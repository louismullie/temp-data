## Question

PALS bradycardia algorithm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the PALS bradycardia algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope, including the definition of bradycardia and the age range covered by PALS. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities, especially how to determine cardiopulmonary compromise. Next, I will examine the sequence of interventions, including oxygenation, ventilation, chest compressions, vascular access, and medications. After that, I need to check dosing details and special scenarios like vagal etiologies and pacing. Finally, I will integrate evidence quality, controversies, and a concise algorithm summary with citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. PALS addresses infants and children up to 18 years, and bradycardia is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute in infants and children, with the critical distinction that management hinges on whether there is cardiopulmonary compromise rather than the absolute heart rate alone [^719b8ddd] [^6bd46ae1]. Hold on, I should verify the neonatal boundary: PALS may be applied to neonates after hospital discharge, but at birth and during the first hospitalization, neonatal resuscitation guidelines (NRP) should be followed, which affects the initial emphasis on ventilation versus compressions in newborns [^a7f8f99b] [^6b875eb4].

> Next, I should review how to assess for cardiopulmonary compromise. I need to ensure I capture the three key markers: acutely altered mental status, signs of shock, or hypotension, because the presence of any of these shifts management toward aggressive support and chest compressions if bradycardia persists despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation [^bcf1693e] [^cb69dd0a]. Wait, let me verify the threshold for compressions: yes, if the heart rate remains less than 60 bpm with compromise despite effective ventilation, start CPR; if there is no compromise, prioritize supportive care and treat reversible causes while observing [^bcf1693e] [^49812570].

> I will now examine the initial priorities when compromise is present. Airway, breathing, and circulation must be addressed simultaneously: secure the airway, provide oxygen, and assist ventilation as needed, while attaching a cardiorespiratory monitor and continuously reassessing pulse and perfusion; this parallel approach avoids delays in critical interventions [^bcf1693e] [^cb69dd0a]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about compressions before ventilation; in children, most bradycardia is secondary to hypoxia or respiratory failure, so optimizing oxygenation and ventilation is foundational before escalating to compressions, which aligns with PALS principles [^6bd46ae1] [^df4dd47c].

> Now, I should confirm the chest compression trigger and technique. If the heart rate remains less than 60 bpm with signs of inadequate perfusion despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation, start high-quality chest compressions at 100–120 per minute, using the two-finger or two-thumb technique in infants and one- or two-hand technique in children, aiming for about one-third the anterior–posterior chest depth, and recheck the pulse about every 2 minutes [^bcf1693e] [^9b2e4371]. Wait, I initially thought to cite a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 15:2 for two rescuers, but I should double-check: PALS uses 30:2 for a single rescuer and 15:2 for two rescuers, and with an advanced airway, continuous compressions with one breath every 2–3 seconds are recommended, so I need to correct that earlier assumption and align with the current standard [^9b2e4371].

> Next, I should review vascular access and medications. I need to ensure rapid establishment of IV or IO access, and if bradycardia with compromise persists, administer epinephrine IV/IO at 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg of the 0.1 mg/mL solution) every 3–5 minutes, with a maximum single dose of 1 mg; this remains the cornerstone pharmacologic therapy in this setting [^bcf1693e] [^270ed431]. Let me consider atropine: it is indicated when increased vagal tone or primary AV block is suspected, dosed at 0.02 mg/kg IV/IO, may repeat once, with a minimum dose of 0.1 mg and a maximum single dose of 0.5 mg; I should confirm that routine atropine is not recommended for all bradycardias, only when vagal etiologies are likely or epinephrine is ineffective [^bcf1693e] [^0e3e30f8].

> But wait, what if the bradycardia is refractory to ventilation, compressions, and medications? I should consider transcutaneous pacing for complete heart block or sinus node dysfunction unresponsive to CPR, recognizing that pediatric evidence is limited and pacing is not helpful for bradycardia due to hypoxic–ischemic myocardial injury or respiratory failure; this is a Class IIb recommendation and should be individualized [^0e3e30f8] [^06940055]. Hold on, I should verify that pacing is not indicated for asystole in children; yes, pacing is ineffective in pediatric asystole and should not delay ongoing CPR and epinephrine administration [^06940055].

> I need to ensure I address reversible causes throughout. Concurrently, I should search for and treat hypoxia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, acidosis, and toxic ingestions, because correcting these drivers can reverse bradycardia and reduce the need for ongoing resuscitation; this is explicitly emphasized in PALS and should be revisited at each reassessment [^6bd46ae1] [^bcf1693e]. Let me reconsider the sequence: even as I escalate compressions and medications, I should continuously re-evaluate airway and ventilation adequacy, since ineffective ventilation is a common, reversible contributor to persistent bradycardia in children [^6bd46ae1].

> For children without cardiopulmonary compromise, I should confirm the management is supportive. Support ABCs, consider oxygen, obtain a 12-lead ECG to identify rhythm and conduction abnormalities, and observe while treating underlying causes; routine epinephrine or atropine is not indicated in stable bradycardia, and observation with targeted therapy is appropriate [^bcf1693e] [^cb69dd0a]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "never give medications in stable bradycardia", but I should qualify that: if a reversible cause like cholinergic toxicity is identified, targeted therapy such as atropine may be appropriate even if the child appears hemodynamically stable, so I need to keep the etiology front and center [^0e3e30f8].

> Next, I should review the evidence quality and controversies. The core recommendations are based on expert consensus and low-certainty evidence; recent observational data have questioned whether early epinephrine during bradycardia with poor perfusion improves outcomes, with some analyses showing no benefit and potential harm, likely confounded by illness severity and the rapid progression to pulselessness in many children [^9457c503] [^7af5ecc0]. Hold on, I should verify guideline stance: ILCOR and AHA have not changed recommendations based on these data, so current practice still supports epinephrine for persistent bradycardia with poor perfusion despite ventilation, while acknowledging the evidence gap and the need for high-quality CPR and rapid correction of reversible causes [^06940055] [^0e3e30f8].

> I should double-check the neonatal and infant nuances. In newborns and young infants, especially in the NICU, NRP emphasizes ventilation-first strategies due to the primacy of respiratory etiologies, whereas PALS allows a compressions-first approach when compromise is present; institutions may adopt hybrid protocols, and there is no definitive evidence that one approach is superior in hospitalized neonates, so local policy and provider training should guide practice [^6d1aab11] [^cc2505df]. Let me verify the compression threshold in neonates: the less-than-60 bpm threshold for compressions originates in NRP and is carried into PALS for infants, reinforcing the need to ensure effective ventilation before compressions in neonatal contexts [^58ff1646].

> Finally, I will synthesize the algorithm succinctly. Assess for compromise; if present, secure airway, oxygenate, and ventilate; if HR remains less than 60 bpm with compromise, start high-quality chest compressions and obtain IV/IO access; give epinephrine every 3–5 minutes and consider atropine if vagal tone or AV block is suspected; consider transcutaneous pacing for refractory bradycardia from conduction disease; and continuously identify and treat reversible causes while reassessing pulse and perfusion every 2 minutes; if the patient becomes pulseless, transition to the pediatric cardiac arrest algorithm [^bcf1693e] [^0e3e30f8]. If there is no compromise, support ABCs, consider oxygen, obtain a 12-lead ECG, treat underlying causes, and observe, reserving medications for specific etiologies or deterioration [^cb69dd0a] [^bcf1693e].

The PALS bradycardia algorithm centers on **rapid recognition of cardiopulmonary compromise** and **immediate correction of reversible causes**, especially hypoxia and hypoventilation [^6bd46ae1]. If the heart rate is **< 60 bpm with poor perfusion** despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation, start chest compressions, obtain IV/IO access, and give epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg every 3–5 minutes (max 1 mg) [^0e3e30f8] [^bcf1693e]. Use atropine 0.02 mg/kg (min 0.1 mg, max 0.5 mg) for suspected vagal tone or AV block, and consider transcutaneous pacing if refractory [^0e3e30f8] [^270ed431]. If there is no compromise, treat underlying causes and observe; **always reassess every 2 minutes** and escalate if deterioration occurs [^cb69dd0a].

---

## Indications for intervention

Intervention is indicated when **bradycardia is accompanied by signs of cardiopulmonary compromise**, including:

- **Acutely altered mental status**: lethargy, confusion, or coma.
- **Signs of shock**: pallor, mottling, cool extremities, delayed capillary refill, or weak pulses.
- **Hypotension**: systolic blood pressure below the 5th percentile for age.

---

## Initial assessment and management

### Airway and breathing

Ensure a **patent airway** and provide **oxygen** to achieve adequate oxygenation (SpO2 ≥ 94%) [^914f9a9b]. Assist ventilation with **bag-mask ventilation** if the patient is not breathing adequately or if respiratory effort is insufficient [^bcf1693e].

---

### Circulation

Attach a **cardiorespiratory monitor** to continuously monitor heart rate and rhythm, and assess perfusion by checking pulse quality, capillary refill, and skin color [^bcf1693e].

---

## Decision point: heart rate and perfusion status

The algorithm branches based on the **heart rate and perfusion status**:

| **Heart rate** | **Perfusion status** | **Action** |
|-|-|-|
| < 60 bpm | Poor perfusion despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation | Initiate chest compressions and proceed to pharmacologic intervention [^0e3e30f8] |
| < 60 bpm | Adequate perfusion | Continue supportive care, monitor, and treat underlying causes [^49812570] |

---

## Chest compressions

Initiate **chest compressions** if the heart rate remains < 60 bpm with poor perfusion despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation:

- **Technique**: Two-finger or two-thumb technique for infants; heel of one hand or two hands for children.
- **Rate**: 100–120 compressions per minute.
- **Depth**: Approximately one-third of the anterior-posterior chest diameter.
- **Compression-to-ventilation ratio**: 30:2 for single rescuer; 15:2 for two rescuers [^9b2e4371].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

### Epinephrine

Epinephrine is the **first-line medication** for bradycardia with poor perfusion:

- **Dose**: 0.01 mg/kg IV/IO (0.1 mL/kg of 1:10,000 solution) every 3–5 minutes.
- **Maximum dose**: 1 mg per dose.
- **Route**: IV or IO access should be established as soon as possible [^bcf1693e].

---

### Atropine

Atropine is indicated for **bradycardia due to increased vagal tone or primary AV block**:

- **Dose**: 0.02 mg/kg IV/IO (minimum dose 0.1 mg; maximum single dose 0.5 mg).
- **May repeat once** if needed [^bcf1693e].

---

### Transcutaneous pacing

Consider **transcutaneous pacing** for refractory bradycardia due to complete heart block or sinus node dysfunction unresponsive to CPR and medications [^0e3e30f8].

---

## Identification and treatment of reversible causes

Throughout resuscitation, **identify and treat reversible causes** using the **H's and T's** mnemonic:

| **H's** | **T's** |
|-|-|
| Hypoxia | Toxins |
| Hypovolemia | Tamponade (cardiac) |
| Hypoglycemia | Tension pneumothorax |
| Hyperkalemia | Thrombosis (coronary or pulmonary) |
| Hypothermia | Trauma |

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Continuously monitor the **heart rate, rhythm, and perfusion**, and reassess every 2 minutes. Adjust interventions based on patient response and clinical status [^bcf1693e].

---

## Special considerations

- **Neonates and infants**: Neonatal resuscitation guidelines (NRP) should be followed for newborns, emphasizing ventilation-first strategies [^6b875eb4] [^6d1aab11].
- **Congenital heart disease**: Modifications to the standard algorithm may be necessary based on underlying cardiac anatomy and physiology [^4988545f].
- **Post-cardiac arrest care**: Structured post-arrest care, including targeted temperature management and hemodynamic optimization, is essential for improved outcomes [^34bb33ad].

---

## Key principles

- **Oxygenation and ventilation**: Adequate oxygenation and ventilation are critical first steps in managing pediatric bradycardia [^6bd46ae1].
- **Early intervention**: Prompt recognition and intervention significantly improve outcomes [^notfound].
- **Teamwork**: Effective communication and coordination among team members are essential for successful resuscitation [^notfound].

---

The PALS bradycardia algorithm emphasizes **rapid recognition of compromise**, correction of reversible causes, and escalation to compressions, epinephrine, atropine, and pacing as needed, with continuous reassessment to guide care.

Management of bradycardia — initial evaluation and reversible causes: Bradycardia with a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute in infants and children should prompt an evaluation for cardiopulmonary compromise, including acutely altered mental status, hypotension or other signs of shock, and correctable factors that contribute to bradycardia include hypoxia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, acidosis, and toxic ingestions.

Pediatric bradycardia — initial assessment and chest compression threshold is outlined as follows: Sinus bradycardia with adequate perfusion typically does not require immediate intervention beyond supportive care and treatment of reversible causes, and when bradycardia is accompanied by inadequate perfusion, a first step is to ensure that oxygenation and ventilation are adequate. For infants and children with bradycardia with inadequate perfusion, assurance of adequate oxygenation and ventilation must be the initial intervention, and when the heart rate is 60 beats per minute or less, chest compressions should be started; for infants and children with bradycardia with inadequate perfusion and a heart rate of 60 beats per minute or less despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation, chest compressions should be initiated.

Optimizing ventilation strategies in infant resuscitation: Point of convergence

Hypoxia, secondary to respiratory failure, leading to bradycardia, is the most common precipitating cause of IHCA in infants, which both NRP and PALS acknowledge in their guidelines. The focus of the initial steps of resuscitation should be to optimize oxygenation and ventilation. NRP recommends rescue breathing at 40–60 per minute before starting CC and 30 breaths per minute during coordinated CC. This recommendation is based on the observational data of the average respiratory rates among infants. PALS recommends rescue breathing at a rate of 20–30 per minute before and during CC. This recent recommendation change was provided for the ease of training with limited evidence. PALS has acknowledged the critical knowledge gap due to insufficient pediatric data regarding the optimal ventilation rate during CPR in patients with or without an advanced airway and whether the ventilation rate is age-dependent. A systematic review of observational studies found that the respiratory rates declined from a median of 44 per minute at birth to 26 per minute at the end of 2 years, which continued to decline until early adolescence. Given the differences in respiratory rates and the algorithm, is it reasonable to resuscitate all infants per NRP during an IHCA, especially in the NICU?

Pediatric bradycardia with a pulse — algorithm-based management begins by assessing for cardiopulmonary compromise defined by "Acutely altered mental status", "Signs of shock", or "Hypotension"; if present, provide assessment and support to "Maintain patent airway and provide oxygen", "Assist breathing with positive-pressure ventilation as necessary", "Attach cardiorespiratory monitor", and "Monitor pulse", then determine if "Bradycardia persists with cardiopulmonary compromise?" and, if yes, "Start CPR if HR < 60", obtain "IV/IO access", give "Epinephrine" and consider "Atropine for increased vagal tone or primary AV block", plus "Identify and treat underlying causes" and "Consider transthoracic/transvenous pacing", with "Check pulse every 2 minutes" and, if no pulse, "Go to Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Algorithm"; if there is no cardiopulmonary compromise, "Identify and treat underlying causes – Support ABCs – Consider oxygen – Consider 12-lead ECG – Observe", and dosing details specify "Epinephrine IV/IO dose: 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mg/mL concentration. Maximum dose 1 mg)" and "Atropine IV/IO dose: 0.02 mg/kg. May repeat once. Minimum dose 0.1 mg and maximum single dose 0.5 mg".

Conclusion

While resuscitating a neonate in the NICU, there is currently no definitive evidence to support the superiority of either the NRP or PALS protocol. Both protocols provide valuable frameworks for managing emergencies, yet studies comparing their outcomes and effectiveness in this specific setting remain limited. While NRP is designed specifically for neonatal resuscitation, and PALS offers a more generalized approach to pediatric cardiac care, there is a lack of consensus regarding which protocol is more beneficial in the NICU. Following AHA recommendations, institutions should consider developing policies tailored to meet their respective populations' unique patient care needs.

NRP guidelines could be enhanced by incorporating specific therapies for cardiac arrhythmias and recommendations for infants with congenital cardiac anomalies or primary cardiac etiologies of cardiac arrest, which are currently under development. This would allow providers using NRP to better refine their resuscitation strategies for less common clinical scenarios.

Additionally, PALS can help highlight key differences in infant resuscitation protocols, particularly by updating the cardiac arrest algorithm to address resuscitation strategies for infants with severe bradycardia who still have a pulse. Further research is needed to evaluate the outcomes associated with each protocol in neonatal care and to guide evidence-based decisions on the most appropriate training and implementation for NICU providers.

Identification of pulse – Salient points of divergence

NRP does not distinguish the resuscitation of infants with severe bradycardia (HR < 60 bpm), asystole, and pulseless electrical activity (PEA). NRP has a common approach toward different etiologies of cardiac arrest. PALS recommendations for severe bradycardia with a pulse are distinct from asystole/PEA. The choice of these approaches depends on identifying the brachial pulse in the infants. The identification of pulses in severe bradycardia determines whether the initial resuscitative efforts are being targeted toward optimizing oxygenation and ventilation versus analyzing the rhythm with an automated external defibrillator (AED) and starting high-quality CPR. NRP recommends epinephrine, preferably intravascular if the HR is < 60 bpm despite 1 min of coordinated effective PPV + CC. In a similar situation, pediatric guidelines recommend epinephrine and atropine.

### Part 8: pediatric advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^0e3e30f8]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Management of bradycardia — treatment recommendations (classes of recommendation and level of evidence): For bradycardia with cardiopulmonary compromise due to increased vagal tone or atrioventricular conduction block and not due to factors such as hypoxia, atropine is recommended (1 C-LD). In infants and children with heart rate < 60 beats/min and cardiopulmonary compromise despite effective ventilation with oxygen, start CPR (1 C-EO). If bradycardia with cardiopulmonary compromise persists after correction of other factors (eg, hypoxia), give epinephrine IV/IO (1 C-EO). Emergency transcutaneous pacing may be considered for infants and children with bradycardia and cardiopulmonary compromise due to complete heart block or sinus node dysfunction unresponsive to CPR (2b C-EO).

### Resuscitation after birth and beyond in the neonatal intensive care unit: NRP or PALS? [^051028da]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Scenario 3: A preterm neonate in the NICU, a former 29-weeker, now corrected to 40 weeks postmenstrual age, is currently on a 2 L nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen of 25%. She has a severe apnea/bradycardia/desaturation episode about 2 hours after a feed. A travel nurse caring for this infant starts resuscitation as per the PALS algorithm.

For a preterm infant experiencing a severe apneic episode, bradycardia, and desaturation, the first-line management typically includes tactile stimulation, supplemental oxygen, and airway clearance, followed by positive pressure ventilation if necessary. This approach is effective in resolving mild to moderate apneic events. If the infant remains unresponsive to these measures, resuscitation efforts are escalated, often involving positive pressure ventilation or even intubation, depending on the severity of the situation.

However, airway management and ventilation are particularly important in neonates, especially preterm infants. As this infant is not intubated, focus should be on appropriate ventilation to restore the heart rate and improve oxygenation. NRP provides clear guidance in this area, emphasizing proper airway management and ventilation to correct bradycardia and desaturation, which are common in preterm infants experiencing apnea of prematurity or related respiratory complications.

In this scenario, the travel nurse initiated PALS guidelines. While the PALS algorithm is often used for resuscitation in older infants and children, its application in this scenario could still be justified, particularly in an environment where a provider not trained in NRP was at the bedside. However, NRP would be more appropriate for this infant to address the underlying causes of apnea and bradycardia.

Since the infant is on supplemental oxygen and experiencing an apnea/bradycardia/desaturation event, the initial steps, such as ensuring airway patency and applying positive pressure ventilation, would fall within the scope of NRP guidelines. While the PALS algorithm may still provide a framework for resuscitation, a provider trained in PALS may start compressions before optimizing ventilation.

Initial management of bradycardia — adult patients with acute symptomatic bradycardia receive the following recommendations with class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE): COR 1, LOE C-EO: "In adult patients presenting with acute symptomatic bradycardia, evaluation and treatment of reversible causes are recommended". COR 2a, LOE B-NR: "In adult patients with acute bradycardia associated with hemodynamic compromise, administration of atropine is reasonable to increase heart rate". COR 2a, LOE C-LD: "In adult patients with persistent hemodynamically unstable bradycardia refractory to medical therapy, temporary transvenous pacing is reasonable to increase heart rate and improve symptoms". COR 2b, LOE C-LD: "If bradycardia is unresponsive to atropine, IV chronotropic agents with catecholaminergic effects (eg, epinephrine, dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing may be effective while the adult patient is prepared for emergent transvenous temporary pacing if required". COR 2b, LOE C-EO: "Immediate pacing should be considered in unstable adult patients with high-degree AV block when IV/ IO access is not available".

RE: Implementation of delayed cord clamping into neonatal algorithms Thank you. We do appreciate these insightful comments. They are correct in observing that our recommendations show a preference for deferring cord clamping in babies who do not require resuscitation and that the decision-making process for clamping and associated resuscitation steps are not indicated on the algorithm. The decision not to place new steps or branches in the algorithm in 2020 was deliberate: the algorithm views neonatal resuscitation from a high level and remains a condensed version of practice that is detailed in the text. The algorithm also does not encourage drying and stimulation of preterm infants that would benefit for 30–60 seconds of delayed cord clamping. The 2020 guidelines considered DCC a reasonable option for any gestational age infant that does not require resuscitation at birth.

It would be extremely helpful for providers if the indications for cord clamping to be included in the algorithm's last version. Specifically, based on recommendations, the cord's clamping might be postponed until the first stabilization of warming and drying the infant. Implementation of delayed cord clamping into neonatal algorithms Recently been updated, neonatal resuscitation guidelines continue to recommend delayed cord clamping in preterm newborns not requiring resuscitation at birth. Since the publication of the last guidelines the level of evidence has strengthened from limited data on efficacy and safety to moderate quality of evidence from randomized trials and their meta-analysis. Preterm infants receiving DCC were less likely to receive red blood cell transfusion and medications for hypotension, and most important DCC was associated with improved survival.

While the guidelines advocate for DCC in infants who do not require resuscitation, this is not found in the Neonatal Resuscitation Algorithm, which is where the recommendations are operationalized by delivery room staff. The first observation pertains to the algorithm questions that should anticipate resuscitation needs. It is our opinion that "term gestation" should no longer have been present in the 2020 algorithm because it may promote an excessive conservative attitude, leading to clamp immediately the umbilical cord of any preterm newborns that could safely benefit from placental transfusion during routine care while staying with the mother. The algorithm also does not encourage drying and stimulation of preterm infants that would benefit for 30–60 seconds of delayed cord clamping.

### Performance of a consensus scoring algorithm for assessing pediatric advanced life support competency using a computer screen-based simulator [^80974456]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a computer screen-based simulator that may be used as a pediatric advanced life support (PALS) cognitive skill assessment tool and to pilot test a consensus-based scoring system for the simulator.

Design

Development of an evaluation tool, followed by prospective, observational study of tool performance.

Setting

Tertiary care pediatric hospital.

Subjects

A total of 100 PALS providers from multiple disciplines.

Interventions

Using a consensus process with a group of six experts in pediatric emergency and critical care medicine, we developed scoring algorithms to measure performance on four interactive PALS scenarios (supraventricular tachycardia, pulseless electrical activity, ventricular fibrillation, and bradycardia). PALS providers (n = 100) completed the scenarios on the simulator and the computer assessed their performance using the scoring algorithm.

Measurements and Main Results

Case management scoring audits agreed 100% with computer scoring during pilot testing, indicating excellent reliability. The mean time to complete all four cases was 13.8 mins. Performance scores were highest for supraventricular tachycardia management and lowest for pulseless electrical activity management. Survival was significantly more common than death in the supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation scenarios, whereas death was more common in the pulseless electrical activity scenario (p < .004). Physician status predicted a higher aggregate score as well as higher scores in the supraventricular tachycardia (p < .001), pulseless electrical activity (p = .041), and bradycardia (p = .006) scenarios. Participants who completed the PALS course on the same day as their assessment scored higher on the supraventricular tachycardia scenario (p = .041).

Conclusions

Personal computer-based simulation can be used to evaluate performance against consensus criteria in a large number of PALS providers. This technology could supplement traditional curricula by facilitating frequent knowledge assessments as part of a PALS competency maintenance regimen.

### Considerations on the use of neonatal and pediatric resuscitation guidelines for hospitalized neonates and infants: on behalf of the American Heart Association emergency cardiovascular care committee and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^cb69dd0a]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric bradycardia with a pulse algorithm — Patients with bradycardia are evaluated for "Cardiopulmonary compromise?" (acutely altered mental status, signs of shock, hypotension). If compromise is present, provide assessment and support to maintain a patent airway, assist breathing with positive pressure ventilation and oxygen as necessary, and use a cardiac monitor to identify rhythm while monitoring pulse, BP, and oximetry; if not present, support ABCs, consider oxygen, observe, obtain a 12-Lead ECG, and identify and treat underlying causes. Start CPR if HR < 60/min despite oxygenation and ventilation. If bradycardia persists, continue CPR if HR < 60 beats per min, obtain IV/IO access, give epinephrine, give atropine for increased vagal tone or primary AV block, consider transthoracic/transvenous pacing, and identify and treat underlying causes. Check pulse every 2 minutes; if "Pulse present?" is answered no, go to Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Algorithm. Possible causes listed are hypothermia, hypoxia, and medications.

### Part 8: pediatric advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^4b24a07c]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

The American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics provide these pediatric advanced life support guidelines focusing on resuscitation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care. These guidelines are intended to be a resource for health care professionals to identify and treat infants and children up to 18 years of age (excluding newborn infants) in the prearrest, intra-arrest, and post-cardiac arrest states as well as select other emergency care situations. These guidelines apply to infants and children in various settings, including the community, prehospital environments, and hospital environments. Topics presented include ventilation and advanced airway strategies during cardiopulmonary resuscitation; drug administration and weight-based dosing of medications during cardiopulmonary resuscitation; energy doses for defibrillation; measuring cardiopulmonary resuscitation physiology and quality; extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation; post-cardiac arrest care related to management of core temperature, blood pressure, oxygenation/ventilation, neurologic monitoring, and seizures; neurological prognostication post-cardiac arrest; post-cardiac arrest survivorship; family presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation; evaluation of sudden unexplained cardiac arrest; management of shock types; airway/intubation management; arrhythmia management including bradycardia and tachycardia (narrow and wide complex); treatment of myocarditis/cardiomyopathies; resuscitation of patients with single ventricle congenital heart disease; management of pulmonary hypertension; and management of traumatic cardiac arrest. Lastly, important gaps in resuscitation science knowledge are identified, aiming to encourage further scientific inquiry and provide additional evidence for future pediatric advanced life support guidelines.

### Evaluating pediatric advanced life support in emergency medical services with a performance and safety scoring tool [^a2bd9b95]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (P-OHCA) are infrequent, have low survival rates, and often have poor neurologic outcomes. Recent evidence indicates that high-performance emergency medical service (EMS) care can improve outcomes.

Objectives

To evaluate Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guideline performance in the out of hospital setting and introduce an easy-to-use tool that scores guideline compliance and patient safety.

Methods

We observed EMS teams responding to standardized pediatric resuscitation simulations. Teams were dispatched to a mock assisted living home for a choking 6-year-old with a complex medical history. The child manikin was presented as unconscious and apneic, with bradycardic pulse. Teams were expected to monitor vitals; initiate airway management and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); and establish vascular access and administer epinephrine based on PALS guidelines. We developed a tool to score the quality of care for critical tasks and had a clinical expert evaluate technical performance using blinded video review.

Results

We observed 34 EMS teams providing care in P-OHCA simulations. Teams were proficient at assessing vitals, using correct-sized equipment, intubation, and confirmation of tube placement. Teams were delayed in initiating positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and chest compressions. Many teams (53%) deviated from guidelines in chest compressions with 17 (50%) performing continuous compressions before establishing an advanced airway and one (3%) not performing compressions. Similarly, 20 (59%) teams deviated from medication guidelines with 12 (35%) failing to administer epinephrine, six (18%) underdosing, and two (6%) overdosing by more than 20%.

Conclusion

EMS teams were successful in selecting the appropriate equipment but delayed initiating ventilations in a child with severe bradycardia. We also noted frequent use of continuous chest CC rather than the AHA recommended 15:2 ratio. We developed a scoring tool with time-based criteria that can be used to assess guideline compliance, individual performance, and/or educational effectiveness.

Pediatric fluid resuscitation and management of septic shock — Health care professionals should reassess infants and children after every fluid bolus to assess for fluid responsiveness and signs of volume overload. Either isotonic crystalloids or colloids can be effective as the initial fluid choice for resuscitation in infants and children. Either balanced or unbalanced solutions can be effective as the fluid choice for resuscitation in infants and children. In infants and children with septic shock, it is reasonable to administer fluid in 10 mL/kg or 20 mL/kg aliquots with frequent reassessment. In infants and children with fluid-refractory septic shock, it is reasonable to use either epinephrine or norepinephrine as an initial vasoactive infusion. For infants and children with cardiac arrest and sepsis, it is reasonable to apply the standard PALS algorithm compared with any unique approach for sepsis-associated cardiac arrest. For infants and children with septic shock unresponsive to fluids and requiring vasoactive support, it may be reasonable to consider stress-dose corticosteroids. In infants and children with fluid-refractory septic shock, if epinephrine or norepinephrine are unavailable, dopamine may be considered.

### A survey of anesthesiologists' knowledge of American Heart Association pediatric advanced life support resuscitation guidelines [^92793c1c]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

Aim Of Study

Determine anesthesiologists' knowledge of the 2005 American Heart Association (AHA) Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) recommendations.

Methods

After obtaining institutional review board approval, a survey was sent in February 2007 to members of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia via a web-based survey tool, and re-sent to nonresponders five times over the following 7 months.

Results

Overall response rate was 51% (389/768 members). Eighty-five percent of respondents had pediatric anesthesia fellowships, 71% provided anesthesia primarily to children, 71% had been in practice > 10 years, 29% had PALS or APLS training during the previous year, and 37% had a patient requiring chest compressions in the previous year. Overall, 89% of respondents knew the correct initial dose of epinephrine (adrenaline) for asystole, 44% knew subsequent management for asystole if initial epinephrine dose was ineffective, 49% knew defibrillation sequence to treat pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), and 73% knew the medication sequence to treat pulseless VT. Only those respondents who reported to be in practice for > 10 years scored significantly (p < 0.0001) better on all resuscitation treatment questions. Respondents who had PALS or APLS training in the previous year or previous 2 years scored significantly better on the defibrillation sequence for pulseless VT (p = 0.001 and p = 0.045, respectively), and the medication sequence for pulseless VT (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.011, respectively) when compared with those who had no previous training.

Conclusion

Deficiencies exist in the knowledge of current AHA PALS guidelines among anesthesiologists. Formal resuscitation training programs should be considered in ongoing continuing medical education.

### Resuscitation after birth and beyond in the neonatal intensive care unit: NRP or PALS? [^f0d58441]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Birth asphyxia is the most common cause necessitating cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at birth. The uniqueness of newborn resuscitation is due to the physiological cardiopulmonary transition occurring at birth. The lungs, which are fluid-filled, take over as an organ of gas exchange from the placenta while transitioning from fetal to neonatal life. Any event that disrupts this process can lead to fetal hypoxemia and hypercarbia, resulting in acidosis. This could subsequently impair perfusion and, if not addressed by appropriate resuscitative efforts, lead to bradycardia and circulatory failure. In neonates, the focus is primarily on the airway, breathing followed by circulation, in contrast to resuscitation in cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to primary heart disease, where circulation is emphasized. In infants > 28 d and patients until 18 y age, the etiology for resuscitation may similarly differ. The resuscitation outside the newborn period focuses on circulation, airway, and breathing to maintain circulation until specific treatments like defibrillation restore the heart's function.

Newborns born outside the hospital who present to the emergency room (ER) or neonates (< 28 days old) admitted to a tertiary intensive care unit and require resuscitation either follow a Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) or Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS). The optimization of CPR approaches for hospitalized neonates and infants is a critical concern due to the high incidence of cardiopulmonary instability and arrest in this population. Notably, CPR with chest compressions (CC) is required in 0.25% to 1% of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, 1.4% of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions, and 3.1% of pediatric cardiac ICU (PCICU) admissions, predominantly affecting patients under one year of age. The incidence of CPR in the NICU is significantly higher than that at birth, where CPR is required in only 0.06% to 0.12% of cases. Resuscitation practices differ based on the patient's age, arrest physiology, and care location, with distinct neonatal and pediatric resuscitation guidelines.

Adult advanced life support — bradycardia definition and clinical assessment states that bradycardia has historically been defined as a ventricular heart rate of less than 60/min, and the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline adopted a lower threshold of less than 50/min. Bradycardia can be a normal finding in healthy adults, athletes, or during sleep, and its clinical manifestation ranges from stable (asymptomatic) through symptomatic to unstable with signs of poor perfusion. Patients with symptomatic bradycardia can present with dizziness or light‑headedness, acute altered mental status, ischemic chest discomfort, acute heart failure, hypotension, or syncope due to decreased cardiac output and tissue hypoperfusion. Clinicians must evaluate whether bradycardia is a manifestation of another underlying disease process (eg, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, electrolyte disturbance, acidosis, hypothermia) or the primary driver of the presentation. Immediate treatment of symptomatic bradycardia is focused on both supporting perfusion and identifying and reversing the underlying cause(s).

### Pediatric advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^06940055]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric bradycardia — drug therapy and transcutaneous pacing evidence updates report that a 2022 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) review identified three relevant observational retrospective studies; one analysis found an association between epinephrine use and a worse prognosis, while another used a different population and reported no differences in epinephrine use between patients with bradycardia compared with patients with other rhythms; the ILCOR Pediatric Task Force concluded that the new evidence does not impact current recommendations and that ILCOR 2010 treatment recommendations for pharmacotherapy of bradycardia remain unchanged. For transcutaneous pacing, ILCOR reported no pediatric-specific literature and that recommendations remain unchanged since a 2000 ILCOR and American Heart Association review noting that in select cases of bradycardia caused by complete heart block or abnormal function of the sinus node, emergency transthoracic pacing may be lifesaving, whereas pacing is not helpful in children with bradycardia secondary to a post-arrest hypoxic/ ischemic myocardial insult or respiratory failure and was not shown to be effective in the treatment of asystole in children; the Red Cross guidelines are informed by the ILCOR CoSTR, and with the latest evidence updates, the current guidelines are reaffirmed.

### Resuscitation education for NICU providers: current practice and recommendations for NRP and PALS in the NICU [^cc2505df]. Seminars in Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) is the most used resuscitation algorithm for infants requiring resuscitation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The population of infants cared for in the NICU is varied and complex with resuscitation needs that may extend beyond the NRP algorithm. To provide resuscitation care that addresses these needs, institutions may choose to incorporate algorithms from the Pediatric Advanced Life Support or a "hybrid" approach that includes NRP. Limited evidence exists to support one algorithm or approach over another. In this article, we identify potential gaps in the application of using NRP or PALS in the NICU population, present select patient decompensations and discuss the resuscitation management approach using the NRP or PALS algorithms. Challenges associated with NICU resuscitation education will be explored as well as approaches to overcome some of the identified resuscitation education obstacles.

### Pediatric advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^270ed431]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric bradycardia — drug therapy and pacing recommendations state that epinephrine is the cornerstone of drug therapy when bradycardia with inadequate perfusion is present despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation, while transcutaneous or transvenous pacing may be needed for some types of bradycardias and/or if there is no response to drug therapy. For infants and children with bradycardia with inadequate perfusion that is unresponsive to oxygenation and ventilation, drug therapy may begin with epinephrine, and epinephrine may be used for infants and children with bradycardia and poor perfusion that is unresponsive to ventilation and oxygenation. For infants and children with bradycardia with inadequate perfusion in the setting of increased vagal tone or atrioventricular (AV) block, or if there is no response to epinephrine, atropine may be considered; it is reasonable to administer atropine for bradycardia caused by increased vagal tone or cholinergic drug toxicity, and there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of atropine for pediatric cardiac arrest. Transcutaneous pacing may be considered for some types of bradycardias, such as in the setting of complete AV block and/or if there is no response to drug therapy.

Pediatric Advanced Life Support — Atropine use for emergency intubation — It may be reasonable to use atropine as a premedication to prevent bradycardia in infants and children during emergency intubation (COR 2b, LOE C-LD), and when atropine is used as a premedication for emergency intubation of infants and children, a dose of 0.02 mg/kg with no minimum dose may be considered (COR 2b, LOE C-LD). Supporting evidence notes prospective observational studies in patients < 8 years of age showing associations between atropine pretreatment and decreased ICU mortality after propensity score adjustment and significant acceleration in heart rate without provoking arrhythmias with a decrease in bradycardia, whereas 4 retrospective studies did not demonstrate an association between atropine use and occurrence of bradycardia during the peri-intubation period. Historical dosing data indicate a minimum dose of atropine (0.1 mg) was recommended based on a 1971 series of 79 patients, including 5 aged 6 weeks to 3 years, in which doses ranging from 0.0018 to 0.0036 mg/kg produced a small and statistically insignificant decrease in heart rate; additionally, in a 2015 prospective observational study of 60 infants less than 15 kg who all received < 0.1 mg atropine before intubation, no patient experienced paradoxical bradycardia or arrhythmias.

section of the Clinical Performance Tool, a scoring system with supportive validity evidence designed on PALS algorithms. 20, 21 Usability of the app was evaluated by team leaders who used the app through a questionnaire that included open-ended questions and a score with published supportive. Agreement between reviewers for error scores was calculated on primary outcome measures through the CCC and its 95% CI calculated with the bootstrap method considering 2000 resamplings. 31 All the analyses were performed considering the intention-to-treat principle; a per-protocol analysis was also performed for the primary outcome. The statistical analysis was performed with SAS statistical software version 9. 4 for Windows.

The analysis of the time to perform critical resuscitation actions showed that teams that used the PediAppRREST app took significantly shorter times in calling for help compared with the PALS group and the null control group. The clinical performance of the teams measured by the Clinical Performance Tool score, was significantly higher in the PediAppRREST group than in the PALS group, and null control group group. This divergence could be explained by differences in the cognitive supports tested, study designs, outcome measures, and scenarios.

In this randomized clinical trial, teams using the PediAppRREST app had fewer deviations from international guidelines and a better clinical team performance during the management of simulated pediatric cardiac arrest. Further studies are necessary to understand the effectiveness of this aid in multidisciplinary team compositions reflecting the latest PALS recommendations. Before considering implementation in clinical practice, systematic simulation training with the app and further studies should be performed.

### Early bolus epinephrine administration during pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation for bradycardia with poor perfusion: an ICU-resuscitation study [^60d2bfb8]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort of pediatric IHCA with an initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion, we did not identify an association between early bolus epinephrine and outcomes when controlling for illness severity, which differs from a previous investigation showing an association between epinephrine and worse outcomes in these patients. Many children receiving CPR for bradycardia with poor perfusion progress to pulselessness and do so quickly, with forty-six percent of children becoming pulseless within 2 min of the start of CPR. These data support additional studies to further support or refute current guideline recommendations for the administration of epinephrine during CPR in this population.

### Resuscitation after birth and beyond in the neonatal intensive care unit: NRP or PALS? [^67c73d58]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for infant (age < 12 months) resuscitation

NRP and PALS are the two guidelines recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) that are widely used in the resuscitation of infants. A national survey analyzed the resuscitation practices of the US healthcare providers (n = 152) in three different settings, including 118 NICUs, 19 pediatric intensive care units (PICUs), and 15 cardiac intensive care units (CICUs). The survey results showed that neonatal providers preferred neonatal guidelines in infants < 28 days and pediatric guidelines in infants beyond 28 days with a primary cardiac etiology for the arrest. In contrast, the providers in the PICU and CICU preferred pediatric guidelines for any infant after birth, irrespective of the age or etiology of the cardiac arrest. The provider's preference determined the application of either NRP or PALS based on similar foundational principles of resuscitation.

The fundamental differences between NRP vs. PALS were discussed in a recent report published collaboratively on behalf of the AHA Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The emphasis is on adequate ventilation in the NRP guidelines and CC in the PALS guidelines (Table 1). The NRP recommends 3 CC to 1 breath with a pause for the breaths, including in the presence of an advanced airway. There are 120 events in a minute (90 CC and 30 breaths). The PALS guidelines recommends for one rescuer include 30 CC to 2 breaths, or 15 CC to 2 breaths for two-rescuer resuscitations with no advanced airway. Two rescuers with an advanced airway include continuous CC with one breath every 2–3 seconds, which adds up to 100–120 CC to 20–30 breaths in a minute. Epinephrine is the only medication recommended in NRP with blood transfusion and a normal saline bolus during special circumstances. PALS recommends multiple medications, cardioversion, and defibrillation based on the various rhythm abnormalities through algorithms relatively more complex than NRP.

Newborns requiring resuscitation present a unique challenge compared to pediatric and adult patients due to the physiological differences at birth. This paper explores the distinction between the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) and Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), with a focus on the optimal approaches for resuscitation in newborns. Through clinical studies and case scenario analysis, the paper underscores the importance of ventilation, tailored algorithms, and collaborative resuscitation efforts in NICU settings, focusing on respiratory versus cardiac causes. It evaluates the necessity of NRP over PALS, the resuscitation techniques, and the impact of combining the two protocols. A perspective on the challenges and costs of implementing such protocols has also been discussed.

### Early bolus epinephrine administration during pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation for bradycardia with poor perfusion: an ICU-resuscitation study [^452c3027]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

To increase our understanding of children receiving CPR who have an initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion, we analyzed the ICU-RESUS BP waveforms to present a granular summary of rhythm status and pulselessness during the first 10 min of CPR. Similar to earlier studies reliant on clinician reporting of subsequent cardiac arrest rhythms, we confirmed that the majority of children with an initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion deteriorate to pulselessness. Additionally, this happens quickly, often by the time of a guideline-recommended first pulse check (54% of those with invasive BP monitoring experienced pulselessness within 3 min of starting CPR). Notably, nearly one-third of the patients who received any bolus doses of epinephrine experienced pulselessness before or during the minute in which they first received epinephrine. This suggests that many patients in previous work may have already been pulseless at the time of epinephrine administration, which may have biased toward identifying worse outcomes.

Task Force Insights

The body of available evidence does not justify an ILCOR SysRev at this time because no studies assessed whether feedback devices result in improvements in resuscitation practice or outcomes in human infants. Further research is justified, including assessing whether improvements measured in simulation settings result in improvement in clinical performance or outcomes and to assess the role of capnography and other types of clinical measurements in improving outcomes in infants who receive chest compressions.

Treatment Recommendations

The 2015 treatment recommendation remains unchanged.

In newborn infants with asystole or bradycardia, we suggest against the routine reliance on any single feedback device such as ETCO 2 monitors or pulse oximeters for detection of ROSC until more evidence becomes available (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).

Chest compressions in infant CPR – Double-Edged Sword?

NRP has recommended electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring of the heart rate in infants undergoing PPV at birth since 2015. A single-center study in the US compared the impact of this practice-changing recommendation using a prospective and a retrospective cohort. The authors found that the use of ECG in the delivery room caused a 3.6-fold increase in the rate of CC. A retrospective observational study of neonatal CPR at birth (n = 1153) using the AHA Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry found that CC were started in the first minute of life in 76% of CPR events, and 79% of infants received CC without endotracheal intubation. A similar registry-based retrospective study analyzed the prevalence and predictors of survival of IHCA in 5592 pediatric patients (age > 30 days of life - < 18 years of age) who progressed from bradycardia to pulselessness. The study reported that 50% of the cohort had bradycardia with poor perfusion at the start of CC, with approximately 30% of those patients progressing to pulselessness despite CPR. Progression to pulselessness despite CPR resulted in decreased survival compared to pulseless cardiac arrest, with an inverse relationship to the time to pulselessness. The reasons for the progression and poor survival of patients with bradycardia with pulse to pulselessness despite CPR are unknown.

CC in NRP and PALS differ primarily due to the age of the patient. In NRP, CC for newborns is typically performed using the 2-thumb technique or encircling hands for a depth of approximately one-third of the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest. The compression-to-ventilation ratio is usually 3:1, aiming to give 90 compressions and 30 ventilations per minute, accounting for 120 events per minute. In PALS, CC for children is performed with either a one- or two-hand technique, depending on size, and for infants, the two-finger or two-thumb technique is used. The compression depth for infants is about 1.5 inches (4 cm), and for children, it is about 2 inches (5 cm), with a rate of 100–120 compressions per minute with an advanced airway in place. The compression-to-ventilation ratio is 30:2 for single rescuers and 15:2 for two rescuers.

For infants and newborns, initiate chest compressions for heart rate less than 60 BPM and signs of poor perfusion, manage airway and assist ventilations with minimally interrupted compressions using a compression-to-ventilation ratio 15:2 (30:2 if single clinician is present), administer oxygen with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation, initiate monitoring and perform 12-lead EKG, establish IV access, and check blood glucose per the Hypoglycemia Guideline. If bradycardia and symptoms or hemodynamic instability continue, epinephrine by push dose may be given by preparing 10 mcg/mL and administering 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg) with maximum single dose 10 mcg (1 mL) q 3–5 minutes titrated to MAP greater than 65 mmHg; also consider atropine 0.01–0.02 mg/kg IV with minimum dose of 0.1 mg to maximum initial dose of 0.5 mg (maximum total dose of 3 mg). Transcutaneous pacing: If pacing is performed, consider sedation or pain control. Epinephrine may be used for bradycardia and poor perfusion unresponsive to ventilation and oxygenation, and it is reasonable to administer atropine for bradycardia caused by increased vagal tone or cholinergic drug toxicity.

### Early bolus epinephrine administration during pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation for bradycardia with poor perfusion: an ICU-resuscitation study [^79352326]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

The ICU-Resuscitation Project (ICU-RESUS) trial, a multicenter cluster randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of physiology-focused CPR training on patient outcomes, collected Utstein-style data and physiologic waveforms for all enrolled patients. Our objective was to leverage this prospectively collected data to better understand pediatric cardiac arrests with an initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion. We first aimed to investigate the association between early epinephrine and outcomes in children receiving CPR for bradycardia with poor perfusion in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. In the subset of patients with intra-arrest physiologic waveform data available, we aimed to also evaluate the incidence and time course of the development of pulselessness and determine the association between subsequent pulselessness and outcomes. We hypothesized that early epinephrine administration during CPR would be associated with higher rates of survival to hospital discharge with a favorable neurologic outcome when controlling for illness severity. Additionally, we hypothesized that most children receiving at least 2 min of CPR for an initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion would deteriorate to pulseless cardiac arrest.

Atropine use and endpoints of atropinization — In adults and children with life-threatening organophosphate or carbamate poisoning including cardiac arrest, bradycardia, hypotension, bronchorrhea, or bronchospasm, early atropine improved survival in 1 clinical trial; larger doses than for typical bradycardia are often required, the initial dose is doubled every 5 minutes until atropinization is achieved (clear chest on auscultation; heart rate > 80/min; systolic blood pressure > 80 mm Hg), and maintenance can be achieved by an atropine infusion.

Neonatal advanced life support — sustained inflation and inspiratory pressure in newborn resuscitation: Inflation of longer than 15 seconds duration and using sustained inflation with inspiratory pressure greater than 20 mmHg similarly found no significant benefit or harm, while a subgroup with first sustained inflation with inspiratory pressure 20 mmHg or more could not exclude benefit or harm. A weak recommendation by ILCOR for preterm newborn infants who receive positive pressure ventilation due to bradycardia or ineffective respirations at birth suggests against the routine use of initial sustained inflation(s) greater than 5 seconds. Due to very low confidence in the estimates of effect, it was not possible to recommend any specific duration for initial inflations for term or late preterm infants who receive positive pressure ventilations due to bradycardia or ineffective respirations at birth.

We suggest that a DSED strategy (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence) or a VC defibrillation strategy (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence) may be considered for adults with cardiac arrest who remain in VF or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after ≥ 3 consecutive shocks.

If a DSED strategy is used, we suggest an approach similar to that in the available trial, with a single operator activating the defibrillators in sequence (good practice statement).

Drugs or, when appropriate, pacing may be used to control unstable or symptomatic bradycardia. Cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic tachycardia. ACLS providers should closely monitor stable patients pending expert consultation and should be prepared to aggressively treat those with evidence of decompensation.

Adult advanced life support — bradycardia acute management notes that atropine has been shown to be effective for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia in observational studies. In OHCA with a nonshockable rhythm, the addition of atropine following epinephrine was a predictor of survival to hospital admission, whereas in IHCA atropine for nonshockable rhythms did not improve survival. When symptomatic bradycardia is refractory to medical management, cardiac pacing is a reasonable alternative; transcutaneous pacing is noninvasive, can be performed quickly at bedside, and is typically used as a bridge to placement of a temporary transvenous pacing catheter, though it is often painful and may necessitate sedation. If atropine is ineffective, alternative agents to increase heart rate and blood pressure or transcutaneous pacing are reasonable alternatives, and dopamine infusion can also increase heart rate. For severe symptomatic bradycardia causing shock, if no IV or IO access is available, immediate transcutaneous pacing while access is being pursued may be undertaken. A 2006 systematic review involving seven studies of transcutaneous pacing in prehospital settings did not find a benefit compared with standard ALS, although a subgroup analysis from a single trial suggested a possible benefit in patients with symptomatic bradycardia.

### Pulselessness after initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation for bradycardia in hospitalized children [^7000f152]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is initiated in hospitalized children with bradycardia and poor perfusion. However, their rate of progression to pulseless cardiac arrest despite CPR and the differences in survival compared with initially pulseless arrest are unknown. We examined the prevalence and predictors of survival of children who progress from bradycardia to pulseless in-hospital cardiac arrest despite CPR.

Methods

Pediatric patients > 30 days and < 18 years of age who received CPR at hospitals participating in Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation during 2000 to 2016 were included. Each CPR event was classified as bradycardia with pulse, bradycardia with subsequent pulselessness, and initial pulseless cardiac arrest. We assessed risk-adjusted rates of survival to hospital discharge using multilevel Poisson regression models.

Results

Overall, 5592 pediatric patients were treated with CPR, of whom 2799 (50.1%) received CPR for bradycardia with poor perfusion and 2793 (49.9%) for initial pulseless cardiac arrest. Among those with bradycardia, 869 (31.0%, or 15.5% of cohort) became pulseless after a median of 3 minutes of CPR (interquartile range, 1–9 minutes). Rates of survival to discharge were 70.0% (1351 of 1930) for bradycardia with pulse, 30.1% (262 of 869) for bradycardia progressing to pulselessness, and 37.5% (1046 of 2793) for initial pulseless cardiac arrest (P for difference across groups < 0.001). Children who became pulseless despite CPR for bradycardia had a 19% lower likelihood (risk ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70, 0.93]; P = 0.004) of surviving to hospital discharge than those who were initially pulseless. Among children who progressed to pulselessness despite CPR for bradycardia, a longer interval between CPR and pulselessness was a predictor of lower survival (reference, < 2 minutes; for 2–5 minutes, risk ratio, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.41–0.70]; for > 5 minutes, risk ratio, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.32–0.53]).

Conclusions

Among hospitalized children in whom CPR is initiated, half have bradycardia with poor perfusion at the initiation of chest compressions, and nearly one-third of these progress to pulseless in-hospital cardiac arrest despite CPR. Survival was significantly lower for children who progress to pulselessness despite CPR compared with those who were initially pulseless. These findings suggest that pediatric patients who lose their pulse despite resuscitation attempts are at particularly high risk and require a renewed focus on postresuscitation care.

Heart Rate to Initiate Chest Compressions (ScopRev)

Rationale for Review

The recommended heart rate threshold for initiating chest compressions during resuscitation at birth has been < 60 bpm since 1999; at the same time, the optimal heart rate threshold for initiating chest compressions has been identified as a gap in knowledge. A ScopRev was initiated from a priority list from the ILCOR NLS Task Force. See the ILCOR website for the full online CoSTR.

PICOST

Population: Newborn infants immediately after birth who are being resuscitated with ventilation and who have a slow heart rate
Intervention: Starting cardiac compressions at other heart rate thresholds
Comparators: Starting cardiac compressions when the heart rate is < 60 bpm
Outcomes:
Critical: survival, neurological outcomes
Important: Any other reported short- or long-term outcomes, including time to ROSC
Study designs: RCTs, nonrandomized studies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies), and case series were eligible for inclusion. Manikin, computer model, and animal studies were eligible for inclusion. Conference abstracts and unpublished studies (eg, trial protocols) were excluded.
Time frame: All years and all languages were included as long as there was an English abstract. The literature search was updated to November 22, 2021.

Summary of Evidence

No studies were found that examined different heart rate thresholds for initiating chest compressions in newborn infants immediately after birth. There is also very little evidence from animal studies. Further description is included in the full online CoSTR.

Task Force Insights

The heart rate threshold of < 60 bpm was originally selected on the basis of expert opinion and a desire to simplify the resuscitation algorithm. The ScopRev provided no data sufficient to alter the existing recommendation, but the optimal threshold and whether it differs for different subgroups of infants remain unknown.

Treatment Recommendations

ILCOR has not developed an evidence-based treatment recommendation for heart rate threshold to initiate chest compressions previously. However, ILCOR guidance since 1999 has been to initiate chest compressions if the heart rate is < 60 bpm despite adequate assisted ventilation for 60 seconds. Insufficient evidence was found in the ScopRev to support a new SysRev or a different recommendation.

The AHA considers victims in puberty and beyond to be adults for the purposes of CPR, so adolescent victims follow the adult algorithm; Step 3 in the adult algorithm, effective defibrillation, which includes the use of an AED, can be critical in adolescents because they have a higher rate of VF/VT arrests than infants and children.

Prone position cardiac arrest — management recommendations in pediatric advanced life support include a strong recommendation and several good practice statements reflecting the lack of higher certainty evidence. A strong recommendation was made, for patients with cardiac arrest occurring while in the prone position without an advanced airway already in place, to turn that patient to the supine position as quickly as possible and begin CPR. For patients with cardiac arrest while in the prone position with an advanced airway already in place, and where immediate supination is not feasible or poses a significant risk to the patient, initiating CPR while the patient is still prone may be a reasonable approach (good practice statement). Invasive blood pressure monitoring and continuous (ETCO2) monitoring may be useful to ascertain whether or not prone compressions are meeting benchmarks for adequate perfusion, and this information could inform decision making on when to prioritize supination (good practice statement). For patients with cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm who are in the prone position and cannot be supinated immediately, attempting defibrillation in the prone position is a reasonable approach (good practice statement).

### Early bolus epinephrine administration during pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation for bradycardia with poor perfusion: an ICU-resuscitation study [^7af5ecc0]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is often the result of hemodynamic compromise secondary to progressive respiratory failure or shock accompanied by the development of bradycardia with poor perfusion. Expert consensus pediatric cardiac arrest guidelines recommend initiating cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for children with persistent non-pulseless bradycardia with poor perfusion as this may be a harbinger for pulseless cardiac arrest. Among children with IHCA, bradycardia with poor perfusion is the initial rhythm for which CPR is provided in approximately half of all events. Similar to guidelines for pulseless cardiac arrest, epinephrine administration is recommended during pediatric CPR for bradycardia with poor perfusion. However, a propensity score matched analysis of pediatric IHCA registry data identified an association between epinephrine and worse survival outcomes in patients receiving CPR for an initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion, thus bringing this practice into question. Though guidelines have not been changed to reflect this study's results, they provide rationale for further study of this patient population.

Both physiologic premise and previously published data support timely epinephrine administration during pulseless cardiac arrest. However, the utility of epinephrine in the subset of children receiving CPR for bradycardia with poor perfusion is unclear. Heterogeneity in the characteristics and outcomes of this population may confound the evaluation. First, epinephrine may preferentially be administered to children with a higher severity of illness and thus a lower likelihood of a favorable outcome, with limitations in the ability of registry data to account for these confounders. Second, many children with an initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion subsequently become pulseless.

While previous studies have included general data regarding the frequency with which clinicians detect subsequent pulselessness in children with an initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion, data regarding the timing of pulselessness and evolution of cardiac rhythms throughout a CPR event are limited. Rhythm documentation in previous work is based on clinician documentation and retrospective data abstraction, potentially limiting accuracy. Moreover, the poor reliability of clinician pulse detection during cardiac arrest has also been described. In this patient population that has been reported to have different demographics, response to therapy (including epinephrine), and event outcomes compared to children with initial pulseless rhythms, there is utility in a more granular and data-driven description of cardiac rhythm progression and its association with outcomes using a less subjective method of rhythm determination.

### Early bolus epinephrine administration during pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation for bradycardia with poor perfusion: an ICU-resuscitation study [^003a57e3]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In this secondary analysis of a cluster randomized trial, we must also consider the potential impact of the trial intervention on the exposure or outcomes in question. The ICU-RESUS trial studied a resuscitation quality improvement bundle, which could be expected to result in variable resuscitation practices (including epinephrine administration) and outcomes (including survival to hospital discharge). However, achieving target chest compression rate, depth, and fraction (markers of CPR quality) did not differ between the parent trial intervention and control groups (rate: OR 1.3 [95% CI 0.65–2.63], p = 0.46; depth: OR 1.28 [95% CI 0.52–3.24], p = 0.59; fraction: OR 0.82 [95% CI 0.51–1.33], p = 0.42), nor did event outcomes (survival to discharge with favorable neurologic outcome: aOR 1.08 [95% CI 0.76–1.53; survival to discharge: aOR 1.03 [95% CI 0.73–1.47]). More specifically, when dividing our cohort by treatment allocation, there were no differences in the percentage of cases receiving epinephrine (control: 91%, treatment: 89%; p = 0.431), time to first epinephrine (control: 1 min [IQR 0, 2], treatment: 1 min [IQR 0, 2], or total number of doses (control: 3 [IQR 1, 5], treatment: 2 [IQR 1, 7]; p = 0.476). Considering the lack of differences noted between the groups in these relevant outcomes and metrics, we expect it is unlikely that intervention allocation confounded this study although unmeasured confounding remains a possibility.

### Early bolus epinephrine administration during pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation for bradycardia with poor perfusion: an ICU-resuscitation study [^9457c503]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Half of pediatric in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) events have an initial rhythm of non-pulseless bradycardia with poor perfusion. Our study objectives were to leverage granular data from the ICU-RESUScitation (ICU-RESUS) trial to: (1) determine the association of early epinephrine administration with survival outcomes in children receiving CPR for bradycardia with poor perfusion; and (2) describe the incidence and time course of the development of pulselessness.

Methods

Prespecified secondary analysis of ICU-RESUS, a multicenter cluster randomized trial of children (< 19 years) receiving CPR in 18 intensive care units in the United States. Index events (October 2016–March 2021) lasting ≥ 2 min with a documented initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion were included. Associations between early epinephrine (first 2 min of CPR) and outcomes were evaluated with Poisson multivariable regression controlling for a priori pre-arrest characteristics. Among patients with arterial lines, intra-arrest blood pressure waveforms were reviewed to determine presence of a pulse during CPR interruptions. The temporal nature of progression to pulselessness was described and outcomes were compared between patients according to subsequent pulselessness status.

Results

Of 452 eligible subjects, 322 (71%) received early epinephrine. The early epinephrine group had higher pre-arrest severity of illness and vasoactive-inotrope scores. Early epinephrine was not associated with survival to discharge (aRR 0.97, 95%CI 0.82, 1.14) or survival with favorable neurologic outcome (aRR 0.99, 95%CI 0.82, 1.18). Among 186 patients with invasive blood pressure waveforms, 118 (63%) had at least 1 period of pulselessness during the first 10 min of CPR; 86 (46%) by 2 min and 100 (54%) by 3 min. Sustained return of spontaneous circulation was highest after bradycardia with poor perfusion (84%) compared to bradycardia with poor perfusion progressing to pulselessness (43%) and bradycardia with poor perfusion progressing to pulselessness followed by return to bradycardia with poor perfusion (62%) (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this cohort of pediatric CPR events with an initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion, we failed to identify an association between early bolus epinephrine and outcomes when controlling for illness severity. Most children receiving CPR for bradycardia with poor perfusion developed subsequent pulselessness, 46% within 2 min of CPR onset.

### Risk-standardizing hospital rates of survival for pediatric in-hospital CPR events [^a657f62b]. Resuscitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bradycardia with poor perfusion is the most common reason for in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in children. To date, validated methods to risk-standardize pediatric survival rates for CPR events in hospitals that includes bradycardia with poor perfusion do not exist.

Methods

Within Get With the Guidelines-Resuscitation, we identified 8080 children who underwent CPR between 2016 and 2023. Using hierarchical logistic regression, we derived and validated a model for survival to hospital discharge to calculate risk-standardized survival rates (RSSRs) for hospitals.

Results

Bradycardia with poor perfusion comprised 56.4% of pediatric CPR events. An initial full model in the derivation cohort identified 16 predictors of survival (c-statistic = 0.772), and a parsimonious model with 13 predictors maintained good discrimination (c-statistic = 0.769). The model calibrated well in the validation cohort (R² = 0.993). Final predictors included: age group, illness category, initial rhythm, arrest location, renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, sepsis, metabolic or electrolyte abnormality, metastatic or hematologic malignancy, cardiac acyanotic congenital abnormality, congenital noncardiac abnormality, and mechanical ventilation or continuous intravenous vasopressor at the time of the CPR event. Among 100 hospitals with ≥ 5 CPR events, the median RSSR was 51.8% (IQR: 50.1–54.5%; range: 40.5–62.9%). The adjusted median OR was 1.32 (95% CI: 1.18–1.43), which suggests that the odds of survival to discharge for two children with similar characteristics varied by 32% between hospitals.

Conclusion

We developed and validated a model to risk-standardize hospital rates of survival for children undergoing CPR, including those with bradycardia and poor perfusion. This model can facilitate efforts to benchmark hospitals in resuscitation outcomes for children.

Association between subsequent pulselessness and outcomes

The primary exposure for this subgroup analysis of patients with invasive BP monitoring was the development of subsequent pulselessness during CPR initially provided for bradycardia with poor perfusion. Events were divided into three groups: (1) those with an initial rhythm of bradycardia with poor perfusion who did not develop pulselessness during the first 10 min of the CPR event; (2) those who did develop pulselessness; and (3) those who developed pulselessness and subsequently had at least one return to bradycardia with poor perfusion. The primary outcome for this analysis was sustained ROSC. Exploratory outcomes included survival to hospital discharge and survival to hospital discharge with a favorable neurologic outcome. Associations were measured using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous variables. A sensitivity analysis was performed with events categorized by early epinephrine status.

All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC). Reported p-values were based on a two-sided alternative and considered significant if less than 0.05.

### Using pediatric advanced life support in pediatric residency training: does the curriculum need resuscitation? [^eed3f803]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) course is used throughout North American pediatric residency programs to provide a core pediatric resuscitation curriculum. Despite this widespread use, its effectiveness has not been formally assessed in pediatric residents. This study aimed to evaluate the PALS curriculum's effectiveness in providing pediatric residents with knowledge, skill and confidence in pediatric resuscitation.

Design

Course evaluation.

Setting

Tertiary care pediatric hospital.

Subjects

Pediatric residents.

Interventions

Subjects were followed prospectively for 1 yr following completion of an annual PALS course. Multiple choice and short answer questionnaires were used to evaluate residents' knowledge immediately before and after completion of the course and throughout the following year. Confidence in ten aspects of pediatric resuscitation was assessed. Scores were compared before and after the PALS course to evaluate acquisition of knowledge and confidence. Scores at 12 months were compared with the immediate post-PALS course scores to evaluate maintenance of knowledge and confidence over time. Technical skills were evaluated by staff anesthetists using a 3-point scale.

Measurements and Main Results

Knowledge questionnaire scores were significantly higher post-PALS compared with pre-PALS, but knowledge of the details of PALS algorithms decreased significantly over the following 12 months. Confidence ratings improved post-PALS on only two of ten measures and remained very low overall. Residents could complete the four core technical skills but required assistance or multiple attempts.

Conclusions

PALS is successful in providing basic resuscitation knowledge to pediatric residents, but knowledge of critical algorithm details is not sustained. The course does not provide for the expected level of competency in relevant technical skills. Residents do not achieve the confidence to feel well prepared to provide comprehensive care to pediatric patients in cardiopulmonary arrest. These findings support the hypothesis that the PALS course alone is insufficient to provide pediatric residents with competency in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia and conduction disease evaluation algorithm — For a patient with symptoms suggestive of or consistent with bradycardia or conduction disorder, initial steps include comprehensive history and physical examination (Class I), electrocardiogram (ECG) (Class I), and directed blood testing (Class IIa). If the initial evaluation is nondiagnostic, the pathway includes echocardiography if structural heart disease suspected, and for exercise-related symptoms it includes exercise ECG testing (Class IIa) followed by ambulatory ECG monitoring (Class I). For infrequent symptoms (> 30 days), ICM (Class IIa) is shown, with monitor choice based on the frequency of symptoms. When there are no significant arrhythmias, observation is shown; the algorithm also references SND Diagnostic algorithm†, AV Block Diagnostic algorithm‡, and Conduction disorder with 1:1 AV conduction Diagnostic algorithm§, with dashed lines indicating possible optional strategies based on the specific clinical situation.

### Considerations on the use of neonatal and pediatric resuscitation guidelines for hospitalized neonates and infants: on behalf of the American Heart Association emergency cardiovascular care committee and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^6d1aab11]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Hospitalized neonates and infants — sequence of resuscitation efforts: In the ICU, most children receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation have bradycardia with poor perfusion, and pediatric guidelines call for simultaneous assessment and management by providing airway, ventilation, and oxygenation, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) initiated if compromise persists despite effective oxygenation and ventilation. Neonatal guidance emphasizes ventilation first, noting that mask leaks and upper airway obstruction can cause ineffective positive pressure ventilation (PPV), so neonatal resuscitation focuses on optimizing PPV and performing ventilation-corrective steps, including advanced airway placement, before starting chest compressions. In the NICU, over 80% of arrests start as acute respiratory compromise, and simulation studies warn that starting compressions before ensuring effective ventilation may divert focus; there is no evidence that attempting ventilation-corrective steps before compressions is inferior to starting compressions first. For in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), pediatric guidelines state there are not sufficient data to support a recommendation for advanced airway use; in most hospital CPR events compressions and ventilations are started simultaneously because most patients are already intubated, and thus differences between the pediatric C-A-B approach and a neonatal ventilation-first approach are likely minimal.

Shared decision-making process — The bradycardia guideline writing committee endorses shared decision-making as part of the general care for patients with symptomatic bradycardia, and a commonly accepted definition of shared decision-making includes 4 components: 1) at least 2 participants, the clinician and patient; 2) both participants share information with each other; 3) both parties build a consensus about the preferred treatment; and 4) an agreement is reached on the treatment to implement. Notably, a recommendation based on evidence or guidelines alone is not shared decision-making, and if time permits the patient should be directed to trusted material which supports and itemizes appropriate considerations which should be factored into their decision-making.

### Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the United States: a review [^34bb33ad]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) occurs frequently and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the current knowledge and recommendations regarding pediatric IHCA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Observations

Each year, more than 15 000 children receive CPR for cardiac arrest during hospitalization in the United States. As many as 80% to 90% survive the event, but most patients do not survive to hospital discharge. Most IHCAs occur in intensive care units and other monitored settings and are associated with respiratory failure or shock. Bradycardia with poor perfusion is the initial rhythm in half of CPR events, and only about 10% of events have an initial shockable rhythm. Pre-cardiac arrest systems focus on identifying at-risk patients and ensuring that they are in monitored settings. Important components of CPR include high-quality chest compressions, timely defibrillation when indicated, appropriate ventilation and airway management, administration of epinephrine to increase coronary perfusion pressure, and treatment of the underlying cause of cardiac arrest. Extracorporeal CPR and measurement of physiological parameters are evolving areas in improving outcomes. Structured post-cardiac arrest care focused on targeted temperature management, optimization of hemodynamics, and careful intensive care unit management is associated with improved survival and neurological outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Pediatric IHCA occurs frequently and has a high mortality rate. Early identification of risk, prevention, delivery of high-quality CPR, and post-cardiac arrest care can maximize the chances of achieving favorable outcomes. More research in this field is warranted.

Pediatric basic and advanced life support guidelines — pediatric advanced life support guidelines apply to neonates (less than 30 days old) after hospital discharge, infants, children, and adolescents up to 18 years of age, and the pediatric guidelines exclude newborns and recommend that neonatal guidelines be used at birth and during the first hospitalization after birth. According to the pediatric guidelines, when cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is initiated, it may be reasonable to use a sequence of compressions first, followed by airway and breathing.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of data collected from Severance Children's' Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, from January 2010 to December 2020. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (4-2022-0024). Participants of this study were of the age ranging from 0 to 23 months including infants and toddlers, who had experienced cardiac arrest out-of-hospital or in-hospital at least once.

High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) according to pediatric advanced life support (PALS) guidelines was performed by board-certified physicians. Misreported cases such as syncope, not cardiac arrest and cases of poor-quality CPR not following PALS guidelines were excluded. Only the initial cardiac arrest counted as a meaningful event in patients with recurrent episodes of cardiac arrest in the same admission period.

In total, 98 patients were primarily selected. Two cases of misreported cases and 30 cases of recurrent CPR on the same patients were excluded. Finally, 66 children were recruited for our study, whose medical data were reviewed (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Chart depicting final participants.

The flow chart depicts candidate elimination, with participants at each step were represented as "N".

Age, sex, underlying disease, etiology, time between last normal to CPR, initial CPR location, administered epinephrine, in-hospital CPR duration out-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), presence of doctor on duty, initial cardiac rhythm, changes and kinds of cardiac rhythm, venous access securing time, and use of inotropes were considered as the variable factors similar to the previous scoring tools used in adultsto discover prognostic predictors. A good outcome is defined as the recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), while a bad outcome is defined as failure of recovery including death. Outcome after ROSC was not included in the analysis.

We chose a cut-off value of 30 minutes for CPR duration and 10 as the threshold number for administered epinephrine, similar to previous studies having clinically significant outcomes. Epinephrine was administered at an interval of 3 minutes. The administration of epinephrine was analyzed in two ways: first, by the number of each administration as a continuous variable. Second, it was divided into two categories (less than ten times administration and more than ten times administration) and interpreted as a categorical variable.

Likewise, CPR duration was also considered as both continuous and categorical variables and divided into groups of 5 minutes each. The final changes in rhythm were analyzed by eliminating a small number of duplicates that had appeared.

Cardiovascular bradycardia — EMS key considerations include observing for decreased end-organ perfusion signs such as chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine. Consider potential culprit medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers/anti-depressants, digoxin, and clonidine, and consider hyperkalemia in the patient with wide complex bradycardia. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, hypoxia, pacemaker failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with increased intracranial pressure, stroke, spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, and cholinergic nerve agents. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as needed. Third-degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine or dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight-based for non-obese patients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research suggests that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine. Caution: Norepinephrine can theoretically cause reflex bradycardia.

"Notably, a recommendation based on evidence or guidelines alone is not shared decision-making". While "pacemaker implantation or revision are commonly performed heart procedures and are not typically associated with high procedural risk in most patients", adverse events "such as pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade can complicate the procedure". Moreover, "patients with significant comorbid conditions may not derive the intended benefit of pacing support or an improved QOL", and "the benefit-risk ratio is not favorable if the probable benefit is also quite low", particularly in terminal progressive illness where "the benefits of pacing support may not be realized and are unlikely to positively impact the overall outcome".

### Drugs used to treat pediatric emergencies [^068096c9]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric emergency drug dosing principles and guideline resources — individualization and recommended references — are as follows: Dosing should be individualized, taking into account the patient's weight in kilograms, medical illness, age, concurrently administered drugs, and drug hypersensitivity history, and dosages are generally provided as milligrams per kilogram. The committees recommend the use of current Advanced Pediatric Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support textbooks, updated American Heart Association guidelines, and additional references for more detailed information on pediatric resuscitation algorithms, rapid-sequence intubation (RSI), procedural sedation, and medical management in disasters. The Neonatal Resuscitation Program is focused on care of the newborn infant, and there is no clear evidence to guide when it is appropriate to use Advanced Pediatric Life Support guidelines in the care of an infant. General recommendations are currently to decide which drug to use on the basis of the likely etiology of the problem, and the use of preprinted weight-based medication cards and/or length-based resuscitation tapes is recommended when treating an emergency regardless of location.

Cardiac arrest in pregnancy algorithm — initial actions and timing: Start basic life support/advanced life support (BLS/ALS) with high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), provide continuous left lateral uterine displacement when the fundal height is at or above the umbilicus, and use an automated external defibrillator (AED)/defibrillator when indicated; activate a cardiac arrest in pregnancy team and address the etiology of arrest; optimize resuscitation by prioritizing early airway management, placing intravenous (IV) access above the diaphragm, stopping IV magnesium and giving calcium if receiving magnesium, detaching fetal monitors, and activating a massive blood transfusion protocol if amniotic fluid embolism is suspected; prepare for resuscitative delivery when fundal height is at or above the umbilicus with the goal of delivery by 5 minutes if no return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); continue ALS and resuscitate the newborn infant using the Neonatal Resuscitation Algorithm; the goal of left lateral uterine displacement is to relieve aortocaval compression and facilitate effective chest compressions, and the goal of resuscitative delivery is to improve the pregnant patient's outcome, and when feasible, the newborn infant's outcome, with guidance that ideally, resuscitative delivery is performed by 5 minutes and that in pregnancy a difficult airway is common and is managed by the most experienced professional.

Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework Highlights

The complete evidence-to-decision framework can be found on the ILCOR website, and the evidence-to-decision table is provided in Appendix A.

In making this weak recommendation, we note that this patient population (ie, cardiac arrest for which conventional CPR is failing) has a very high mortality rate. Therefore, the potential for benefit and value of this intervention remains despite the overall low certainty in the evidence.
The published randomized trials have included highly selected patients for ECPR. The trial by Yannopoulos et alenrolled patients with OHCA with an initial shockable rhythm refractory to at least 3 shocks and randomized patients on hospital arrival. The trials by Hsu et aland Belohlavek et alenrolled patients with OHCA with any initial rhythm and randomized patients in the prehospital setting. In all 3 trials, the intervention was a treatment strategy that included ECPR. The percentages of patients in the intervention group who received ECPR were 80%, 42%, and 66% in the Yannopoulos et al, Hsu et al, and Belohlavek et al trials, respectively. The ECPR strategy in the trials by Yannopoulos et al and Belohlavek et al included immediate access to a catheterization laboratory. Guidelines for clinical practice should ideally apply to populations similar to those enrolled in the trials to date, although randomized trials have not been performed to define the optimal population. For this reason, the findings of individual trials should be interpreted cautiously in the context of the trial setting and population.
We acknowledge that ECPR is a complex intervention that requires considerable resources and training that are not universally available but also acknowledge the value of an intervention that may be successful in individuals for whom usual CPR techniques have failed.

Secondary Outcomes

We assessed 6 secondary outcomes. Performance and time (in seconds) to accomplish critical resuscitation interventions were measured. Chest compression quality metrics were analyzed by the manikin internal software (Skill Reporter, Laerdal). Chest compression quality was defined according to AHA standards as proportion of compressions with depth 50 to 60 mm, compression fraction (percentage of time during arrest with compressions), mean depth of compressions, and mean rate of compressions. Team clinical performance was evaluated by means of the asystole section of the Clinical Performance Tool (range, 0–13; higher score indicating better performance), a scoring system with supportive validity evidence designed on PALS algorithms. Usability of the app was evaluated by team leaders who used the app through a questionnaire that included open-ended questions and a score with published supportive validity evidence, the System Usability Scale (range, 0–100; higher score indicating better usability). Team leaders' workload was measured by the raw version of the NASA-Task Load Index, which includes 6 subscale scores representing different perceived workload domains (range, 0–100; higher score indicating higher perceived workload).
