## Question

In a patient with stemi and atrial fibrillation, is it ok to start dapt and therapeutic anticoagulation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is appropriate to start dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) together with therapeutic anticoagulation in a patient who has both STEMI and atrial fibrillation, and how to manage the antithrombotic regimen safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the competing thrombotic risks of STEMI and AF and the baseline bleeding risk. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines recommend for timing and duration of triple versus dual therapy. Next, I will review randomized and observational evidence on bleeding and ischemic outcomes, especially in STEMI. After that, I need to check practical peri-PCI considerations, including access, stent choice, and procedural anticoagulation. Finally, I will synthesize a risk-stratified, time-limited plan and confirm monitoring and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk framing. STEMI carries high early stent thrombosis risk, and AF mandates oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Combining DAPT with therapeutic anticoagulation yields triple therapy, which substantially increases bleeding risk, including intracranial hemorrhage, so I need to ensure we balance these risks carefully rather than reflexively layering agents [^117LUFb9] [^114L2smw].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. Wait, let me verify the default strategy. The 2023 ESC ACS guidance recommends dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT: a non-VKA OAC plus a single antiplatelet agent, preferably clopidogrel) for up to 12 months after an initial short course of triple therapy (TAT: OAC plus aspirin plus clopidogrel) for about 1 week, with the total TAT duration individualized to ischemic and bleeding risk and generally not exceeding 1 month [^11559wGx]. The 2024 ESC AF guidance similarly advises considering TAT for more than 1 week after ACS when ischemic risk outweighs bleeding risk, but keeping total TAT duration to 1 month or less and documenting the rationale [^1178otRd] [^116cfv9E]. The 2020 ACC expert consensus likewise favors DAT as the default after a very short period of TAT, reserving longer TAT for selected high-ischemic, low-bleeding-risk patients [^114BecDu] [^115ZkU7x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about immediate DAT. I should double-check whether starting DAT on day 1 post-PCI is safe in STEMI. Large contemporary observational analyses show that immediate DAT on day 1 is increasingly used, but is associated with a small but significant increase in stent thrombosis, particularly in STEMI, compared with an initial short TAT course, reinforcing that STEMI patients are a subgroup where a brief TAT phase is prudent [^117GXAdC] [^112YX8Z1] [^111k2rFx]. This aligns with the ESC/ACC emphasis on a short TAT lead-in for high ischemic risk presentations like STEMI [^114rQm99] [^114BecDu].

> I will now examine the bleeding-versus-ischemia trade-off in trials and meta-analyses. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses consistently show that DAT (OAC plus single antiplatelet, usually clopidogrel) reduces major bleeding by roughly 30–50% compared with TAT without increasing stroke or all-cause mortality, though there is a small, non-significant signal toward more stent thrombosis, which becomes more relevant in ACS and STEMI subgroups [^114L2smw] [^112VW7hm] [^115CzPWo]. Let me reconsider the magnitude: pooled analyses suggest stent thrombosis risk may be modestly higher with DAT, which is why guidelines still endorse a short TAT period in high ischemic risk patients despite the bleeding penalty [^115CzPWo] [^114rQm99].

> Next, I should review peri-PCI and procedural considerations that mitigate bleeding. Radial access is preferred to reduce access-site bleeding, and contemporary drug-eluting stents are favored over bare-metal stents even in high bleeding risk because they permit shorter antiplatelet durations while maintaining low stent thrombosis risk [^1156Bg6m] [^116z6UV7]. I need to ensure intraprocedural anticoagulation is adjusted: for VKA, avoid additional UFH if INR is ≥ 2.5 or use reduced dosing; for NOACs, add low-dose UFH or enoxaparin during PCI irrespective of last dose timing, and avoid routine GPIs unless bailout [^1156Bg6m] [^112BpiNS]. Let me verify stent choice guidance: yes, newest-generation DES are recommended even in high bleeding risk patients to enable shorter DAPT courses [^116z6UV7].

> Now, I should define the antithrombotic sequence explicitly. For most STEMI patients with AF, start TAT with a DOAC at stroke-prevention dose, aspirin 75–100 mg daily, and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for about 1 week, extending up to 1 month only if ischemic risk is very high and bleeding risk is acceptable, with clear documentation of the rationale [^114rQm99] [^1178otRd]. After the TAT phase, transition to DAT with a DOAC plus clopidogrel for 6–12 months, then continue the DOAC alone for long-term stroke prevention, reassessing annually for any need to extend antiplatelet therapy in exceptional anatomies like left main or complex bifurcation stenting [^114rQm99] [^114rQm99]. But wait, what if bleeding risk is very high? In that case, it is reasonable to abbreviate TAT to 1 week or even omit TAT and proceed directly to DAT in select cases, acknowledging the small stent thrombosis trade-off and ensuring close follow-up [^1146nVb7] [^114BecDu].

> I need to ensure agent selection minimizes bleeding. DOACs are preferred over VKAs when combined with antiplatelet therapy because they reduce major and intracranial bleeding without sacrificing ischemic protection, with apixaban, rivaroxaban 15 mg, and dabigatran 150 mg supported by randomized data in this setting [^114L2smw] [^112aGFJM]. Clopidogrel is the P2Y12 inhibitor of choice in TAT/DAT regimens; prasugrel and ticagrelor are generally avoided with TAT due to bleeding, though ticagrelor may be considered in select high-ischemic, low-bleeding-risk patients within a DAT framework, not TAT [^1156Bg6m] [^1127GaoY].

> Let me first confirm the practical loading and dosing details. At PCI, give aspirin 162–325 mg if not already given, and load clopidogrel 600 mg. For the DOAC, use standard stroke-prevention doses unless there are dose-reduction criteria, and avoid VKA loading or bridging unless there is a compelling reason, given the higher bleeding risk with VKA-based triple therapy [^115dynL4] [^116wVVm9]. I should double-check that this aligns with consensus pathways: yes, ACC guidance supports aspirin during hospitalization with early cessation and DOAC plus clopidogrel as the default after a short TAT phase [^114BecDu] [^115ZkU7x].

> Next, I should review risk stratification tools and modifiable risks. Use CHA2DS2-VASc to affirm the need for OAC and HAS-BLED to quantify bleeding risk and correct modifiable factors; in STEMI, even with high CHA2DS2-VASc, the early hazard of stent thrombosis justifies a short TAT course if bleeding risk is not prohibitive [^1156Bg6m] [^114rQm99]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse documenting the ischemic-versus-bleeding rationale when deviating from the default; ESC AF guidance explicitly calls for clear documentation of the risk assessment and plan [^1178otRd].

> I will now examine monitoring and transitions. During TAT, monitor closely for bleeding, hemoglobin drops, and symptoms of stent thrombosis. After transitioning to DAT, reassess at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months for bleeding, adherence, and ischemic events, with a plan to stop antiplatelet therapy at 12 months in most patients and continue DOAC monotherapy thereafter [^114rQm99] [^114BecDu]. Let me verify the long-term plan: yes, after 12 months, OAC alone is recommended unless there are special anatomic or recurrent ischemic considerations [^114rQm99] [^114BecDu].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Starting full DAPT with therapeutic anticoagulation (i.e., triple therapy) is acceptable in STEMI with AF, but it should be time-limited to about 1 week, extended only selectively to 1 month if ischemic risk clearly outweighs bleeding risk, and then de-escalated to dual therapy with a DOAC plus clopidogrel for 6–12 months before continuing DOAC monotherapy, with radial access, DES, and careful procedural anticoagulation to mitigate bleeding [^114rQm99] [^112aGFJM] [^116z6UV7]. Immediate DAT without any TAT is not the preferred strategy in STEMI because of a small but real increase in stent thrombosis observed in observational cohorts, so I need to ensure a brief TAT phase unless bleeding risk is prohibitive [^117GXAdC] [^112YX8Z1].

---

In STEMI with AF, **triple therapy is indicated for the first 1–4 weeks** [^112aGFJM] after PCI to balance ischemic and bleeding risks, then transition to dual therapy (OAC plus a single antiplatelet, preferably clopidogrel) for up to 12 months [^114rQm99], and continue OAC alone thereafter [^115XwcrN]. Use **radial access and PPIs** to reduce bleeding [^116z6UV7], and avoid prasugrel/ticagrelor during triple therapy [^1156Bg6m]. Immediate dual therapy (OAC plus single antiplatelet) is not recommended due to increased stent thrombosis risk [^112YX8Z1], especially in STEMI [^117GXAdC].

---

## Indications for anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in STEMI with AF

In STEMI with AF, **anticoagulation** is indicated for stroke prevention per CHA2DS2-VASc, and **antiplatelet therapy** is required after PCI to prevent stent thrombosis and ischemic events [^116NVy9e] [^113rDD7G].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines recommend a **stepwise approach** that starts with short-term triple therapy and then transitions to dual therapy, followed by OAC monotherapy:

| **Phase** | **Recommended therapy** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial phase (post-PCI) | Triple therapy (OAC + aspirin + clopidogrel) | 1–4 weeks (individualized) [^112aGFJM] [^114mK7Tr] |
| Maintenance phase | Dual therapy (OAC + single antiplatelet, preferably clopidogrel) | Up to 12 months [^114rQm99] |
| Long-term phase | OAC monotherapy | Indefinitely if AF indication persists [^115XwcrN] |

---

Triple therapy is favored initially to mitigate **early stent thrombosis risk** [^114mK7Tr]; dual therapy reduces bleeding thereafter while maintaining ischemic protection [^114L2smw].

---

## Risks and benefits of triple therapy

Triple therapy reduces ischemic events but increases bleeding; **balancing these risks** is essential:

- **Benefits**: Reduces stent thrombosis and ischemic events in high-risk patients [^115CzPWo].
- **Risks**: Increases major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage [^115Mf8z7] [^114L2smw].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting triple therapy

Evidence supports a short course of triple therapy post-PCI in AF:

- **AUGUSTUS trial**: Short triple therapy (median 6.5 days) followed by dual therapy reduced bleeding without increasing ischemic events [^117GXAdC] [^114L2smw].
- **RE-DUAL PCI trial**: Dual therapy (dabigatran + P2Y12 inhibitor) reduced bleeding vs triple therapy; noninferior for ischemic events [^11444BR7].
- **Meta-analyses**: Dual therapy reduces bleeding vs triple therapy, with similar ischemic outcomes [^114L2smw] [^112VW7hm].

---

## Risks associated with triple therapy

Triple therapy significantly increases **bleeding risk**, including major and intracranial hemorrhage [^114L2smw]; bleeding risk is highest early and declines over time, supporting a short initial course [^114eoL5Q] [^112aGFJM].

---

## Alternative strategies

Alternative strategies include **dual therapy (OAC + single antiplatelet)** for patients at high bleeding risk or after a very short triple course, and **OAC monotherapy** after 12 months if no ongoing antiplatelet indication [^115XwcrN] [^114rQm99].

---

## Clinical factors influencing decision-making

Decision-making should be **individualized** based on:

- **Ischemic risk**: High-risk features (e.g. STEMI, complex PCI) favor triple therapy [^114mK7Tr].
- **Bleeding risk**: High bleeding risk (e.g. HAS-BLED ≥ 3) favors shorter triple therapy or dual therapy [^11559wGx].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, renal function, prior bleeding, and access route [^116z6UV7].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **regular assessment** for bleeding, adherence, and ischemic symptoms, with **laboratory monitoring** of renal function and INR if VKA is used.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial phase**: Triple therapy (OAC + aspirin + clopidogrel) for 1–4 weeks post-PCI [^114edFye].
- **Maintenance phase**: Dual therapy (OAC + clopidogrel) for up to 12 months [^114rQm99].
- **Long-term phase**: OAC monotherapy indefinitely if AF indication persists [^114BecDu].
- **Bleeding risk mitigation**: Use radial access, PPIs, and avoid prasugrel/ticagrelor during triple therapy [^116z6UV7] [^1156Bg6m].

---

Triple therapy is appropriate initially after PCI in STEMI with AF, then transition to dual therapy and eventually OAC alone, with therapy tailored to ischemic and bleeding risk profiles [^11559wGx].

A growing number of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation also have atrial fibrillation. This poses challenges for their optimal antithrombotic management because patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI require oral anticoagulation for the prevention of cardiac thromboembolism and dual antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of coronary thrombotic complications. The combination of oral anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy substantially increases the risk of bleeding. Over the last decade, a series of North American Consensus Statements on the Management of Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention have been reported. Since the last update in 2018, several pivotal clinical trials in the field have been published. This document provides a focused updated of the 2018 recommendations. The group recommends that in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant is the oral anticoagulation of choice. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor should be given to all patients during the peri-PCI period (during inpatient stay, until time of discharge, up to 1 week after PCI, at the discretion of the treating physician), after which the default strategy is to stop aspirin and continue treatment with a P2Y 12 inhibitor, preferably clopidogrel, in combination with a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (ie, double therapy). In patients at increased thrombotic risk who have an acceptable risk of bleeding, it is reasonable to continue aspirin (ie, triple therapy) for up to 1 month. Double therapy should be given for 6 to 12 months with the actual duration depending on the ischemic and bleeding risk profile of the patient, after which patients should discontinue antiplatelet therapy and receive oral anticoagulation alone.

### Anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategies used in Sweden in patients with myocardial infarction and concomitant atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^113cHmio]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Optimal antithrombotic therapy and its duration, whether triple therapy with dual antiplatelets plus oral anticoagulant (OAC), or dual antithrombotic therapy with an antiplatelet plus OAC, is uncertain for patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

Patients registered in SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for enhancement and development of evidence-based care in heart disease evaluated according to recommended therapies) for their first MI between 2011 and 2021 with a history or new-onset AF were included (n = 26 574). Linkage between SWEDEHEART and Swedish administrative health databases was performed, and pseudonymised data analysed.

Results

Over time, OAC use at discharge after MI tripled from 27% in 2011 to 77% in 2021, with direct OACs (DOACs) largely replacing warfarin, predominantly in combination with a single antiplatelet. The strongest factors for initiating OAC therapy were the performance of coronary angiography (OR 1.53 (1.40–1.68)), and percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 1.49 (1.39–1.61)). However, the year of the MI was the most predictive variable associated with OAC initiation, with an OR of 9.31 (7.92–10.95) in 2021 compared with 2011. The clinical factors associated with lower likelihood of OAC initiation were dementia, liver disease, cancer and ST-elevation MI (STEMI) versus non-STEMI.

Conclusions

Use of OAC has increased over the years in patients with MI and concurrent AF, primarily driven by the increased adoption of DOACs. Additionally, there has been a shift in antithrombotic combinations, with most patients in recent years receiving DOAC in combination with a single antiplatelet, reflecting the nationwide implementation of recent evidence and guidelines. However, significant variation in antithrombotic therapy strategies remains.

PCI procedural considerations in anticoagulated patients emphasize bleeding avoidance and agent selection: We recommend radial access and other feasible bleeding avoidance strategies; radial access is also recommended when possible in elective PCI, though crossover to femoral access may be necessary in 5% to 10% of cases. Intraprocedural anticoagulation options include unfractionated heparin, LMWH, or bivalirudin, and all 3 agents have a Class I recommendation in ACC/AHA guidelines with dosing guidelines to be followed. A glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor or cangrelor may be considered based on anatomic and procedural characteristics, but these medications will likely increase bleeding risk. Even among patients with high bleeding risk, we recommend using the newest-generation DES over bare metal stents for PCI.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) with immediate vs delayed invasive strategy — management while on oral anticoagulation: In NSTE-ACS planned for an immediate invasive strategy (i.e. < 2 h from symptom onset), periprocedural treatment should be as in STEMI. If invasive treatment is delayed, it is still suggested to perform PCI without interruption or discontinuation of VKAs or possibly NOACs, and an uninterrupted strategy was not associated with an increase in bleeding or major cardiovascular events vs bridging. For VKAs, it is suggested either not to administer additional intraprocedural UFH if INR value is ≥ 2.5 or to consider a lower UFH dose; for NOACs, additional intraprocedural low-dose parenteral anticoagulation (e.g. enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg i.v. or UFH 60 U/kg i.v.) should be added irrespective of the time of the last NOAC administration; GPIs should be avoided unless for bail-out.

### Contemporary use and clinical significance of initial triple versus double therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention for myocardial infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111k2rFx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study include a large sample size from > 1000 US hospitals. However, its limitations include the observational design, which may introduce confounding and bias when attempting to draw conclusions around causal inference. Additionally, 31.5% of patients were excluded due to missing medication data, which could introduce selection bias. The complexity of intervened lesions, severity of comorbid conditions, and duration of triple therapy were not accounted for in our analysis because of lack of granular details. Our findings should also be interpreted after considering that there may be a competing risk of death, our primary outcome, on secondary outcomes.

In conclusion, many cardiologists are transitioning their patients with AF to double therapy immediately following PCI, despite the lack of randomized controlled evidence for this approach. Our study suggests that this is likely safe for select patients with AF following PCI. However, we observed a signal for increased risk of stent thrombosis with immediate double therapy in select populations, specifically those presenting with STEMI. This suggests that the highest risk subgroups of patients likely benefit from an initial course of triple therapy before transitioning to double therapy. Future randomized trials are needed to determine which patients require an initial short course of triple therapy before transitioning to double therapy in patients with AF post‐PCI and, if so, to establish the optimal duration.

### A systematic review of randomized trials comparing double versus triple antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^115CzPWo]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating the optimal antithrombotic therapies for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have not been powered to evaluate ischemic outcomes. We compared double therapy with oral anticoagulation (OAC) and a P2Y12 inhibitor to triple therapy with an OAC+dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with AF requiring PCI.

Methods

Using PRISMA guidelines, we searched for RCTs including patients with AF as an indication for OAC and undergoing PCI or medical management of acute coronary syndrome. The results were pooled using fixed-effects and random-effects models to estimate the overall effect of double therapy versus triple therapy on ischemic and bleeding outcomes.

Results

We identified four RCTs, comprising 10,238 patients (5,498 double therapy, 4,740 triple therapy). Trial-reported major adverse cardiovascular events were similar between double therapy and triple therapy (fixed effect model OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94–1.26). However, stent thrombosis (61/5,496 double therapy vs. 33/4738 triple therapy; fixed effect model OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02–2.40; number needed to treat with triple therapy = 242) favored triple therapy. Bleeding outcomes were less frequent with double therapy (746/5470 vs. 950/4710; fixed effect model OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.53–0.65; number needed to harm with triple therapy = 16), but with significant heterogeneity (Q = 8.33, p = .04; I² = 64%), as were intracranial hemorrhages (19/5470 vs. 30/4710; fixed effect model OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31–0.96).

Conclusions

Double therapy in patients with AF requiring OAC following PCI or Acute coronary syndrome has a significantly better safety profile than triple therapy but may be associated with a modest increased risk of stent thrombosis.

### Combining antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in cardiovascular disease [^112UasHC]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Up to 10% of the > 3 million Americans with atrial fibrillation will experience an acute coronary syndrome or undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. Therefore, concurrent indications for multiple antithrombotic agents is a common clinical scenario. Although each helps reduce thrombotic risk, their combined use significantly increases the risk of major bleeding events, which can be life threatening. In the past 5 years, a number of randomized clinical trials have explored different combinations of anticoagulation plus antiplatelet agents aimed at minimizing bleeding risk while preserving low thrombotic event rates. In general, shorter courses with fewer antithrombotic agents have been found to be effective, particularly when direct oral anticoagulants are combined with clopidogrel. Combined use of very low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin has also demonstrated benefit in atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary and peripheral artery disease. Use of proton pump inhibitor therapy while patients are taking multiple antithrombotic agents has the potential to further reduce upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk in select populations. Applying this evidence to patients with multiple thrombotic conditions will help to avoid costly and life-threatening adverse medication events.

### Bleeding after initiation of multiple antithrombotic drugs, including triple therapy, in atrial fibrillation patients following myocardial infarction and coronary intervention: a nationwide cohort study [^115Mf8z7]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainty remains over optimal antithrombotic treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation presenting with myocardial infarction and/or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We investigated the risk and time frame for bleeding following myocardial infarction/percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with atrial fibrillation according to antithrombotic treatment.

Methods and Results

Patients with atrial fibrillation and admitted with myocardial infarction or for percutaneous coronary intervention between 2000 and 2009 (11 480 subjects, mean age 75.6 years [SD ± 10.3], males 60.9%) were identified by individual level linkage of nationwide registries in Denmark. Fatal or nonfatal (requiring hospitalization) bleeding was determined according to antithrombotic treatment regimen: triple therapy (TT) with vitamin K antagonist (VKA)+aspirin+clopidogrel, VKA+antiplatelet, and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin+clopidogrel. We calculated crude incidence rates and adjusted hazard ratios by Cox regression models. Within 1 year, 728 bleeding events were recorded (6.3%); 79 were fatal (0.7%). Within 30 days, rates were 22.6, 20.3, and 14.3 bleeding events per 100 person-years for TT, VKA+antiplatelet, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. Both early (within 90 days) and delayed (90–360 days) bleeding risk with TT exposure in relation to VKA+antiplatelet was increased; hazard ratio 1.47 (1.04;2.08) and 1.36 (0.95;1.95), respectively. No significant difference in thromboembolic risk was observed for TT versus VKA+antiplatelet; hazard ratio, 1.15 (0.95;1.40).

Conclusions

High risk of bleeding is immediately evident with TT after myocardial infarction/percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with atrial fibrillation. A continually elevated risk associated with TT indicates no safe therapeutic window, and TT should only be prescribed after thorough bleeding risk assessment of patients.

Atrial fibrillation with elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing PCI — risk‑stratified antithrombotic sequencing is outlined as follows: under "Concerns about thrombotic risk prevailing", initiate "1 mo. Triple Therapy", allow "Triple Therapy up to 6 mo"., then continue "Dual Therapy with OAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor up to 12 mo"., followed by oral anticoagulant (OAC) alone; when "Concerns about high bleeding risk prevailing", use "1 mo. Triple Therapy" then "Dual Therapy with OAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor up to 12 mo". before OAC alone; for "(Patient very high bleeding risk)", use "Dual Therapy with OAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor up to 12 mo". followed by OAC alone. Bleeding risk assessment is supported as "Bleeding risk can be estimated using HAS-BLED score; correct modifiable bleeding risk factors", and long‑term monotherapy is consistent with "After 1 year it is reasonable to maintain OAC alone".

PCI with oral anticoagulation — preprocedural management is outlined as follows: For patients on a VKA presenting with ACS without ST-segment elevation who do not need urgent angiography, it may be necessary to bridge with unfractionated heparin or LMWH as the INR tapers; for those on a DOAC, there is likely no value in bridging. All patients should receive aspirin 162 to 325 mg preferably prior to the catheterization procedure. A loading dose of a P2Y12i should be given in the preprocedural period; because clopidogrel is the recommended agent in these patients, a 600-mg loading dose would be used.

### Safety and efficacy of dual vs. triple antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation following percutaneous coronary intervention: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^11393AiZ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

In the last several years, a number of randomized trials, have attempted to evaluate the strategy of dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT) vs. TAT in this patient population with DAT defined as a combination of one antiplatelet agent and an anticoagulant. In aggregate, studies have suggested reduction in bleeding by almost half in patients on DAT compared with TAT. These results are complemented by similar incidence of thrombo-embolic and MACE between the two groups. A major criticism for all the randomized trials is that none of them is sufficiently powered to assess thrombo-embolic (efficacy) outcomes. To reduce the selection bias introduced by observational data and to enhance the power for assessment of efficacy outcomes, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of Phase 3, randomized trials examining DAT vs. TAT in patients with AF, following PCI with inclusion of the most recently published Randomized Evaluation of Dual Antithrombotic Therapy With Dabigatran vs. Triple Therapy With Warfarin in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (RE-DUAL PCI) trial, which is the largest of all the trials on this topic to date.

### Meta-analysis comparing dual versus single antiplatelet therapy in combination with antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation [^111VS8a2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The coexistence of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease is commonly found in clinical practice. The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy in combination with antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were systematically evaluated for articles published up to October 31, 2017. The risk ratios (RR) were extracted from each study. Pooled estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by a fixed or random-effects model. Eight studies involving a total of 10,861 patients with atrial fibrillation were included in this meta-analysis. Five thousand sixty-six participants received dual antiplatelet therapy together with warfarin or new oral anticoagulation (triple antithrombotic therapy, TT) and 5,795 participants received single antiplatelet therapy together with warfarin or new oral anticoagulation (dual antithrombotic therapy). TT was associated with a significantly higher incidence of all (RR 1.45, p < 0.001) and major (RR 1.77, p < 0.001) bleeding events, but no difference with regard to stroke, in-stent thrombosis, major adverse cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality rate. In conclusion, as compared to TT, dual antithrombotic therapy is equally effective in reducing stroke, in-stent thrombosis, major adverse cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality rate, but shows beneficial effect in reducing overall bleeding incidence in atrial fibrillation patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention.

### The role of triple antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^114M2bXY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus clopidogrel forms the backbone of secondary prevention in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), oral anticoagulation (OAC) is superior to antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. Patients with AF who undergo PCI or have an ACS event therefore have an indication for both OAC and DAPT, so-called triple antithrombotic therapy. However, observational analyses have shown that the annual rate of major bleeding on triple therapy exceeds 10%. For this reason, five major randomized clinical trials have compared double antithrombotic therapy with OAC and a P2Y 12 inhibitor versus triple therapy in patients with AF who underwent PCI or had an ACS event. Each of the trials showed that double antithrombotic therapy reduced the rate of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared with triple therapy and was non-inferior for prevention of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In the one trial that directly compared warfarin with a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), apixaban reduced the rate of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared with warfarin and was non-inferior with respect to prevention of ischemic events. As a result of these trials, consensus guidelines recommend that patients with AF who undergo PCI or have an ACS event should be treated with triple antithrombotic therapy (OAC + P2Y 12 inhibitor + aspirin) for 7 days or less, followed by double antithrombotic therapy (OAC + P2Y 12 inhibitor) for 6 to 12 months.

DISCUSSION

In the largest contemporary analysis of practice patterns in anticoagulation and antiplatelet use following PCI in patients with AF to date, we found that > 15% of patients with AF were prescribed double therapy immediately on day 1 following PCI rather than undergoing a short course of triple therapy. Immediate transition to double therapy was associated with similar in‐hospital mortality, major bleeding, ICH, and NACEs compared with those receiving an initial course of triple therapy post‐PCI, although we did observe a signal for a slightly higher incidence of stent thrombosis (absolute difference 0.3%) in those transitioning to a single antiplatelet agent on day 1 post‐PCI. This higher risk appeared to be driven by patients with STEMI. Although an immediate double therapy approach appears safe in select patients, randomized controlled trials are required to definitively answer this question.

All randomized trials comparing double and triple therapy to date have mandated a short course of triple therapy before transitioning to double therapy, with most requiring at least 30 days. The AUGUSTUS (Antithrombotic Therapy After Acute Coronary Syndrome or PCI in Atrial Fibrillation) trial was the only exception, with an average triple therapy duration of 6.5 ± 4.1 days. Although the AUGUSTUS trial was not powered to assess for coronary ischemic events, it did report more of these events in the double therapy group, a trend seen in other trials as well. Our study is the first to investigate outcomes in patient with AF started immediately on double therapy following PCI, finding that > 15% receive this therapeutic approach in contemporary clinical practice, despite the lack of randomized trials testing this strategy.

Although statistically nonsignificant, nearly all the point estimates in our study favored an initial course of triple therapy, and more studies will be needed to examine whether such concern is valid. We observed a small but statistically significant increase in stent thrombosis among those receiving immediate double therapy, driven by a difference in patients with STEMI. This difference was preserved even after IPTW was performed, suggesting stronger evidence. A trend toward increased risk of stent thrombosis in patients receiving double therapy was observed in some, but not all, randomized trials on this topic. However, meta‐analyses have found that the modest increase in ischemic risk is generally outweighed by the significant reduction in bleeding risk. This suggests that the highest risk subgroup of patients, such as those presenting with STEMI, may benefit from an initial course of triple therapy before transitioning to double therapy.

### Contemporary use and clinical significance of initial triple versus double therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention for myocardial infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112YX8Z1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have traditionally received triple therapy (dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation). More recent randomized trial evidence supports a strategy of double therapy (anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet agent), albeit after a brief triple therapy course. The safety of initiating double therapy immediately post-PCI remains unclear.

Methods and Results

This study analyzed real-world prescribing patterns and outcomes of immediate double therapy versus initial triple therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation post-PCI using the Vizient Clinical Database. Patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI for myocardial infarction (2016–2023) were categorized into 2 groups: triple therapy (aspirin, P2Y12 [purinergic receptor P2Y, G-protein coupled, 12 protein] inhibitor, and anticoagulant) or double therapy (anticoagulant and 1 antiplatelet agent) on day 1 post-PCI. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included stent thrombosis, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and net clinical adverse events. Multivariable logistic regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to compare outcomes. Among 29226 patients, 16.3% received immediate double therapy on day 1 post-PCI, whereas 83.7% received triple therapy. Adjusted analyses showed no significant differences in in-hospital mortality (9.4% versus 9.2%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.05 [95% CI, 0.93–1.18]), major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or net clinical adverse events. However, immediate double therapy was associated with higher odds of stent thrombosis (1.1% versus 0.8%; aOR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.08–2.03]), particularly in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (2.0% versus 1.3%; aOR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.001–2.13]).

Conclusions

Immediate double therapy post-PCI is frequently used and appears safe for most patients with atrial fibrillation. Further studies are needed to identify high-risk subgroups, including those with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, who may benefit from an initial short course of triple therapy.

ACC Expert Consensus — Combination anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet therapy (APT) emphasizes bleeding risk mitigation by therapy selection and dosing, stating that preference is given to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for most patients because of the lower risk of major, intracranial, and fatal bleeding, and that even if patients are on a VKA prior to PCI, we prefer switching to a DOAC prior to hospital discharge.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) complicating acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — In patients with AF and an increased risk for stroke who undergo PCI, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in combination with antiplatelet therapy (APT) to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding (1 A). In most patients with AF who take oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI, early discontinuation of aspirin (1–4 wk) and continuation of dual antithrombotic therapy with OAC and a P2Y12 inhibitor is preferred over triple therapy (OAC, P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin) to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding (1 A).

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with antithrombotic therapy — patients are usually treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 12 months. If it has been ≤ 12 months since the ACS, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12 inhibitor (P2Y12i) (with preference given to clopidogrel), and start an OAC (with preference given to a DOAC). If it has been > 12 months since the ACS, APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an OAC alone. For patients at high bleeding risk and low ischemic risk, shorter durations of APT can be considered. At the clinician's discretion, selected patients felt to be at higher thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk may continue single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) (aspirin 81 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily) beyond 12 months while on an OAC.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the standard of care for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and a treatment option for those with stable ischemic heart disease. 1, 2, 3 Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor is mandatory after PCI to prevent ischemic events, including stent thrombosis (ST), but this comes at the price of an increased risk of bleeding complications. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 The trade‐off of thrombotic and bleeding complications is even more challenging when a patient undergoing PCI has a requirement for long‐term oral anticoagulation therapy, such as atrial fibrillation (AF). 9, 10 It is estimated that ≈20% to 30% of patients with AF presents with SIHD, and AF coexists in up to 7% to 10% of those undergoing PCI. 11 Because the mechanisms underpinning coronary ischemic events and ST are largely different from those responsible for cardioembolic stroke in patients with AF, both antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy are indicated in the context of AF‐PCI. 2, 3, 12, 13, 14 Unfortunately, the combination of DAPT and oral anticoagulation, also known as triple antithrombotic therapy, is associated with a high rate of fatal and nonfatal bleeding complications. 15

Results

Among the 598 consecutive AF patients enrolled in the registry, 132 were on DOAC at hospital admission: 72 (54.6%) underwent PCI without pauses in DOAC treatment (UDOAC group) and in the remaining 60 (45.4%) patients the DOAC was stopped before the procedure (IDOAC group). In this latter group, the median time from the last DOAC assumption to PCI was 24 (IQR: 24–48) hours. The different types and dosages of DOACs in the two groups and the median time intervals from the last DOAC assumption to PCI are detailed in figure 1.

Figure 1
Different types and dosages of DOACs at hospital admission for patients in UDOAC and IDOAC groups and hours of DOAC interruption before PCI in IDOAC group. Dark blue: full dose (150 mg/twice daily dabigatran; 20 mg/od rivaroxaban; 5 mg/twice daily apixaban; 60 mg/od edoxaban); light blue: reduced dose (110 mg/twice daily dabigatran; 15 mg/once daily rivaroxaban; 2.5 mg/twice daily apixaban; 30 mg/odonce daily edoxaban). DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; IDOAC, interrupted direct oral anticoagulant; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; UDOAC, uninterrupted direct oral anticoagulant.

Clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in table 1. Patients in the UDOAC group were significantly younger and presented more frequently a diagnosis of STEMI at discharge compared with patients in the IDOAC group. The mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 3.8 ± 1.7 and 3.9 ± 1.3 (p = 0.89), while the HAS-BLED score was 2.5 ± 1.0 and 2.5 ± 0.9 (p = 0.96), in UDOAC and IDOAC groups, respectively. At the time of admission, 14 (10.6%) patients were receiving acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 5 (3.8%) a dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), in addition to a DOAC.

### Vitamin K antagonist vs direct oral anticoagulants with antiplatelet therapy in dual or triple therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention or acute coronary syndrome in atrial fibrillation: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111P8esx]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

While RCT studying the association of DOAC and antiplatelet agents in AF patients undergoing PCI consistently showed a greater safety profile of DOAC over VKA, none was powered to assess efficacy thrombotic endpoints. Patients with AF are at higher risk of thromboembolic events compared to those without AF. The risk of myocardial infarction in such patients is also about twice higher 20 and increases with the use of PCI 21 as compared to those without AF. Our pooled meta‐analysis supports comparable efficacy of DOAC vs VKA in this setting. Additionally, dual therapy using a DOAC and one antiplatelet agent — mostly clopidogrel — was shown to be safer than and as effective as dual or triple therapy using VKA. There rates of stent thrombosis were similar between studied arms and very low in the included studies, possibly because of the use of newer generation drug‐eluting‐stent and the limited proportion of PCI for ST‐elevation myocardial infarction. 22, 23 Such characteristics may have blunted a difference between DOAC and the possibly more potent anticoagulation by VKA. On the other hand, major bleeding associated with VKA and triple therapy may lead to antithrombotic treatment interruption and in turn promote ischemic events. 24 Bleeding can reduce oxygen delivery to the myocardium and promote platelet activation. 25 Major bleeding is associated with an increased risk of recurrent ischemic events including myocardial infarction and stroke in ACS patients. 17, 19 Consequently, by reducing bleeding complications, the use of DOAC may have led to reduced ischemic events too. The same consideration applies to dual therapy which showed comparable thromboembolic events rates. This is in concordance with results of a large registry and a previous meta‐analysis that include dual therapy with VKA. 26, 27 Unlike other studies included in our analysis, there was an important 50% reduction of the risk of stroke with apixaban compared to VKA in the AUGUSTUS trial. 13 This may be explained by the use of the approved dose of apixaban tested in the pivotal trial for stroke prevention, 9 unlike the doses of rivaroxaban (15 or 5 mg per day) and dabigatran 110 mg used in PIONEER AF‐PCI and RE‐DUAL PCI trials, respectively. 11, 12 In absence of a head to head comparison, the relative efficacy of DOAC on the prevention of stroke is not known. Hence, a dose effect may explain the heterogeneity found in our analysis for stroke. Concordantly our subgroup analysis and exploratory analysis comparing lower vs higher doses of rivaroxaban and dabigatran, showed a trend toward higher risks of ischemic events including stroke and stent thrombosis in association with lower doses. Hence, our analysis not only supports the preferential use of approved doses of apixaban in AF patients following PCI or ACS as assessed in the AUGUSTUS trial, but also higher doses of rivaroxaban (15 mg) and dabigatran (150 mg) in absence of high bleeding risk.

### Contemporary use and clinical significance of initial triple versus double therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention for myocardial infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113yL7od]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Research Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of in‐hospital morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Historically, patients with AF who undergo PCI were treated with dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation, known as triple therapy. However, triple therapy increases bleeding risk, and multiple randomized trials have since shown the superiority of double therapy (anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet therapy) over triple therapy with regard to safety profile. Notably, these trials mandated a short duration of triple therapy before dropping the second antiplatelet agent in the double therapy arm. For example, landmark randomized trials investigating double versus triple therapy in this population transitioned from triple to double therapy anywhere from 6 to 30 days after PCI. Given this heterogeneity, there is no current consensus on how long to wait before transitioning from triple to double therapy after PCI. Some clinicians may skip this short course of triple therapy and immediately transition to double therapy post‐PCI, despite the lack of randomized trial evidence supporting this practice. The prevalence and safety of this untested approach are unknown. We aimed to use real‐world data to understand the in‐hospital prescribing patterns and clinical impact of immediate double therapy versus an initial course of triple therapy in patients with AF post‐PCI.

Warfarin

The addition of standard‐dose warfarin to DAPT with clopidogrel after ACS has been assessed only in small registries that showed unacceptable increases in bleeding. Warfarin is the most commonly used vitamin K antagonist, which inhibits the production of vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and, to a lesser extent, proteins C and S. This leads to a dose‐ and time‐dependent anticoagulation effect that requires close monitoring. 12 A registry of 40 812 ACS patients treated with multiple different regimens revealed a 3‐fold increase in bleeding with TT comprising warfarin, clopidogrel, and aspirin compared with DAPT. 13

The WOEST (What Is the Optimal Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary Stenting) open‐label randomized controlled trial compared dual antithrombotic therapy (warfarin and clopidogrel) with TT (warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) in patients undergoing PCI with an indication for anticoagulation, mainly atrial fibrillation. 14 A third of patients had ACS. TT significantly increased bleeding compared with dual therapy (44.4% versus 19.4%; 95% CI, 0.26–0.50; P < 0.0001) and increased the risk of the composite of all‐cause death, MI, stroke, TVR, and stent thrombosis, driven by an increase in all‐cause mortality (6.3% versus 2.5%, P = 0.027). Consequently, the ESC guidelines on myocardial revascularization and the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend reserving TT with warfarin and DAPT to a short period after PCI in those with an indication for anticoagulation. 9, 15

### Anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategies used in Sweden in patients with myocardial infarction and concomitant atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^111mGeqU]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal antithrombotic therapy and its duration, whether triple therapy with dual antiplatelets plus oral anticoagulant (OAC), or dual antithrombotic therapy with an antiplatelet plus OAC, is uncertain for patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

Patients registered in SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for enhancement and development of evidence-based care in heart disease evaluated according to recommended therapies) for their first MI between 2011 and 2021 with a history or new-onset AF were included (n = 26574). Linkage between SWEDEHEART and Swedish administrative health databases was performed, and pseudonymised data analysed.

Results

Over time, OAC use at discharge after MI tripled from 27% in 2011 to 77% in 2021, with direct OACs (DOACs) largely replacing warfarin, predominantly in combination with a single antiplatelet. The strongest factors for initiating OAC therapy were the performance of coronary angiography (OR 1.53 (1.40–1.68)), and percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 1.49 (1.39–1.61)). However, the year of the MI was the most predictive variable associated with OAC initiation, with an OR of 9.31 (7.92–10.95) in 2021 compared with 2011. The clinical factors associated with lower likelihood of OAC initiation were dementia, liver disease, cancer and ST-elevation MI (STEMI) versus non-STEMI.

Conclusions

Use of OAC has increased over the years in patients with MI and concurrent AF, primarily driven by the increased adoption of DOACs. Additionally, there has been a shift in antithrombotic combinations, with most patients in recent years receiving DOAC in combination with a single antiplatelet, reflecting the nationwide implementation of recent evidence and guidelines. However, significant variation in antithrombotic therapy strategies remains.

### Challenges in oral antiplatelet therapy: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^111irwMf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) poses unique challenges to cardiologists because short- and long-term therapeutic plans occur rapidly and often with limited information. Dual oral antiplatelet therapy is a mainstay of treatment, although limitations exist for all agents. Simple algorithms will improve prompt use of these medications in emergency room settings, although simplicity may not be possible for high-risk patient populations, especially those with an increased risk of bleeding. Caution is therefore warranted against the usual process of generalization of clinical trial results to the entire spectrum of patients with STEMI. This concern is especially important for those at highest risk for bleeding, where high-dose clopidogrel or short- or long-term prasugrel may carry significant risks. Maximizing the efficacy and safety of long-term oral antiplatelet therapy requires individualization of therapy, heightened clinical judgement, and caution.

### Triple therapy in hospitalized patients: facts and controversies [^116G916a]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The use of triple therapy (warfarin plus dual antiplatelet therapy) has increased in recent years due to an aging population with a higher risk for atrial fibrillation, as well as the increased use of coronary stents for acute coronary syndromes. Triple therapy confers a higher bleeding risk than either warfarin or dual antiplatelet therapy alone. However, warfarin alone is inadequate for patients with indications for triple therapy because of an unacceptable risk of stent thrombosis, and dual antiplatelet therapy is inferior to warfarin for the prevention of ischemic strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical valves, or intraventricular thrombosis. Hospitalists face the challenge of balancing the aforementioned risks; the optimal management of these patients requires knowledge of the relevant literature and expertise. In this paper, we review the current literature on antiplatelet and anticoagulant combinations in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary stents in order to improve adherence to published guidelines and to reduce the risk of bleeding.

### Decision support intervention and anticoagulation for emergency department atrial fibrillation… [^117VgPSQ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Intervention Physician education, facility-specific audit and feedback, and access to decision support, which identified eligible patients and recommended shared decision-making, anticoagulation initiation, and timely follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was a composite of anticoagulation on discharge or within 30 days. A primary intention-to-treat analysis and a secondary per-protocol analysis were performed. Multivariable analyses adjusted for intervention and exposure months with random effects, accounting for clustering by facility and patient. There was no statistically significant change in initiation of anticoagulation associated with the intervention. Decision support was used for 217 eligible case patients and was associated with a statistically significant change in anticoagulation initiation when compared with 599 patients for whom decision support was not used. Emergency departments were staffed by emergency medicine residency-trained, board-certified physicians. During the study period, treating physicians had access to a standard discharge order set for AFF OACs, which recommended dabigatran, on the system's pharmacy formulary, as the first-line OAC if not contraindicated. Care of patients taking OACs was managed by a regional pharmacy-led, telephone-based anticoagulation service using structured protocols.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and coronary artery disease (CAD) epidemiology and antithrombotic therapy risks are highlighted: Approximately one in four individuals will develop AF during their lifetime, and AF increases the risk of stroke 4- to 5-fold and accounts for 15% to 20% of ischemic strokes; CAD occurs in roughly 25% to 35% of patients with AF. Among patients on a chronic oral anticoagulant (OAC) with CAD, they are 7 times more likely to have a separate indication for concomitant antiplatelet therapy (APT) than those without CAD, and approximately 10% of patients with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have concomitant AF. VTE is common with an overall incidence estimated to be 1 to 2 per 1,000 person-years. Combined antithrombotic therapy increases bleeding risk: the addition of single APT to an OAC increases bleeding ≥ 20% to 60%, the addition of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to an OAC increases risk 2- to 3-fold, and the risk of major bleeding with triple therapy can be as high as 2.2% at 1 month and 4% to 12% at 1 year; major bleeding is associated with an up to 5-fold increased risk of death following an acute coronary syndrome.

### Role and timing of aspirin therapy following PCI in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116N2dBc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), both anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor) are indicated. However, this "triple" antithrombotic therapy is associated with high rates of bleeding. Finding the right balance of reducing ischemic risk and protecting coronary stents from restenosis while not increasing bleeding risk is difficult. In the past 5 years, 6 randomized clinical trials have shown the benefit of dropping aspirin from the triple therapy regimen to create "dual" therapy (oral anticoagulants and P2Y 12 inhibitors alone) with reductions in bleeding without a significant increase in ischemic events. Because of small trends toward higher risk of stent thrombosis, especially in higher risk patients with acute coronary syndromes, current recommendations call for dual therapy as the "default" regimen, but that risk stratification be used to help inform the decision on potentially using a brief period of triple therapy in selected high ischemic risk patients. For long-term therapy (after one year post-PCI), recent studies have found oral anticoagulation alone without any antiplatelet therapy has a favorable benefit risk ratio. Thus, while dropping aspirin at varying times post-PCI has become an attractive strategy in many patient groups, careful patient selection and individualized assessment of the risk:benefit balance is warranted.

### Benefit and risk of adding rivaroxaban in patients with coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113c6pQ4]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Antiplatelet agents are the cornerstone of secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Guidelines recommend lifelong use of single antiplatelet therapy in all patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) for 12 months. 1 Despite the adherence to recommended antiplatelet therapy (APT), 12.2% of patients with SCAD and 18.3% of patients with ACS experience recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). 2 There is evidence that anticoagulation is effective in reducing ischaemic events in ACS during the acute phase and that the combination with platelet inhibitors is more effective than either treatment alone. 3, 4

Early meta‐analyses revealed adding direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) to APT in ACS after the acute phase could reduce the risk of ischemic events at the cost of a higher risk of bleeding. 5, 6 However, with the results of the ATLAS ACS 2‐TIMI 51 trial, 7 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily for non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction and ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients after the acute phase. 8 Subsequently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved rivaroxaban for the prevention of recurrent adverse cardiovascular events in patients with SCAD according to the results of the COMPASS trial. 9

Nonetheless, recently meta‐analyses demonstrated the addition of rivaroxaban to APT regimen was effective in patients with CAD, but the safety outcome was doubtful. 10, 11, 12 Interestingly, Chiarito et al 13 found the risk–benefit profile of DOAC appears unfavorable in patients with NSTE‐ACS, whereas DOAC in addition to APT might represent an attractive option for patients with STEMI. Therefore, we conducted a meta‐analysis to evaluate the benefit and risk of adding rivaroxaban in patients with CAD and focusing on treatment efficacy and safety stratified by different baseline clinical presentations.

### Aspirin-free strategy for percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with oral anticoagulation: prespecified subgroup analysis from the STOPDAPT-3 trial [^113GcazH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) was superior to clopidogrel plus aspirin for prevention of thrombotic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, triple therapy with OAC on top of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has been given just after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, triple therapy with DAPT plus vitamin K antagonist (VKA) as compared with dual therapy with clopidogrel plus VKA was associated with higher risk of bleeding events without reducing thrombotic events in the WOEST (What Is the Optimal Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Stenting) trial. In the meta‐analysis, VKA‐based triple therapy was associated with higher risk of bleeding, including major and intracranial hemorrhages, as compared with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) based dual therapy. However, the lower risk of bleeding events in DOAC‐based dual therapy compared with triple therapy was counterbalanced by a higher risk of stent thrombosis even with triple therapy within a few days or up to 2 weeks at the longest in the dual therapy group. In the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 1 week of triple therapy followed by DOAC plus single antiplatelet therapy was recommended as the default strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation. Triple therapy for longer than 1 week and up to 1 month was recommended (Class IIa) in patients with high ischemic risk. Therefore, optimal duration of triple therapy within 1 month after PCI is still a matter of debate.

Recently, the STOPDAPT‐3 (Short and Optimal Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy‐3) trial has demonstrated that an aspirin‐free strategy compared with the standard DAPT strategy failed to reduce major bleeding at 1 month after PCI, with a signal suggesting increased coronary events such as definite or probable subacute stent thrombosis and any unplanned coronary revascularization. In this study, we conducted a prespecified subgroup analysis based on the use of OAC within 7 days before PCI in the STOPDAPT‐3 trial to elucidate the safety and efficacy of an aspirin‐free strategy relative to the DAPT strategy within 1 month after PCI in patients treated with OAC.

### Meta-analysis comparing the safety and efficacy of dual versus triple antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^112VW7hm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the effectiveness and safety of dual compared with triple antithrombotic therapy are a matter of debate, especially when considering the prevention of end points at low incidence, such as myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, or mortality. This study-level meta-analysis included 4 controlled randomized trials and 6,036 patients with a clinical indication to chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) after PCI, mainly for atrial fibrillation. Patients receiving dual therapy with a single antiplatelet agent, essentially a P2Y 12 inhibitor, plus OAC were compared with those treated with triple therapy (aspirin, a P2Y 12 inhibitor, and OAC). The incidence of the following outcomes was evaluated: Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major and minor bleeding, MI, stent thrombosis, stroke, cardiovascular, and all-cause death. Occurrence of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major bleeding was significantly lower in patients treated with dual therapy: 1.97% versus 3.53% in those on triple therapy (odds ratios 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.78, p = 0.0007); rates of minor bleeding were also decreased in the former (57% relative reduction). With dual therapy, there was not a statistically significant difference in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (3.81% vs 4.01%, p = 0.37 and 1.62% vs 2.02%, p = 0.42, respectively). Incidence of MI (3.25% vs 2.78%, p = 0.61), definite stent thrombosis (0.92% vs 0.66%, p = 0.46), and stroke (1.28% vs 1.32%, p = 0.85) was similar in the 2 treatment strategies. In patients with long-term indication to OAC after PCI, compared with triple therapy, dual antithrombotic therapy reduces bleeding, without an excess in thromboembolic and ischemic cardiac events.

### Anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategies used in Sweden in patients with myocardial infarction and concomitant atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^115WsLcK]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with AF undergoing PCI for acute or stable coronary artery disease, data suggest that a SAPT+OAC strategy is preferable to DAPT+OAC due to a reduced risk of bleeding. In fact, SAPT rather than DAPT has been the common regimen of antiplatelet therapy in combination with OACs since 2013 when the WOEST (What is the Optimal antiplatElet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with oral anticoagulation and coronary StenTing) trial demonstrated a significant reduction in bleeding complications without increasing thrombotic events with dual therapy including clopidogrel rather than triple therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients with OAC undergoing PCI. The PIONEER AF-PCI (OPen-Label, Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study ExplorIng TwO TreatmeNt StratEgiEs of Rivaroxaban and a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy in Subjects with Atrial Fibrillation who Undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) trial presented in 2016, observed a lower bleeding risk with rivaroxaban combined with SAPT (a P2Y 12 inhibitor), compared with triple therapy with either rivaroxaban or warfarin, without increasing the thromboembolic risk. Similarly, the RE-DUAL PCI (Randomized Evaluation of Dual Antithrombotic Therapy with Dabigatran versus Triple Therapy with Warfarin in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) trial in 2017 showed lower bleeding risks with a dual antithrombotic therapy including dabigatran plus SAPT (a P2Y 12 inhibitor) compared with triple therapy with warfarin, a P2Y 12 inhibitor and aspirin. In the AUGUSTUS trial published in 2019, patients with AF receiving P2Y 12 inhibition, with or without aspirin, following a recent acute coronary syndrome or PCI, experienced fewer bleeding events with apixaban compared with warfarin, without an increase in ischaemic events. Consistent with these findings, the ENTRUST-AF PCI (EdoxabaN TReatment versUS VKA in paTients with AF undergoing PCI) trial in 2019 showed that a regimen including edoxaban and a P2Y 12 inhibitor was non-inferior to triple therapy, in patients with AF and PCI for acute or stable coronary artery disease in terms of bleeding. Collectively, these studies show that a SAPT+OAC strategy seems to be a safer option in terms of bleeding risks than DAPT+OAC, without an increased risk of thromboembolic events, although the studies were not large enough to conclusively test the risk of thromboembolic outcomes. These findings have also resulted in updated clinical practice guidelines and consensus documents since then recommending triple therapy for a short period of time following an MI and/or PCI, followed by SAPT+OAC therapy.

### Is percutaneous coronary intervention safe during uninterrupted direct oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndromes? [^111bRmh9]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the safety of UDOAC in patients undergoing PCI. Therefore, the recommendations on periprocedural management of DOACs were generated from pharmacokinetic studies and evidence about the effectiveness of vitamin K antagonists' interruption before elective or urgent PCI. In a retrospective analysis of 523 patients (70% with AF) on long-term warfarin therapy referred for PCI in seven Finland centres, major bleeding events were more common in those who interrupted warfarin compared with those who did not. In a subanalysis of the What is the Optimal antiplElet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with oral anticoagulation and coronary StenTing study, uninterrupted therapy with warfarin was not associated with an increase of bleeding or MACE at 1 year compared with a strategy of warfarin interruption and bridging therapy before PCI. Accordingly, in a meta-analysis of uninterrupted strategy when compared with interrupted strategy, uninterrupted therapy with warfarin was found to be at least as safe as interrupted oral anticoagulation in patients undergoing coronary angiography with or without PCI. Moreover, in the Management of patients with Atrial Fibrillation undergoing Coronary Artery Stenting trial, the number of access site bleedings and the length of hospital stay after PCI was higher in patients who interrupted warfarin compared with patients who did not interrupt anticoagulation therapy. A high incidence of procedural complications, including access site bleedings and a prolonged time to PCI were also seen in our cohort of patients on long-term DOACs.

Since DOAC regimens became available for clinical use in AF, few studies have been conducted in order to assess the safety of an UDOAC strategy for cardiac procedures such as pulmonary vein ablation, electrical cardioversion, coronary angiography or elective PCI. In our study, we first demonstrated the safety of UDOAC in ACS using current PCI strategies, as suggested by the use of radial access and DES in nearly the totality of patients enrolled and the scarce rate of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa during the PCI. These measures are recommended by consensus documents and international guidelinesin order to reduce the risk of bleeding and minimise the duration of DAPTand may partially explain the comparable risk for bleeding events between UDOAC and IDOAC observed in our analysis. Notably, patients who received PCI during UDOAC were more frequently diagnosed with STEMI resulting in shorter times to PCI and a lower incidence of multivessel coronary artery disease than patients in the IDOAC group. Our findings further corroborate the safety data in terms of bleeding of the UDOAC strategy.

### Safety and efficacy of double antithrombotic therapy with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1127GaoY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The pooled analysis with reconstructed patient‐level data corroborates the evidence from the trial‐level meta‐analyses and gives insights on the distribution of the bleeding reduction with NOAC+SAPT. Understandably, bleeding was mostly reduced during the first 6 months, when the proportion of triple therapy patients in the control group was higher than in the subsequent period. Trial‐level subgroup analyses demonstrated that the effect of NOAC+SAPT versus VKA+DAPT was consistent in different settings, including presence or absence of ACS. Moreover, the trial sequential analyses demonstrated that the evidence about the absence of significant differences in the composite ischemic outcome, even though not conclusive, are not likely to change with further studies and those supporting the superiority in terms of clinically significant bleedings of NOAC+SAPT against VKA+DAPT could be considered conclusive. These results strengthen new guidelines recommendations.

About antiplatelet drugs selection, the 2019 European Society of Cardiology Chronic Coronary Syndromes guidelines recommend (class IIb) that double therapy with more potent P2Y 12 inhibitors may be considered as an alternative to triple therapy with clopidogrel in patients with a moderate or high risk of ST. 3 A North American consensus document indicates that ticagrelor, but not prasugrel, may be considered in patients at high thrombotic but low bleeding risk and only in the context of a double therapy regimen. 10 Our subgroup analysis showed that the kind of P2Y 12 inhibitor did not affect significantly the efficacy and the safety of NOAC+SAPT against VKA+DAPT. However, only 7.4% of patients were treated with more potent antiplatelet drugs; this justifies the weak recommendation of ticagrelor and prasugrel from the guidelines and its limitation (due to their known stronger antiplatelet effect) to patients with higher risk of ST. Studies are warranted to better understand the safety and efficacy profiles of prasugrel and ticagrelor in a NOAC+SAPT regimen.

### Triple oral antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation and coronary artery stenting [^116Gy85J]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation affected by an acute coronary syndrome have indications for oral anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor after coronary artery stenting. The concurrent use of all 3 agents, termed triple oral antithrombotic therapy, significantly increases the risk of bleeding. To date, there is a lack of evidence on the proper combination and duration of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in patients with indications for both therapies. As such, care has been guided by expert opinion, and there is wide variation in clinician practice. In this review, the latest evidence on the risks and benefits of triple oral antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation after coronary artery stenting is summarized. We discuss the clinical risk scores useful in guiding the prediction of stroke, bleeding, and stent thrombosis. Additionally, we highlight where additional evidence is needed to determine the proper balance of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in this patient population.

### Direct oral anticoagulation for post-TAVI atrial fibrillation | NEJM resident 360… [^112Tibxz]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature From Pages to Practice Published October 27, 2021 Mr. Gannon is an 82-year-old man with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was admitted to the hospital and underwent successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation. However, he developed postprocedural atrial fibrillation and was started on metoprolol for rate-control management. The decision was made to initiate anticoagulation with warfarin. However, interns on the team asked whether direct oral anticoagulants would be an appropriate substitute to reduce risk of thromboembolism. For those with symptomatic aortic stenosis or asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, aortic valve replacement can reduce AVR can be achieved surgically or via transcatheter AVR, or more accurately referred to as transcatheter aortic valve implantation because the diseased native aortic value is not actually excised.

The choice of TAVI versus SAVR is based on individual patient characteristics including comorbidities, age, expected length of survival, vascular access, and patient preferences. But for patients with high or prohibitive surgical risk, TAVI can reduce mortality, symptomatic aortic stenosis, and hospitalization. Postoperative complications associated with TAVI include stroke, paravalvular leak, stent migration, conduction abnormalities, and iliofemoral complications. Recommendations for antithrombotic prophylaxis after TAVI include aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin for at least 3 months. The use of DOACs in patients with mechanical heart valves is contraindicated. However, the off-label use of DOACs in patients with bioprosthetic heart valves is increasingly common.

Patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement traditionally receive vitamin K antagonists because of the long history of warfarin use in patients with valve replacements and the inferiority of direct-acting oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in those with mechanical valves. In the industry-funded, multicenter, open-label ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial, researchers compared the safety and efficacy of the DOAC edoxaban and a VKA in this setting.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113USG8B]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without intracoronary stent — antithrombotic recommendations: For patients at intermediate to high risk of stroke (CHADS2 score of 1 or greater) who do not undergo intracoronary stent placement, we suggest, for the first 12 months, adjusted-dose VKA therapy (INR 2.0–3.0) plus single antiplatelet therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy or triple therapy (Grade 2C); after the first 12 months, antithrombotic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease. For patients at low risk of stroke (CHADS2 score of 0), we suggest dual antiplatelet therapy rather than adjusted-dose VKA therapy (INR 2.0–3.0) plus single antiplatelet therapy or triple therapy (Grade 2C); after the first 12 months, antithrombotic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease. We do not advocate the use of triple therapy in AF with ACS who do not receive an intracoronary stent, though patients placing a high value on MI and stroke reduction and a low value on avoiding bleeding may opt for an initial period of triple therapy (3–6 months) followed by warfarin plus aspirin.

3.4.2 Antiplatelet therapy

Antiplatelet therapy is an essential first‐line component of guideline‐recommended type 1 NSTEMI treatment, to inhibit platelet activation and thus reduce acute ischemic complications and prevent further atherothrombotic events. 1, 3 Dual antiplatelet therapy, consisting of a P2Y 12 inhibitor plus aspirin, is indicated for patients who are initially treated with either an early invasive or medical management strategy. 1, 2, 37, 38 Dual antiplatelet therapy guidelines support the use of the P2Y 12 inhibitor ticagrelor rather than clopidogrel in type 1 NSTEMI, regardless of whether early revascularization is performed, based on the results of the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) study. 37, 38, 39

Following successful recovery from the acute phase of an NSTEMI, patients remain at an increased risk of subsequent CV events and premature death. 40, 41, 42, 43 Current NSTEMI guidelines therefore recommend that dual antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y 12 inhibitor plus aspirin be continued for ≥ 12 months after the index date, after an assessment of the individual patient's ischemic and bleeding risk. 1, 3, 37, 38

Recommendations for antiplatelet therapy are more applicable to patients with type 1 NSTEMI, as intracoronary thrombosis is absent in patients with type 2 MI. 5 Furthermore, there is a lack of data on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with type 2 NSTEMI from either randomized controlled trials or observational studies. 44

3.4.3 Anticoagulant therapy

As with antiplatelet therapy, recommendations for anticoagulant treatment apply primarily to patients with type 1 MI because of the lack of atherothrombotic plaque rupture in type 2 MI. Administration of anticoagulants during the initial treatment of type 1 NSTEMI is effective in reducing ischemic events, and the combination of an anticoagulant and dual antiplatelet therapy during the acute phase is more effective for this than either treatment alone. 3 Treatment with an anticoagulant during the acute phase is therefore recommended for all patients with a type 1 NSTEMI, regardless of the initial management strategy. 1, 3 Unlike dual antiplatelet therapy, discontinuation of anticoagulants beyond the acute phase, for example, after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), should be considered in type 1 NSTEMI unless there is a compelling reason to continue. 1, 3 For information on the management of patients who have another condition prompting continuation of anticoagulation, please refer to recent studies such as PIONEER AF‐PCI, RE‐DUAL PCI, and AUGUSTUS. 45, 46, 47

### Postprocedural anticoagulation for specific therapeutic indications after revascularization for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (from the harmonizing outcomes with revascularization and stents in acute myocardial infarction trial) [^112rVMZj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Postprocedural anticoagulation (AC) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) may be administered for a number of specific therapeutic indications (e.g. atrial fibrillation or left ventricular thrombus). However, the safety and effectiveness of such post-PCI AC for specific indications are not well defined. Thus, we sought to study outcomes after postprocedural AC for specific indications in patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI in the Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial. Patients who underwent primary PCI for STEMI in the Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial were grouped according to whether they received specific indication AC. Adverse outcomes were assessed using propensity-adjusted multivariate analyses. After excluding patients who received post-PCI AC solely for routine prophylaxis, 410 patients (16.6%) received postprocedural AC for specific indications and 2,063 patients (83.4%) received no post-PCI AC. After propensity adjustment, use of postprocedural AC for specific indications was associated with higher rates of cardiac mortality, reinfarction, stent thrombosis, and major bleeding at 30 days compared with patients who received no AC post-PCI. In conclusion, in this large prospective study, use of postprocedural AC for specific indications after primary PCI for STEMI was independently associated with early rates of adverse ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Post-PCI AC for specific indications was also associated with worse outcomes from 30 days to 3 years. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal use of postprocedural AC after primary PCI in STEMI.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) antiplatelet management — this pathway is disproportionately focused on antiplatelet therapy (APT) after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation; bare metal stents are no longer the preferred choice, even in high bleeding-risk patients, and for those receiving a bare metal stent or balloon angioplasty alone, shorter durations of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (≤ 1 month) are feasible in stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), while in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) the duration of DAPT is the same irrespective of stent type; additionally, APT can usually be discontinued when anticoagulation (AC) is initiated, and although risk scores may help stratify thromboembolic and bleeding risk, overlapping and time-varying risks limit a generalized approach to treatment.

### Optimal delay time to initiate anticoagulation after AF-associated ischemic stroke… [^1169UHVM]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Is there an optimal day within the first 14 days to initiate anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant after atrial fibrillation–associated acute ischemic stroke. Findings In this phase 2, response-adaptive randomized clinical trial, none of the 4 groups met statistical criteria as the optimal day for treatment initiation. Group 1 had no ischemic events and the highest posterior probability of being optimal for treatment initiation. Meaning Although a clearly superior day to initiate use of a direct oral anticoagulant was not identified, the evidence suggests that initiating a direct oral anticoagulant earlier is better than later within the first 2 weeks after stroke due to atrial fibrillation. Importance Clinical practice guidelines recommend initiation of anticoagulation within 2 weeks after stroke with atrial fibrillation.

It is unknown whether there is an optimal starting day within the 14-day period that balances the risks of recurrent embolic events against serious hemorrhagic events. Objective To determine if there is an optimal delay time to initiate treatment with a direct oral anticoagulant after atrial fibrillation–related stroke that minimizes the risk of a composite outcome of ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Design, Setting, and Participants. This phase 2, pragmatic, response-adaptive randomized clinical trial was conducted between June 2017 and June 2023 at acute care hospitals in Texas and included patients who had a mild to moderate ischemic stroke with atrial fibrillation and were prescribed a direct oral anticoagulant within 2 weeks from stroke onset.

Intervention Within 3 to 4 days after atrial fibrillation–associated ischemic stroke, patients were randomized to a group for treatment start date with a direct oral anticoagulant for secondary stroke prevention. Conclusions and Relevance A clearly superior day to initiate use of a direct oral anticoagulant for secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation was not identified, but the evidence suggests that initiating use of a direct oral anticoagulant earlier is better than at later times within the first 2 weeks after stroke onset.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy versus oral anticoagulation plus dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and low-to-moderate thromboembolic risk undergoing coronary stenting: design of the MUSICA-2 randomized trial [^114y3b98]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the recommended therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) because it reduces the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is required after percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting (PCI-S). In patients with AF requiring PCI-S, the association of DAPT and OAC carries an increased risk of bleeding, whereas OAC therapy or DAPT alone may not protect against the risk of developing new ischemic or thromboembolic events.

Objective

The MUSICA-2 study will test the hypothesis that DAPT compared with triple therapy (TT) in patients with nonvalvular AF at low-to-moderate risk of stroke (CHADS2 score ≤ 2) after PCI-S reduces the risk of bleeding and is not inferior to TT for preventing thromboembolic complications.

Design

The MUSICA-2 is a multicenter, open-label randomized trial that will compare TT with DAPT in patients with AF and CHADS2 score ≤ 2 undergoing PCI-S. The primary end point is the incidence of stroke or any systemic embolism or major adverse cardiac events: death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or target vessel revascularization at 1 year of PCI-S. The secondary end point is the combination of any cardiovascular event with major or minor bleeding at 1 year of PCI-S. The calculated sample size is 304 patients.

Conclusions

The MUSICA-2 will attempt to determine the most effective and safe treatment in patients with nonvalvular AF and CHADS2 score ≤ 2 after PCI-S. Restricting TT for AF patients at high risk for stroke may reduce the incidence of bleeding without increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications.

5 Antithrombotic Therapy

The guidelines further delineate the antithrombotic therapy regimens that are appropriate for patients with and without indications for oral anticoagulation and present antiplatelet drug strategies designed to reduce bleeding risk in the first year after an ACS. For example, for patients with very high bleeding risk, 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT — P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin) may be feasible (IIb, B). In those with a lower bleeding risk, 3 months of such therapy may be considered. In general, 6 months of DAPT is reasonable (IIa, A), although optimal is 1 year of DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy, with the latter preferred. An alternative DAPT de‐escalation strategy involves a change from aspirin plus prasugrel or aspirin plus ticagrelor to aspirin plus clopidogrel. In patients who require oral anticoagulation, NOAC monotherapy is a Class 1 indication after a year of DAPT.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention — anticoagulation and antiplatelet timing: PCI in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) on ongoing uninterrupted non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) monotherapy is currently not recommended; in patients not on oral anticoagulant but on stable aspirin, clopidogrel may be given either prior to or during PCI with no apparent outcome differences, and given triple therapy (TAT) bleeding risk it may be considered to withhold the additional antiplatelet until PCI is indicated by diagnostic angiography. The time to effective platelet inhibition with oral clopidogrel is approximately 2 to 6 h depending on a 600 vs 300 mg loading dose, while intravenous cangrelor or aspirin has a nearly immediate effect; when oral pretreatment is chosen, pretreatment with both aspirin and clopidogrel should preferably include loading with 300 mg to reduce initial bleeding risk. For intraprocedural unfractionated heparin (UFH), doses as low as 30–50 IU/kg have been shown effective for preventing ischaemic PCI complications and should be preferred to limit bleeding risk.

NSTE-ACS including unstable angina and NSTEMI — In atrial fibrillation (AF) patients on oral anticoagulation (OAC) who develop non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), aspirin loading should be as in STEMI and clopidogrel is the P2Y12 inhibitor of choice; clopidogrel without aspirin cannot be recommended in the acute or periprocedural phase; pretreatment with P2Y12 receptor antagonists may be withheld until coronary angiography when an early invasive strategy within 24 h is planned; ticagrelor or prasugrel in combination with OAC may only be considered under certain circumstances; if parenteral therapy is needed, unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin should be given only as bailout or if INR < 2 in vitamin K antagonist (VKA) users while avoiding glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors; triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT) is the recommended initial treatment for the first month after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or an ACS in AF patients with high ischaemic and low bleeding risk; and an early invasive strategy within 24 h should be preferred among AF patients with moderate to high-risk NSTE-ACS to expedite treatment allocation and determine the optimal antithrombotic regimen.

### Managing antithrombotic therapy in patients with both atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease [^115P4CRA]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary heart disease (CHD) commonly occur together. Previous consensus guidelines were published before the wide availability of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and newer P2Y12 antiplatelet agents. We examine recent evidence to guide management in 3 categories of patients with AF and CHD: patients with stable CHD, nonstented patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, and patients with a coronary stent requiring dual-antiplatelet therapy.

Methods

We conducted a literature search by evaluation of PubMed and other data sources including international meeting reports. We critically reviewed recent clinical trial and relevant registry evidence to update European and US consensus documents.

Findings

Oral anticoagulation with warfarin or NOACs is required to prevent embolic stroke in AF, and antiplatelet therapy is insufficient for this purpose. Antiplatelet therapy using monotherapy with aspirin is the standard of care in stable CHD. Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel or a new P2Y12 inhibitor (dual-antiplatelet therapy) is needed to reduce coronary events after an acute coronary syndrome or after percutaneous coronary intervention. Combinations of these agents increase the risk of bleeding, and limited clinical trial evidence suggests that withdrawal of aspirin may reduce bleeding without increasing coronary events.

Implications

Available clinical trials and registries provide remarkably little evidence to guide difficult clinical decision making in patients with combined AF and CHD. In patients on triple antithrombotic therapy with vitamin K antagonists, aspirin, and clopidogrel, a single clinical trial indicates that withdrawal of aspirin may reduce bleeding risk without increasing the risk of coronary thrombosis. It is unclear whether this evidence applies to combinations of NOACs and newer P2Y12 inhibitors. Clinical trials of combinations of the newer antithrombotic agents are urgently needed to guide clinical care.

### Rivaroxaban in patients stabilized after a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: results from the ATLAS ACS-2-TIMI-51 trial (anti-Xa therapy to lower cardiovascular events in addition to standard therapy in subjects with acute coronary syndrome-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction-51) [^116xa1Yq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The present analysis reports on the pre-specified subgroup of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, in whom anticoagulant therapy has been of particular interest.

Background

In ATLAS ACS-2-TIMI-51 (Anti-Xa Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events in Addition to Standard Therapy in Subjects with Acute Coronary Syndrome-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction-51), rivaroxaban reduced cardiovascular events across the spectrum of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Methods

Seven thousand eight hundred seventeen patients in ATLAS ACS-2-TIMI 51 presented with a STEMI. After being stabilized (1 to 7 days), they underwent randomization to twice daily rivaroxaban 2.5 mg, rivaroxaban 5 mg, or placebo. Data are presented as 2-year Kaplan-Meier rates, and for intention-to-treat (ITT) and modified ITT (mITT) analyses.

Results

Among STEMI patients, rivaroxaban reduced the primary efficacy endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, compared with placebo (ITT: 8.4% vs. 10.6%, hazards ratio [HR]: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.97, p = 0.019; mITT: 8.3% vs. 9.7%, HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.03, p = 0.09). This reduction emerged by 30 days (ITT and mITT: 1.7% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.042) and was evident in analyses that included events while patients received background dual antiplatelet therapies (ITT: 7.9% vs. 11.9%, p = 0.010; mITT: 7.7% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.061). In terms of the individual doses, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg reduced cardiovascular death (ITT: 2.5% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.006; mITT: 2.2% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.006), which was not seen with 5 mg of rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban versus placebo increased non-coronary artery bypass grafting Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major bleeding (2.2% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.001) and intracranial hemorrhage (0.6% vs. 0.1%, p = 0.015) without a significant increase in fatal bleeding (0.2% vs. 0.1%, p = 0.51).

Conclusions

In patients with a recent STEMI, rivaroxaban reduced cardiovascular events. This benefit emerged early and persisted during continued treatment with background antiplatelet therapies. Rivaroxaban compared with placebo increased the rate of major bleeding, but there was no significant increase in fatal bleeding.

### Concomitant use of single antiplatelet therapy with edoxaban or warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: analysis from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI48 trial [^1142TBVD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Current guidelines recommend that low‐dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) and/or a P 2 Y12 antagonist may be given concurrently with an anticoagulant to prevent myocardial ischemic events and stroke in AF patients after coronary revascularization, a recent acute coronary syndrome or with high‐risk CAD. The associated increased risk of bleeding should be evaluated and efforts made to minimize it whenever possible. 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Also, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation guideline for secondary prevention in patients with AF and coronary or other atherosclerotic vascular disease recommends treatment with warfarin and low‐dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg daily). 14 However, for AF patients with stable coronary or peripheral arterial disease (ie, no acute events or revascularization for ≥ 12 months), oral anticoagulant therapy without antiplatelet therapy may be considered. 10, 16 In clinical practice, a combination of anticoagulant and dual antiplatelet therapy (triple antithrombotic therapy) may be administered, preferably for short periods in patients with AF who are at very high risk of a platelet‐driven event, such as patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome or stent implantation. 19 This increases the risk of serious bleeding and it should be reduced to double therapy (ie, an anticoagulant together with SAPT) whenever, or as soon as, possible.

The present report from the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial provides data on the relative efficacy and safety of combination antithrombotic therapy. At the time of enrollment, approximately one‐third of patients were receiving SAPT, usually aspirin. SAPT was discontinued in one quarter of these patients after randomization to anticoagulant therapy. SAPT was prescribed by the treating physician more commonly in patients with established CAD, diabetes, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and those who were therefore at higher risk of development of acute coronary syndromes than were patients without these comorbidities. SAPT administration was used most frequently in North America and less frequently elsewhere. This difference may be explained, at least in part, by the greater frequency of patients at high risk enrolled in North America.

We observed that the addition of SAPT to an anticoagulant (warfarin or edoxaban) was associated with a significantly greater risk of bleeding. However, the addition of SAPT did not modify the relative efficacy and safety of edoxaban as compared to warfarin. Notably, when compared to warfarin, both edoxaban regimens significantly reduced all forms of bleeding, including ICH and life‐threatening bleeding, both in patients who were as well as those who were not, receiving a SAPT.

Atrial fibrillation on OAC undergoing PCI — aspirin during hospitalization and short-term triple therapy: Low-dose aspirin is recommended for the duration of the hospitalization, and in general, the guidance states to recommend discontinuing it prior to/up on discharge in most patients; although the default approach is dual antiplatelet therapy, because the risk of stent-related thrombotic complications is greatest in the first month post-PCI, one may consider continuing aspirin 81 mg/day for 30 days (after which the patient should switch to an OAC and P2Y12 inhibitor) in those with high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk.

### Safety and efficacy of antithrombotic strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114L2smw]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The antithrombotic treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease, in particular with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), poses a significant treatment dilemma in clinical practice.

Objective

To study the safety and efficacy of different antithrombotic regimens using a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in this population.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials comparing antithrombotic regimens.

Study Selection

Four randomized studies were included (n = 10 026; WOEST, PIONEER AF-PCI, RE-DUAL PCI, and AUGUSTUS).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used in this systematic review and network meta-analysis between 4 regimens using a Bayesian random-effects model. A pre hoc statistical analysis plan was written, and the review protocol was registered at PROSPERO. Data were analyzed between November 2018 and February 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary safety outcome was Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding; secondary safety outcomes were combined TIMI major and minor bleeding, trial-defined primary bleeding events, intracranial hemorrhage, and hospitalization. The primary efficacy outcome was trial-defined major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); secondary efficacy outcomes were individual components of MACE.

Results

The overall prevalence of ACS varied from 28% to 61%. The mean age ranged from 70 to 72 years; 20% to 29% of the trial population were women; and most patients were at high risk for thromboembolic and bleeding events. Compared with a regimen of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) plus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; P2Y12 inhibitor plus aspirin), the odds ratios (ORs) for TIMI major bleeding were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.31–1.08) for VKA plus P2Y12 inhibitor, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.30–0.82) for non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOAC) plus P2Y12 inhibitor, and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.38–1.23) for NOAC plus DAPT. Compared with VKA plus DAPT, the ORs for MACE were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.60–1.46) for VKA plus P2Y12 inhibitor, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.71–1.47) for NOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.60–1.45) for NOAC plus DAPT.

Conclusions and Relevance

A regimen of NOACs plus P2Y12 inhibitor was associated with less bleeding compared with VKAs plus DAPT. Strategies omitting aspirin caused less bleeding, including intracranial bleeding, without significant difference in MACE, compared with strategies including aspirin. Our results support the use of NOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor as the preferred regimen post-percutaneous coronary intervention for these high-risk patients with AF. A regimen of VKA plus DAPT should generally be avoided.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in atrial fibrillation (AF) — post-PCI antiplatelet approach: Several randomized trials indicate that discontinuation of aspirin 1 to 4 weeks after PCI reduces bleeding in AF patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and an oral anticoagulant, with stent thrombosis analyses showing that 80% of events occurred within 30 days of PCI and randomization approximately 1 week after PCI in AUGUSTUS. For patients at high risk of stent thrombosis, aspirin for up to 30 days after PCI could be considered. Following aspirin discontinuation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be continued for at least 12 months after PCI, with earlier discontinuation possible in those with multiple bleeding risk factors.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112nDtHH]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without stent — comparative evidence and evidence gaps: Warfarin plus aspirin is associated with a significant reduction in risk of subsequent myocardial infarction and stroke vs aspirin alone after ACS, with MI relative risk 0.69 (95% CI, 0.54–0.88) and stroke relative risk 0.56 (95% CI, 0.39–0.82); point estimates are greater than those seen with clopidogrel plus aspirin vs aspirin alone (relative risk, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.89; and 0.86; 95% CI, 0.63–1.18 in CURE). There are no RCTs comparing warfarin plus single antiplatelet therapy to dual antiplatelet therapy, and no studies comparing warfarin plus aspirin to triple therapy in AF with recent ACS; triple therapy may not be associated with net clinical benefit compared with dual antiplatelet therapy unless patients are at substantially high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score of ≥ 2), and use would be appropriate only if the risk reduction in MI and stroke achieved by adding the second antiplatelet agent is greater than the increase in bleeding risk.

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: where are we now? [^115pBARY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To synthesize the literature and provide guidance to practitioners regarding double therapy (DT) and triple therapy (TT) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Data Sources

PubMed and MEDLINE (January 2000 to February 2018) were searched using the following terms: atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronary intervention, anticoagulation, dual-antiplatelet therapy, clopidogrel, aspirin, ticagrelor, prasugrel, and triple therapy.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The results included randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials and meta-analyses. Each study was reported based on study design, population, intervention, comparator, and key cardiovascular (CV) and bleeding outcomes.

Data Synthesis

A total of 15 studies were included in the review. The majority of studies evaluating DT and TT utilized clopidogrel and warfarin as components of the regimen, although there are emerging data with newer agents. Evidence purporting DT regimens to be equally effective in preventing CV events and improved safety profiles compared with TT regimens included populations with relatively low risk for recurrent CV events, and many of these studies were observational in nature. Overall, current evidence as well as American and European guidelines support the use of TT in patients with AF who require PCI for the least possible amount of time, depending on patient-specific factors involving bleeding and thrombosis.

Conclusions

In the majority of patients with AF who require PCI, TT should be used for the shortest period of time possible. DT regimens may be used in patients requiring PCI who have low risk for thrombosis and/or high bleeding risk.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents in acute coronary syndromes: what is the current status and what does the future hold? [^115oxztc]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Mortality and morbidity in acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), caused principally by plaque erosion or rupture leading to thrombus formation and myocardial ischemia, have been reduced by a combination of antithrombotic agents (antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants) and early revascularization. Aspirin is the foundation antiplatelet agent. New P2Y12 receptor inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor) have clear benefits compared with clopidogrel for dual antiplatelet therapy, and cangrelor or vorapaxar, a thrombin receptor inhibitor, may be of value in specific settings. Anticoagulation uses 1 of 4 choices: bivalirudin, unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, and fondaparinux. Moreover, some patients (such as those who have chronic atrial fibrillation) require triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, plus an anticoagulant, frequently a vitamin K antagonist. New oral anticoagulants have been shown to be at least as effective as vitamin K antagonists in atrial fibrillation and led to fewer bleeding complications. Finally, the combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and low-dose rivaroxaban has recently been approved by the European Medicines Agency (but not the Food and Drug Administration) for secondary prevention after ACS. Several strategies have been developed to balance the potential benefit of antithrombotic therapy against the risk of bleeding complications, for example, radial access in coronary angiography or restricted use of combination therapy, and others are under investigation, such as discontinuation of aspirin. This overview summarizes the current status of antithrombotic therapy in ACS and describes strategies currently explored to optimize its benefit/risk ratio.

### Vitamin K antagonist vs direct oral anticoagulants with antiplatelet therapy in dual or triple therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention or acute coronary syndrome in atrial fibrillation: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114eoL5Q]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

International guidelines already recommend the preferential use of DOAC over VKA in AF patients treated with PCI. However while European guidelines 28, 29 recommend triple therapy as the default strategy except for patients at very high bleeding risk, the recent AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines 30 recommend that dual therapy (including clopidogrel with rivaroxaban 15 mg or dabigatran 150 mg twice daily or dose‐adjusted VKA) should be considered for most patients. Our study supports the overall preferential use of DOAC as well as a dual therapy strategy for most patients in this setting as dual therapy was associated with the strongest risk reduction for bleeding without higher ischemic risk. The rates of significant bleeding are highest within the first 30 days after PCI and twice higher than those of ischemic events. 11, 12, 13 Hence, by shifting the choice of the antithrombotic regimen toward dual therapy with a DOAC in most patients immediately following PCI, a significant reduction of bleeding without an excess in thrombotic risk may be anticipated.

4.1 Limits

Our meta‐analysis was not performed on individual patients' data. Hence, analyses could not take in to account the individual levels of risk. A limited proportion of included patients presented with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction. Knowing the higher risk of stent thrombosis associated with the latter condition, caution should be taken to extend the results in this setting. The doses of rivaroxaban used in the PIONEER AF‐PCI study 12 were lower than those used for stroke prevention in the ROCKET‐AF trial. 10 Although the results of PIONEER trial are in line with other trials included in our analysis, the effect of a 20 mg recommended dose remains un‐assessed. The comparison between low and high doses of DOAC and between dual and triple therapy using DOAC are only exploratory as with the exception of AUGUSTUS trial 13 the included trials were not designed to assess antiplatelet regimens individually. Our research was limited to two main databases for studies retrieval. Substantial heterogeneity exists in between trials in terms of trial design as well as type and duration of antiplatelet/antithrombotic therapy used, which could affect interpretation of our results. Finally, only three randomized studies were included in the analysis which might limit the assessment of publication bias.

Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study selection

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for the systematic review and meta‐analysis (see PRISMA checklist in Appendix S1). We conducted a systematic literature review by formal searches of the electronic databases MEDLINE (source PubMed) and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register Database as well as European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and American College of Cardiology annual meetings through March 18, 2018. The following search terms were used: "vitamin K antagonist" OR "VKA" OR "warfarin" OR "dabigatran" OR "rivaroxaban" OR "apixaban" OR "edoxaban" OR "novel oral anticoagulant" OR "new oral anticoagulant" OR "NOAC" OR "direct oral anticoagulant" OR "DOAC" AND "percutaneous coronary intervention" OR "PCI" OR "coronary stent implantation" OR "acute coronary syndrome" AND "atrial fibrillation" OR "AF" AND "randomized controlled trial" OR "randomized" OR "trials". References from reviews and selected articles were also reviewed for potential relevant citations. Studies were searched for and evaluated by two independent reviewers (VR and PA).

We restricted our analysis to the trials that met all of the following inclusion criteria: (a) randomized controlled comparison between DOAC and VKA, (b) in patients with AF following PCI and/or ACS, (c) available outcomes involving main adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) and major bleeding, and (d) English‐language publications.

2.2 Outcome definition

Any bleeding ranging from minor to severe and major bleeding were the safety endpoints. Major bleeding complications were reported as defined in each study. The efficacy endpoints were all‐causes death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, and the composite efficacy endpoint (MACCEs) as defined in each study. Outcomes were based on the longest follow‐up available for each study.

### Outcomes of patients treated with triple antithrombotic therapy after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (from the harmonizing outcomes with revascularization and stents in acute myocardial infarction [HORIZONS-AMI] trial) [^112taANo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

In the setting of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), patients at high risk of systemic emboli who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using stents might require triple antithrombotic therapy (a combination of aspirin, thienopyridine, and vitamin K antagonist [VKA]). The risks and benefits of such therapy in the setting of STEMI have been incompletely characterized. We, therefore, assessed the outcomes of patients who received triple therapy after primary PCI in the large-scale, contemporary Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction [HORIZONS-AMI] trial. Among the 3,320 patients triaged to primary PCI, 126 (3.8%) were prescribed triple therapy and 3,194 (96.2%) were prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy. The most frequent indications for VKA treatment were a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with a large akinetic area, atrial fibrillation (23.8% each), and mural thrombus (23.0%). The assignment to triple therapy was associated with older age, female gender, rhythm disturbances, Killip class > 1 on admission, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, left anterior descending artery territory infarcts, and Final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade < 3. Patients treated with triple versus dual therapy had comparable short- and long-term ischemic outcomes but had significantly increased rates of major bleeding during the index hospitalization (17.1% vs 6.5%, p < 0.0001), resulting in premature VKA discontinuation in 14.3% of those patients. In conclusion, in the setting of STEMI treated with primary PCI, the combination of aspirin, thienopyridine, and VKA results in an excess of bleeding complications and premature discontinuation of VKA. The risk of adding oral anticoagulation to patients admitted for STEMI should be carefully considered before choosing drug-eluting or bare metal stents.

### Outcomes and prognostic impact of prophylactic oral anticoagulation in anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients with left ventricular dysfunction [^117LcHEr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines in the management of ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) provide a recommendation for prophylactic oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with anterior wall myocardial infarction with associated wall motion abnormalities (Class IIb, Level of Evidence: C). 1, 2 The basis for this recommendation, however, stems from evidence obtained in a relatively historical time frame before contemporary expedited reperfusion strategies with primary percutaneous coronary intervention or a fibrinolysis pharmacoinvasive strategy delivered within STEMI systems of care. Currently with more effective and rapid reperfusion therapies, the frequency of left ventricle (LV) thrombus has reduced, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and combined with the aggressive use of secondary prevention therapies, improved outcomes of anterior STEMI with LV dysfunction (LVd) are expected in the present day.

The recognition of the prognostic relevance of major bleeding, 8, 9, 10 particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on "triple therapy" (combination dual antiplatelet therapy and OAC), 11, 12 has called into question the suggestion of prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with apical wall motion abnormalities following an acute anterior STEMI. In fact, the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Thrombosis recognizes the absence of high‐quality evidence in support of prophylactic warfarin in this patient subgroup. 13 Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with prophylactic anticoagulation in day‐to‐day clinical practice is illustrated within The National Survey of Canadian Practice Patterns on prophylactic anticoagulation prescriptions following an anterior wall STEMI. 14

In the absence of randomized data and given the paucity of observational data evaluating the contemporary role of prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with apical wall motion abnormalities, we sought to (1) compare outcomes of patients with anterior STEMI and LVd (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤ 40%) (high‐risk) to an "all‐comer" STEMI population (low risk) and (2) evaluate the prognostic impact of prophylactic OAC in this high‐risk group, within a regional comprehensive STEMI reperfusion network (The Vital Heart Response Registry).

### Triple therapy for percutaneous coronary intervention in atrial fibrillation: standard of care, or a nightmare soon to end? [^115Hubfw]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

The need to combine anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy ('triple therapy') in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease increases the risk of bleeding. As percutaneous intervention is now the dominant therapy for coronary disease, clinicians question how to manage the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and a coronary stent that require dual antiplatelet therapy. In this review, the risk of stroke and coronary thrombosis in this difficult group of patients will be summarized using current recommendations and guidelines. The scarce randomized data on triple therapy are reviewed, and there will be a focus on currently running trials on this topic.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

Our findings agree with and extend the findings of three previous systematic reviews.

Oldgren 2013 performed a meta‐analysis of RCTs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, darexaban, rivaroxaban, and ximelagatran) to single (aspirin) or dual (aspirin and clopidogrel) antiplatelet therapy after ACS. The findings suggested that adding NOACs to antiplatelet therapy resulted in a modest reduction in cardiovascular events but a substantial increase in bleeding. However, Oldgren 2013 included RCTs of NOACs that were not approved by the FDA (ximelagatran and darexaban).

Khan 2017 conducted a meta‐analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of adding NOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran) to SAPT or DAPT in people with ACS, and concluded that the addition of NOACs to DAPT was associated with an increase in the risk of clinically significant bleeding and only a modest reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events. The addition of NOACs to SAPT did not result in a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events or an increase in clinically significant bleeding. However, Khan 2017 included RCTs assessing NOACs in people with an indication for anticoagulation due to atrial fibrillation.

Chiarito 2018 suggested a favourable net clinical benefit when adding NOACs to antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention after ACS, particularly in people presenting with STEMI; the findings showed that administration of NOACs in addition to antiplatelet therapy after STEMI appeared to improve ischaemic events at the cost of a marginally increased risk of major bleeding.

In contrast to these previous meta‐analyses, we used individual efficacy outcomes rather than composite outcomes, which might explain why we found no meaningful difference in efficacy for all individual doses. We analysed the safety results using the TIMI criteria to avoid the limitation of the variability in definitions of bleeding events across included studies. Furthermore, our review provided a comprehensive and comparative evaluation of all available treatment options within an NMA framework, thus increasing the statistical power and confidence in the results.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with atrial fibrillation (AF) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — antithrombotic regimens are stratified by bleeding risk as follows: For low risk (HAS-BLED 0–2), triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT; oral anticoagulant [OAC], aspirin and clopidogrel) should be considered for 6 months irrespective of stent type, then long term dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT; up to 12 months) with OAC and clopidogrel 75 mg/day or alternatively aspirin 75–100 mg/day. For high risk (HAS-BLED ≥ 3), initial TAT should be considered for 4 weeks irrespective of stent type, followed by long term DAT (up to 12 months) with OAC and clopidogrel 75 mg/day or alternatively aspirin 75–100 mg/day. In AF patients at high risk of bleeding, aspirin may be omitted and dual therapy with OAC and clopidogrel 75 mg/day continued for 3–6 months, after which patients would be managed on OAC alone. Long-term antithrombotic therapy (beyond 12 months) is recommended with OAC in all patients, with combination OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy sometimes continued in very selected cases (e.g., left main or proximal bifurcation stenting or recurrent MIs). Radial access for primary PCI is stated as the best option, when feasible, to reduce procedural bleeding.

### Dual (anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet) vs triple (anticoagulant plus dual antiplatelet) antithrombotic therapy-"Real world" experience [^116zCquk]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that increases in prevalence with advancing age and in patients with coronary artery disease, revascularization, particularly with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), is also common. Both disease states have thrombosis as a core pathophysiologic process which requires treatment - low sheer stress thrombi in AF and intracoronary high sheer stress thrombi in PCI. For the 10–20% of patients who have both AF and undergo PCI, preventing thrombotic complications will require inhibition of both processes requiring simultaneous use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. There is a broad experience of combining oral anticoagulation therapy, used to prevent stroke and systemic embolization, in AF with dual antiplatelet therapy, used to prevent stent thrombosis and thrombotic coronary events. This "triple antithrombotic therapy" (TT) has been evaluated through many observation studies, both small and large. TT has more frequently been associated with a significant increase in bleeding events with non-significant reduction in thrombotic events. Current guidelines recommend shorter duration of TT, especially in patients with high risk of bleeding.

### Outcomes and prognostic impact of prophylactic oral anticoagulation in anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients with left ventricular dysfunction [^11725E4r]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

We observe a much lower bleeding rate in patients discharged on prophylactic OAC than would be anticipated in comparison to clinical trials evaluating the use of "triple therapy". 11, 12, 14 This is likely because of a combination of factors including the definition of major bleeding, nonadjudication of bleeding events, lack of information regarding the duration of prophylactic anticoagulation, and the intensity of anticoagulation in our study. Knowledge of anticoagulation intensity in our study would have been particularly relevant in light of the reduced mortality associated with warfarin use in the high‐risk subgroup; this is particularly important, given that it has also been reported that lower doses of non‐vitamin K antagonists have resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular deaths, yet increased major bleeding. 32, 33

Other limitations within this study include the nonrandomized nature of the data, and although an attempt to mitigate this using a propensity‐matched analysis was made, the possibility of unidentified confounders cannot be excluded. While we excluded all patients with pre‐existing AF, we were unable to exclude STEMI patients developing new‐onset in‐hospital AF as an indication for OAC. Also, although all patients were treated per best practice guidelines, detailed information regarding the utilization and impact of resynchronization and implantable defibrillator therapies is not available for this study.

In conclusion, within a contemporary STEMI network of care, we continue to demonstrate that patients with LVd following an anterior STEMI remain a very high‐risk subgroup. Prophylactic anticoagulation, while frequently utilized, does not appear to mitigate the intended thromboembolic risk and calls this therapeutic indication into question. Further validation of the dual pathway strategy is required to accurately determine its relationship with secondary prevention of recurrent ischemia and all‐cause mortality.

### Newly detected atrial fibrillation… [^115XeNBB]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Rate control is strongly preferred to rhythm control in most patients, using nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers.
- Rate control to less than 110 beats per minute at rest is recommended over rate control to less than 80 beats per minute.
- Long-term anticoagulation should be prescribed for all patients with atrial fibrillation, with the exception of those who have contraindications or a low stroke risk From the AFP Editors. Recommendations Rate control is strongly preferred to rhythm control in most patients, using nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers, which are superior to digoxin. Rhythm control with amiodarone, dronedarone, propafenone, or sotalol can be considered for persons in whom rate control is ineffective and based on symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference.

High-quality data indicate that there are fewer hospitalizations with rate control than with rhythm control. In addition, there are significant risks and adverse effects with medications to control rhythm. Long-term anticoagulation should be prescribed for all patients with atrial fibrillation, with the exception of those who have contraindications or a low stroke risk defined as a CHADS. 2 score less than 2. When selecting the anticoagulant, the history and patient preferences should be taken into account. Vitamin K antagonists are the first-line option, with high-quality data indicating that they have a lower stroke risk and all-cause mortality vs. placebo. They do, however, have an increased risk of major bleeding and a narrow therapeutic window, as well as monitoring requirements and changes in diet.

Combination treatment with an anticoagulant and an antiplatelet agent is not recommended for most patients. Moderate-quality data indicate that combining warfarin with clopidogrel or aspirin is associated with greater risk of major bleeding vs. warfarin monotherapy; that combining warfarin with aspirin is associated with a greater risk of ischemic stroke; and combining warfarin with clopidogrel has the same risk of ischemic stroke.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to management of AF, antithrombotic therapy, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and an OAC for > 1 week after percutaneous intervention when the risk of stent thrombosis outweighs the bleeding risk. Decide the total duration (≤ 1 month) according to the assessment of these risks and ensure clear documentation.
