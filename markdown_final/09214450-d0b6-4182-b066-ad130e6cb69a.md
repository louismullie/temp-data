## Question

how is alcohol related ketosis diagnosed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is diagnosed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the canonical clinical context that raises suspicion for AKA versus DKA. Then, I should verify the initial laboratory approach to confirm a high–anion gap metabolic acidosis and characterize glucose status. Next, I will examine ketone measurement strategies, emphasizing β-hydroxybutyrate over urine nitroprusside, and compare diagnostic thresholds and accuracy. After that, I need to differentiate AKA from DKA and euglycemic DKA, including how to use chronic glycemic indices when hyperglycemia is present. Then, I will review coexisting conditions and pitfalls, such as toxic alcohols and pancreatitis, and finally, I will summarize a practical diagnostic algorithm that anchors timely management decisions like fluids, dextrose, and thiamine while avoiding missteps like reflex insulin when primary pathology is AKA.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario that should trigger suspicion for AKA: recent heavy alcohol use followed by abrupt reduction or cessation, several days of poor oral intake, and persistent vomiting with dehydration; the onset is often within 1–3 days of stopping alcohol and patients commonly report nausea, abdominal pain, and dyspnea, yet mental status is often relatively preserved compared to DKA, which can present with confusion or coma in severe cases, so I need to explicitly note alert mentation as a supportive clue for AKA unless another process is clouding sensorium [^115qd9am] [^116HMEp8] [^113PehAx].

> Wait, let me verify the initial laboratories before I jump to conclusions: I need to document a high–anion gap metabolic acidosis, confirm low bicarbonate on chemistry, and corroborate with a blood gas showing metabolic acidosis; while bicarbonate in starvation ketosis is usually not less than 18 mEq/L, AKA may produce more profound acidosis with low bicarbonate and pH, so I should not dismiss severe gaps in an alcohol user just because starvation is also plausible, and I should calculate a corrected anion gap and consider albumin effects for accuracy [^114cqmGM] [^113JDFth] [^1163sSVX].

> I should double-check glucose early because it is a key discriminator: in AKA, glucose is typically low, normal, or only mildly elevated, but I must not be misled — hyperglycemia can occur and even reach levels consistent with DKA, which is a classic pitfall leading to inappropriate insulin; the general DKA construct involves glucose typically exceeding 250 mg/dL, but euglycemic DKA exists, especially with SGLT2 inhibitors, so I need to integrate context and avoid anchoring on a single glucose value [^115qd9am] [^1171Hoe2] [^114Zxwf4] [^1152Ag4y].

> Hold on, I should verify ketone testing modality because this is where misclassification often happens: serum or capillary β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) directly measured is preferred over urine nitroprusside, which misses BHB and underestimates total ketones when the BHB:AcAc ratio is high, as in AKA; point-of-care BHB has excellent sensitivity near 98% at a threshold of approximately > 1.5–2.0 mmol/L for ketoacidosis, with better specificity than urine dipsticks, but thresholds for DKA severity vary and device precision declines at higher values, so I need to corroborate with acid–base data rather than use BHB alone [^113KospR] [^116sN1Mz] [^112H9My1] [^113eLXyY].

> Hmm, wait a minute — if BHB is elevated, what level "confirms" AKA specifically? There is no single AKA-specific cutoff, so I should treat any clearly elevated BHB above physiologic fasting levels (for example, > 1.0–1.5 mmol/L) in the right clinical context as strongly supportive of ketoacidosis, while recognizing that DKA cutoffs in adults may be closer to 3–3.8 mmol/L and that newer data question rigid thresholds; therefore, I must integrate BHB with pH/bicarbonate and the anion gap rather than rely on a single number, especially in mixed states or alcohol-related presentations [^116xm6bK] [^112P8N72] [^116rLYRF] [^111KPh1w].

> Next, I should review differentiators from DKA systematically: use glucose pattern, assess chronic glycemic control when hyperglycemia clouds the picture (HbA1c, sometimes fructosamine), and consider C-peptide and pancreatic autoantibodies if needed; a normal or near-normal HbA1c with preserved C-peptide and negative autoantibodies argues against chronic diabetes driving the ketoacidosis and supports AKA when the history and ketone pattern fit, but I should confirm that I am not missing euglycemic DKA in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors or in physiologic low-glucose states [^1171Hoe2] [^1152Ag4y] [^1147X3RR] [^114PixxV].

> Let me think about mental status and hemodynamics as supportive clues: AKA patients are often alert but volume depleted, whereas DKA can progress to altered mental status with severe dehydration; this is not absolute, so I should correlate with vital signs, degree of acidosis, and co-conditions like toxic alcohol ingestion or pancreatitis that can alter mentation, while remembering that both syndromes can present with tachypnea and abdominal pain, demanding biochemical confirmation to avoid cognitive bias [^113PehAx] [^115qd9am].

> I will now examine for coexisting causes of high–anion gap acidosis that commonly overlap with AKA: check lactate, because volume contraction and redox shifts in AKA can produce mild to moderate hyperlactatemia and, at times, profound elevations; evaluate for toxic alcohols when the osmolal gap is increased or the history is suggestive; and do not forget pancreatitis in heavy alcohol users, which can both precipitate and mimic these metabolic emergencies, changing fluid and electrolyte plans [^115ZZEPS] [^115BXWUQ] [^111QBddX] [^112UNHfj].

> But wait, what if urine ketones are negative despite strong clinical suspicion? I should not stop there — urine nitroprusside detects acetoacetate, not BHB, and can be falsely negative early in AKA when BHB predominates; I need to obtain serum or capillary BHB and treat the patient based on the total clinical picture rather than a misleading urine strip, especially if the anion gap and acidosis are otherwise unexplained [^116QT6D3] [^113eLXyY] [^116xm6bK].

> Next, I should review electrolytes and anticipate treatment-induced shifts: potassium may appear normal or high initially in acidosis but can fall rapidly with glucose administration and correction of acidosis; magnesium and phosphate are often depleted and require monitoring and repletion; while ADA potassium replacement algorithms are derived for DKA, the same vigilance during resuscitation of AKA is prudent to prevent arrhythmias and neuromuscular complications as fluids and dextrose shift electrolytes intracellularly [^1135r4eb] [^115qd9am].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical diagnostic criteria I'm applying at the bedside: a consistent history of alcohol use with abrupt reduction, a high–anion gap metabolic acidosis with low bicarbonate and pH, elevated BHB as the predominant ketone, glucose usually not markedly elevated, and exclusion of alternative or coexisting causes like toxic alcohol ingestion, lactic acidosis due to sepsis or shock, and renal failure — taken together, these confirm AKA and guide initiation of targeted therapy without unnecessary insulin if diabetes is not the driver [^115qd9am] [^115qd9am] [^115BXWUQ].

> Let me reconsider how to accelerate diagnosis in the ED: point-of-care capillary BHB gives immediate results and, at a cutoff around > 1.5 mmol/L, has very high sensitivity with better specificity than urine dipsticks for ketoacidosis; BHB correlates with the anion gap and inversely with bicarbonate, so serial measurements can track response, but I should still pair this with pH/bicarbonate and the clinical course to avoid overreliance on any single biomarker [^116sN1Mz] [^114Zxwf4] [^116xm6bK].

> Finally, I need to ensure my diagnostic algorithm links to correct initial management: in suspected AKA, start isotonic fluids, give dextrose with thiamine to reverse ketogenesis and address malnutrition, replete electrolytes, and treat coexisting conditions; importantly, avoid reflex insulin unless there is concomitant DKA or persistent hyperglycemia attributable to diabetes, because insulin in pure AKA can precipitate hypoglycemia once dextrose triggers endogenous insulin release and ketone clearance, a pitfall repeatedly documented in misdiagnosed cases [^115qd9am] [^116HMEp8] [^1171Hoe2].

> In summary, I should double-check that I have: 1) the right history signal for AKA, 2) confirmed high–anion gap metabolic acidosis with appropriate gas analysis, 3) directly measured BHB rather than relying on urine ketones, 4) a rational glucose-based differentiation that considers euglycemic DKA and SGLT2-associated risk, and 5) an exclusion of competing toxins and comorbid processes; executing this sequence reduces misdiagnosis, prevents inappropriate insulin in AKA, and facilitates rapid recovery with fluids, dextrose, thiamine, and electrolyte stewardship [^115qd9am] [^113KospR] [^115BXWUQ] [^1147X3RR].

Alcohol-related ketosis (alcoholic ketoacidosis, AKA) is diagnosed by a combination of **clinical history, laboratory findings, and exclusion of other causes** [^1164Bq47]. The key diagnostic features are **high anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated β-hydroxybutyrate** [^116xm6bK] and **normal or low glucose** [^113d2JBQ] in a patient with recent heavy alcohol use and poor oral intake [^115qd9am].

---

## Clinical history and presentation

- **Alcohol use**: Recent heavy or chronic alcohol consumption, often with abrupt cessation or reduction [^116HMEp8] [^115qd9am].
- **Poor intake**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and poor oral intake [^115HCHhw] [^115qd9am].
- **Mental status**: Typically preserved or only mildly altered, unlike DKA [^116HMEp8] [^113PehAx] [^115qd9am].

---

## Laboratory findings

- **Anion gap**: Elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis (anion gap > 12 mEq/L) [^1164Bq47] [^115qd9am].
- **Ketones**: Elevated serum β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), often > 3 mmol/L [^116xm6bK] [^115qd9am].
- **Glucose**: Normal, low, or mildly elevated serum glucose (usually < 250 mg/dL) [^116HMEp8] [^113d2JBQ] [^115qd9am].
- **Lactate**: Elevated serum lactate due to impaired hepatic metabolism [^115ZZEPS] [^115qd9am].
- **Electrolytes**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia are common [^1125iiLt] [^115qd9am].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis is **based on the following criteria**:

| **Criterion** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Clinical history | - Recent heavy alcohol use <br/> - Poor oral intake <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Abdominal pain [^116HMEp8] |
| Laboratory findings | - Elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis [^1164Bq47] <br/> - Elevated serum β-hydroxybutyrate [^113KospR] <br/> - Normal or low glucose [^113d2JBQ] <br/> - Elevated lactate [^115ZZEPS] |
| Exclusion of other causes | - Rule out diabetic ketoacidosis [^114cqmGM] [^111N7noh] <br/> - Starvation ketosis [^1164Bq47] <br/> - Toxic alcohol ingestion [^115BXWUQ] [^111QBddX] |

## Differentiation from other ketoacidosis

Alcohol-related ketosis must be **differentiated from diabetic ketoacidosis**, which features hyperglycemia (> 250 mg/dL), elevated β-hydroxybutyrate, and metabolic acidosis [^114cqmGM] [^111N7noh]. It should also be distinguished from **starvation ketosis**, which typically presents with mild ketosis, normal or low glucose, and minimal acidosis [^114cqmGM] [^1164Bq47].

---

## Diagnostic tests and biomarkers

- **Serum β-hydroxybutyrate**: Direct measurement is the most reliable test for diagnosing and monitoring ketosis [^113KospR] [^111N7noh] [^116xm6bK].
- **Urine ketones**: Useful adjunct but less specific than serum β-hydroxybutyrate [^116sN1Mz] [^113eLXyY].
- **Blood gas analysis**: Essential for assessing acid-base status and severity of acidosis [^1163sSVX] [^111f8ug3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize a detailed alcohol use and dietary history; laboratory evaluation with **serum β-hydroxybutyrate measurement** [^113KospR], blood gas analysis [^1163sSVX], and electrolyte assessment; and exclusion of alternative causes of ketoacidosis. Clinicians should specifically rule out diabetic ketoacidosis and toxic alcohol ingestion [^115BXWUQ]. Diagnosis combines clinical history and laboratory findings while excluding other causes, with **elevated β-hydroxybutyrate and normal or low glucose** as key features [^116HMEp8].

Differential diagnosis - **Clinical history**: Not all patients with ketoacidosis have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Starvation ketosis and alcoholic ketoacidosis can be distinguished by the patient's clinical history and plasma glucose concentrations, which range from mildly elevated (rarely > 200 mg/dl) to hypoglycemia. Although alcoholic ketoacidosis can cause profound acidosis, the serum bicarbonate concentration in starvation ketosis is usually not < 18 mEq/l.

- **High–anion gap metabolic acidosis**: DKA must also be distinguished from other causes, including lactic acidosis; ingestion of drugs such as salicylate, methanol, ethylene glycol, and paraldehyde; and acute chronic renal failure. Lactic acidosis is more common in patients with diabetes than in nondiabetic persons, and elevated lactic acid levels may occur in severely volume-contracted patients. Therefore, plasma lactate should be measured on admission.

- **Drug abuse indicators**: A clinical history of previous drug abuse should be sought. Measurement of serum salicylate and blood methanol level may be helpful. The presence of ethylene glycol (antifreeze) may be suggested by calcium oxalate and hippurate crystals in the urine. Paraldehyde ingestion is indicated by its characteristic strong odor on the breath. As these intoxicants are low–molecular weight organic compounds, they can produce an osmolar gap in addition to the anion gap acidosis. Active cocaine use is an independent risk factor for recurrent DKA (reDKA).

One case report has recently shown that a patient diagnosed with acromegaly may present with DKA as the primary manifestation of the disease.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: {beta}-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^116sN1Mz]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 859 patients were screened, of whom 616 provided informed consent. Among them, 516 (83.7%) had all the data elements necessary for analysis. Patients were excluded if they had no urine dipstick (49 patients), no serum pH via venous blood gas (30 patients), or no serum chemistry panel (21 patients). In our final sample, 54 of 516 subjects (10.5%) met the ADA criteria for DKA. Sample characteristics are provided in Table 1 below.

- **Table 1: Demographic and laboratory characteristics of the study sample**

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: At the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, the sensitivity of capillary β-OHB and the urine dipstick for DKA were identical at 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100). However, the specificity of β-OHB was significantly higher than the urine dipstick, with results showing 78.6% [74.5–82.2] versus 35.1% [30.7–39.6], respectively (P < 0.001). When the cutoff for β-OHB is increased to > 2 mmol/L, sensitivity remains at 98.1%, but specificity improves to 82.3%.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis: Etiologies, evaluation, and management [^115qd9am]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is defined by metabolic acidosis and ketosis in a patient with alcohol use. This is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED) and requires targeted therapies.

- **Objective**: This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of AKA for emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: AKA is frequently evaluated and managed in the ED. The underlying pathophysiology is related to poor glycogen stores and elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and hydrogen, resulting in metabolic acidosis with elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels. Patients with AKA most commonly present with a history of alcohol use (acute or chronic), poor oral intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, and ketoacidosis on laboratory assessment. Patients are generally dehydrated, and serum glucose can be low, normal, or mildly elevated. An anion gap metabolic acidosis with ketosis and electrolyte abnormalities is usually present on laboratory evaluation. Management includes fluid resuscitation, glucose and vitamin supplementation, electrolyte repletion, and evaluation for other conditions.

- **Conclusions**: Emergency clinician knowledge of the evaluation and management of AKA is essential in caring for these patients.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: A prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^113PehAx]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious condition that can be associated with a range of symptoms and contributing factors. Key symptoms include altered mental status, abdominal pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, coma, and confusion. Laboratory findings often reveal decreased serum magnesium, serum bicarbonate, and serum pH, alongside increased indicators such as serum osmolal gap, serum potassium, serum sodium, blood glucose, serum anion gap, urine glucose, urine ketones, serum ketones, serum β-hydroxybutyrate, HbA1c, and serum phosphate levels.

Additional symptoms and signs may include polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, fatigue, fruity breath odor, dehydration, increased thirst, increased appetite, weight loss, lethargy, somnolence, visual disturbances, and fainting. Risk factors associated with diabetic ketoacidosis are alcohol consumption, poorly controlled diabetes, some medications like corticosteroids and SGLT-2 inhibitors, and underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus.

Effective management and early diagnosis are crucial, emphasizing the importance of recognizing these symptoms and potential precipitating factors to prevent the progression of this life-threatening condition.

### Features and long-term outcomes of patients hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115jndm7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute metabolic complication characterized by hyperglycemia, ketones in blood or urine, and acidosis.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to characterize features of patients hospitalized for DKA, identify triggers for DKA, and evaluate the long-term effects of DKA on glycemic control, complications of diabetes, re-hospitalizations, and mortality.

- **Methods**: Historical prospectively collected data of patients hospitalized to medical wards for DKA between 2011 and 2017. Data regarding comorbidities, mortality, triggers, and re-hospitalizations for DKA were also collected.

- **Results**: The cohort consisted of 160 patients (mean age 38 ± 18 years, 43% male). One-fifth of the patients (34 patients, 21%) were newly diagnosed with diabetes, and DKA was their first presentation of the disease. Among the 126 patients with pre-existing diabetes, the common identified triggers for DKA were poor compliance to treatment (22%) and infectious diseases (18%). During over 7 years of follow-up, the mortality rate was 9% (15 patients), and the re-hospitalization for DKA rate was 31% (50 patients).

	- Risk factors for re-hospitalization for DKA included young age (OR = 1.02, 95% CI [1.00–1.04]), pre-existing diabetes compared to DKA as the first presentation (OR = 5.4, 95% CI [1.7–18]), and poorer glycemic control before initial hospitalization (10.5 ± 2.5% vs. 9.4 ± 2.2%; OR = 0.8, 95% CI [0.68–0.96]) and after discharge (10.3 ± 2.4% vs. 9.0 ± 1.9%; OR = 0.73, 95% CI [0.61–0.87]).

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis: Confused diagnosis [^1171Hoe2]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A woman in her 30s presented with a 3-day history of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was found to be in ketoacidosis with an elevated serum glucose level of 18.2 mmol/L (328 mg/dL). Based on her initial presentation and test results, she was believed to have new onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) from previously undiagnosed diabetes. Subsequently, she was found to have acidosis caused by acute or chronic alcohol consumption, even though her serum glucose was higher than would be typically expected with alcohol abuse.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis usually has lower glucose levels as well as retained mental function when compared with DKA. Haemoglobin A1c, fructosamine level, betahydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate ratio, C-peptide, and antibodies to pancreatic beta-cells can help rule out diabetes as the aetiology of the ketoacidosis. This patient was treated with fluids and electrolyte replacement, showed rapid improvement, received alcohol cessation resources, and was discharged home.

### Review of clinical disorders causing metabolic acidosis [^1164Bq47]. Advances in Chronic Kidney Disease (2022). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by:

- **Drug-induced causes**: metformin-induced lactic acidosis, aspirin overdose, acetaminophen overdose, propylene glycol poisoning
- **Toxin and chemical exposures**: toluene poisoning, ethylene glycol poisoning, methanol poisoning, cyanide poisoning, isopropyl alcohol poisoning
- **Metabolic conditions**: alcoholic ketoacidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, starvation ketosis, lactic acidosis, pyroglutamic acidosis
- **Renal and systemic conditions**: acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, uremia, sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, multiple myeloma
- **Rare metabolic disorders**: maple syrup urine disease

In addition, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by medications such as aspirin.

### Teaching neuroimages: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation in aceruloplasminemia [^116nstSZ]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old African Canadian man with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and alcohol abuse presented with diabetic ketoacidosis. Progressive cognitive decline over the previous 5 years resulted in long-term care placement. Aside from pigmentary retinopathy, the general examination was unremarkable. MRI demonstrated iron accumulation in the brain (figure 1) and liver (figure 2A). Ceruloplasmin, a ferroxidase enzyme important in iron homeostasis, was undetectable and associated with low serum iron, low serum copper, and a 10-fold increase in serum ferritin. Liver biopsy confirmed increased hepatocyte iron storage (figure 2B). Aceruloplasminemia was diagnosed. Iron chelation was not administered given advanced dementia at presentation.

### Point-of-care test identifies diabetic ketoacidosis at triage [^114Zxwf4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common, life-threatening complication of diabetes. The diagnosis of DKA relies on signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings, including blood glucose (BG) of > 250 mg/dL, an anion gap (AG) of ≥ 15 mmol/L, and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. A study was conducted in a large urban hospital emergency department where adult patients with BG > 250 mg/dL underwent testing for beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) using the Precision Xtra meter (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) at triage. Clinicians diagnosed DKA using standard clinical criteria without the knowledge of the beta-OHB test results.

- **Results**: A diagnosis of DKA was made in 57 of 160 subjects. The beta-OHB values correlated strongly with AG (r = 0.66, p < 0.001) and with CO2 (r = -0.69, p < 0.001), as well as with glucose (r = 0.31, p < 0.001). Cross-classification of DKA vs. beta-OHB yielded a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI = 91% to 100%) and specificity of 85% (95% CI = 78% to 91%), with a positive likelihood ratio of 6.7 (95% CI = 4.22 to 10.78) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.021 (95% CI = 0.003 to 0.144) at the manufacturer-suggested beta-OHB level of 1.5.

- **Conclusions**: The point-of-care test for beta-OHB was as sensitive as more established indicators of DKA. It is more useful than glucose alone for the diagnosis of DKA and offers immediate diagnostic utility in emergency settings.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis [^116HMEp8]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a common reason for investigation and admission of alcohol-dependent patients in UK emergency departments. Although it is well described in international emergency medicine literature, UK emergency physicians rarely make the diagnosis of AKA. There is increasing evidence that, rather than being benign and self-limiting, AKA may be a significant cause of mortality in patients with alcohol dependence. This literature review discusses the history, characterization, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of AKA.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis as a complication of methanol poisoning; a case report [^111EByqG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of diabetes presenting with high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Methanol poisoning, on the other hand, is a toxicology emergency that presents with the same feature. We present a case of methanol poisoning who presented with DKA.

- **Case presentation**: A 28-year-old male was referred to us with blurred vision and loss of consciousness three days after ingestion of 1.5 liters of an unknown mixture of bootleg alcoholic beverage. He had a history of insulin-dependent diabetes and had neglected his insulin shots on the day prior to hospital admission due to progressive loss of consciousness. Vital signs were normal, and venous blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis and a methanol level of 10.2 mg/dL. After eight hours of hemodialysis, he remained unresponsive. Diabetic ketoacidosis was suspected due to positive urine ketone and blood sugar of 411 mg/dL. Insulin infusion was initiated, which was followed by full awakening and extubation. He was discharged completely symptom-free after four weeks.

- **Conclusions**: Diabetic ketoacidosis and methanol poisoning can happen simultaneously in a diabetic patient. Given the analogous high anion gap metabolic acidosis, physicians should pay particular attention to the examination of diabetic patients. Meticulous evaluation for both conditions is highly recommended.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^116rLYRF]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

This study, which involves patients presumed to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), was unable to verify the equivalence between a β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) concentration of 3 mmol/L and a bicarbonate concentration of 18 mmol/L. On average, normal pH and bicarbonate concentrations equated to a BOHB of 3 mmol/L. The 3 mmol/L value, originally adopted by several guidelines, appears to have been derived from preliminary recommendations based on a study of only 14 patients admitted with DKA. A larger study equated BOHB concentrations to a bicarbonate concentration of 18 mmol/L, but only quoted the BOHB equivalence of 3.0 mmol/L in children, with adults at 3.8 mmol/L.

Nonetheless, guidelines continue to promulgate a BOHB threshold of 3.0 mmol/L. In this study, the 18 mmol/L bicarbonate level, on average, equated to a BOHB concentration of 4.3 mmol/L, aligning more closely with the aforementioned Sheikh-Ali adult value and other contemporary findings. More recent diagnostic guidelines for DKA suggest a lower bicarbonate concentration of less than 15 mmol/L as a criterion. In our study, this corresponded to a BOHB value of 4.7 mmol/L.

It might be assumed that our data suggests consideration of raising the diagnostic DKA threshold for blood BOHB concentrations. However, this study also demonstrated that in real-world settings using modern point-of-care blood ketone testing, there is a marked variance in BOHB values around the same, including pathological, bicarbonate concentration (r = -0.49).

### Clinicopathologic appearance of advanced ketoacidosis with basal vacuolation in renal tubules [^113D5Exs]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Basal vacuolization (BV) in renal tubules is a histopathologic hallmark of advanced ketoacidosis that enables us to retrospectively diagnose these cases.

- **Objective**: To clarify the pathologic background and serologic findings of ketoacidosis with BV and to reveal the pathologic findings by each pathologic background.

- **Design**: We examined 664 serial autopsy cases. A systemic histopathologic examination and measurement of serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration were performed for the cases with BV. The extent of steatosis and fibrosis in the organs and the degree of coronary artery stenosis were semiquantitatively investigated. Immunohistochemistry for adipophilin was also performed to analyze its usefulness for the pathologic diagnosis.

- **Results**: Basal vacuolization was found in 16 cases, all of which showed a pathologic serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration. The main background of ketoacidosis was considered as alcohol abuse in 6 cases, diabetes in 5, malnutrition in 3, and hypothermia and infection in 1 case each. Severe hepatic fibrosis was observed only in the alcohol-abuser group. Moreover, cardiac steatosis was more severe in patients with possible alcohol abuse than in those with other causes. Immunohistochemistry for adipophilin showed immunoreactivity consistent with BV in 13 of 16 cases. There was no correlation between β-hydroxybutyrate concentration and either the postmortem or storage interval.

- **Conclusions**: Basal vacuolization may be a useful finding for detecting ketoacidosis cases in a postmortem investigation. Serum β-hydroxybutyrate was a.

### Steglujan [^114PixxV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Steglujan significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to those who received a placebo; this risk may be greater with higher doses. Steglujan is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 4 days.

### Fasting ketone levels vary by age: Implications for differentiating physiologic from pathologic ketotic hypoglycemia [^111KPh1w]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Ketone production is a physiological phenomenon that occurs during beta-oxidation of free fatty acids. Distinguishing physiologic ketosis from pathologic over-production or underutilization of ketones is critical as part of the diagnostic evaluation of disorders of carbohydrate metabolism. However, there is limited literature on normal ketone production with fasting. This study aims to measure fasting serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations in healthy children after an overnight fast.

Children aged ≤ 18 years were prospectively recruited from elective procedures through our surgery centers. Exclusion criteria included a history of diabetes, hypopituitarism, adrenal, metabolic or inflammatory disorders, dietary restrictions, trauma, or use of medications that might affect blood glucose. Serum glucose, cortisol, and BHB were assessed after an overnight fast.

Data from 94 participants (mean age 8.3 ± 5.7 years, 54% male, 46% female) were analyzed. Children aged ≤ 3 years (n = 19) had significantly higher mean (0.40 ± 0.06 mmol/L) and median (0.4, IQR 0.2–0.6 mmol/L) BHB concentrations compared to children > 3 years of age (n = 75) who had a mean (0.21 ± 0.02 mmol/L) and median BHB of 0.1 (IQR 0.1–0.2 mmol/L) (p < 0.001). Elevated BHB levels > 1.0 mmol/L were rare (2%, N = 2), and 74% (N = 70) of participants had BHB levels ≤ 0.2 mmol/L. In conclusion, BHB concentrations > 1.0 mmol/L are rare within our population and therefore may indicate an abnormality when observed.

### Farxiga [^1147X3RR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and other ketoacidosis**: In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Farxiga significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. Farxiga is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Farxiga.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing Farxiga.

### Unexplained metabolic acidosis: Alcoholic ketoacidosis or propylene glycol toxicity [^114Tau7X]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Low credibility.

Severe metabolic acidosis with elevated anion and osmol gap is suggestive of toxic alcohol ingestion. The absence of detectable methanol or ethylene glycol in the serum could mean that metabolism is complete or that other hypotheses have to be considered. Ingestion of less common alcohol or alcoholic ketoacidosis should be investigated, as illustrated by the present observation.

- **Case report**: A 46-year-old woman was admitted with altered consciousness in the Emergency Department. In the presence of a high anion gap (peak value 39 mEq/L) metabolic acidosis with mildly increased osmol gap (peak value 19 mOsm/kg), there was a high suspicion of toxic alcohol ingestion in an individual with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Serum arterial lactate concentration was particularly high at 27 mmol/L. Urinalysis failed to reveal the presence of ketone bodies or oxalate crystals. The results of the serum determination of ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropanol were obtained within 2 hours and were negative. Due to the severity of lactic metabolic acidosis and the persisting suspicion of intoxication by a less common toxic alcohol, antidotal therapy with ethanol was initiated together with hemodialysis. Correction of lactic metabolic acidosis was achieved. Results of urinalysis obtained later revealed the presence not only of propylene glycol and D-lactate but also of significant concentrations of ß-hydroxybutyrate as a marker of alcoholic ketoacidosis.

- **Discussion**: The combination of propylene glycol ingestion and alcoholic ketoacidosis may have contributed to the severity of the condition.

### Utility of ketone measurement in the prevention, diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113oCyb2]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ketone measurement is advocated for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and assessment of its severity. Assessing the evidence base for ketone measurement in clinical practice is challenging because multiple methods are available, but there is a lack of consensus about which is preferable. Evaluating the utility of ketone measurement is additionally problematic because of variability in the biochemical definition of ketoacidosis internationally and in the proposed thresholds for ketone measures. This has led to conflicting guidance from expert bodies on how ketone measurement should be used in the management of ketoacidosis.

The development of point-of-care devices that can reliably measure the capillary blood ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) has widened the spectrum of applications of ketone measurement. However, whether the evidence base supporting these applications is robust enough to warrant their incorporation into routine clinical practice remains unclear. The imprecision of capillary blood ketone measures at higher values, the lack of availability of routine laboratory-based assays for BOHB, and the continued cost-effectiveness of urine ketone assessment prompt further discussion on the role of capillary blood ketone assessment in ketoacidosis.

In the present article, we review the various existing methods of ketone measurement, the precision of capillary blood ketone as compared with other measures, its diagnostic accuracy in predicting ketoacidosis, and other clinical applications including prevention, assessment of severity, and resolution of ketoacidosis.

### Inpefa [^112WAsUA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Inpefa significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo; this risk may be greater with higher doses of Inpefa. Inpefa is not indicated for glycemic control.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes using SGLT2 inhibitors.

- **Precipitating conditions**: Conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, insulin dose reduction, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

- **Signs and symptoms**: Symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing Inpefa [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Diabetic ketoacidosis as a complication of methanol poisoning; a case report [^116e1FPA]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Methanol intoxication is a toxicologic emergency that occurs due to the ingestion of methanol-containing alcoholic beverages, particularly in countries where alcohol ingestion is prohibited. Since treatments should be initiated immediately in cases of high suspicion, it is important to recognize methanol poisoning promptly. Any delay in initiation of treatment can result in detrimental consequences, including blindness and death. Symptoms include gastrointestinal and visual complications that can lead to critical involvement of the central nervous system, and eventually, complete vision loss. Formation of formic acid is responsible for the high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA).

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most debilitating complications of diabetes, presenting with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dehydration, abdominal pain, acetone breath, and Kussmaul breathing pattern. Diabetic ketoacidosis is also associated with HAGMA. It is imperative to differentiate DKA from other causes of metabolic acidosis. We present a case of methanol poisoning presenting with DKA.

### Illnesses associated with ketosis including diabetic ketoacidosis during very low carbohydrate and ketogenic diets [^115PxhsG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Due to warnings from the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology against combining SGLT2‐inhibitors with VLCKD due to the risk of DKA, the safety protocol is to stop SGLT2‐inhibitors a few days before diet changes in people without cardiorenal indications. For people with cardiorenal SGLT2‐inhibitor indications, the medications are continued through diet changes to ensure protective benefits. Diabetes medications, including SGLT2‐inhibitors, are started de novo or resumed if needed for persistent hyperglycemia despite dietary changes.

All patients taking SGLT2‐inhibitors in combination with carbohydrate restriction receive anticipatory guidance on the risk of DKA, a description of DKA symptoms, and caution on avoidable risk factors such as dehydration, fasting, and heavy alcohol use. A safety protocol is provided to hold the medication and hydrate if the ketones rise above 3 mmol/L and to resume the medication when the fingerstick BHB falls below 2 mmol/L.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: Etiologies, evaluation, and management [^1152Ag4y]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) is an endocrine emergency observed in some diabetic patients who present with relative euglycemia and acidosis, often misdiagnosed due to serum glucose levels being below 250 mg/dL.

- **Objective**: This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of EDKA for emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: EDKA is characterized by serum glucose levels less than 250 mg/dL, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketosis. It most commonly occurs in patients with histories of low glucose states, such as starvation, chronic liver disease, pregnancy, infection, and alcohol use. Additionally, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which increase urinary glucose excretion, are associated with EDKA. The underlying pathophysiology involves insulin deficiency or resistance with glucagon release, poor glucose availability, ketone body production, and urinary glucose excretion. Patients typically present with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, malaise, or fatigue. Physicians must identify and treat the underlying etiology of EDKA. Laboratory assessment includes venous blood gas analysis for serum pH, bicarbonate, and ketones. Management involves resuscitation with intravenous fluids, insulin, and glucose, along with addressing the underlying etiology.

- **Conclusions**: Clinician knowledge of this condition can improve the evaluation and management of patients with EDKA.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^112P8N72]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a relatively common and potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosing DKA traditionally involves the identification of hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, and metabolic acidosis, often in that order. Recommended thresholds for diagnosis vary among different organizations, with plasma glucose values most commonly used being > 11 or > 13.9 mmol/L, pH less than 7.3, and blood ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BOHB) > 3 mmol/L.

- **Emerging challenges**: The increasing prevalence of euglycemic ketoacidosis is attributed to factors such as the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Additionally, there is a lack of evidence confirming the 3 mmol/L diagnostic threshold for blood BOHB. Therefore, a study is warranted to verify ketone thresholds and evaluate the reliance on glucose and BOHB testing in this clinical context.

- **Study aim**: To use real-world data from patients admitted to an Emergency Department with presumptive DKA. The study seeks to validate blood ketone concentration thresholds and explore the effectiveness of blood glucose and BOHB measurement in identifying patients with significant acidosis.

### Comparisons of biochemical parameters and diabetic ketoacidosis severity in adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^1166byoJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening acute complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. It can occur in both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes patients under stress conditions such as infection, surgery, and trauma, or under the administration of SGLT2 inhibitors. The mortality rate for patients with DKA is about 1%, and the rate rises to 5% in elderly patients. Multiple studies of DKA have been conducted in Caucasian populations, mainly with type 1 diabetes. However, a significant proportion of DKA in Asian populations occurs in type 2 diabetes, and it is unclear if the clinical courses of DKA of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in Asian populations differ.

The severity of DKA is generally classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to the American Diabetes Association. However, variations in the criteria exist among different professional societies. It should be noted that the severity criteria for DKA were mainly derived in Western countries, and it remains unclear whether the criteria are appropriate for Asian populations and whether the severity of DKA is associated with clinical characteristics, biochemical derangements, and outcomes in Asian populations. Furthermore, it is currently unknown whether the severity of DKA based on clinical and biochemical parameters differs in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Laboratory findings in DKA consist of hyperglycemia (> 250 mg/dL), high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and detection of serum ketone or urine ketone bodies. Three types of ketone bodies, acetoacet…

### Toxic alcohol ingestions: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^115BXWUQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol-related intoxications, including methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol, as well as alcoholic ketoacidosis, can present with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and an increased serum osmolal gap. However, isopropanol intoxication presents with hyperosmolality alone. The effects of these substances — except for isopropanol and possibly alcoholic ketoacidosis — are due to their metabolites, which can cause metabolic acidosis and cellular dysfunction. Accumulation of alcohols in the blood can lead to increased osmolality, while the accumulation of their metabolites can result in an increased anion gap and decreased serum bicarbonate concentration. The presence of both laboratory abnormalities concurrently is an important diagnostic clue, although either can be absent depending on the timing of blood sampling post-exposure.

In addition to metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure and neurologic disease can occur in some cases of intoxication. Dialysis to remove unmetabolized alcohol and possibly the organic acid anion can be beneficial in treating several alcohol-related intoxications. Administering fomepizole or ethanol to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase — a critical enzyme in the metabolism of these alcohols — is beneficial for treating ethylene glycol and methanol intoxication and possibly diethylene glycol and propylene glycol intoxication. Given the potentially high morbidity and mortality associated with these intoxications, it is important for clinicians to maintain a high degree of suspicion for these disorders in cases of high anion gap.

### Xigduo XR [^113HvAGX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who show signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Xigduo XR immediately, evaluate, and treat for ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor for resolution before restarting Xigduo XR.

Withhold Xigduo XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Xigduo XR once the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Xigduo XR and seek medical attention immediately if these occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Xigduo XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension.

### Significant ketoacidosis at autopsy: A single-centre systematic review [^113d2JBQ]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). High credibility.

To examine the value of vitreous beta-hydroxybutyrate and serum acetone in the investigation of sudden unexpected death, coroners' autopsy reports from a provincial UK city, with a population of approximately 900,000, over a 24-month period with significant ketoacidosis were studied. Demographic features, medical history, anatomical and histological findings, and biochemical parameters, including renal function, vitreous glucose, serum, and vitreous alcohol, were analysed.

Forty-two cases (28 males and 14 females) were identified; 55% had a history of alcohol and/or substance misuse, and mental health problems, particularly depression and anxiety, and 16% were diabetic. In all, 50% of subjects had alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA), 19% had diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and 12% had a history of both diabetes and alcohol abuse. In 19% of cases, an exact cause of ketoacidosis was established. In AKA, the subjects typically had low vitreous glucose and low or undetected blood alcohol levels. All of the subjects with raised vitreous glucose levels had DKA.

Ketoacidosis is relatively common and should be considered as a cause of sudden death, especially in alcoholic patients and patients with diabetes with no clear cause of death at autopsy.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1135r4eb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, especially with respect to potassium replacement, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend establishing adequate renal function, which is indicated by a urine output of approximately 0.5 mL/kg/h, and monitoring serum potassium levels for potassium replacement.

- **Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L**: Faster potassium replacement will require central venous access.

- **Serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mmol/L**: Administer 10–20 mmol/L potassium in each liter of IV fluid as needed to maintain serum potassium levels between 4–5 mmol/L.

- **Serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L**: Start insulin therapy but do not administer potassium. Assess serum potassium every 2 hours.

### Use of anion gap in the evaluation of a patient with metabolic acidosis [^113JDFth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

High anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, a common laboratory abnormality encountered in clinical practice, frequently results from the accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid, ketoacids, alcohol metabolites, and reduced kidney function. The cause of high AG metabolic acidosis is often easily established using historical and simple laboratory data. Despite this, several challenges in the diagnosis and management of high AG metabolic acidosis remain. These include quantifying the increase in AG, understanding the relationship between changes in AG and serum bicarbonate level, and identifying the cause of high AG metabolic acidosis when common causes are excluded.

This case highlights the importance of correcting AG for serum albumin level, using actual baseline AG rather than mean normal AG, understanding the relationship between changes in serum bicarbonate level and AG, and employing a systematic diagnostic approach to uncommon causes of high AG metabolic acidosis, such as 5-oxoproline acidosis (pyroglutamic acidosis).

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^116QT6D3]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Rationale**: Ketone bodies are usually present in urine and blood, but in very low concentrations (e.g. total serum ketones, < 0.5 mmol/L). Increased ketone concentrations detected in patients with known diabetes or in previously undiagnosed patients presenting with hyperglycemia suggest impending or established diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a medical emergency. The two major mechanisms for high ketone concentrations in patients with diabetes are increased production from triglycerides and decreased utilization in the liver. Both mechanisms are due to an absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased counter-regulatory hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, glucagon, and growth hormone.

	- The principal ketone bodies, β-hydroxybutyrate (βHBA) and acetoacetate (AcAc), are typically present in approximately equimolar amounts. Acetone, usually present in only small quantities, is derived from the spontaneous decarboxylation of AcAc. The equilibrium between AcAc and βHBA is shifted towards βHBA formation in any condition that alters the redox state of hepatic mitochondria to increase NADH concentrations, such as hypoxia, fasting, metabolic disorders (including DKA), and alcoholic ketoacidosis. Assay methods for ketones that do not include βHBA measurement may provide misleading clinical information by underestimating total ketone body concentration.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis with multiple complications: a case report [^115HCHhw]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis is a poorly diagnosed medical emergency usually identified in chronic alcohol misusers following an abrupt cessation or reduction of alcohol consumption. A high index of suspicion should be maintained by acute physicians, as response to treatment is rapid, with complete resolution of metabolic derangements. Complications are usually the result of not instituting the correct treatment or not addressing associated conditions. We describe a case of alcoholic ketoacidosis with multiple complications at presentation.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^116MTGQQ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes, present with hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. Blood glucose and blood ketone results are often used to triage patients with suspected DKA. This study aimed to establish how effective blood glucose and blood ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BOHB) measurements are in identifying patients with significant acidosis and sought to validate existing diagnostic BOHB thresholds.

- **Methods**: Initial Emergency Department results on 161 presumptive DKA episodes in 95 patients (42 F, 53 M, age range 14–89 years) containing a complete dataset of D (glucose), K (BOHB) and A (Bicarbonate [HCO₃] and pH) results.

- **Results**: Blood glucose correlated poorly with BOHB (r = 0.28, p = 0.0003), pH (r = -0.25, p = 0.002) and HCO₃ (r = -0.17, p = 0.04). BOHB, though better, was still limited in predicting pH (r = -0.44, p < 0.001) and HCO₃ (r = -0.56, p < 0.001). Findings indicated that neither BOHB nor glucose effectively stratified patients as acidemic (pH ≤ 7.3, HCO₃ ≤ 13.9mmol/L, n = 8), ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9), or either (n = 5).

- **Conclusions**: The commonly employed BOHB diagnostic cutoff of 3mmol/L could not be verified. Since acid-base status was poorly predicted by both glucose and BOHB, it highlights that, regardless of their results, pH and/or HCO₃ should also be tested in any patient suspected of DKA.

### Steglujan [^116FW1dT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Steglujan, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Steglujan.

Withhold Steglujan, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Steglujan when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue Steglujan and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Pancreatitis**: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking sitagliptin, a component of Steglujan. After initiation of Steglujan, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, Steglujan should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using Steglujan.

### Ketoacidosis is not always due to diabetes [^113AqPuz]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic alcoholism is a frequently unrecognized cause of ketoacidosis. Most patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis present with normal or low glucose levels, but this condition can also present with hyperglycemia, which can lead to a misdiagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and result in inappropriate treatment with insulin.

We describe a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with chronic pancreatitis secondary to excessive alcohol consumption, who was admitted with abdominal pain and vomiting and was found to fulfill the criteria for diabetic ketoacidosis. She was treated according to the diabetic ketoacidosis protocol and experienced a hypoglycemic attack within an hour of insulin initiation.

Upon reviewing her history, it was discovered that she had experienced three similar episodes over the past 12 months. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can present with hyperglycemia due to a relative deficiency of insulin and a relative surplus of counter-regulatory stress hormones, including glucagon. Awareness of the syndrome, along with a detailed history, helps differentiate alcoholic ketoacidosis from diabetic ketoacidosis and prevents iatrogenic hypoglycemia.

### The influence of hyperchloraemia on acid base interpretation in diabetic ketoacidosis [^114H2xD7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

During the acute treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, we determined the temporal incidence of hyperchloraemia and quantified its influence on the interpretation of common blood gas-derived acid-base parameters, namely base deficit and bicarbonate.

- **Design and setting**: Retrospective chart review in two regional paediatric intensive care units.

- **Measurements and results**: Stewart's physicochemical theory was used to develop regression equations quantifying the acidifying effect of hyperchloraemia on both base deficit and bicarbonate. These were then applied retrospectively to blood chemistry results from 18 children (median age 12.7 years, weight 43 kg) with diabetic ketoacidosis. Plasma ketonaemia was estimated using the albumin-corrected anion gap. The incidence of hyperchloraemia, as documented by a ratio of plasma chloride to sodium greater than 0.79, increased from 6% at admission to 94% after 20 hours of treatment. Correction for chloride produced a dramatic improvement in the relationship between changes in the anion gap versus both base deficit (from R² = 0.55 to R² = 0.95) and bicarbonate (from R² = 0.51 to R² = 0.96) during treatment. After 20 hours of treatment, the mean base deficit decreased from 24.7 mmol/l to 10.0 mmol/l; however, the proportion due to hyperchloraemia increased from 2% to 98%.

In conclusion, it is now possible, using a simple correction factor, to quantify the confounding effect of hyperchloraemia on both base deficit and bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis. This bedside tool may be a useful adjunct to guide therapy.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116vxCdp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly with respect to fluid resuscitation, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend determining hydration status and administering IV fluids according to the severity of hypovolemia:

- **Mild hypovolemia**: Use 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at a clinically appropriate rate, aiming to replace 50% of the estimated fluid deficit in the first 8–12 hours. Add 5% or 10% dextrose to the 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid when glucose levels reach a certain threshold. Start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid at the start of insulin treatment in euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (glucose < 200 mg/dL and positive β-hydroxybutyrate).

- **Severe hypovolemia**: Administer 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at 1.0 L/hr.

- **Cardiac compromise**: Implement hemodynamic monitoring and use pressors as necessary.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap, with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, is an important clue to exposure to toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol.

In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis.

It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of the osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and an increased serum osmolal gap, with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

### Qtern [^116sL3TC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Patient counseling information**: Qtern can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis, particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and those experiencing other forms of ketoacidosis. Inform patients that type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders, such as a history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery, are risk factors. Educate all patients on precipitating factors, such as insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, a ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse. Discuss symptoms of ketoacidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing. Note that blood glucose may be normal even with the presence of ketoacidosis.

- **Monitoring advice**: Advise patients that they may be asked to monitor ketones. If symptoms of ketoacidosis occur, instruct patients to discontinue Qtern and seek medical attention immediately [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].

- **Pancreatitis**: Inform patients that acute pancreatitis has been reported during post-marketing use of saxagliptin. Acute pancreatitis is characterized by persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and potentially accompanied by vomiting. Instruct patients to promptly discontinue Qtern and contact their healthcare provider if they experience persistent severe abdominal pain [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend modifying replacement fluids once the plasma glucose concentration is < 250 mg/dL (< 13.9 mmol/L). The fluids should contain 5–10% dextrose in addition to 0.9% sodium chloride to prevent hypoglycemia and allow continued insulin administration until the ketonemia is corrected. Plasma glucose concentrations usually decrease before the resolution of ketoacidosis, which typically occurs within 4–8 hours.

### Non-diabetic ketoacidosis: A case of alcoholic ketoacidosis accompanied by hyperglycemia [^1134prJU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) lacks specific clinical presentation. Blood tests commonly reveal hemoconcentration, elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels, and acidosis in patients with AKA. Herein, we report a case of AKA accompanied by hyperglycemia and review the related literature.

- **Case report**: AKA associated with hyperglycemia is rare, and its pathogenesis is similar to that of diabetic ketoacidosis, making differentiation challenging. Consequently, AKA is easily misdiagnosed by endocrinologists. The main symptoms in a 37-year-old female included hyperglycemia, elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels, and metabolic acidosis. Primary clinical presentations were severe nausea and vomiting. The patient, initially diagnosed with DKA, was eventually confirmed to have AKA and recovered after active therapy with rehydration and correction of hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, and ketosis.

This study provides a reference for clinicians to reduce missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis rates of AKA.

### Severe metabolic derangement: a case of concomitant diabetic ketoacidosis and beer potomania [^116oYFnC]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyponatraemia associated with beer potomania are severe diagnoses warranting intensive care level management. Our patient, a middle-aged man with a history of chronic alcohol abuse and insulin non-compliance, presents with severe DKA and severe hyponatraemia. Correcting sodium and metabolic derangements in each disorder requires significant attention to fluid and electrolyte levels. Combined, they prove challenging and require an individualized approach to prevent the overcorrection of sodium. Furthermore, management of these conditions highlights the importance of understanding the pathophysiology behind their hormonal and osmotic basis.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis caused by alcoholic pancreatitis and starvation ketosis [^112UNHfj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Starvation ketosis and pancreatitis are uncommon and underrecognized etiologies of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Euglycemic DKA is commonly associated with pregnancy, use of insulin en route to the hospital, and use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. A 58-year-old male with a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus and alcoholism presented with a chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake for several weeks. Despite an extensive history of diabetes and no recent SGLT-2 inhibitor use, his labs were consistent with euglycemic DKA. His imaging and clinical history also confirmed alcoholic pancreatitis. The patient was admitted for euglycemic DKA secondary to starvation ketosis and alcoholic pancreatitis. His anion gap and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels rapidly cleared with the initiation of the DKA protocol. This case teaches us that clinicians should consider early initiation of the DKA protocol even in the setting of euglycemia when a patient presents with high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, a high beta-hydroxybutyrate level, and a clinical picture of pancreatitis and starvation.

### A patient with alcoholic ketoacidosis and profound lactemia [^115ZZEPS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a complex syndrome that results from disrupted metabolism in the setting of excessive alcohol use and poor oral intake. Dehydration, glycogen depletion, a high redox state, and the release of stress hormones are the primary factors producing the characteristic anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OH) and lactate.

- **Case report**: We present the case of a 47-year-old man who arrived at the emergency department with metabolic acidosis and profoundly elevated lactate levels, diagnosed with AKA. He completely recovered with intravenous fluids and parenteral glucose administration.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Emergency physicians should always consider the immediately life-threatening causes of severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and treat aggressively based on the situation. This case highlights the fact that AKA can present with impressively elevated lactate levels. Emergency physicians should keep AKA in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with a similar clinical picture.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^113eLXyY]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Urine ketones**:
	1. **Preanalytical**: The concentrations of ketones in the urine of healthy individuals are below the detection limits of commercially available testing materials. False-positive results have been reported with highly colored urine and in the presence of several sulfhydryl-containing drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Urine test reagents deteriorate with exposure to air, giving false-negative readings. Therefore, testing material should be stored in tightly sealed containers and discarded after the expiration date on the manufacturer's label. False-negative readings have also been reported with highly acidic urine samples, such as after large intakes of ascorbic acid. Loss of ketones from urine attributable to microbial action can also cause false-negative readings. Because acetone is a highly volatile substance, samples should be kept in a closed container. For point-of-care analyses in medical facilities and for patients in the home setting, control materials (that give both negative and positive readings) are not commercially available but would be desirable to ensure accuracy of test results.

	2. **Analytical**: Several assay principles have been described. The most commonly used is the colorimetric reaction that occurs between AcAc and nitroprusside (sodium nitroferricyanide) to produce a purple color. This method is widely available in the form of dipsticks and tablets and is used to measure ketones in both the urine and blood (either serum or plasma). Several manufacturers offer dipsticks for measuring glucose and ketones.

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and other ketoacidosis**: In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, inform them that using Farxiga can increase their risk of life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis. For all other patients, inform them that Farxiga can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis and that type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are risk factors.

- **Educate all patients**: On precipitating factors (such as insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse) and symptoms of ketoacidosis (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing). Inform patients that blood glucose may be normal even in the presence of ketoacidosis.

- **Advise patients**: That they may be asked to monitor ketones. If symptoms of ketoacidosis occur, instruct patients to discontinue Farxiga and seek medical attention immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Volume depletion**: Inform patients that symptomatic hypotension may occur with Farxiga and advise them to contact their healthcare provider if they experience such symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Inform patients that dehydration may increase the risk for hypotension and to have adequate fluid intake.

### Blood β-hydroxybutyrate vs. urine acetoacetate testing for the prevention and management of ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: A systematic review [^112H9My1]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of Type 1 diabetes. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is now widely available as an alternative to urine acetoacetate testing for detecting ketosis. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of capillary or serum β-hydroxybutyrate compared with urine acetoacetate testing in the prevention and management of diabetic ketoacidosis.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL (until April 2012, no language restrictions, studies in humans) were searched for experimental and observational studies comparing the effectiveness of blood β-hydroxybutyrate and urine acetoacetate testing. Outcomes examined were the prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis, time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, healthcare costs, and patient or caregiver satisfaction. Additional sources included reference lists, conference proceedings, and contact with experts in the field.

- **Results**: Four studies (two randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies) met eligibility criteria, including 299 participants across 11 centers. Risk of bias was low to moderate. Blood ketone testing compared with urine testing was associated with reduced frequency of hospitalization (one study), reduced time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis (three studies), cost benefits (one study), and greater satisfaction (one study, intervention group only). No study assessed the prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. Meta-analysis could not be performed because of heterogeneity in study design and published data.

Conclusions are suggestive but not conclusive due to the variability of the studies and outcomes.

### Bedside detection of urine beta-hydroxybutyrate in diagnosing metabolic acidosis [^114YBuYr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

While critically important, the rapid identification of the etiology of metabolic acidosis (MA) may be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Alcoholic, starvation, and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (AKA, SKA, and DKA, respectively) may produce beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) in marked excess of acetone (ACET) and acetoacetate (AcAc). Unfortunately, urine dipstick technology poorly detects ACET and cannot measure BOHB. The inability to detect BOHB might delay therapy for ketoacidoses or provoke unnecessary evaluation or empiric treatment of other causes of MA, such as toxic alcohol poisoning. The authors tested the previous assertion that commonly available hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) would improve BOHB detection. The effectiveness of alkalinization and use of a silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) catalyst was also assessed.

- **Methods**: Control and urine test specimens containing from 0.5 to 800 mmol/L ACET, AcAc, and BOHB were prepared. Urine specimens were oxidized with H(2)O(2) (3%) 1:9 (H(2)O(2):urine), alkalinized with potassium hydroxide (KOH; 10%), exposed to AgNO(3) sticks, or altered with a combination of these methods in a random fashion. Three emergency physicians (EPs) blinded to the preparation technique evaluated urine dipsticks (Multistix, Bayer Corp.) placed in the specimens for "ketones".

- **Results**: Multistix detected AcAc appropriately; ACET was detected only at high concentrations of ≥ 600 mmol/L. Multistix failed to measure BOHB at all concentrations tested. H(2)O(2) improved urinary BOHB detection, although not to clinically relevant levels (40 mmol/L).

### Controversies around the measurement of blood ketones to diagnose and manage diabetic ketoacidosis [^111aUKuC]. Diabetes Care (2022). Low credibility.

The measurement of blood ketones, in preference to urine ketones, has become a well-established tool in the diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, there remains considerable disparity between diabetes guidelines regarding if, how, and when this test should be used. While recent guidelines mainly emphasize blood measurement, several issues nonetheless remain.

Many laboratories still measure blood ketones using a semiquantitative test that does not measure the predominant ketone, β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), which may hinder patient management. Even when BOHB is measured, the evidence for cutoffs used in DKA diagnosis or exclusion is limited, and its use in gauging severity, treatment progress, and resolution is not fully clear.

Lastly, although employing point-of-care meters instead of a laboratory for BOHB measurement brings undoubted benefits, this approach also has its own challenges. This article provides a perspective on these topics to complement recommendations and suggests how future research may improve its use in the DKA context.

### Update on measuring ketones [^116xm6bK]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). High credibility.

Ketone bodies are an energy substrate produced by the liver and used during states of low carbohydrate availability, such as fasting or prolonged exercise. High ketone concentrations can be present with insulin insufficiency and are a key finding in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). During insulin deficiency, lipolysis increases, leading to a flood of circulating free fatty acids that are converted in the liver into ketone bodies, mainly beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. During DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone in the blood. As DKA resolves, beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, the predominant ketone in the urine. Because of this lag, a urine ketone test might increase even as DKA is resolving.

Point-of-care tests are available for self-testing of blood ketones and urine ketones through the measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate and are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Acetone forms through spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate and can be measured in exhaled breath, but currently, no device is FDA-cleared for this purpose. Recently, technology for measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate in interstitial fluid has been announced.

Measurement of ketones can be helpful to assess compliance with low carbohydrate diets; acidosis associated with alcohol use; and, in conjunction with SGLT2 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, both of which can increase the risk of DKA. It can also help identify DKA due to insulin deficiency. This article reviews the challenges and shortcomings of ketone testing in diabetes.

### Qtern [^111DmsE2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Qtern, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Qtern.

Withhold Qtern, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Qtern when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue Qtern and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Pancreatitis**: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking saxagliptin. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), cases of definite acute pancreatitis were confirmed in 17 of 8240 (0.2%) patients receiving saxagliptin compared to 9 of 8173 (0.1%) receiving placebo. Pre-existing risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving saxagliptin and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo.

After initiation of Qtern, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue Qtern.

### Steglatro [^114x995h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Steglatro significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received a placebo; this risk may be greater with higher doses. Steglatro is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for four days.

### Metabolomics, stable isotopes, and A-β+ ketosis-prone diabetes [^115kMK23]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

First described in 1987 by Winter et al. as "atypical diabetes", A − β + ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) characterizes a group of primarily middle-aged individuals who come to medical attention due to an episode of spontaneous ketoacidosis (i.e. without evidence of infection, alcohol abuse, etc) and are subsequently diagnosed with diabetes. Although not exclusive to a particular ethnic group, KPD has primarily been reported in individuals of African descent, Hispanics, and groups traditionally classified as ethnic minorities. Experience from our county hospital in Dallas, Texas, suggests that among those who present with new-onset diabetes and ketoacidosis, 60% meet criteria for the diagnosis of KPD.

These patients generally lack evidence of endocrine pancreas autoimmunity (A −) and experience improved insulin secretory capacity (β +) and sensitivity after near-normalization of glycemia. Patients with KPD tend to be male and obese, typically with a family history of diabetes. Over time, this condition is characterized by a period of near-normoglycemia followed by sustained deterioration in glucose control and episodes of ketoacidosis. The metabolic perturbations leading to transient β-cell dysfunction and spontaneous ketoacidosis in individuals with KPD remain unclear. Insights into the extreme metabolic phenotype of KPD have the potential to enhance our understanding of more subtle metabolic derangements of type 2 diabetes.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^112DKyXG]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

When bicarbonate was correlated with pH (r = 0.79, p < 0.00001), 52 of 53 patients with pH levels ≤ 7.30 had bicarbonate levels ≤ 18 mmol/L. A beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) threshold of ≥ 3 mmol/L identified 104 of 118 subjects with pH levels ≤ 7.30. Among those with pH ≤ 7.30, 50% were hyperglycemic (glucose > 13.9 mmol/L, n = 8), ketonemic (≤ 3 mmol/L, n = 9), or either (n = 5). Reducing the diagnostic threshold for BOHB to ≥ 1.6 mmol/L identified 130 of the 133 (98%) subjects with bicarbonate concentrations ≤ 18 mmol/L but also a further 11 where bicarbonate was instead > 18 mmol/L.

There was no statistically significant linear relationship between serum creatinine concentration and BOHB, pH, or glucose (p = 0.45, p = 0.9, p = 0.17, respectively, n = 156), despite the potential analytical interference of ketones with serum creatinine. Similarly, there was no statistically significant linear relationship between serum urea, as a marker of circulatory volume, and BHB (p = 0.97) or pH (p = 0.86). There was a significant relationship between urea and glucose (p = 0.039), but the r squared was only 0.03.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis as a complication of methanol poisoning; a case report [^111yMWkm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Alcoholic beverages are prohibited in Islamic countries like Iran; therefore, methanol intoxication is rather prevalent in these countries. Methanol is essentially found in various household and industrial chemicals. Methanol poisoning often happens due to its accidental ingestion and can be fatal if left untreated. This intoxication should be included in differential diagnoses of any altered mental status.

In low-income countries, toxicologists face obstacles, including the lack of laboratory tests to detect blood levels of methanol and its metabolites, making the diagnosis and management more complicated. Methanol is not toxic per se; however, the accumulation of its active metabolite, formic acid, plays a major role in the development of metabolic acidosis. In the late stages of intoxication, cellular damage is due to acidosis and the histotoxic effect of formate, which is accompanied by the formation of free radicals.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening acute condition that more commonly occurs in type I diabetes. If DKA overlaps with high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) due to any other reason, it may become challengingly difficult to diagnose DKA.

In this case scenario, methanol poisoning was accompanied by DKA in a diabetic patient. Such a condition pronounces the hyperglycemic effect of methanol. On the other hand, DKA itself can be due to excessive exogenous acids like methanol. Additionally, stress-induced hyperglycemia is seen in critically ill and poisoned patients. In other words, increases in counter-regulatory hormones as a result of acute stress caused by poisoning may contribute to this condition.

### Synjardy [^117LCRAJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Empagliflozin, a component of Synjardy or Synjardy XR, significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, a life-threatening event beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to those who received placebo, and fatal ketoacidosis has occurred with empagliflozin. Notably, Synjardy and Synjardy XR are not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders, such as a history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery, are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Synjardy or Synjardy XR.

### Point-of-care capillary blood ketone measurements and the prediction of future ketoacidosis risk in type 1 diabetes [^116oyT6h]. Diabetes Care (2023). High credibility.

Rather than during illness while diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is developing, we aimed to determine if levels of routine point-of-care capillary blood ketones could predict future DKA.

- **Research design and methods**: We examined previously collected data from placebo-assigned participants in an adjunct-to-insulin medication trial program that included measurement of fasted capillary blood ketone levels twice per week in a 2-month baseline period. The outcome was 6- to 12-month trial-adjudicated DKA.

- **Results**: DKA events occurred in 12 of 484 participants at a median of 105 (interquartile range 43, 199) days. Maximum ketone levels were higher in patient cases compared with control patients (0.8 [0.6, 1.2] vs. 0.3 [0.2, 0.7] mmol/L; P = 0.002), with a nonparametric area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66–0.88). Ketone levels ≥ 0.8 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 64%, a specificity of 78%, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 2.9 and 0.5, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: This proof of concept that routine capillary ketone surveillance can identify individuals at high risk of future DKA implies a role for future technologies including continuous ketone monitoring.
