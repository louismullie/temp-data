## Question

Hemolytic anemia workup and differentials

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step approach to the workup and differential diagnosis of suspected hemolytic anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to recognize hemolysis clinically and from the history and exam. Then, I should confirm hemolysis biochemically with the core laboratory pattern. Next, I will classify the mechanism (immune versus nonimmune; intravascular versus extravascular) using the DAT and blood smear. After that, I need to branch the differential by mechanism: autoimmune causes, microangiopathic hemolysis, hereditary membranopathies and enzymopathies, hemoglobinopathies, infections, and drugs or toxins. Then, I should consider special populations (pregnancy/postpartum, pediatrics, transfusion/transplant). Finally, I will verify pitfalls (DAT-negative AIHA, pseudohemolysis), transfusion strategy, and targeted second-line testing including specialized and genetic assays, while highlighting management implications where appropriate [^111kLtJd].

> Let me first confirm the clinical suspicion from the history and physical exam, because jumping into testing without pretest context risks misinterpretation. Typical features include acute or subacute anemia symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea, tachycardia) with jaundice, dark urine suggesting hemoglobinuria, pallor, and sometimes splenomegaly; severe cases may have hypotension or angina, and I should check carefully for these red flags at the bedside [^111kLtJd]. I need to check the drug exposure history in detail (methyldopa, primaquine, apomorphine, nitrofurantoin, ribavirin, immune checkpoint inhibitors, among others), because this can immediately change the diagnostic path and management [^114xQpfX] [^117VCvtg] [^115BtTwG] [^112VmjhG]. I should confirm family and ethnic background for hereditary disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis or G6PD deficiency, since pretest probability and downstream testing depend on this context [^111z6yPq] [^117VCvtg]. I will now examine comorbidities and triggers for secondary AIHA (autoimmune disease, lymphoproliferative malignancy, infections), ask about pregnancy/postpartum for HELLP, and review transfusion and transplant history which can complicate immunohematology and alloimmunization patterns [^113YZYZW] [^115x8Nh8] [^114Hkxrs].

> Wait, let me verify the core laboratory definition of hemolysis before labeling any anemia as hemolytic. The canonical constellation is reticulocytosis indicating marrow response, elevated LDH, decreased haptoglobin, and increased unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin, often accompanied by morphologic clues on a peripheral smear; a low reticulocyte count in this setting should prompt me to reconsider marrow failure or combined processes rather than hemolysis alone [^111kLtJd]. Hold on, I should double-check that I include a CBC with indices, reticulocyte count or production index, LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, and a competent smear review, aligning with broader anemia workups that also incorporate iron indices and inflammatory markers when the picture is mixed or unclear [^112qcPhA].

> I will now examine the peripheral smear because its immediate clues can narrow mechanisms rapidly while I am still awaiting immunohematology. Spherocytes push me toward hereditary spherocytosis or warm AIHA and should be correlated with DAT and family history, whereas schistocytes indicate microangiopathic hemolysis or mechanical destruction and should raise urgency for TTP/HUS/HELLP or device-related hemolysis; bite cells and Heinz body precursors suggest oxidative hemolysis such as G6PD deficiency or oxidant drugs, so I should confirm exposures and consider G6PD testing once the acute episode allows reliable interpretation [^111kLtJd] [^111z6yPq] [^115x8Nh8]. But wait, I must not overcall these features in isolation; smear patterns must be interpreted alongside clinical context and the full hemolytic panel to avoid anchoring bias [^111kLtJd].

> Next, I should review the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) to distinguish immune from nonimmune hemolysis, but hold on, I should verify the specifics of DAT reactivity because it changes my pathway. Warm AIHA typically shows IgG positivity, whereas cold agglutinin processes often show C3 positivity; in suspected cold disease, I should ensure specimens are handled warm and pursue cold agglutinin testing and, when positive, obtain titers and thermal amplitude in a laboratory with appropriate expertise, per BSH guidance [^114KFrir] [^1155E4cJ]. I need to remember that DAT-negative AIHA exists and requires modified DAT protocols or enhanced methods before excluding immune hemolysis; automatic reflex algorithms that add reticulocyte counts and DATs in new normocytic anemias can avert delays in recognition, and definitional heterogeneity in the literature underscores the need to correlate serology with the biochemistry of hemolysis and exclusion of alternatives [^112F5SPX] [^1156YiHZ] [^114KmstF].

> If immune hemolysis is likely, I should confirm potential secondary causes and initiate evidence-based therapy without delay when clinically warranted. Warm AIHA is most common, often idiopathic or associated with autoimmune diseases or lymphoproliferative disorders; corticosteroids are first-line, and for steroid-refractory disease or specific contexts, rituximab and other immunosuppressants are considered per guideline-directed care while I continuously reassess hemolysis markers and transfusion needs [^113YZYZW] [^112G3Jgb]. Let me consider special scenarios: in IBD with secondary AIHA or immune dysregulation, combining steroids with a steroid-sparing immunosuppressant may be recommended, and in CVID, maintenance IVIG can be indicated when immunosuppression or splenectomy are used; I should verify these nuances against BSH recommendations before finalizing the plan [^1139e9Ew] [^1165hTFp] [^112j7YGk].

> But wait, what if the hemolysis is drug-induced; I need to check this rigorously because the treatment is often to stop the culprit. Methyldopa can cause a positive DAT and rarely hemolytic anemia; if Coombs-positive hemolysis occurs, discontinuation is required, and I should anticipate crossmatch complexities if both direct and indirect Coombs tests are positive, coordinating closely with transfusion medicine [^114xQpfX] [^116N8KRd]. Apomorphine has postmarketing reports of immune-mediated hemolysis, so new anemia on this drug warrants a hemolysis workup and consideration of discontinuation; hydroxyurea can rarely induce hemolysis and should be stopped if confirmed; primaquine mandates baseline G6PD testing and careful monitoring given predictable oxidant risk in deficiency states, with timing of testing and re-exposure decisions individualized to risk-benefit [^115BtTwG] [^113u8xzE] [^117VCvtg]. I should double-check for other implicated medications and toxins if the first pass is unrevealing because omissions here can lead to unnecessary invasive workups [^112VmjhG].

> Let me now consider nonimmune intrinsic red cell causes when the DAT is negative and the smear suggests a membrane or enzyme defect. Hereditary spherocytosis and other membranopathies need targeted testing such as EMA binding and osmotic fragility, guided by phenotype and family history; importantly, splenectomy is not universally effective or safe, so I should avoid reflexively recommending it and instead align with modern management frameworks [^111z6yPq]. If I suspect pyruvate kinase deficiency in chronic, unexplained Coombs-negative hemolysis, I should order a PK activity assay but remember transfusions can artifactually normalize activity; calculating a PK/hexokinase ratio and then confirming with genetic testing helps avoid false negatives, and the enzyme activity does not neatly predict severity, so I must integrate clinical trajectory into decisions [^114sLq5i]. When phenotypes are overlapping or tests are limited locally, a curated next-generation sequencing panel can clarify diagnoses across heterogeneous hereditary hemolytic anemias, but I should interpret variants within a clinical-genetic framework to avoid misattribution [^111WUkxf] [^115f9yjX] [^111ejCYa].

> Hold on, I should verify microangiopathic hemolysis promptly because delays are dangerous. Schistocytes with thrombocytopenia and organ injury point toward TTP/HUS or pregnancy-related TMAs such as HELLP; in pregnancy or postpartum, microangiopathic processes can mimic primary TMAs, so serial assessment and multidisciplinary management are essential while I align laboratory and clinical evolution with the likely syndrome and initiate appropriate urgent therapy pathways [^111kLtJd] [^115x8Nh8] [^113h9JG1] [^116FbXGC]. I need to ensure that I am not anchoring solely on pregnancy status; mechanical hemolysis from devices or valves can present similarly and should be kept in the differential when schistocytes are present without immune features [^111kLtJd].

> Next, I should review special populations to avoid missed diagnoses. In children, microcytic anemia is common, but normocytic anemia with a high reticulocyte count should cue me to hemolysis; a structured pediatric approach integrates indices, reticulocytes, and smear with history, and neonatal anemia requires a tailored differential including hemolytic disease of the newborn, infections, congenital hemolytic disorders, and iatrogenic causes, so I must confirm age-specific patterns and testing strategies [^113rxHok] [^1152gK26] [^116DbepM]. I will now examine whether newborn screening results, family history, and ethnicity modify pretest probabilities for inherited hemolytic anemias before ordering specialized tests to minimize delays and costs [^113rxHok].

> I need to ensure safe transfusion support in active hemolysis, especially AIHA, where every crossmatch may be incompatible due to autoantibodies. Transfusions should not be withheld in unstable patients, but I must collaborate closely with transfusion medicine to exclude alloantibodies, select the best-matched units, and monitor carefully; this is distinct from trauma emergency release because the immunohematologic context is fundamentally different [^1122WpXg]. If methyldopa exposure is present with positive direct and indirect Coombs tests, I should anticipate crossmatch problems and seek expert input early to avoid delays when transfusion is urgent [^116N8KRd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could apparent hemolysis be an artifact. Plasma discoloration from drugs or other substances can mimic hemolysis on visual inspection; I should confirm true hemolysis with the biochemical panel and smear rather than relying on appearance alone, and I should differentiate hemoglobinuria from hematuria when patients report dark urine, as misclassification can misdirect the workup [^112jbdNQ] [^111kLtJd]. I should double-check preanalytic variables and sample handling, particularly when evaluating cold agglutinin disease, to avoid spurious results that could derail interpretation [^1155E4cJ].

> I will now examine longitudinal risks and preventive care because evaluation is not the endpoint. Some hereditary hemolytic anemias carry risk of iron overload even without transfusions, warranting screening strategies; conversely, indiscriminate splenectomy can cause harm and must be individualized with appropriate vaccination and infection risk counseling and assured revaccination follow-up if performed [^111z6yPq] [^116aGYoQ] [^111fcDfF] [^111wrMKP]. Let me verify that any planned surgical or immunosuppressive interventions align with guideline-based prophylaxis, timing, and monitoring to minimize complications downstream [^111fcDfF] [^111wrMKP].

> To synthesize, let me reconsider the algorithm and ensure no steps are missing. Start with suspicion based on symptoms and history including drugs, family, and comorbidities; confirm hemolysis with reticulocytosis, LDH, haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin; read the smear for spherocytes, schistocytes, or bite cells; use the DAT and targeted cold testing to classify immune versus nonimmune while remembering DAT-negative AIHA; branch to immune, microangiopathic, hereditary, infectious, or drug-induced pathways; address special populations; avoid pitfalls and coordinate transfusion; and deploy second-line and genetic tests when needed, all while iteratively validating each inference against evolving clinical and laboratory data [^111kLtJd].

Initial workup for suspected hemolytic anemia includes a **CBC with reticulocyte count** [^111kLtJd], LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, and a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) [^113YZYZW] [^114KFrir] to **confirm hemolysis** and **distinguish immune from non-immune causes** [^114KmstF]. A **peripheral smear** is essential [^111kLtJd] to identify schistocytes, spherocytes, or sickled cells, pointing to TMAs, hereditary spherocytosis, or sickle cell disease, respectively [^111z6yPq]. If the DAT is positive, classify as **warm or cold AIHA** [^114KFrir] [^113YZYZW]; if negative, evaluate for hereditary membrane or enzyme defects, hemoglobinopathies, or TMAs with ADAMTS13 and complement studies [^111z6yPq] [^116CqG8D]. Additional tests include a G6PD assay [^117VCvtg], hemoglobin electrophoresis [^111wbP4h], and Coombs testing for drug-induced hemolysis [^112G3Jgb]; consider bone marrow [^113h86KQ] or genetic testing if the diagnosis remains unclear [^111WUkxf]. The differential includes immune (AIHA, drug-induced) [^111kLtJd], hereditary (spherocytosis, G6PD deficiency, sickle cell), and acquired non-immune causes (TTP, HUS, DIC, infections, mechanical hemolysis) [^112VmjhG].

---

## Clinical presentation and initial assessment

Patients with hemolytic anemia typically present with fatigue, pallor, and jaundice [^111kLtJd], often accompanied by dark urine due to hemoglobinuria and splenomegaly from increased red blood cell destruction. Severe cases may develop acute dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypotension [^1122WpXg]. Initial assessment should include a **thorough history** [^111kLtJd] (including family history, drug exposure, recent infections, and transfusion history) and **physical examination** [^113h86KQ].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

### Initial laboratory tests

The following tests **confirm hemolysis** and assess severity [^111kLtJd]:

| **Test** | **Expected findings in hemolysis** |
|-|-|
| Hemoglobin/hematocrit | Decreased |
| Reticulocyte count | Increased (reticulocytosis) |
| Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) | Elevated |
| Haptoglobin | Decreased or undetectable |
| Indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin | Elevated |
| Peripheral blood smear | Abnormal RBC morphologies (schistocytes, spherocytes, sickled cells) |
| Direct antiglobulin test (DAT, Coombs test) | Positive in immune-mediated hemolysis |

---

### Direct antiglobulin test (DAT)

The DAT is critical for differentiating immune-mediated from non-immune hemolytic anemia: a **positive DAT** [^113YZYZW] indicates immune-mediated hemolysis (autoimmune hemolytic anemia, drug-induced hemolysis, transfusion reactions), while a **negative DAT** suggests non-immune causes (hereditary membrane defects, enzyme deficiencies, hemoglobinopathies, mechanical hemolysis) [^114KmstF] [^114KFrir].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Classify causes as **immune-mediated** or **non-immune-mediated** [^111kLtJd]:

---

### Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia

- **Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)**: Warm AIHA (IgG-mediated), cold agglutinin disease (IgM-mediated) [^113YZYZW], mixed AIHA, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria [^113A6kWJ] [^112j7YGk].

- **Drug-induced hemolysis**: Methyldopa [^116N8KRd], penicillin, cephalosporins, quinidine [^112G3Jgb], dapsone, nitrofurantoin, primaquine.

- **Transfusion reactions**: Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions [^1122WpXg] [^113YZYZW].

---

### Non-immune-mediated hemolytic anemia

- **Hereditary membrane defects**: Hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary stomatocytosis [^111z6yPq].

- **Enzyme deficiencies**: G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency [^114sLq5i], hexokinase deficiency.

- **Hemoglobinopathies**: Sickle cell disease, thalassemias, unstable hemoglobins [^111ejCYa] [^113YZYZW] [^115XnfEq].

- **Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)**: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [^116CqG8D], disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), HELLP syndrome [^115x8Nh8] [^113YZYZW].

- **Mechanical hemolysis**: Prosthetic heart valves, mechanical circulatory support devices, march hemoglobinuria [^112VmjhG].

- **Infections**: Malaria, babesiosis, Clostridium perfringens sepsis [^111kLtJd] [^113YZYZW].

---

## Advanced diagnostic tests

If initial tests are inconclusive, **additional specialized tests** may be required:

- **G6PD assay**: For suspected G6PD deficiency [^117VCvtg].

- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: For hemoglobinopathies [^111wbP4h].

- **Enzyme assays**: Pyruvate kinase, hexokinase [^114sLq5i].

- **ADAMTS13 activity**: For TTP.

- **Complement studies**: For paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: For suspected marrow disorders [^113h86KQ].

- **Genetic testing**: For hereditary hemolytic anemias [^111WUkxf].

---

## Clinical pearls and pitfalls

**DAT-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia** [^114KmstF] can occur. If suspicion remains high, repeat the DAT with sensitive methods [^112F5SPX]. Always **review medication history** carefully for potential drug-induced hemolysis [^112G3Jgb]. **Schistocytes on the peripheral smear** suggest TTP, HUS, or DIC and require urgent management [^113h9JG1]. For suspected hereditary hemolysis, a detailed family history and consideration of genetic testing are crucial [^111z6yPq].

---

A structured workup for hemolytic anemia includes **confirming hemolysis**, **differentiating immune from non-immune causes**, and using targeted tests to identify the underlying etiology. This approach enables accurate diagnosis and appropriate management [^115StMcR].

### Diagnosis and clinical management of red cell membrane disorders [^111z6yPq]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2021). High credibility.

Heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders and hydration defects often present with the common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia. However, they may require substantially different management based on their pathophysiology. An accurate and timely diagnosis is essential to avoid inappropriate interventions and prevent complications. Advances in genetic testing availability within the last decade, combined with extensive foundational knowledge on RBC membrane structure and function, now facilitate the correct diagnosis in patients with a variety of hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs).

Studies in patient cohorts with well-defined genetic diagnoses have revealed complications such as iron overload in hereditary xerocytosis, which is amenable to monitoring, prevention, and treatment. It has also been demonstrated that splenectomy is not always an effective or safe treatment for any patient with HHA. However, a multitude of variants of unknown clinical significance have been discovered by genetic evaluation, requiring interpretation by thorough phenotypic assessment in clinical and/or research laboratories.

Here, we discuss genotype-phenotype correlations and corresponding clinical management in patients with RBC membranopathies and propose an algorithm for the laboratory workup of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia. A clinical case that exemplifies such a workup is also included.

### Hemolytic anemia: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction.

Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies.

Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^113YZYZW]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) autoantibodies are a relatively uncommon cause of anemia. However, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) must be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemolytic anemias, especially if the patient has a concomitant lymphoproliferative disorder, autoimmune disease, or viral or mycoplasmal infection.

Classifications of AIHA include warm AIHA, cold agglutinin syndrome, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, mixed-type AIHA, and drug-induced AIHA. Characteristics of the autoantibodies are responsible for the various clinical entities. As a result, diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation and a serologic work-up.

For each classification of AIHA, this review discusses the demographics, etiology, clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, and treatment options.

### Erythroid-intrinsic activation of TLR8 impairs erythropoiesis in inherited anemia [^1124iXxE]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Anemia is the most prevalent hematological abnormality detected in children, classified into inherited and acquired anemia. Inherited anemia is further subcategorized into inherited hemolytic anemia and inherited non-hemolytic anemia. Defects of the erythrocytes, such as membrane or hemoglobin (Hb) disorders and metabolic abnormalities, constitute the primary causes of inherited hemolytic anemia. Conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis, β-thalassemia, and pyruvate kinase deficiency exemplify these defects. In contrast, inherited non-hemolytic anemia, such as Diamond–Blackfan anemia (DBA), congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA), and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA), results in erythroid hypoproliferation or ineffective erythropoiesis in the bone marrow with multiple etiologies. For example, DBA results from specific mutations in genes encoding ribosome proteins (e.g. RPS19 and RPL5) or involved in ribosomal biosynthesis (e.g. TSR2), representing one of the most common forms of inherited non-hemolytic anemia. CDA, characterized by inefficient erythropoiesis, is caused by mutations in genes including CDAN1, C15orf41, SEC23B, and KIF1, among others. These belong to a heterogeneous group of congenital anemias due to the interference with erythroid differentiation and proliferation. Additionally, mutations in other genes, such as GATA1, EPO, TP53, and ADA2, have also been reported to be involved in inherited non-hemolytic anemia. Nonetheless, the causative genes for some patients with inherited anemia remain enigmatic. Unraveling the pathogenesis underlying these conditions is critical for advancing our understanding and treatment of these disorders.

### Anemocheck-LRS: An optimized, color-based point-of-care test to identify severe anemia in limited-resource settings [^11266BzA]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

This study has two important conclusions. First, AnemoCheck-LRS performed very well in measuring Hb concentrations commonly found in limited-resource settings (Hb 2–8 g/dL) and, more importantly, was highly sensitive in recognizing severe and profound anemia. Although AnemoCheck-LRS performed well on its own, we analyzed the data further to identify an AnemoCheck-LRS result that could serve as a cutoff value where the likelihood of profound anemia requiring transfusion is high. We identified a slight shift in the hemoglobin color result (to the color corresponding to 6.0 g/dL in Fig. 1a) on the AnemoCheck-LRS as a "cutoff" threshold that would correctly identify 99% of cases of profound anemia where blood transfusion may be needed.

The interpretation of the AnemoCheck-LRS could be reconsidered to provide a binary result rather than an exact hemoglobin estimation. For example, if the AnemoCheck-LRS color is at or below this orange color (Fig. 1a), the interpretation would be "high likelihood of requiring blood transfusion; consider transfusion if clinically indicated, or further confirmatory testing if available", and if the color is above the orange range, the result could read "low likelihood of profound anemia requiring transfusion, unless additional clinical concerns are present".

This strategy would help to rapidly identify those that may need transfusion, limit unnecessary transfusions, and reduce the number of complete blood counts performed, thereby conserving the limited and expensive reagents required for more elaborate laboratory equipment.

### Establishing pediatric and adult RBC reference intervals with NHANES data using piecewise regression [^113RW7HY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

RBC laboratory values are among the most important clinical tests used by health care providers for diagnosing diseases, monitoring various medical conditions, and assessing nutritional status. Anemia, diagnosed with data from the CBC, is a global health problem affecting about 25% of the population worldwide, with the highest prevalence among preschool-aged children and pregnant women. In a survey of female US Army personnel, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia immediately following basic combat training has been reported to be about 21%, with higher prevalence among Hispanic and African-American military personnel than among white military personnel. Anemia is typically identified by the presence of low hemoglobin levels; however, other CBC measures, particularly RBC parameters, are surrogate measures of iron availability and are essential for optimal classification, monitoring, and management of anemia. Measures collected as part of the CBC parameters are also used as a screening tool for a wide range of conditions and diseases, including infection, inflammation, neoplasia, and systemic disease, and are markers for specific types of leukemia.

RBC reference intervals determine the upper and lower limits for normal test results and are typically defined as 95% (± 2.5% upper and lower limits) of the measured values from a healthy population. They provide baseline values that are used to interpret clinical laboratory test results and for diagnosis and disease management. RBC parameters vary with demographic factors such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and other characteristics.

### The diagnosis and management of primary autoimmune haemolytic anaemia [^1174E6hE]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). High credibility.

For specific cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, particularly concerning pregnant patients and postnatal care, the BSH 2017 guidelines recommend following up with the infant for 6 weeks to monitor for late-onset anemia.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population, adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear, with subcategories including microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias. These categories are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination, along with appropriate laboratory test results, can aid in detecting the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to assist physicians in properly evaluating children to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### The diagnosis and management of primary autoimmune haemolytic anaemia [^116CoQVo]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). High credibility.

When investigating the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, specifically in relation to the cold agglutinin test, the BSH 2017 guidelines recommend that all cases of suspected primary cold agglutinin disease should be reviewed by an appropriately constituted hemato-oncology multidisciplinary team.

### Real-world insights from a cohort of approximately 2000 individuals who were analysed using a freely available next-generation sequencing anaemia screening programme [^111WUkxf]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Diagnostic techniques for hereditary haemolytic anaemias (HHAs) are diverse. These include red blood cell (RBC) indices, reticulocyte counts, osmotic fragility, eosin-maleimide binding tests, or measurement of RBC enzyme activity. However, some methods are technically complex or unavailable to non-specialist centres, making definitive diagnoses difficult. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) may provide a platform to diagnose a range of HHAs and overlapping clinical entities through extensive, simultaneous evaluation of multiple disease-causing genes. Inaccurate diagnosis of HHAs can have serious implications, highlighting the potential clinical utility of NGS in supplementing routine diagnostic techniques.

A real-world diagnostic programme for patients with a suspected HHA disease or carrier status, excluding haemoglobinopathies, has been available since 2018 (ARUP Laboratories® 2018–2020, AnemiaID®/Revvity, Inc.® 2020–present) to provide a diagnosis using an NGS panel of HHA-associated genes. Here, we describe genetic testing results from this real-world programme to evaluate the clinical utility of NGS in supporting the diagnosis of suspected HHAs. In total, this programme evaluated 2003 individuals between 3 December 2020 and 23 February 2023.

Clinical indications for testing varied among patients, ranging from unexplained or unspecified anaemia or hyperbilirubinaemia to specific diagnoses indicated by prior clinical testing. It also included patients with a family history of haemolytic anaemia. Individuals were referred for testing based on clinicians' judgement.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm³ (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia.

Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered.

If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Methyldopa [^114xQpfX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

It is important to recognize that a positive Coombs test, hemolytic anemia, and liver disorders may occur with methyldopa therapy. The rare occurrences of hemolytic anemia or liver disorders could lead to potentially fatal complications unless properly recognized and managed. It is crucial to read this section carefully to understand these reactions.

With prolonged methyldopa therapy, 10 to 20 percent of patients develop a positive direct Coombs test, usually occurring between 6 and 12 months of methyldopa therapy. The lowest incidence is at a daily dosage of 1 g or less. On rare occasions, this may be associated with hemolytic anemia, which could lead to potentially fatal complications. It is not possible to predict which patients with a positive direct Coombs test may develop hemolytic anemia.

The prior existence or development of a positive direct Coombs test is not in itself a contraindication to the use of methyldopa. If a positive Coombs test develops during methyldopa therapy, the physician should determine whether hemolytic anemia exists and whether the positive Coombs test may pose a problem. For example, in addition to a positive direct Coombs test, there is less often a positive indirect Coombs test which may interfere with cross-matching of blood.

Before treatment is started, it is desirable to perform a blood count (hematocrit, hemoglobin, or red cell count) for a baseline or to establish whether there is anemia. Periodic blood counts should be conducted during therapy to detect hemolytic anemia. It may be useful to perform a direct Coombs test before therapy and at 6 and 12 months after the start of therapy.

### Treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemias [^115jG1WJ]. Haematologica (2014). High credibility.

In the United States, the prevalence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia is estimated at 17 per 100,000 population.

### Siklos [^113u8xzE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported. Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis. These tests include the measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, and unconjugated bilirubin levels, along with urinalysis and direct and indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) tests. In the setting of a confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia not related to the disease and in the absence of other causes, discontinue Siklos.

### How I manage acquired pure red cell aplasia in adults [^116QKnvN]. Blood (2021). Low credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare hematological disorder with multiple etiologies. The multifaceted nature of this disease is emphasized by the variety of concomitant clinical features. Classic idiopathic presentation aside, prompt recognition of pathogenetic clues is important because of their diagnostic and therapeutic implications. As a consequence, treatment of PRCA is diverse and strictly dependent on the presented clinical scenario.

Here, we propose a series of clinical vignettes that showcase instructive representative situations derived from our routine clinical practice. Using these illustrative clinical cases, we review the diagnostic workup needed for a precise diagnosis and the currently available therapeutic options, discussing their applications in regard to the various PRCA-associated conditions and individual patients' characteristics. Finally, we propose a treatment algorithm that may offer guidance for personalized therapeutic recommendations.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: A systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^115PLhwK]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Our study has limitations, primarily due to the reliance on published case reports and small retrospective studies, which may be subject to publication bias and incomplete reporting. Furthermore, the diagnostic heterogeneity — such as different testing platforms, methodologies, and reagents, as well as various immunohematologic criteria for diagnosing mixed AIHA — across studies complicates direct comparisons. Many reports defined mixed AIHA based on a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) for both IgG and complement, without stringent thermal amplitude testing or additional immunohematologic assessments, such as serum and elution studies, precluding further analysis.

Acutely ill patients may exhibit a positive DAT that is not necessarily due to an autoantibody, making it essential to differentiate true mixed AIHA from incidental serologic findings. Given the variability in diagnostic approaches, the true prevalence and clinical impact of mixed AIHA remain uncertain. Although a strict framework was used to identify reviewed cases, the diagnosis of mixed AIHA remains controversial due to the range of immunohematology and clinical findings described with the condition.

Furthermore, the broad timeframe over which the included studies were published (1975–2024) poses challenges in comparing treatment strategies, as advancements in medical management have evolved significantly over time. Finally, while some patients with acute, severe disease may be treated with faster-acting therapies, including bendamustine, eculizumab, and therapeutic plasma exchange, our review did not separately analyze these patients.

### Anemia in infants and children: Evaluation and treatment [^113rxHok]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age.

Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate.

### Management of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in low-to-middle income countries: Current challenges and the way forward [^115TvFkL]. The Lancet Regional Health, Southeast Asia (2024). Low credibility.

Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is a common term for several disorders that differ in terms of aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment. Therapy is becoming increasingly differentiated and evidence-based, with several new established and investigational therapeutic approaches emerging in recent years. While these developments have led to therapeutic improvements, they also necessitate increased medical and financial resources for optimal diagnosis, subgrouping, and individualization of therapy. This includes the use of more advanced laboratory tests and expensive drugs.

In this brief Viewpoint review, we first summarize the diagnostic workup of AIHA subgroups and the respective therapies currently considered optimal. We then compare these principles with real-world data from India, the world's largest nation by population and a typical low-to-middle income country. We identify major deficiencies and limitations in general and laboratory resources, real-life diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic practices. Incomplete diagnostic workup, overuse of corticosteroids, lack of access to more specific treatments, and poor follow-up of patients are more common than exceptions. Although it might not seem realistic to resolve all challenges, we outline some steps towards improved management of patients with AIHA.

### Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and direct antiglobulin testing with a false-negative result in a 53-year-old man: The DAT will set you free [^112F5SPX]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA), the most common of the relatively uncommon autoimmune-mediated hemolytic anemias (AIHAs), is mediated by polyclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)G autoantibodies in most cases. Herein, we present a case of WAIHA involving a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) with an initially negative result. Using a modified DAT protocol, repeat testing of the same specimen material from a previously healthy 53-year-old man yielded positive results. This case demonstrates that investigation of an apparently negative DAT result plays a critical role in the differential diagnosis of patients with rapidly progressing hemolytic anemia and the reversal of that decline.

### Automatic laboratory-initiated reflex testing to identify patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^1156YiHZ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical usefulness of automatic laboratory-initiated testing of patients with recent-onset normocytic anemia to diagnose autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is uncertain. During a 28-month period, we performed 784,185 CBC counts. Patients without a history of anemia had reticulocyte count testing if hemoglobin values were less than 10 g/dL. Of the 784,185 CBC counts, 3,841 (0.49%) revealed recent-onset normocytic anemia, with 424 (11.04%) having reticulocyte counts of 2% or more. Of those with elevated reticulocyte counts, 52 (12.3%) had positive DAT results. Patient information was available for 40 patients. Physicians were unaware of the existence of AIHA in 33 (83%) of them. Of the 40 patients, 11 (28%) were treated with steroids and 6 (15%) were hospitalized; in 2 patients (5%), medications were stopped because they were suspected to have caused the hemolytic anemia. Automatic laboratory testing for patients with recent-onset normocytic anemia ensures recommended practices, probably saves physician visits, and, for some patients, results in more timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Defining autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a systematic review of the terminology used for diagnosis and treatment [^114KmstF]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

The terminology applied to autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) seems inconsistent. We aimed to evaluate the consistency of definitions used for diagnosis and treatment. In this systematic review of literature from January 2006 to December 2015, we assessed heterogeneity in the definition of AIHA and its subtypes, refractory disease, disease phase, severity, criteria for treatment response, and response durability. A Medline search for anemia, hemolytic, autoimmune was supplemented with keyword searches. Main exclusions were conference abstracts, animal and non-English studies, and studies with fewer than 10 cases. Of 1,371 articles retrieved, 1,209 were excluded based on titles and abstracts. Two authors independently reviewed 10% and 16% of abstracts and full papers, respectively. After the full-paper review, 84 studies were included.

AIHA was most frequently (32 out of 61, 52%) defined as hemolytic anemia with a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and exclusion of alternatives, although 10 of these also recognized DAT-negative AIHA. A lower threshold for the diagnosis of DAT-negative AIHA was observed in literature on chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Definitions of anemia, hemolysis, and exclusion criteria showed substantial variation. Definitions of primary/secondary cold agglutinin disease/syndrome were not consistent. Forty-three studies provided criteria for treatment response; apart from studies from one center, these were almost entirely unique. Other criteria were rarely defined. Only 7, 0, 3, 2, 2, and 3 studies offered definitions of warm AIHA, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, mixed AIHA, and AIHA.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC, particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history, and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to pediatric and adult hematology practices. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most cases will be acquired, especially in adult patients, but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step in the diagnostic process is defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up. This can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex.

In this article, a general approach for evaluating patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered is outlined. Two clinical vignettes are presented to introduce the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. The rationale for the different types of clinically available tests, their limitations, and the challenges frequently encountered in the interpretation of results are described. Additionally, guidance is provided on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. The goal is to furnish the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### Clinical and epidemiological features of paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria: A systematic review [^113A6kWJ]. Blood Advances (2023).

We acknowledge that this review may not be exhaustive because cases that may have been clinically compatible with PCH but lacked confirmatory laboratory testing were excluded. Furthermore, there are known reporting biases in the medical literature; for example, patients with mild disease may not have been diagnosed or hospitalized, and thus these results may be skewed to patients with more severe findings.

This analysis comprised the largest cohort of patients with PCH described in the English language at the time of writing. Its implications include the importance of recognizing the most common patient population, using the most appropriate diagnostic modality, and illustrating that additional research is necessary to elucidate whether corticosteroids and/or other therapeutic measures are indeed effective. In summary, we highlight several important clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic features of patients with PCH, demonstrating the importance of maintaining this condition in the differential for patients with hemolysis. This point is aptly illustrated by Heddle, who described one hospital that had diagnosed no cases of PCH over a six-year period, yet following a single PCH diagnosis, four additional cases were identified in the ensuing nine months.

Although the pathophysiology of PCH is well described, diagnosis and management remain challenging. Hematologists and transfusion medicine specialists should be familiar with the clinical and laboratory findings of this disease. This review highlights the temporal association with infectious agents, immunohematologic details, and outcomes.

### Anemocheck-LRS: An optimized, color-based point-of-care test to identify severe anemia in limited-resource settings [^111Wkkpv]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The second important conclusion was the superiority of AnemoCheck-LRS over the WHO HCS as a diagnostic tool for severe and profound anemia. Our data demonstrate that for samples with very low Hb levels, the WHO HCS consistently overestimated the true hemoglobin level and was an insensitive screening test for either severe (Hb ≤ 7 g/dL) or profound (Hb ≤ 5 g/dL) anemia.

In summary, this study demonstrated the possible utility of the AnemoCheck-LRS as a screening tool for severe and profound anemia in limited-resource settings. In addition, the results from HemoCue 201+ were very highly correlated with the gold standard and may be used as a reasonable substitute gold standard for future field studies of the AnemoCheck-LRS. These results were obtained in a controlled laboratory environment in the United States, and further field testing in limited-resource settings is necessary, including patients with various causes of anemia to ensure that the performance of the test remains strong regardless of the cause of anemia. Ideally, future studies should focus on the clinical utility of the AnemoCheck-LRS as a hemoglobin threshold screening tool to identify and manage patients with profound anemia requiring transfusion.

### How I treat hypoxia in adults with hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic disorders [^115XnfEq]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies are caused by genetic mutations that result in abnormal hemoglobin molecules, leading to hemolytic anemia. Chronic complications involving the lung parenchyma, vasculature, and cardiac function in hemoglobinopathies result in impaired gas exchange, which causes tissue hypoxia. Hypoxia is defined as a deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body and is prevalent in patients with hemoglobinopathies; its cause is often multifactorial. Chronic hypoxia in hemoglobinopathies is often a sign of disease severity and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoxia in these disease processes is important to appropriately treat the underlying cause and prevent complications.

In this article, we discuss management of hypoxia based on three different cases: sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, and hereditary spherocytosis. These cases are used to review the understanding of the disease pathophysiology, demonstrate the importance of a thorough clinical history and physical examination, explore diagnostic pathways, and review the management.

### Drugs and conditions that may mimic hemolysis [^112jbdNQ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Visual inspection of posttransfusion plasma for hemolysis is a key laboratory method in the investigation of possible acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (AHTRs). Many substances and physiological conditions can mimic hemolysis in vitro. Isolated reports describe specific cases of interference, but a comprehensive listing is lacking.

- **Methods**: Using an illustrative case, we summarize available literature on substances and conditions that may mimic hemolysis in vitro. We further describe other substances and conditions that may discolor plasma but are unlikely to be mistaken for hemolysis upon visual inspection.

- **Results**: At least 11 substances and conditions have been reported to discolor plasma, in colors ranging from orange to red to brown, including relatively common therapies such as eltrombopag, hydroxocobalamin, and iron dextran. Other substances are unlikely to be encountered in everyday practice but may mimic hemolysis in particular patient populations. Additional substances may cause plasma discoloration, ranging from blue to green to white, and are associated with a wide variety of therapies and conditions.

- **Conclusions**: An awareness of the possible preanalytic confounding factors that may mimic hemolysis can aid in the workup of a suspected AHTR. Reviewing the medical record, utilizing ancillary testing, and considering nonimmune causes of hemolysis can aid in ruling out AHTR.

### Apokyn [^115BtTwG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hemolytic anemia**: Hemolytic anemia requiring hospitalization has been reported with apomorphine treatment in the postmarketing setting. Many of the reported cases included a positive direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test), suggesting a potential immune-mediated hemolysis. Severe anemia, angina, and dyspnea have occurred with hemolytic anemia. Some patients were treated with high-dose glucocorticoids or blood transfusions. Hemolytic anemia can appear at any time after apomorphine treatment. If a patient develops anemia while taking Apokyn, consider a workup for hemolytic anemia. If hemolytic anemia occurs, consider discontinuing Apokyn treatment.

- **Impulse control/compulsive behaviors**: Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including Apokyn, that increase central dopaminergic tone and are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, or other urges while being treated with Apokyn. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: A systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^1151Cpjd]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

Future research efforts should focus on the development and implementation of standardized diagnostic criteria for mixed AIHA and the establishment of prospective, multicenter registries to better characterize this rare condition. Immunohematology evaluation should include characterization of both the warm and cold components, including serum and elution studies, cold agglutinin titers, and thermal amplitude testing. While antibody titer testing may be more widely available, titers are subject to wide inter- and intra-laboratory variation, and future research should investigate the effect of changes in thermal amplitude over the course of therapy on clinical outcomes.

Importantly, there is a pressing need for clinical recommendations that guide a standardized diagnostic approach, not only to improve case definitions for research but also to inform treatment selection and monitor therapeutic response. Diagnostic inconsistencies across studies have contributed to challenges in interpreting treatment efficacy, as the lack of detailed immunohematologic characterization obscures whether observed outcomes reflect true therapeutic effects or underlying diagnostic heterogeneity. Future recommendations should emphasize incorporating comprehensive immunohematology testing into both initial and longitudinal patient evaluations, ideally with defined testing protocols that can be adopted across institutions. Without such diagnostic rigor, clinicians and researchers cannot reliably determine whether treatments are effective or ineffective, hindering both evaluation and response strategies.

### Hemolytic anemia: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^112VmjhG]. American Family Physician (2018). High credibility.

Hemolytic anemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including:

- **Infections and infestations**: malaria infection, congenital syphilis, bartonellosis, babesiosis

- **Genetic and congenital conditions**: pyruvate kinase deficiency, hereditary stomatocytosis, sickle cell disease, hemoglobin H disease, congenital hemolytic anemia with Heinz bodies, hemoglobin E disease, erythropoietic protoporphyria, beta-thalassemia

- **Immune-mediated and hemolytic conditions**: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, warm antibody hemolytic anemia, cold agglutinin disease, hemolytic disease of the newborn

- **Physical and mechanical factors**: viperidae snake bites, March hemoglobinuria, atrial myxoma

- **Metabolic and nutritional disorders**: hypophosphatemia, sitosterolemia, scurvy

- **Miscellaneous conditions**: hypersplenism, favism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, myelofibrosis, gastric cancer, ovarian teratoma

Various medications have been identified as potential causes of hemolytic anemia:

- **Medications**:

- **Antimalarials and antibiotics**: quinine, quinidine ER, artemether/lumefantrine, nitrofurantoin, nitrofurantoin macrocrystals, rifampin
- **Cancer and immunomodulatory therapies**: venetoclax, pembrolizumab, alemtuzumab, imatinib, arsenic trioxide
- **Antipsychotics and pain relievers**: chlorpromazine, mefenamic acid, diclofenac sodium, diclofenac sodium DR, phenazopyridine
- **Miscellaneous drugs**: ribavirin, penicillamine, micafungin, metaxalone, dapsone, captopril, zidovudine, apomorphine, cetirizine, repaglinide

### The variable manifestations of disease in pyruvate kinase deficiency and their management [^114sLq5i]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) should be suspected in patients presenting with an unexplained chronic Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia following an unrevealing standard hemolytic anemia evaluation. Tests to be considered in this situation are outlined in the figures not included here. The stepwise approach to diagnosing patients with chronic unexplained hemolytic anemia involves performing a pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme assay as the first test in cases of suspected PKD. Although it is a useful and inexpensive screening test, PK enzyme activity assays have several limitations. Recent transfusions can result in falsely normal enzyme activity since PK enzyme activity is red cell age-dependent. Consequently, cases of suspected PKD with a normal PK enzyme assay should also be evaluated further by calculating the PK/hexokinase ratio.

- **PK/HK ratio significance**: This ratio relates PK activity to the activity of hexokinase, another red cell age-dependent enzyme used as an internal standard. A decreased PK/hexokinase ratio is suspicious for PKD and warrants further investigation with genetic testing. It is clinically relevant to note that PK enzyme activity has not been shown to correlate with disease severity.

In addition, this case demonstrates the complexity of enzymatic and genomic diagnosis in pyruvate kinase deficiency.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: A systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^114upjva]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Data management**: Search results were managed in EndNote 21. Title and abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction were performed in Covidence and Microsoft Excel. Review author pairs independently screened the titles and abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria. Full reports were obtained for all titles that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria or where there was any uncertainty. Review author pairs then independently screened the full-text reports for inclusion or exclusion. Discrepancies were adjudicated by a review author not involved in the discrepancy.

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: Eligible studies included randomized and non-randomized trials, cross-sectional studies, retrospective and prospective cohort analyses, case–control analyses, case series, and case reports. Reviews were assessed for additional cases not identified in our primary literature search. There was no time limit, and articles in any language were included if they could be translated using a web-based translation system such as Google Translate. Studies were required to present data on patients with mixed AIHA, categorized as either "definite" or "possible/probable" cases. We used guidance from both the British Society of Haematology and the First International Consensus Meeting to inform how we defined mixed AIHA. Cases lacking sufficient laboratory data were excluded.

For specific circumstances of iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), evaluation according to the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommends obtaining an anemia workup if the hemoglobin is below normal. This workup should include at least the following: red blood cell (RBC) indices such as red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration.

For a more extensive workup, include serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Pattern of hemolytic anemia among Egyptian pediatric emergency department patients [^114etVpS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

The emergency department is considered the backbone of the medical service offered in any hospital, yet the data on the frequency of pediatric hematological presentation is scanty. Anemia occurs in 9% to 14% of pediatric emergency department (ED) patients. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency affects more than 400 million people worldwide. Unfortunately, there is no screening program for G6PD deficiency in Egypt. The aim of this study is to assess the burden of hemolytic crisis among Egyptian children visiting the ED.

This is a prospective cross-sectional study among children presenting with acute hemolytic crisis in the ED of New Children Hospital, Cairo University, from March to June 2016. Cases underwent full history taking, clinical examination, and laboratory tests based on the clinical judgment of the resident. We categorized the presenting hemolytic anemias into three groups: G6PD deficiency, acute hemolysis in previously diagnosed patients with chronic hemolytic anemia, and acute undiagnosed hemolytic anemia.

Our study included 143 patients, 109 males (76.22%) and 34 females (23.76%), with a mean age of 36 months (range, 3–188 months), who presented with hemolytic anemia in the ED. Seventy-six cases (53.1%) were diagnosed as G6PD deficiency, 36 (25.2%) were diagnosed with chronic hemolytic anemia, and 31 (21.7%) were diagnosed as undiagnosed acute hemolytic anemia.

Hemolytic anemia is a very common presentation in the ED. G6PD deficiency is the most common cause, representing 53.1% of the hemolytic anemia.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Y5frp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocyte count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count, and leucocyte count. To differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to examine the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic, normocytic, or microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help identify the various causes of anemia.

In clinical practice, it must be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in a single patient. For example, coexisting iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), lab tests can indicate a microcytic or even macrocytic anemia. This exemplifies that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not exclude the possibility of iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia but are typically normal in ACD.

The RDW illustrates how much the erythrocytes vary in size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within the normal range in thalassemia.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: A systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^111DMrRp]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by the premature destruction of autologous red blood cells (RBCs) due to autoantibody-mediated hemolysis. The etiology of AIHA is multifaceted. Cases are typically considered either primary or secondary to conditions such as autoimmune diseases, infections, malignancies, or drug exposure. AIHA may be categorized based on the optimal thermal reactivity of the autoantibodies involved, resulting in distinct subtypes including warm AIHA, cold AIHA (i.e. cold agglutinin disease or cold agglutinin syndrome), mixed AIHA, and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH). Among these, warm AIHA is the most prevalent, accounting for over two-thirds of adult cases, whereas mixed AIHA, although less common, remains clinically significant.

Mixed AIHA is characterized by the presence of both warm (IgG)- and cold (IgM)-reactive autoantibodies, resulting in a complex and often treatment-resistant clinical presentation. Reports suggest that mixed AIHA accounts for fewer than 10% of AIHA cases, though its true incidence is difficult to ascertain due to inconsistencies in diagnostic criteria across studies. Some studies have proposed that mixed AIHA imparts a more severe clinical course, often necessitating multiple lines of therapy and leading to increased transfusion dependence. However, the rarity of the condition — coupled with the variability in laboratory definitions and diagnostic methodologies — continues to hinder a comprehensive understanding of its epidemiology and optimal management.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and red blood cell autoantibodies [^113x8rDZ]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a rare disorder caused by autoreactive red blood cell (RBC) antibodies that destroy RBCs. Although autoimmune hemolytic anemia is rare, RBC autoantibodies are encountered frequently and can complicate transfusion workups, impede RBC alloantibody identification, delay distribution of compatible units, have clinical significance that ranges from benign to life-threatening, and may signal an underlying disease or disorder. In this review, we discuss the common presenting features of RBC autoantibodies, laboratory findings, and ancillary studies that help the pathologist investigate the clinical significance of autoantibodies. We also explore how to provide appropriate patient care and consultation for clinical colleagues. Pathologists must be mindful of, and knowledgeable about, this entity because it not only facilitates direct clinical management but also offers an opportunity to preemptively treat an otherwise silent malignancy or disorder.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^114Hkxrs]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for aplastic anemia, specifically in relation to hemopoietic stem cell transplantation and the management of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, the ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining C1q testing both before and after desensitization in patients with donor-specific antibodies. This applies to cases with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than 2,000 in haploidentical HSCT and greater than 1,000 MFI in single cord blood transplantation. It is also advisable to consider obtaining a flow cytometric crossmatch as an alternative.

### The diagnostic dilemma of congenital unstable hemoglobinopathies [^111ejCYa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Unstable hemoglobin variants represent a rare etiology of congenital hemolytic anemia. Without a high index of suspicion, along with proper laboratory testing and interpretation, the correct diagnosis can be elusive. We report on five children who were initially thought to have other congenital disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis or thalassemia, before β-globin gene sequencing led to the definitive diagnosis. Recognizing the variable clinical presentation and laboratory data reported will aid clinicians in the diagnosis of unstable hemoglobin variants in children with atypical forms of hemolytic anemia, particularly those with low pulse oximetry values or whose hemoglobin electrophoresis suggests β-thalassemia trait.

### Hepatic infarction induced by HELLP syndrome: A case report and review of the literature [^115x8Nh8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

HELLP syndrome occurs in about 20% of patients with severe preeclampsia. The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome can be made through typical laboratory test results, including signs of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia with platelet counts less than 100,000 cells/µl, and elevated levels of AST, ALT, and lactate dehydrogenase. These are associated with clinical manifestations such as right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, malaise, headache, and edema. Some women with HELLP syndrome may, however, be asymptomatic.

In this case, the presence of proteinuria, pregnancy-induced hypertension, edema, elevated liver enzyme levels, decreased platelet count, decreased hemoglobin, and rapidly increased serum creatinine and urea supported the criteria for both preeclampsia (PE) and HELLP syndrome. Nonetheless, the pathogenesis of both PE and HELLP remains unknown. Fortunately, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and plasma exchange were effective for the patient. Following hormone therapy and supportive treatments, the damaged areas of the liver recovered, and the patient showed improvement.

Liver infarction is a rare consequence of HELLP syndrome. A CT scan, which shows peripherally wedge-shaped inhomogeneous areas of low attenuation with enhanced vessels coursing through these areas, may be useful for differential diagnosis. Based on the clinical manifestations, CT images, and other laboratory tests (e.g. normal levels of glucose and blood ammonia), we could rule out other diagnoses and make a definite diagnosis of HELLP syndrome with liver infarction.

In conclusion, we reported a patient diagnosed with HELLP syndrome accompanied by hepatic infarction.

### Differential diagnosis and management of anemia in the newborn [^1152gK26]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Neonatal anemia is a condition with a diverse etiologic spectrum. Therefore, in order to form a focused differential diagnosis, it is important for the caregiver to have some knowledge of the more common causes of low hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in the neonate. Proper history taking, physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic tests can narrow this focus and aid in establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cancer-related anemia, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, ASCO/ASH 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests for baseline evaluation for anemia in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy:

- **Thorough drug exposure history**: Details of medication use should be gathered to identify potential causes of anemia.

- **Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow examination**: Conducted in some cases to assess blood cell morphology and marrow function.

- **TIBC, transferrin saturation, ferritin, folate, vitamin B12, hemoglobinopathy screening**: Performed where indicated to evaluate iron status and potential deficiencies.

- **Reticulocyte count, assessment for occult blood loss, and renal insufficiency**: These tests help in understanding anemia's pathophysiology.

- **Baseline EPO level**: This measurement can provide insight into erythropoietin production and responsiveness.

- **Serum TSH**: Conducted where indicated to assess thyroid function, which can impact erythropoiesis.

- **Direct Coombs test**: Recommended in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or a history of autoimmune disease to evaluate for autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

- **CBC**: Including MCH, MCV, platelet count, and hemoglobin concentration.

- **Absolute reticulocyte count**: To assess bone marrow responsiveness, if indicated.

- **Assessment of iron status**:
	- Percentage of hypochromic RBCs, if the processing of the blood sample is possible within 6 hours.
	- Reticulocyte hemoglobin count or equivalent tests, such as reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent.
	- Combination of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin if the previous tests are not available or the patient has thalassemia or thalassemia trait.

- **Serum ferritin**: To assess iron stores.

- **Serum CRP**: To assess possible inflammation.

### Primaquine phosphate [^117VCvtg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Hemolytic anemia may occur in individuals with G6PD deficiency and those with a family or personal history of favism. Regions with a high prevalence of G6PD deficiency include Africa, Southern Europe, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Individuals from these regions have a greater tendency to develop hemolytic anemia due to a congenital deficiency of erythrocytic G6PD while receiving primaquine and related drugs.

Due to the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, G6PD testing must be performed before using primaquine. Before initiating treatment, baseline hemoglobin and hematocrit levels should be obtained. In the case of severe anemia, the G6PD test and the decision on treatment with primaquine should be postponed until recovery.

Physicians must be aware of the residual risk of hemolysis due to the limitations of G6PD tests. Adequate medical support and follow-up to manage hemolytic risk should be available, especially for individuals with a personal or family history of hemolytic anemia.

- **Patients with G6PD deficiency**: Primaquine phosphate tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe G6PD deficiency. In cases of mild to moderate G6PD deficiency, the decision to prescribe primaquine must be based on an assessment of the risks and benefits. If primaquine administration is considered, baseline hematocrit and hemoglobin levels must be checked before treatment, and close hematological monitoring (e.g. on days 3 and 8) is required. Adequate medical support to manage hemolytic events should be in place.

### How I treat autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^115StMcR]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is an uncommon entity that presents diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic dilemmas despite being a well-recognized entity for over 150 years. This is due to significant differences in the rates of hemolysis and associated diseases, as well as considerable clinical heterogeneity. Additionally, there is a lack of clinical trials required to refine and update standardized and evidence-based therapeutic approaches.

To aid clinicians in AIHA management, we present four vignettes that highlight distinct clinical presentations with separate diagnostic and therapeutic pathways that we use in our clinical practice setting. We also review the parameters present in diagnostic testing that allow for prognostic insight and present algorithms for both diagnosis and treatment of AIHA patients in diverse situations. This is done with the hope that this review may offer guidance regarding personalized therapy recommendations.

A section is included for the diagnosis of suspected AIHA with negative test results, a relatively infrequent but challenging situation, to assist in the overall evaluation spectrum for these patients.

### Diagnosis and management of rare congenital nonimmune hemolytic disease [^115f9yjX]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Rare, congenital nonimmune hemolytic disorders of the erythrocyte, although uncommon, are important causes of anemia in children and adults. These are a heterogeneous group of diseases that disrupt normal erythrocyte structure and function in varying ways. The predominant issues are abnormalities of hemoglobin stability, defects of erythrocyte metabolism, and disorders of erythrocyte hydration. Unstable hemoglobinopathies may lead to chronic or episodic hemolysis. Perturbation of critical enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway leads to altered erythrocyte metabolism and chronic hemolysis. Disorders of erythrocyte hydration are an under-recognized cause of hemolytic anemia.

Beyond pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease, clinical, laboratory, and genetic heterogeneity characterize this group of disorders. They are often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. This review discusses pathophysiology, inheritance, clinical findings, laboratory manifestations, and management considerations in several rare nonimmune hemolytic diseases, including unstable hemoglobins, disorders of erythrocyte metabolism, and abnormalities of erythrocyte hydration.

### Laboratory evaluation and transfusion support of patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^1122WpXg]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Although some autoantibodies do not cause hemolysis and their workup is performed routinely, others might lead to life-threatening hemolysis. In the latter situation, the pathologist often is involved in the urgent decision to transfuse before completion of the evaluation. However, every effort must be made to exclude the presence of alloantibodies, as this identification of RBC autoantibodies is less common than alloantibody identification, and the evaluation often requires techniques and expertise available only in specialized laboratories.

Unlike emergency release of units for trauma victims, an autoantibody by definition will react with all units in the inventory; thus, all crossmatches are expected to be incompatible. To avoid additional untoward consequences of transfusion, there must be close communication between the consulting pathologist and the clinician, as well as close monitoring of the patient during and after transfusion.

This review is intended to serve as a guide to general pathologists in the appropriate evaluation and interpretation of laboratory tests in the diagnosis and management of autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

### The conundrum of postpartum thrombotic microangiopathy: case report and considerations for management [^116FbXGC]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias and thrombocytopenias in pregnant or postpartum women present an interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the evaluation of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), where urgent care must be considered.

- **Case presentation**: We report the case of a 21-year-old Somali woman who underwent an emergency caesarean section at 35 weeks of gestational age. She presented with acute dyspnea, placental abruption, and gross edema due to severe preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome. After delivery, she developed acute kidney failure and thrombotic microangiopathy, as revealed by kidney biopsy. The lack of early response to plasma exchange prompted extensive laboratory workup. Ultimately, the patient completely recovered with a negative fluid balance and control of severe hypertension.

- **Conclusions**: This case report emphasizes the importance of differentiating between primary TMA syndromes and microangiopathic hemolytic anemias due to systemic disorders. Delayed recovery from preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome and malignant hypertension can clinically mimic primary TMA syndromes in the postpartum period.

### Methyldopa [^116N8KRd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

If Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia occurs, the cause may be methyldopa and the drug should be discontinued. Usually, the anemia remits promptly; if not, corticosteroids may be given and other causes of anemia should be considered. If the hemolytic anemia is related to methyldopa, the drug should not be reinstituted.

When methyldopa causes Coombs positivity, either alone or with hemolytic anemia, the red cell is usually coated with gamma globulin of the IgG (gamma G) class only. The positive Coombs test may not revert to normal until weeks or months after methyldopa is stopped.

Should the need for transfusion arise in a patient receiving methyldopa, both a direct and an indirect Coombs test should be performed. In the absence of hemolytic anemia, usually only the direct Coombs test will be positive. A positive direct Coombs test alone will not interfere with typing or cross-matching. If the indirect Coombs test is also positive, problems may arise in the major cross-match, and the assistance of a hematologist or transfusion expert will be needed.

Occasionally, fever has occurred within the first 3 weeks of methyldopa therapy, associated in some cases with eosinophilia or abnormalities in one or more liver function tests, such as serum alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT), bilirubin, and prothrombin time. Jaundice, with or without fever, may occur, with onset usually within the first 2 to 3 months of therapy. In some patients, the findings are consistent with those of cholestasis, while in others, they align with hepatitis and hepatocellular injury.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: A systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^114BDygQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare and clinically complex hematologic disorder defined by the simultaneous presence of both warm and cold autoantibodies, resulting in severe and often treatment-resistant hemolysis. Due to variability in diagnostic criteria and limited data, a comprehensive understanding of its epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and management remains incomplete. To address these gaps, we performed a systematic literature review employing stringent diagnostic criteria to evaluate epidemiologic patterns, clinical features, and therapeutic outcomes.

Our analysis included 81 patients identified across 35 studies, revealing a median age of 45 years and a notable female predominance (2.25:1). Autoimmune diseases constituted the most frequent underlying etiology, followed by hematologic malignancies and infections. Patients exhibited significant anemia, with median nadir hemoglobin levels reaching 5.6 g/dL. Corticosteroids represented the most common therapeutic intervention; however, only 43% of patients achieved remission, while 37% experienced chronic hemolysis, and mortality reached 11%.

Many patients required multiple lines of therapy, including rituximab and cytotoxic agents, highlighting the disease's refractory nature and management complexity. The substantial variability in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches emphasizes an urgent need for standardized diagnostic criteria, earlier integration of combination therapies, and exploration of innovative treatment modalities. Future prospective, multicenter studies are essential.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^113GnUWL]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for aplastic anemia, specifically hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, the ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend the recognition of the following considerations for the identification of anti-HLA antibodies in allogeneic HSCT:

- **Cell-based assays**: These are now infrequently used due to limitations in both sensitivity and specificity, and the requirement for viable donor lymphocytes.

- **Solid-phase immunoassays**: These are increasingly utilized as they can reliably identify antibodies, even with HLA-allele specificity, including HLA-DQ- and HLA-DP-specific antibodies. Solid-phase assays are typically semiquantitative unless titration is performed. However, they are limited by cost.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^112RQe65]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests based on the initial assessment to diagnose the cause of anemia in selected cases:

- **Serum B12 and serum folate concentrations**: These tests help in identifying possible deficiencies that could contribute to anemia.

- **Tests for hemolysis**: This includes measuring plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, LDH, bilirubin, and conducting a Coombs' test. These are crucial to rule out hemolytic causes of anemia.

- **Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis**: This test is essential for assessing the presence of abnormal proteins that might indicate underlying conditions.

- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: This is used to detect abnormalities in hemoglobin that may lead to anemia.

- **Free light chains and bone marrow examination**: These tests are recommended for more in-depth analysis if the initial evaluation suggests more complex underlying issues.

### Aranesp [^116zRTUV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Lack or loss of hemoglobin response to Aranesp**: For a lack or loss of hemoglobin response to Aranesp, initiate a search for causative factors (e.g. iron deficiency, infection, inflammation, bleeding). If typical causes of lack or loss of hemoglobin response are excluded, evaluate for pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. In the absence of PRCA, follow dosing recommendations for managing patients with an insufficient hemoglobin response to Aranesp therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

- **Pure red cell aplasia**: Cases of PRCA and severe anemia, with or without other cytopenias that arise following the development of neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin, have been reported in patients treated with Aranesp. This has been reported predominantly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) by subcutaneous administration. PRCA has also been reported in patients receiving ESAs for anemia related to hepatitis C treatment (an indication for which Aranesp is not approved).

	- If severe anemia and low reticulocyte count develop during treatment with Aranesp, withhold Aranesp and evaluate patients for neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin. Contact Amgen (1–800–77-AMGEN) to perform assays for binding and neutralizing antibodies. Permanently discontinue Aranesp in patients who develop PRCA following treatment with Aranesp or other erythropoietin protein drugs. Do not switch patients to other ESAs.

- **Serious allergic reactions**: Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, skin rash, and urticaria, have been reported.
