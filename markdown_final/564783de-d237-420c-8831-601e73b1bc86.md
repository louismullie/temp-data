## Question

Which one of the NSAIDs is safe for kidney failure patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which NSAID is safe for kidney failure patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "kidney failure" means clinically in terms of eGFR thresholds and dialysis status. Then, I should verify whether any NSAID is truly "safe" in this population or if the correct framing is risk minimization. Next, I will review comparative renal safety signals across specific NSAIDs, including COX-2 selective agents. After that, I need to check guideline positions and FDA labeling for high-risk CKD and advanced renal disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring and alternatives, and I will double-check for any exceptions or edge cases I might miss.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. "Kidney failure" generally corresponds to advanced CKD with eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², including end-stage kidney disease on dialysis, where renal hemodynamics are compromised and patients rely on compensatory prostaglandin-mediated mechanisms that NSAIDs can blunt, increasing risks of AKI, hyperkalemia, sodium retention, and progression of CKD [^113mghML].

> Wait, let me verify the core principle before naming any drug. No NSAID is categorically "safe" in kidney failure; the correct approach is to avoid NSAIDs when possible, and if absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring, because all NSAIDs can impair renal perfusion via prostaglandin inhibition and carry dose- and duration-dependent nephrotoxic risk [^11366CiG] [^1137WjKP] [^111GTg8P].

> I will now examine comparative renal safety signals across specific NSAIDs. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — COX-2 selectivity does not confer renal safety. Multiple analyses and guidelines indicate celecoxib has fewer renal adverse events than ibuprofen but similar risk to naproxen, and overall COX-2 inhibitors have renal profiles comparable to nonselective NSAIDs, so there is no renal-safe NSAID class [^116sjyWs] [^117JAGGv] [^113FKM95].

> Let me consider individual agents briefly. Celecoxib shows a lower renal event rate versus ibuprofen in PRECISION-era analyses, but it remains contraindicated or not recommended in severe renal insufficiency by FDA labeling, which applies to eGFR below about 30 mL/min/1.73 m², so it cannot be considered safe in kidney failure even if it is relatively safer than ibuprofen [^116sjyWs] [^1162MgPm] [^116ayrHH] [^1158BK29]. Ibuprofen and other traditional NSAIDs carry explicit warnings against use in advanced renal disease, reinforcing that none are appropriate in kidney failure without exceptional justification and monitoring [^112QjFzU] [^115s1xox] [^111vcHjj].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to ensure alignment. The VA/DoD CKD guideline advises avoiding NSAIDs when eGFR is 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or less, and if a short course is used for compelling indications, it should be time-limited with explicit monitoring plans and shared decision-making, which practically means no NSAID is "safe" in kidney failure [^11366CiG] [^111rWUiu]. KDOQI similarly recommends avoiding NSAIDs when GFR is below 30 and exercising great caution even above that threshold, again underscoring that there is no preferred NSAID in advanced CKD [^1158BK29].

> But wait, what if the pain is localized osteoarthritis and a topical agent could help? I need to check that. Topical NSAIDs, particularly diclofenac gel, reduce systemic exposure to roughly 1% of oral levels and have RCT safety data showing no signal for serious kidney events over 4–12 weeks, though even topical therapy carries a small, nonzero AKI risk and should be preferred over oral NSAIDs when an NSAID must be used, with attention to skin integrity and comorbidities [^115gRSjH] [^113AJFLS] [^11663mZo].

> I should double-check alternatives because the question implies we might be forced to choose among NSAIDs. Acetaminophen remains first-line for mild to moderate pain in CKD when not contraindicated by liver disease, with dose adjustments in advanced CKD and vigilance for total daily dose limits to avoid hepatotoxicity; nonpharmacologic therapies and condition-specific options should be prioritized to avoid NSAID exposure altogether [^113Y7MNH] [^1158fgCQ] [^112P19vk].

> Let me synthesize a direct answer, but I will keep verifying the nuance. There is no NSAID that is safe for patients with kidney failure; if an NSAID is absolutely necessary after shared decision-making, celecoxib at the lowest dose for the shortest possible time with close monitoring is a relatively safer oral choice compared with ibuprofen, whereas topical diclofenac is the preferred NSAID formulation to minimize systemic exposure, and all of this remains contraindicated or strongly discouraged in severe CKD unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and monitoring is assured [^116sjyWs] [^115gRSjH] [^11366CiG].

> I need to ensure practical safeguards are explicit. Before any NSAID trial in advanced CKD, check baseline eGFR, electrolytes, and volume status; avoid concomitant nephrohemodynamic stressors like RAAS inhibitors and diuretics when possible or increase monitoring frequency; limit to under 14 days if used; and recheck renal function and potassium within a week of initiation, with immediate cessation if creatinine rises or hyperkalemia develops, recognizing that NSAID-induced injury is often reversible with prompt discontinuation [^11366CiG] [^113mghML] [^11663mZo].

> Hold on, I should verify edge cases. Even in dialysis, residual renal function can be harmed by NSAIDs, and fluid and blood pressure control are more tenuous, so avoidance remains the rule; rare, short-course use may be considered only with nephrology input and tight monitoring, reinforcing that there is still no "safe" NSAID in kidney failure [^111xnHqa] [^11366CiG].

> In conclusion, I need to be clear and consistent. No NSAID is safe for kidney failure; prioritize non-NSAID strategies, consider topical diclofenac if an NSAID must be used for localized pain, and if an oral NSAID is unavoidable, celecoxib may carry a somewhat lower renal risk than ibuprofen but remains contraindicated in severe renal insufficiency and requires the lowest dose, shortest duration, and vigilant monitoring, with full shared decision-making about uncertain benefits and meaningful harms [^115gRSjH] [^116sjyWs] [^1162MgPm] [^11366CiG].

There is **no NSAID that is safe for patients with kidney failure** (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or on dialysis) because all NSAIDs can cause acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, and progression of CKD [^1158BK29] [^111xnHqa] [^1137WjKP]. If pain control is essential, use the **lowest effective dose for the shortest duration** and monitor renal function and electrolytes closely [^11366CiG]. Prefer **acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs** (e.g. diclofenac gel) when possible, and avoid ibuprofen, naproxen, ketorolac, and COX-2 inhibitors in advanced CKD [^115gRSjH] [^112QjFzU] [^116aUVWZ] [^1162MgPm].

## Risks associated with NSAID use in kidney failure

NSAIDs **impair renal perfusion** by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, which can precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI), hyperkalemia, sodium retention, and progression of CKD [^111NimAT]. These risks are amplified in kidney failure due to reduced baseline renal reserve and common comorbidities (e.g. heart failure, hypertension, diabetes) [^111NimAT].

## Specific NSAIDs and their renal risks

| **Nsaid** | **Renal risks in kidney failure** | **Clinical evidence/guidelines** |
|-|-|-|
| Ibuprofen | - AKI <br/> - Hyperkalemia <br/> - Sodium retention <br/> - Progression of CKD | - FDA warns against use in advanced renal disease [^112QjFzU] <br/> - Avoid in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1158BK29] |
| Naproxen | - AKI <br/> - Hyperkalemia <br/> - Sodium retention <br/> - Progression of CKD | - Avoid in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1158BK29] <br/> - Similar renal risks to other NSAIDs [^111GTg8P] |

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines consistently **advise against NSAID use in kidney failure**:

- **KDIGO 2024**: Prefer low-dose colchicine or corticosteroids over NSAIDs for acute gout in CKD [^114PZgQd].
- **VA/DoD 2025**: Avoid NSAIDs in eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; if absolutely necessary, use the lowest dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring [^1158fgCQ] [^116sjyWs].
- **Beers Criteria 2023**: Avoid all non-aspirin NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease or chronic renal failure [^114SKRP3].

---

## Safer alternatives for pain management

Given the significant risks, **alternative analgesics are recommended**:

- **Acetaminophen**: Preferred first-line analgesic for mild to moderate pain; avoid exceeding 3 g/day [^112P19vk].
- **Topical NSAIDs**: Lower systemic absorption and risk; consider diclofenac gel for localized pain [^115gRSjH].
- **Opioids**: Use cautiously and only if benefits outweigh risks; monitor for sedation, constipation, and respiratory depression [^112P19vk].

---

## If NSAID use is absolutely necessary

In rare cases where NSAIDs are indispensable, follow these precautions:

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the minimum effective dose for the shortest duration [^112QjFzU].
- **Close monitoring**: Check renal function and electrolytes within 1 week of initiation and regularly thereafter [^notfound].
- **Avoid nephrotoxic combinations**: Avoid concurrent use of diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or SGLT2 inhibitors when possible [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no NSAID that is safe for patients with kidney failure**. All NSAIDs carry significant risks of AKI, hyperkalemia, and CKD progression. Use alternative analgesics such as acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs when possible, and if NSAIDs are absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes.

### NSAIDs in CKD: are they safe? [^1137WjKP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging for many reasons. These patients have increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects due to altered drug metabolism and excretion, and there are limited safety data for use in this population despite a high pain burden. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been regarded as dangerous for use in patients with CKD because of their risk for nephrotoxicity and thus alternative classes of analgesics, including opioids, have become more commonly used for pain control in this population. Given the well-established risks that opioids and other analgesics pose, further characterization of the risk posed by NSAIDs in patients with CKD is warranted. NSAID use has been associated with acute kidney injury, progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate in CKD, electrolyte derangements, and hypervolemia with worsening of heart failure and hypertension. The risk for these nephrotoxicity syndromes is modified by many comorbid conditions, risk factors, and characteristics of use, and in patients with CKD, the risk differs between levels of glomerular filtration rate. In this review, we offer recommendations for the cautious use of NSAIDs in the CKD population after careful consideration of these risk factors on an individualized basis.

### The case for cautious consumption: NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease [^113gVCqZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Strong epidemiological and pathologic evidence associates NSAIDs with kidney disease, both acute and chronic. Hence, the usage of NSAIDs has decreased in patients with, or at risk for, chronic kidney disease (CKD). Coupled with this has been a rise in use of opioids and other non-NSAID alternatives, which do come with significant, and underrecognized, risk of nonrenal adverse events. We review the literature to understand if this shift is appropriate or deleterious.

Recent Findings

NSAIDs do have a low but tangible risk in causing acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and increasing blood pressure. However, their role in causing progressive kidney disease is due to long-term usage in high cumulative dosages, and the use of NSAIDs in combination with other agents. Alternatives such as opioids, tramadol, gabapentin and baclofen have weak evidence to support their use and strong evidence to show their harm in patients with CKD.

Summary

Tradeoffs are inherent in using active pharmaceuticals, and NSAIDs are no exception. Balancing potential benefits with possible adverse effects around pain management should be a part of every conversation for patients with kidney disease.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chronic kidney disease progression: a systematic review [^114o9Sv7]. Family Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely regarded as one risk factor, which influences chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. However, previous literature reviews have not quantified the risk in moderate to severe CKD patients.

Objective

To estimate the strength of association between chronic NSAID use and CKD progression.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational general practice or population studies featuring patients aged 45 years and over. The electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, AMED, BNI and CINAHL until September 2011 without date or language restrictions. Searches included the reference lists of relevant identified studies, WEB of KNOWLEDGE, openSIGLE, specific journals, the British Library and expert networks. For relevant studies, random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the association between NSAID use and accelerated CKD progression (estimated glomerular filtration rate decline ≥ 15 ml/min/1.73 m2).

Results

From a possible 768 articles, after screening and selection, seven studies were identified (5 cohort, 1 case-control and 1 cross-sectional) and three were included in the meta-analysis. Regular-dose NSAID use did not significantly affect the risk of accelerated CKD progression; pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.96 (95%CI: 0.86–1.07), but high-dose NSAID use significantly increased the risk of accelerated CKD progression; pooled OR = 1.26 (95%CI: 1.06–1.50).

Conclusions

The avoidance of NSAIDs in the medium term is unnecessary in patients with moderate to severe CKD, if not otherwise contraindicated. As the definition of high-dose of NSAID use remains unclear, the lowest effective dose of NSAIDs should be prescribed where indicated.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^11366CiG]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

NSAID safety in chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes that concomitant use of multiple agents that affect kidney hemodynamics (e.g. RAASi, diuretics, SGLT2i, finerenone) as well as volume depletion may further increase the risk of NSAID-induced AKI; consider increasing frequency of eGFR monitoring with NSAID use, especially if prolonged or high-dose. Risks of NSAIDs are likely to outweigh benefits where there is evidence of little to no benefit (e.g., chronic primary musculoskeletal or wide-spread pain syndromes); determine meaningful functional targets for the patient, using SDM, prior to a trial of NSAID therapy, and proactively educate the patients on risks of NSAIDs, both OTC and prescribed, noting that patients may use OTC NSAIDs without discussion with a provider.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^113mghML]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease — adverse effects and reversibility: NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and kidney adverse events and, by blunting prostaglandin-associated regulation of renal hemodynamics, can induce renal ischemia. NSAIDs can also increase blood pressure, cause edema and sodium retention (mostly mild), induce hyperkalemia, and contribute to heart failure, and NSAID-induced kidney injury is typically reversible with prompt discontinuation.

### Literature review: are NSAIDs harmful and is acetaminophen well tolerated? [^116mPu3s]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

On the basis of previous literature, NSAID use is typically avoided in patients at risk for kidney disease, while acetaminophen has generally been considered well tolerated. However, the extent of NSAID effect on the kidneys is not clear, especially in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the concerns about the safety of acetaminophen have been rising. In this review, we will discuss the latest evidence of the effects of NSAIDs and acetaminophen in the context of nephrology and hypertension.

Recent Findings

The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) by NSAIDs is higher with longer courses and in the presence of several factors such as older age, diabetes mellitus, lower eGFR, diuretic use and cardiovascular disease. The timing of NSAID use in relation to the onset of AKI may affect its progression. Regular NSAID use could be associated with an increased incidence of CKD, but the relation between NSAID use and CKD progression is less clear. Regular acetaminophen use was associated with increased SBP, while its use could have a renoprotective effect in certain situations.

Summary

In patients at risk of kidney disease, NSAIDs may be used cautiously after discussing possible adverse effects. Regular acetaminophen use should be reassessed in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

Opioids versus NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) not requiring dialysis — associations with outcomes and utilization: In a prospective cohort followed for a median of 6.8 years, baseline full-agonist opioid and NSAID use were 9.9% and 15.5% respectively; baseline opioid use was associated with increased risk for a kidney disease composite outcome, kidney failure requiring KRT, hospitalization, and death, whereas baseline NSAID use was associated with increased risk for the kidney disease composite outcome and hospitalization, with outcomes not consistent among subgroups, and overall opioid use had a stronger association with adverse effects than NSAIDs. Given benefits and risks, some reviews now recommend considering cautious time-limited use of NSAIDs with consideration of individual risk factors, SDM, and careful monitoring.

### Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on postoperative renal function in adults with normal renal function [^1143Fc86]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can play a major role in the management of acute pain in the peri-operative period. However, there are conflicting views on whether NSAIDs are associated with adverse renal effects.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to determine the effects of NSAIDs on postoperative renal function in adults with normal preoperative renal function.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches for relevant randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE were performed. Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of relevant trials, review articles and clinical practice guidelines. Handsearching of conference abstracts published in major anaesthetic journals was also performed. Date of most recent search: May 2006

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomised or quasi-randomised comparisons of individual NSAIDs with either each other or placebo for treatment of postoperative pain, with relevant postoperative renal outcome measures, in adult surgical patients with normal renal function.

Data Collection and Analysis

The data were extracted independently by two authors. The primary outcome measure was creatinine clearance within the first two days after surgery. Secondary outcome measures included serum creatinine, urine volume, urinary sodium level, urinary potassium level, fractional excretion of sodium, fractional excretion of potassium and need for dialysis. Weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Twenty-three trials (1459 patients) fulfilled the selection criteria for this review. NSAIDs reduced creatinine clearance by 16 mL/min (95%CI 5 to 28) and potassium output by 38 mmol/day (95%CI 19 to 56) on the first day after surgery compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in serum creatinine on the first day (0 umol/L, 95%CI -3 to 4) compared to placebo. No significant reduction in urine volume during the early postoperative period was found. There was no significant difference in serum creatinine in the early postoperative period between patients receiving diclofenac, ketorolac, indomethacin, ketoprofen or etodolac. No cases of postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis were described. The trials were not heterogeneous for the primary outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

NSAIDs caused a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early postoperative period in patients with normal preoperative renal function. NSAIDs should not be withheld from adults with normal preoperative renal function because of concerns about postoperative renal impairment.

### COX-2 inhibitors and the kidney [^117JAGGv]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors are now extensively used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Several large controlled trials provide evidence to support the proposition that they cause fewer major gastro-intestinal side effects and less toxicity than routine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In view of the documented different localizations of the cyclooxygenase-1 and COX-2 enzymes in the kidney, it was initially hoped that COX-2 inhibitors would be associated with fewer renal side effects than other NSAIDs. This has not been borne out by subsequent studies. Like other NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause salt and water retention, leading to edema and worsening hypertension. They can also cause acute declines in renal function and glomerular filtration rate. These events are, however, uncommon in large rheumatology populations and infrequently lead to discontinuation of the medications. Judicious use of COX-2 inhibitors in high-risk patients (such as those with chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes or congestive heart failure) will lead to a decreased incidence of adverse renal events.

---

### Ibuprofen [^112QjFzU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of ibuprofen tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with ibuprofen tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If ibuprofen tablet therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patients renal function is advisable.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116up4JP]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There is little evidence about the risk of AKI associated with NSAID use in people with CKD available from randomised trials of NSAIDs because such trials routinely exclude people with CKD and rarely report renal outcomes. Under these circumstances, observational evidence provides the best guide to practice that exists. The aim of this study is to systematically review published high-quality population-based observational studies to quantify the risk of AKI due to NSAIDs in the general population and in people with pre-existing CKD.

### Patterns of NSAIDs use and their association with other analgesic use in CKD [^1169V2NX]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is important for safe CKD care. This study examined nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use patterns and their association with other analgesic use in CKD.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study is an observational cohort study that enrolled 3939 adults ages 21–74 years old with CKD between 2003 and 2008 using age-based eGFR inclusion criteria. Annual visits between June of 2003 and December of 2011 were organized into 15,917 visit-pairs (with an antecedent and subsequent visit) for 3872 participants with medication information. Demographics, kidney function, and clinical factors were ascertained along with report of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or other analgesic use in the prior 30 days.

Results

In our study, 24% of participants reported nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use at baseline or at least one follow-up study visit. Having a 10 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 higher eGFR level at an antecedent visit was associated with higher odds of starting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at a subsequent visit (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 1.56). Seeing a nephrologist at the antecedent visit was associated with lower odds of starting or staying on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at a subsequent visit (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.87 and odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.81, respectively). Starting and stopping nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were both associated with higher odds of increasing the number of other analgesics (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 1.85 and odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.39 to 2.28, respectively) and higher odds of increasing the number of opioid analgesics specifically (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 2.48 and odds ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 2.03, respectively).

Conclusions

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is common among patients with CKD but less so among those with worse kidney function or those who see a nephrologist. Initiation or discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is often associated with supplementation with or replacement by, respectively, other analgesics, including opioids, which introduces possible drug-related problems when taking these alternative analgesics.

NSAID-induced kidney injury risk in CKD and general populations — observational and meta-analytic data: Observational studies demonstrate that nephrotoxic risks of NSAIDs are modest, somewhat predictable, and may be less than risks associated with alternative medications. Patients at higher risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) include those with heart failure, cirrhosis, CKD, or dehydration, and those on RAASi, diuretics, or calcineurin inhibitors. In non-CKD populations, studies are conflicting, with some finding no association with incident CKD and others showing increased relative risk with risk generally increasing based on intensity or duration of NSAID exposure; although larger recent studies show a consistent trend toward increased incident CKD, the absolute risks are small when reported. One report demonstrated an excess of 17 CKD events per 100,000 exposed Active-Duty U.S. service members. In patients with pre-existing CKD, a meta-analysis supported increased risk of NSAID-associated AKI with HR of 1.7 and an absolute risk of 4% in NSAID exposed versus non-exposed individuals; however, individual trial estimates varied by an order of magnitude (e.g. OR: 1.05 to 5.25), so pooled averages should be interpreted with skepticism.

### Analgesic use and associated adverse events in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ELWoL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating pain in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with an increased risk of toxicity and drug adverse events in this population. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to assess the prevalence of analgesic use and establish the risk of analgesics-related adverse events, in patients with CKD.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were searched until January 2021. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression were conducted to pool and summarise prevalence data and measures of association between analgesic use and adverse events.

Results

Sixty-two studies relevant to the prevalence of analgesic use and 33 to analgesic-related adverse events were included, combining data on 2.3 and 3 million individuals, respectively. Pooled analyses found that 41% (95% confidence interval, 35–48) of the CKD population regularly use analgesia. The annual period prevalence was estimated at 50% for opioids and 21% for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Overall, 20% and 7% of patients with CKD are on chronic opioid or NSAID therapy, respectively. Opioid use was associated with an increased risk of death (1.61; 95% CI, 1.12–2.31; n = 7, I² = 91%), hospitalisation (1.38; 95% CI, 1.32–1.45; n = 2, I² = 0%), and fractures (1.51; 95% CI, 1.16–1.96; n = 3, I² = 54%).

Conclusion

High levels of analgesic consumption and related serious adverse outcomes were found in patients with CKD. Consideration needs to be given to how these patients are assessed and managed in order to minimise harms and improve outcomes.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly prescribed medications, but they are associated with a number of serious adverse effects, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney injury and GI complications.

Randomised control trials and observational studies published before January 2018 were reviewed, with 329 papers included for the synthesis of evidence-based recommendations.

Results

Whenever possible, a NSAID should be avoided in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, high risk of cardiovascular disease and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). Before treatment with a NSAID is started, blood pressure should be measured, unrecognised CKD should be screened in high risk cases, and unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia should be investigated. For patients with high cardiovascular risk, and if NSAID treatment cannot be avoided, naproxen or celecoxib are preferred. For patients with a moderate risk of peptic ulcer disease, monotherapy with a non-selective NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), or a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor should be used; for those with a high risk of peptic ulcer disease, a selective COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI are needed. For patients with pre-existing hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin system blockers, empirical addition (or increase in the dose) of an antihypertensive agent of a different class should be considered. Blood pressure and renal function should be monitored in most cases.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are a valuable armamentarium in clinical medicine, but appropriate recognition of high-risk cases, selection of a specific agent, choice of ulcer prophylaxis and monitoring after therapy are necessary to minimise the risk of adverse events.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^111xnHqa]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Atkinson et al thoroughly reviewed literature on commonly used opioids in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) setting and ultimately hypothesized that opioids primarily undergoing hepatic phase II metabolism that yields inactive metabolites (such as tapentadol) are highly protein bound, have larger molecular weights, and have higher lipophilicity (to avoid being dialyzed), should be considered first in this population of patients.

NSAIDs have well-documented renal toxicities that can cause acute kidney injury and influence progression of CKD.–They have been shown to increase sodium retention and edema, cause hyperkalemia through decreased delivery of potassium to the distal tubule, cause acute renal failure through disruption of the renal hemodynamic balance, cause nephrotic syndrome by increasing lymphocyte recruitment and activation, and cause acute and chronic renal papillary necrosis through direct toxicity. Nonrenal toxicities include increased blood pressure, decreased antihypertensive effects of several medications, and increased gastrointestinal (GI) bleed risk.

The totality of these toxicities led the American Society of Nephrology to recommend that all patients with hypertension, heart failure, or CKD of all causes avoid NSAID use, in their "Choosing Wisely" campaign published in 2012. This recommendation should further be extended to patients on dialysis. Residual renal function has proven to be important even after commencement of dialysis, because of its implication on dialysis adequacy.NSAIDs have been shown to negatively impact residual renal function, and dialysis patients are more susceptible to fluid and electrolyte changes, have blood pressures that are more difficult to control, and are at higher risk for GI bleeds; thus dialysis patients may be at an even greater risk of harm from NSAID use than the general population.,

Acetaminophen is most commonly used to alleviate mild pain symptoms such as headaches, toothaches, or backaches. The mechanism in which acetaminophen provides analgesia remains unclear; however, it is thought to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus and possibly the spinal cord, with minimal effects on the kidneys. The majority of data supports its renal safety when used in lower, intermittent doses, and only few cases have reported acute renal toxicity after ingestion of larger doses. Chronic high-dose acetaminophen may cause renal function decline (decrease in glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL/min) and has been reported in women who consumed > 3,000 g of acetaminophen over 11 years and has also been associated with tubular necrosis with long-term use (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.28–3.24).

### Ibuprofen oral (ibuprofen) [^115s1xox]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of ibuprofen in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with ibuprofen is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If ibuprofen therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.

Appendix F — NSAID safety for osteoarthritis: All NSAIDs have the potential to increase the risk for cardiovascular events and therefore should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration. Use with caution or avoid use of NSAIDs in patients with renal impairment, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, advanced liver diseases, at high risk for or with known CVD, patients receiving anticoagulants or systemic corticosteroids, etc.

### Ibuprofen (Ibupak) [^111vcHjj]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of ibuprofen tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with ibuprofen tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If ibuprofen tablet therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patients renal function is advisable.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111XtF2K]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with a history of renal impairment, congestive heart failure, elevated BP and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, or the presence of unexplained anemia, consider a complete blood count and assessment of renal function prior to initiating an NSAID.

Patients at high risk of NSAID-associated adverse events may be stratified according to GI, CV and renal risk. Patients considered to be at high GI risk are those with age greater than 65 years, use of high-dose NSAIDs, history of peptic ulcer and related complications, and concurrent use of aspirin, anti-platelet therapy or anti-coagulant therapy (and especially patients receiving double anti-platelet therapy). Patients at high CV risk are those with a history of acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous/surgical coronary revascularization, stable angina and angiographic evidence of significant coronary artery stenosis, a history of stroke/transient ischemic attack, documented significant carotid artery stenosis, or congestive heart failure. Patients at high renal risk are those with age greater than 75 years, impaired renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min, and concomitant administration of an antihypertensive from any of the diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) classes. Analgesics such as paracetamol, tramadol or codeine may be used in place of NSAIDs if the risks of NSAID treatment outweigh the potential benefits. However, the efficacy, availability and potential adverse effects of these alternatives also need to be considered in any decision-making regarding appropriate analgesia.

Choice of NSAIDs

All oral nonselective NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors have analgesic effects of a similar magnitude, but differences may exist among individual drugs in terms of potential GI, CV, renal or liver toxicities.

This statement was a point of contention among the group and represents a compromise from the original statement, which was formulated as: GI protective therapies are generally inadequate or inappropriate in NSAID users. Consensus was not formed for this statement, necessitating rephrasing of the statement to the above wording (Level of agreement: strongly agree, 21%; agree, 43%; consensus, 64% [not reached]). In line with the revision, the group agreed that GI protective therapies (eg, PPIs) benefit patients who require an NSAID and who have a moderate to high risk for upper GI complications. There is little or no evidence to support any protection against lower GI side effects.

### Inflammation reduction pack [^11267NWY]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Caution should be used when initiating treatment with diclofenac sodium delayed-release in patients with considerable dehydration.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^117131So]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding kidney function, NSAIDs, inhibitors of COX, should be avoided in patients with renal impairment. On the contrary, therapeutic doses of paracetamol are generally safe and do not lead to acute renal failure in patients with renal impairment. It was previously hypothesized that paracetamol may cause renal injury due to the reports of nephropathy after phenacetin overuse; however, this hypothesis was then rejected by further evidence. Data show no association between paracetamol and acute renal failure in patients with chronic kidney disease. Thus, paracetamol remains the mainstay analgesic option in patients with chronic kidney disease. It is unnecessary to modify the dose for dialytic patients; however, dose reduction or longer dose interval should be considered in patients with advanced kidney failure.

NSAIDs significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular adverse outcomes. No robust evidence supports an association between paracetamol and adverse cardiovascular outcomes (stroke or myocardial infarction) in patients with atherosclerotic heart diseases. On the other hand, the risk of worsening hypertension should be considered, with some observational studies showing an increase in blood pressure among chronic paracetamol users. Still, published studies failed to show an association between elevated blood pressure and the risk of serious cardiovascular events in paracetamol users. Paracetamol remains probably safer than NSAIDs which showed a significant increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes amongst patients receiving non-aspirin NSAIDs. According to an American Heart Association position statement, paracetamol should be preferred over NSAIDs in patients with coronary artery disease.

Aspirin and other NSAIDs significantly increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding. Unlike NSAIDs, paracetamol, which has a minimal peripheral COX inhibitory effect, does not cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract. The current evidence affirms the more tolerable gastrointestinal safety profile of paracetamol than NSAIDs. Thus, paracetamol is the recommended first-line option for patients at risk of gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding.

Finally, paracetamol is considered the preferred analgesic option for the elderly, a challenging group to manage due to the high frequency of comorbidities and polypharmacy. Paracetamol represents an effective and safe analgesic option; however, its use in the elderly with chronic pain is still questionable.

Based on the above, it can be concluded that the centrally acted paracetamol is a compelling first-line analgesic option even for special populations if a low dosage is used, and it should be preferred over NSAIDs due to its very limited COX action and tolerable safety profile.

### Association of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs with outcomes in CKD: findings from the CRIC (chronic renal insufficiency cohort) study [^111WPBbA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Safe analgesic choices are limited in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted a comparative analysis of harm from opioids versus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in CKD.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

3,939 patients with CKD in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study.

Exposures

30-day analgesic use reported at annual visits.

Outcomes

A composite outcome of 50% glomerular filtration rate reduction and kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT), as well as the outcomes of kidney failure requiring KRT, hospitalization, and pre-kidney failure death.

Analytical Approach

Marginal structural models with time-updated exposures.

Results

Participants were followed up for a median of 6.84 years, with 391 (9.9%) and 612 (15.5%) reporting baseline opioid and NSAID use, respectively. Time-updated opioid use was associated with the kidney disease composite outcome, kidney failure with KRT, death (HRs of 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2–1.7], 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1–1.7], and 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2–2.0], respectively), and hospitalization (rate ratio [RR], 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6–1.9) versus opioid nonusers. Similar results were found in an analysis restricted to a subcohort of participants reporting ever using other (nonopioid and non-NSAID) analgesics or tramadol. Time-updated NSAID use was associated with increased risk for the kidney disease composite (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.5) and hospitalization (RR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0–1.3); however, these associations were not significant in the subcohort. The association of NSAID use with the kidney disease composite outcome varied by race, with a significant risk in blacks (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.7). NSAID use was associated with lower risk for kidney failure with KRT in women and individuals with glomerular filtration rate < 45mL/min/1.73m 2 (HRs of 0.63 [95% CI, 0.45–0.88] and 0.77 [95% CI, 0.59–0.99], respectively).

Limitations

Limited periods of recall of analgesic use and potential confounding by indication.

Conclusions

Opioid use had a stronger association with adverse events than NSAIDs, with the latter's association with kidney disease outcomes limited to specific subgroups, notably those of black race.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^116sjyWs]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis — renal safety with NSAIDs and CKD precautions: There were no differences in renal events between celecoxib and naproxen, but a lower rate of renal events occurred in the celecoxib group versus the ibuprofen group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44–0.85). The use of NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors should generally be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in patients with an eGFR of ≤ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) whose pain is not controlled with other non-NSAID treatments, potential risks and benefits of NSAIDs should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115gRSjH]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Topical NSAIDs versus systemic NSAIDs — recommendation and renal safety data: Topical NSAIDs are recommended for use in knee osteoarthritis based on evidence of equivalent efficacy for improving pain and function and superior systemic adverse effect profiles compared to oral NSAIDs. Multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate adverse effects of topical NSAIDs are similar to placebo except for increased local adverse effects, mostly mild skin reactions. Diclofenac is a topical NSAID approved in the U.S. for osteoarthritis, and in a pooled safety analysis of 7 RCTs of topical diclofenac 1.5% use, among 138 patients using topical diclofenac for 4–12 weeks, no patients experienced a serious kidney adverse event; changes in blood pressure and kidney function were similar between the diclofenac and placebo/control groups. Studies with topical diclofenac also report that the level attained in blood is 0.4–2.2% of the maximum serum.

### Nephrotoxic potential of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^113FKM95]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relative nephrotoxic potential of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-February 2004) identified clinical trials evaluating the nephrotoxicity of COX-2 inhibitors versus traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Key search terms included cyclooxygenase inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, nephrotoxicity, and chemically induced.

Data Synthesis

Three clinical trials determined that COX-2 inhibitors have similar adverse effects on the kidney when compared with nonselective NSAIDs, while 2 studies concluded that COX-2 inhibitors are less nephrotoxic than nonselective NSAIDs. All 5 trials utilized low numbers of subjects, short-term therapy, and surrogate markers of kidney damage.

Conclusions

COX-2 inhibitors may not offer distinct advantages over nonselective NSAIDs with respect to kidney function. Longer trials in patients with comorbidities are warranted. These agents should be used cautiously or not at all in patients with predisposing conditions.

### Pain management in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease [^112P19vk]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review evaluates current recommendations for pain management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with a specific focus on evidence for opioid analgesia, including the partial agonist, buprenorphine.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence supports the use of physical activity and other nonpharmacologic therapies, either alone or with pharmacological therapies, for pain management. Nonopioid analgesics, including acetaminophen, topical analgesics, gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and TCA may be considered based on pain cause and type, with careful dose considerations in kidney disease. NSAIDs may be used in CKD and ESKD for short durations with careful monitoring. Opioid use should be minimized and reserved for patients who have failed other therapies. Opioids have been associated with increased adverse events in this population, and thus should be used cautiously after risk/benefit discussion with the patient. Opioids that are safer to use in kidney disease include oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine. Buprenorphine appears to be a promising and safer option due to its partial agonism at the mu opioid receptor.

Summary

Pain is poorly managed in patients with kidney disease. Nonpharmacological and nonopioid analgesics should be first-line approaches for pain management. Opioid use should be minimized with careful monitoring and dose adjustment.

### Effects of peri-operative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on post-operative kidney function for adults with normal kidney function [^11592NKf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide effective analgesia during the post-operative period but can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) when used peri-operatively (at or around the time of surgery). This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2007.

Objectives

This review looked at the effect of NSAIDs used in the peri-operative period on post-operative kidney function in patients with normal kidney function.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 4 January 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at the use of NSAIDs versus placebo for the treatment of post-operative pain in patients with normal kidney function were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors as was assessment of risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by a third author. Dichotomous outcomes are reported as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analyses were used to assess the outcomes of AKI, change in serum creatinine (SCr), urine output, renal replacement therapy (RRT), death (all causes) and length of hospital stay.

Main Results

We identified 26 studies (8835 participants). Risk of bias was high in 17, unclear in 6and low in three studies. There was high risk of attrition bias in six studies. Only two studies measured AKI. The use of NSAIDs had uncertain effects on the incidence of AKI compared to placebo (7066 participants: RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 7.96; I² = 59%; very low certainty evidence). One study was stopped early by the data monitoring committee due to increased rates of AKI in the NSAID group. Moreover, both of these studies were examining NSAIDs for indications other than analgesia and therefore utilised relatively low doses. Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may slightly increase serum SCr (15 studies, 794 participants: MD 3.23 μmol/L, 95% CI -0.80 to 7.26; I² = 63%; low certainty evidence). Studies displayed moderate to high heterogeneity and had multiple exclusion criteria including age and so were not representative of patients undergoing surgery. Three of these studies excluded patients if their creatinine rose post-operatively.NSAIDs may make little or no difference to post-operative urine output compared to placebo (6 studies, 149 participants: SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.27). No reliable conclusions could be drawn from these studies due to the differing units of measurements and measurement time points. It is uncertain whether NSAIDs leads to the need for RRT because the certainty of this evidence is very low (2 studies, 7056 participants: RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.07; I² = 26%); there were few events and the results were inconsistent. It is uncertain whether NSAIDs lead to more deaths (2 studies, 312 participants: RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 11.12; I² = 38%) or increased the length of hospital stay (3 studies, 410 participants: MD 0.12 days, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.72; I² = 24%).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall NSAIDs had uncertain effects on the risk of post-operative AKI, may slightly increase post-operative SCr, and it is uncertain whether NSAIDs lead to the need for RRT, death or increases the length of hospital stay. The available data therefore does not confirm the safety of NSAIDs in patients undergoing surgery. Further larger studies using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition for AKI including patients with co-morbidities are required to confirm these findings.

### Ketoprofen [^111mC2NP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. Forhigh risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greater risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LvcVB]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

AKI is an increasingly common global problem causing significant morbidity and mortality and with large resource implications. Exposure to NSAIDS and other nephrotoxic drugs is an important cause of AKI, but the risk of these exposures is modified by susceptibilities such as increasing age and the presence of CKD. This study found that the odds of developing AKI increased by over 50% in people who were exposed to NSAIDs in the general population and in people with CKD, and in older people the odds of developing AKI doubled. However, the absolute risk of developing AKI also depends on the baseline risk of AKI in the population exposed, which none of the included studies reported. Future studies should use internationally agreed definitions of AKI and estimate the absolute risk of AKI in different populations including older people and people with CKD to better inform clinical decision making. There is evidence that feedback and more complex interventions to reduce NSAID prescribing in people at high risk of renal adverse effects are effective, and clinicians should seek to minimise NSAID exposure in people particularly susceptible to AKI due to age, CKD or because of the co-prescription of other nephrotoxic drugs.

### Identifying and assessing benefit-risk in primary care – a family physician's perspective [^115EY7FJ]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

What is the right approach to case study A? Clearly, he is at increased risk for NSAID therapy — his recent cardiac event, renal failure, bleeding risk from medications and underlying risk factors must be balanced by the impact of his musculoskeletal pain on his quality of life. An initial approach of non-pharmaceutical interventions would be appropriate. Involvement with physiotherapy and occupational therapy, home care support and weight loss would be helpful. Despite this, many patients such as case study A would benefit from adjunct medical therapy. Before considering the options, careful discussion with case study A, and his family, of risks and benefits of other therapies is important. Particularly, if NSAID therapy was considered, careful monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, electrolytes, haemoglobin and fluid status would be critical. Choice of a non-tNSAID with the lowest bleeding risk may be appropriate. Narcotic and other alternate pain medications will almost certainly increase risk for falls, cognitive impairment and constipation. Assisting case study A in choosing the right treatment and close monitoring following the initiation therapy will maximize the outcomes while reducing the risks.

No solution is offered in this case because there is no one course of treatment with a guaranteed effective outcome: the case simply illustrates the kind of decisions that primary-care doctors face on a regular basis. Furthermore, any decision would be made not by the physician alone but with the patient (and his family) there to consider the risks and benefits of the options.

With ageing patient populations, who have multiple comorbidities and are taking increasingly more medications, patient safety issues are more important than ever for family physicians and other primary-care providers to consider. In the appropriate patient population, with proper monitoring and assessment, NSAID therapy can significantly benefit our patients' quality of life. In selected patients, Cox-2 selective inhibitors provide additional safety benefit and may be considered preferentially. However, notwithstanding their significant safety benefit in some patient populations, they must be used in caution in patients with renal failure, hypertension and heart disease.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114byw17]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed in primary care for their analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. One in fifteen US adults are actively prescribed NSAIDs at any one time, and in many countries low-dose preparations are also available over-the-counter (OCT). Partly due to their widespread use, NSAIDs account for 25% of adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in the United Kingdom ﻿﻿(UK) and 21% in the United States (US). NSAIDs are also commonly implicated in hospital admissions due to ADEs, including those which are fatal, but gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity are better quantified than renal toxicity.

NSAIDs can reduce renal blood flow, cause tubular obstruction through crystal deposition, and induce direct cytotoxicity and cell-mediated immune injury mechanisms leading to the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Another symptom that is commonly caused by NSAIDs is interstitial nephritis (AIN) which requires specialist review, renal biopsy, high-dose corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressant treatments, and will normally be progression in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Older age and underlying chronic kidney disease are also related to the onset of AKI during NSAID use, with early studies showing that the risk of deterioration in renal function increases 3–4 fold in patients with abnormal baseline renal function compared to those with normal renal function. Notably, NSAIDs are commonly prescribed to people with CKD, despite guidance to avoid them in this population. In US veterans in 2005, 15.4% of people with CKD were prescribed traditional NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, compared to 11.1% of people with CKD in the UK in 2012, and 15.9% of people with CKD in Australia in 2004–2006. Better quantification of risk in people with CKD is therefore of particular clinical interest, as is whether NSAID risk varies by age and by COX-2 selectivity. In terms of COX-2 selectivity, early studies suggested that COX-2-selective inhibitors caused fewer renal adverse effects including reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased serum creatinine (SCr) and hypertension. Other studies have shown no significant differences in renal risk between COX-2-selective inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Acunivive 30) [^116aUVWZ]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Impaired Renal Function

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving ketorolac tromethamine to these patients.

Anaphylactoid Reactions

As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to ketorolac tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Pre-existing Asthma). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ketorolac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS).

### Need for a judicious use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to avoid community-acquired acute kidney injury [^112FzdNJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Millions of Americans use over-the-counter analgesics on a daily basis, and nearly 100 million nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescriptions are filled per year. In high-risk patients, these medications can disrupt kidney hemodynamics and precipitate community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). The risk of NSAID-associated CA-AKI increases 3- to 5-fold in patients taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and diuretics concurrently. CA-AKI increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or accelerating progression of pre-existing CKD. Importantly, many cases of NSAID-induced CA-AKI may be avoided by identifying high-risk patients and providing patient and provider education on when to avoid these medications and minimize risk.

Methods

Data sources and search strategy

MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched from inception to June 21th 2016 using OVID from the Knowledge Network using a predetermined list of keywords including NSAIDs, renal diseases and renal function measurements modified from the search strategies used by two related Cochrane reviews (see Additional file 1 for search strategy). Search results were restricted to cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies in the English language. The reference lists from all identified primary studies, review articles, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines for CKD and AKI and OpenSIGLE (unpublished literature database) were manually checked to screen for additional relevant papers.

Citations were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers based on title and abstract (XZ and SB or XZ and BG). If one or more authors deemed the study potentially relevant, or if there was any uncertainty about eligibility based on title and abstract alone, then the full text paper was retrieved for review. Authors of original studies were not contacted. Study selection and quality assessment from full-text papers retrieved were performed independently by two reviewers (XZ and BG).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^11663mZo]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) route and duration — risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia in older adults and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD): Observational analyses examining the first 30 days after a newly prescribed topical, short course (< 14 days), or longer course NSAID found in older adults that both topical (OR: 1.48) and short-course oral NSAIDs (OR: 1.59) were associated with increased risk at 30 days; a similar analysis reported adjusted odds for AKI or hyperkalemia at 30 days of 1.29 for topical NSAIDs, 1.43 for systemic NSAIDs of < 15 days, and 1.84 for systemic NSAIDs of ≥ 15 days, with incrementally higher odds with oral and prolonged administration. Among patients with CKD, topical and oral NSAIDs (compared with no NSAID prescription) were associated with AKI (OR: 1.38 and 1.77 respectively), and moderate and severe AKI were increased with oral NSAIDs but not topical NSAIDs. While each analysis attempted to control for confounders, it is unclear how much residual confounding by indication remains, and the literature suggests that the risk of adverse kidney outcomes is decreased (but likely not eliminated) by use of topical rather than oral NSAIDs.

Results

In total 9852 papers were identified by the two searches (CKD search 5223; general population search 4629). Following title and abstract screening 511 papers proceeded to full text screening (CKD search = 425; general population search = 86). Of the 511 articles, 315 did not contain any PSIs. PSI extraction was performed from the remaining 196 articles, with a total of 3464 PSIs identified. [Fig. 1] The full list of 3464 PSIs was filtered to identify 1775 of potential relevance to people with CKD. These PSIs were reviewed by three of the authors (FS, SH, BH) with 1231 confirmed as CKD-specific.

Fig. 1
Systematic review results and PSI extraction

The CKD-specific PSIs were classified by ATC code. Three hundred seventy-one duplicates were identified and excluded. A further 19 were deemed not to fit the pre-specified criteria after discussion between reviewing authors (6 related to inpatient prescribing and 13 were deemed not to be CKD-specific). The remaining 841 unique PSIs became the final set of CKD-specific PSIs. Examples of PSIs are demonstrated in Table 1 (full list is in Additional file 2: Appendix 3).

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^116wYT4B]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Review of the patient's history and context beyond the presenting pain syndrome is helpful in selection of pain treatments. In particular, medications should be used only after assessment and determination that expected benefits outweigh risks, considering patient-specific factors. For example, clinicians should consider fall risk when selecting and dosing potentially sedating medications (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids) and should weigh benefits and risks of use, dosage, and duration of NSAIDs when treating older adults and patients with hypertension, renal insufficiency, heart failure, or those with risk for peptic ulcer disease or cardiovascular disease. NSAIDs are potentially inappropriate for use in older adults with chronic pain because of higher risk for adverse effects with prolonged use. Some guidelines recommend topical NSAIDs for localized osteoarthritis (e.g. knee osteoarthritis) over oral NSAIDs in patients aged ≥ 75 years to minimize systemic effects. (See Recommendation 8 for additional considerations for assessing risks of opioid therapy.)

### Celecoxib [^1162MgPm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.14)].

Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

Celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9*3/*3), based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) administer celecoxib starting with half the lowest recommended dose. Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111NimAT]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal Risks

In addition to the GI and CV effects of NSAIDs, epidemiological and pathologic data also associate NSAID use with the potential for both acute and chronic kidney disease (CKD).–Renal side effects which include sodium and water retention with edema, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury may precipitate renal failure resulting in acute dialysis. Risk factors include older age, renal impairment, heart failure, liver disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), and concurrent prescription with antihypertensive drugs (eg, diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors). Again, mechanisms of NSAID-induced kidney damage relate to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and are dose- and duration-dependent. Low levels of COX-2 are constitutively expressed in the macula densa, with COX-2 inhibition leading to a reduction in renal blood flow and resulting functional impairment. NSAIDs may also accumulate in renal tubular cells during secretion. While NSAID-induced sodium retention is COX-2-mediated, NSAID-induced reductions in glomerular filtration rate are mediated via COX-1.

Consistent with the dual COX-1/COX-2-dependent mechanisms, which predict the possibility of differences in renal toxicity for different NSAIDs, there are limited data to suggest clinically relevant differences. In the MEDAL program, etoricoxib had a greater risk of renovascular adverse events than diclofenac. In PRECISION, the risk of renal events was significantly lower with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen, and was similar for celecoxib compared with naproxen. In a meta-analysis, NSAIDs with high COX-2 selectivity had a lower association with acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to NSAIDs with low COX-2 selectivity. Overall, NSAIDs have a low but tangible risk in causing AKI, electrolyte imbalances and increased BP, but their role in progressive kidney disease is associated only with long-term use in high cumulative doses. In patients with CKD, withdrawal of NSAID use is recommended by nephrology consensus groups, but initiation of alternatives such as opioids conveys different and no less important drug-related concerns. In a study conducted in China that included age- and sex-matched controls of NSAID users, long-term (≥ 48 months) use of NSAIDs was independently associated with reduced renal function. It is recommended that patients with risk factors for renal impairment have preventative strategies in place that include using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest possible time, as well as monitoring renal function, fluid retention and electrolyte abnormalities. The concomitant use of NSAIDs and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be avoided.

### Diclofenac sodium D / r [^113Vb4xd]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Caution should be used when initiating treatment with diclofenac in patients with considerable dehydration.

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood ow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Frequency and associations of prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among patients with a musculoskeletal disorder and hypertension, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease [^112dGCT9]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

International nephrology societies advise against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in patients with hypertension, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, recent studies have not investigated the frequency or associations of use in these patients.

Objectives

To estimate the frequency of and variation in prescription NSAID use among high-risk patients, to identify characteristics associated with prescription NSAID use, and to investigate whether use is associated with short-term, safety-related outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this retrospective cohort study, administrative claims databases were linked to create a cohort of primary care visits for a musculoskeletal disorder involving patients 65 years and older with a history of hypertension, heart failure, or CKD between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2016, in Ontario, Canada.

Exposure

Prescription NSAID use was defined as at least 1 patient-level Ontario Drug Benefit claim for a prescription NSAID dispensing within 7 days after a visit.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Multiple cardiovascular and renal safety-related outcomes were observed between 8 and 37 days after each visit, including cardiac complications (any emergency department visit or hospitalization for cardiovascular disease), renal complications (any hospitalization for hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, or dialysis), and death.

Results

The study identified 2 415 291 musculoskeletal-related primary care visits by 814 049 older adults (mean [SD] age, 75.3 [4.0] years; 61.1% female) with hypertension, heart failure, or CKD, of which 224 825 (9.3%) were followed by prescription NSAID use. The median physician-level prescribing rate was 11.0% (interquartile range, 6.7%-16.7%) among 7365 primary care physicians. Within a sample of 35 552 matched patient pairs, each consisting of an exposed and nonexposed patient matched on the logit of their propensity score for prescription NSAID use (exposure), the study found similar rates of cardiac complications (288 [0.8%] vs 279 [0.8%]), renal complications (34 [0.1%] vs 33 [0.1%]), and death (27 [0.1%] vs 30 [0.1%]). For cardiovascular and renal-safety related outcomes, there was no difference between exposed patients (308 [0.9%]) and nonexposed patients (300 [0.8%]) (absolute risk reduction, 0.0003; 95% CI, -0.001 to 0.002; p = 0.74).

Conclusions and Relevance

While prescription NSAID use in primary care was frequent among high-risk patients, with widespread physician-level variation, use was not associated with increased risk of short-term, safety-related outcomes.

### Patient benefit-risk in arthritis – a rheumatologist's perspective [^115cgExP]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Renal risk

Both non-selective NSAIDs and Cox-2 selective inhibitors are associated with nephrotoxicity, which can range from fluid and electrolyte disturbances to overt renal dysfunction, renal papillary necrosis or nephrotic syndrome. As a result, current guidelines recommend that NSAIDs should not be used in patients with severe renal insufficiency, and that caution is necessary in patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency or other conditions associated with decreased intravascular volume oedema.

Although the renal adverse effects of non-selective NSAIDs have been well characterized, the risk associated with Cox-2 selective inhibitors is less well documented. Zhang et al. investigated the RRs of renal adverse events associated with rofecoxib or celecoxib in a meta-analysis of 114 clinical trials, involving 116 094 patients, of whom 6394 (5.5%) had peripheral oedema, hypertension or renal dysfunction. The RRs for renal dysfunction or peripheral oedema in patients treated with rofecoxib were 2.31 (95% CI 1.05, 5.07) and 1.43 (95% CI 1.23, 1.66), respectively; in contrast, celecoxib was associated with a lower risk of renal adverse events, with RRs for renal dysfunction and peripheral oedema of 0.61 (95% CI 0.40, 0.94) and 1.09 (95% CI 0.91, 1.31), respectively. The risk of renal adverse events associated with rofecoxib increased with both dose and duration of treatment. These findings suggest that there does not appear to be a class effect in terms of renal adverse events with Cox-2 selective inhibitors. The same caution is needed for all non-selective NSAIDs as well as for all Cox-2 selective inhibitors.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^111GTg8P]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of renal disease: Use of non‑selective or COX‑2 selective NSAIDs can result in renal papillary necrosis, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis with or without nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acute renal failure, or other renal‑related injuries in an estimated 1–5% of patients, and all available agents approved for use in the U.S. include a warning for such events in their prescribing information. The risk for renal adverse events increases in patients who are dependent upon a compensatory increase in renal prostaglandins to maintain renal perfusion, and patients at higher risk include those with preexisting renal disease, volume depletion (e.g., diuretics, vomiting), congestive heart failure, liver dysfunction, cirrhosis with ascites, use of angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and older patients. In healthy patients, renal prostaglandins do not play a significant role in maintaining renal perfusion; however, in reduced volume, hypotension, and reduced renal perfusion, NSAID administration reduces compensatory vasodilatory renal prostaglandins, which can result in reduced renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and can lead to renal damage. Although other mechanisms exist, hemodynamically mediated acute renal insufficiency is the most common cause and is most frequently reversible once the offending agent is discontinued. In the PRECISION study, renal events were prospectively monitored in more than 20,000 RA or OA patients receiving celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen for a mean follow‑up of 20 months, and eligible patients had baseline serum creatinine values within normal limits.

### Using NSAID in volume depleted children can precipitate acute renal failure [^114LgPCk]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are increasingly popular in hospital medicine and general practice and are readily available over the counter. The vast majority of healthy children who ingest therapeutic doses of NSAID for a limited duration tolerate them without any significant adverse effects. However, the risk of renal toxicity is potentially increased in situations where there is stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system such as with volume depletion or in pre-existing chronic renal disease. We describe four cases which illustrate this complication occurring in a children's hospital. We have not proven cause and effect, but further research is needed to define the true risk of the potential renal complications of NSAID in patients at risk of dehydration.

### Ketoprofen [^111NCVxD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ketoprofen capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use ketoprofen capsules. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with ketoprofen capsules, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Concomitant use of ketoprofen capsules and ketoprofen extended-release capsules is not recommended.

If minor side effects appear, they may disappear at a lower dose which may still have an adequate therapeutic effect. If well tolerated but not optimally effective, the dosage may be increased. Individual patients may show a better response to 300 mg of ketoprofen capsules daily as compared to 200 mg, although in well-controlled clinical trials patients on 300 mg did not show greater mean effectiveness. They did, however, show an increased frequency of upper- and lower-GI distress and headaches. It is of interest that women also had an increased frequency of these adverse effects compared to men. When treating patients with 300 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefit to offset potential increased risk.

In patients with mildly impaired renal function, the maximum recommended total daily dose of ketoprofen capsules is 150 mg. In patients with a more severe renal impairment (GFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 or end-stage renal impairment), the maximum total daily dose of ketoprofen capsules should not exceed 100 mg.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID results in a dose-dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and, secondarily, in a reduction of renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

A large noninferiority trial randomized 24,081 patients to celecoxib, naproxen, or ibuprofen and found the cardiovascular (CV) risk associated with celecoxib was noninferior to the non-selective NSAIDs; limitations included drug discontinuation 68.8%, study dropout 27.4%, most patients 90% had OA, and a dose of celecoxib limited to 200 mg/day with dose escalation allowed for ibuprofen and naproxen. All NSAIDs have a black box warning for increased risk of CV and gastrointestinal (GI) events; if an NSAID is required in a patient with CV risk, naproxen may be a viable option; the use of relatively selective COX-2 inhibitors reduces the risk for GI events, but this benefit is negated if the patient is using aspirin; NSAIDs can also exacerbate heart failure and worsen hypertension and renal function and must be used cautiously or avoided in patients with renal impairment or in elderly patients.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113wuPZm]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a common cause of adverse drug events (ADEs), but renal risks of NSAIDs are less well quantified than gastrointestinal and cardiac risks. This paper reports a systematic review of published population-based observational studies examining the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with NSAIDs in community-dwelling adults and those with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched until June 2016, and 3789 papers screened. Ten studies reporting NSAID risk of AKI in the general population were included in random effects meta-analysis, of which five additionally reported NSAID risk in people with CKD.

Results

In the general population, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of AKI for current NSAID exposure was 1.73 (95%CI 1.44 to 2.07), with somewhat higher risk observed in older people (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.52 to 2.68). In people with CKD, individual study OR of AKI due to current NSAID exposure ranged from 1.12 to 5.25, with pooled estimate OR 1.63 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.19).

Conclusions

No study reported baseline risk of AKI in different populations meaning absolute risks could not be estimated, but baseline risk and therefore the absolute risk of NSAID exposure is likely to be higher in people with CKD and older people. Large population based studies measuring AKI using current definitions and estimating the absolute risk of harm are needed in order to better inform clinical decision making.

NSAIDs and other conditions

All NSAIDs can also raise blood pressure and interfere with the blood pressure lowering effects of certain medication classes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The concomitant use of NSAIDs with diuretics increases the likelihood of nephrotoxicity as well as interfering with their blood pressure lowering effects. Electrolyte issues — particularly hyperkalaemia, are also associated with NSAID use. NSAIDs, both traditional and Cox-2 selective inhibitors must, therefore, be used with caution in all patients with renal failure. Congestive heart failure can also be exacerbated by traditional and Cox-2 selective NSAIDs.

### Diclofenac sodium, capsaicin (inflammacin) [^113jeHSe]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Caution should be used when initiating treatment with diclofenac in patients with considerable dehydration.

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^1121YYxQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Tenofovir is principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Prior to initiation and during use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.

Dosing interval adjustment of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in patients at risk of renal dysfunction.

5.3 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV

Due to the risk of development of HIV-1 resistance, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should only be used in HIV-1 and HBV coinfected patients as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen.

HIV-1 antibody testing should be offered to all HBV-infected patients before initiating therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. It is also recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B before initiating treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

### Pharmacology of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition in the kidney [^114PRNaU]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) exists as two unique isoforms (that is, COX-1 and COX-2) which are poorly understood with regard to their roles in renal function. The renal effects of conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are believed to result from the inhibition of one or both isoforms. Drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 provide useful pharmacological tools for discerning the effects associated with the inhibition of the individual isoforms, and may help clarify the renal roles of COX-1 and COX-2. This review summarizes the current data on the renal expression of COX isoforms and their potential roles in renal function, and reviews the studies that have attempted to correlate renal functional changes with selective isoform inhibition. Since there are significant differences in the expression of COX isoforms in the kidneys of laboratory animals and humans, this review also examines the correlation of the results of COX inhibition in experimental studies in laboratory animals with clinical data. Because of potential interspecies differences in the roles of COX isoforms in renal function, animal models may have limited predictive value for patients, particularly those with renal risk factors. Accordingly, any uncertainty concerning the safety or therapeutic benefit of COX-2-specific drugs in these patient populations will need to be resolved with clinical investigations.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^115NtE77]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS knee osteoarthritis — oral acetaminophen is recommended to improve pain and function in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis when not contraindicated (Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Evidence cited indicates oral acetaminophen consistently improved pain and function compared to controls, with meta-analysis showing a meaningful reduction in pain and improved function with no evidence of confounding heterogeneity, and overall it is considered a safe medication with no evidence of significantly increased adverse events among the included studies; however, the United States FDA has a black-box warning for acetaminophen secondary to concern of overdose leading to hepatotoxicity or death. When oral acetaminophen was compared to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the use of oral NSAIDs provided a significant reduction in pain and improved function, and as a result, providers may consider using oral NSAIDs instead of acetaminophen when a contraindication to oral NSAIDs does not exist in the patient. Implementation guidance notes that although oral acetaminophen is widely used, providers must recognize the specific risks associated with each medication and that specific patient contraindications need to be assessed on an individual basis (example: renal failure). Outcome considerations include that the most important consideration will be removal of oral narcotics from medications prescribed for osteoarthritis of the knee, which becomes particularly significant due to the rise of the opioid epidemic in the United States. Cost-effectiveness remains undetermined to date, acetaminophen is commonly utilized so there should be no issues implementing this recommendation, and this recommendation may be implemented immediately having a potential positive impact in clinical practice.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^112aprUe]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Thus, clinicians and their patients face some dilemmas about how to balance the GI and CV risks, especially in patients known to be at increased risk for both, as occurs in many elderly patients. Cryer, in a submission on behalf of consumers to a 2014 FDA hearing that was contemplating a labeling change based solely on CV risk, emphasized the need for a comprehensive risk assessment: ' In the process of addressing cardiovascular health in the setting of NSAID use, which we applaud, we would not want you to inadvertently increase the risk of other untoward outcomes associated with NSAIDs, such as GI and renal toxicities '.

It is timely to review the area; thus, in a recent article published in BMC Medicine, Scarpignato et al. report on a recent consensus meeting that has updated earlier guidelines using more recent information.

### Using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in volume depleted children can precipitate acute renal failure [^113FnHx9]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are increasingly popular in hospital medicine and general practice and are readily available over the counter. The vast majority of healthy children who ingest therapeutic doses of NSAIDs for a limited duration tolerate them without any significant adverse effects. However, the risk of renal toxicity is potentially increased in situations where there is stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system such as with volume depletion or in pre-existing chronic renal disease. We describe four cases which illustrate this complication occurring in a children's hospital. We have not proven cause and effect, but further research is needed to define the true risk of the potential renal complications of NSAIDs in patients at risk of dehydration.

### Celecoxib (Vyscoxa) [^115diMsY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.14)].

Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65–74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The daily recommended dose of VYSCOXA oral suspension in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of VYSCOXA in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

VYSCOXA is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9*3/*3), based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) administer VYSCOXA starting with half the lowest recommended dose. Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^113Y7MNH]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Acetaminophen — dosing, patient selection, and safety: Usual dosing is 2–4 grams [g] per day and its use may still be preferred by providers for patients with more mild disease or mild-to-moderate symptoms of OA and for those at risk for NSAID-induced adverse events, including renal disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD) or risk for CVD, a history of gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers, those receiving oral anticoagulants or corticosteroids, and the elderly aged > 65 years. Although considered relatively safe at usual doses up to 4,000 mg daily, the risk for acute liver injury and liver failure is increased at doses > 4,000 mg daily. In an SR, adverse events did not differ versus placebo (RR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.92–1.11), but liver function test abnormalities were higher with acetaminophen (RR: 3.79, 95% CI: 1.94–7.39), with unclear clinical significance. An observational SR not included in the CPG's evidence review reported a dose-dependent statistical increase in mortality (n = 1 study), cardiovascular (CV) events (n = 4 studies), gastrointestinal (GI) events (n = 1 study), and renal events (n = 3 studies) with acetaminophen use versus no use.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen (combogesic) [^115TFPpP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6)].

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Use in Renal Disease

COMBOGESIC has not been studied in patients with impaired renal function. The use of COMBOGESIC in patients with renal impairment is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

8.7 Use in Hepatic Disease

COMBOGESIC has not been studied in patients with impaired hepatic function. The use of COMBOGESIC in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^1163C3kU]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Non-surgical management of hip & knee osteoarthritis — clinical summary and recommendation state that the evidence supports a clinically significant reduction in pain with NSAIDs and a lesser overall effect of reducing pain with acetaminophen in patients with OA of the hip or knee; the superiority of NSAIDs over acetaminophen was more apparent in patients with moderate-to-severe baseline pain, while differences were negligible in milder disease or symptoms. Therefore, providers should carefully consider the medical history of patients being considered for such therapy, and providers should avoid offering this treatment to patients with comorbidities that increase their risk for adverse events (e.g. CKD [chronic kidney disease], especially severe CKD, at risk for or known CVD, at risk for NSAID-related upper GI events). Adverse events associated with the use of acetaminophen appear to be dose-related, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was low, and avoidance of NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors is suggested in patients with certain comorbidities, leading to a "Weak for" recommendation.

### Clinical implications of nonopioid analgesia for relief of mild-to-moderate pain in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease [^113fdahU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonopioid analgesics, which include acetaminophen, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors (coxibs), are frequently used for the relief of mild-to-moderate pain. Although all of these agents are effective at controlling pain, inhibition of prostaglandins (PGs) by NSAIDs may result in untoward cardiorenal effects, including hypertension, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, acute renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome. Individuals with an increased risk for cardiorenal effects from NSAIDs (eg, the elderly, and those with hypertension, cardiac disease, or gouty nephropathy) should be monitored for early onset of edema, destabilization of blood pressure control, and/or onset of congestive heart failure when started on NSAID therapy. Because acetaminophen has a different mechanism of action from the conventional NSAIDs, it does not inhibit peripheral PGs at recommended dosing and therefore appears to have a more favorable cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety profile. This review discusses the effects of acetaminophen, traditional NSAIDs, and coxibs on fluid and electrolytes, blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and renal function, as well as their consequences in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It also summarizes information on the mechanisms by which NSAID-induced cardiovascular adverse events develop, and it provides recommendations for the use of nonopioid analgesics for relief of mild-to-moderate pain in patients with or at risk for CVD.

### Adverse renal effects of anti-inflammatory agents: evaluation of selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors [^112RT61P]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), i.e. nonselective cyclooxygenase COX inhibitors have well-documented nephrotoxicity. Adverse renal effects occur because of inhibition of the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins which act to modulate pathologic processes that would normally impair various renal functions. The introduction of the selective COX-2 inhibitors raised hope that this class of drugs would reduce injury in both the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys. Animal and human data, however, suggest that COX-2 synthesized prostaglandins are important in the modulation of renal physiology during adverse conditions. Hence, it appears that these drugs are equal in causing nephrotoxicity as the nonselective COX inhibitors.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111o6Ck2]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The study strengths include careful study selection and the use of a structured quality assessment tool to ensure that only high quality studies were included. The observed associations were consistent across subgroups, but the study has several limitations. As with all systematic reviews, the findings depend on the quality of the included studies. We chose to review and meta-analyse observational studies because an initial literature search identified that trials of NSAIDs rarely report renal outcomes (the focus of this study) and exclude people with CKD (a key topic of interest) and other comorbidities as well as older people and minority groups. However, observational studies are vulnerable to residual confounding by measured and unmeasured variables. An example is confounding by indication, which in this context is likely to occur if prescribers avoid NSAIDs in people they perceive to be at higher risk of NSAID toxicity including AKI, which would lead to an underestimation of AKI risk if present. There were also large differences between studies in the population examined and the way in which AKI was measured, both of which likely contributed to the observed moderate to large heterogeneity between studies. It is also important to recognise that the estimate of the risk of NSAIDs in the general population is adjusted for potential confounders, but the estimate in people with CKD is not because only one study reported an adjusted estimate. Other limitations include that we only included studies published in English, that there were a relatively small number of studies suitable for inclusion which made meta-regression to explore heterogeneity unfeasible, and that the rate of concomitant use of OTC NSAID use could not be assessed in the populations studied. Seven of the included studies addressed that OCT NSAID use may have caused exposure misclassification. But all of the studies believed that due to reasons such as financial incentives, the proportion of OCT NSAID users is expected to be small and nondifferential with respect to the NSAID categories the populations studied. Consequently, it would bias the results toward the null. As most of the studies confirmed eligible cases then selected controls according to a certain proportion, non-response rate was not given in the majority of the included studies. Since cases and controls of these studies were derived from the same databases, were examined for the same exposure and followed up in the same way, then non-response rate is not considered to be a problem and therefore it is unlikely there would be missing data bias. We were unable to access publication bias because of the extensive statistical heterogeneity. For many of the methodological qualities assessed there was an unclear risk of bias as studies did not provide explicit detail to make an informed judgement.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^111jYsuo]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pain is one of most common symptoms experienced by patients with kidney disease. More than 70% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) report experiencing pain. Pain has been associated with lower quality of life, high symptom burden, and greater risk of developing kidney disease, its progression, and mortality. Thus, management of pain is a vital component of comprehensive care for patients with CKD.

The already high medication burden makes pain management even more complex in patients with CKD. There are no well-established guidelines for pain management specific to those individuals with kidney disease. Special precautions are needed to manage treatment of patients with reduced kidney function, who may be more prone to experiencing drug toxic effects, adverse effects, greater dose adjustment requirements, and drug interactions. Opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used analgesics. Opioids may have extended half-life in patients with advanced CKD, with substantial effects on the central nervous system, resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, and addiction. Long-term opioid use is a risk factor for opioid abuse and dependence. Use of NSAIDs in patients with CKD may result in nephrotoxicity, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, hypertension, and other complications. Therefore, patients with CKD may be especially at risk of receiving suboptimal pain control and inappropriate use of prescription analgesics.

The opioid epidemic has recently received considerable attention from clinicians, policy makers, and the public. However, to our knowledge, few studies have assessed use of analgesics and outcomes in patients with reduced kidney function, particularly with regard to the long-term effects. The present study sought first to examine trends from 2006 to 2015 in the use of opioids and prescription NSAIDs among older (age ≥ 65 years) patients with CKD in the US, and then to explore factors associated with opioid and NSAID use, as well as outcomes associated with their use, including development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and death. We hypothesized that prescription analgesic use would be higher in patients with CKD compared with the general population. Furthermore, we postulated that use of prescription NSAIDs would be associated with more rapid kidney disease progression to ESKD and opioid use with both higher mortality and advanced-stage or progressive kidney disease.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (viread) [^111xcHzD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients with HBV Infection

All patients should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating VIREAD [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Discontinuation of anti-HBV therapy, including VIREAD, may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Patients infected with HBV who discontinue VIREAD should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.

5.2	New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Tenofovir is principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Prior to initiation and during use of VIREAD, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.

Dosing interval adjustment of VIREAD and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received VIREAD using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of VIREAD therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity.

VIREAD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in patients at risk of renal dysfunction.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^113sqVL3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed as acid-suppression therapy and have transformed the management of conditions affecting the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus (BE), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and other related disorders. These agents have been of great benefit to patients who are at risk of upper GI ulceration and bleeding from aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In the United States alone, it is estimated that 15 million Americans used a prescription PPI in 2013, and PPIs represent one of the most prescribed drug classes in the United States. Moreover, PPI use among the US population has increased over time, from 5.7% in 2002–2003 to 6.73% in 2016. In addition, the use of non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) PPIs is considered to be substantial in the United States.

Although this drug class has historically been recognized as safe given the low risk of ulceration and GI bleeding, results from mostly observational studies suggest that long-term use of PPIs may be associated with serious local and systemic adverse health outcomes. Furthermore, PPIs are increasingly being prescribed off-label by health care professionals and are rarely deprescribed when no longer medically necessary. Without appropriate oversight, some experts argue that they are prone to long-term misuse.

Limited data are available from randomized control trials (RCTs) on the long-term use of PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes. An RCT by Moayyedi et al. reported that PPI (pantoprazole) was not associated with any adverse event [including chronic kidney disease (CKD)] when used for 3 years. However, a subsequent commentary identified several limitations in this study, including CKD ascertainment, potential exposure misclassification, reliance on intention-to-treat analysis, and failure to consider alternative induction periods, which may have biased the results toward the null. Nevertheless, using the gold standard study design for causal evidence in medicine, this RCT by Moayyedi et al. provides insight into potential causality for several reported PPI associations using experimental data.

### Celecoxib (ELYXYB-celecoxib) [^1133M63i]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, treat for the fewest number of days per month, as needed, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.15)].

In the controlled clinical trials for migraine, approximately 70 patients were ≥ 65 years of age. Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib (for indications other than migraine) in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65–74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers.

However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous postmarketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Reduce the dose of ELYXYB in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The use of ELYXYB in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) is not recommended.

8.7 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. ELYXYB is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9*3/*3), based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., warfarin, phenytoin) reduce the dose of ELYXYB [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^111rkRzd]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Research is also needed to assess the effects of gout treatment on CKD and renal function. ULT in people with gout was reported in one study to lead to an improvement in renal function, although how much of this improvement related to a reduction in NSAID use and how much related specifically to the effects of urate lowering is not clear. In addition, the results of this study were stratified only by baseline creatinine clearance of < 80 ml/min versus ≥ 80 ml/min. A post hoc analysis of an allopurinol dose-escalation study suggested that changes in creatinine clearance did not differ when stratified by baseline renal function. Stratifying the efficacy and safety of gout flare treatment and ULT by renal function should be emphasized in all gout studies because gout and CKD frequently coexist. An example of a trial designed to incorporate such stratification is the Veterans Affairs (VA) Stop GOUT study (NCT02579096), which is designed to evaluate the 'treat-to-target' dose escalation of allopurinol versus febuxostat in people with gout. Although this study excluded individuals with stage 4 or 5 CKD, it included a pre-planned analysis of those with stage 3 CKD.

Box 1 G-CAN-proposed general research priorities for people with gout and CKD

Is the natural history of gout, including the transition from asymptomatic hyperuricaemia to symptomatic gout, the same in people with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD)?
In people with CKD and gout, can we predict who will develop tophaceous or erosive disease (and thus require more intensive urate-lowering therapy) and who will have a benign course?
Does the treatment of gout and treat-to-target management of gout reduce progression of CKD and/or improve renal function?

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (viread access) [^117UkXB1]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.1	Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients with HBV Infection

All patients should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating VIREAD [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Discontinuation of anti-HBV therapy, including VIREAD, may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Patients infected with HBV who discontinue VIREAD should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.

5.2	New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Tenofovir is principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Prior to initiation and during use of VIREAD, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.

Dosing interval adjustment of VIREAD and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received VIREAD using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of VIREAD therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity.

VIREAD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in patients at risk of renal dysfunction.

### Renal effects of COX-2-selective inhibitors [^112VpcxK]. American Journal of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effectively treat a variety of inflammatory diseases, these agents may cause deleterious effects on kidney function, especially with respect to solute homeostasis and maintenance of renal perfusion and glomerular filtration. NSAIDs act by reducing prostaglandin biosynthesis through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) which exists as two isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2). NSAID-induced gastrointestinal toxicity is generally believed to occur through blockade of COX-1 activity, whereas the anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs are thought to occur primarily through inhibition of the inducible isoform, COX-2. However, the situation in the kidney may be somewhat different. Recent studies have demonstrated that COX-2 is constitutively expressed in renal tissues of all species; this isoform may, therefore, be intimately involved in prostaglandin-dependent renal homeostatic processes. Drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 might, therefore, be expected to produce effects on renal function similar to nonselective NSAIDs which inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. This assertion is borne out by recent clinical studies showing that the COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib procedure qualitative changes in urinary prostaglandin excretion, glomerular filtration rate, sodium retention, and their consequences similar to nonselective NSAIDs. It, therefore, seems unlikely that these COX-2 inhibitors (and perhaps their successors) will offer renal safety benefits over nonselective NSAID therapies, and, at this juncture, it is reasonable to assume that all NSAIDs, including COX-2-selective inhibitors, share a similar risk for adverse renal effects.

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 50 mg) [^114oV9TQ]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Insufficiency

The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Insufficiency

Celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

Patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) should be administered celecoxib with caution. Consider starting treatment at half the lowest recommended dose in poor metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9*3/*3). Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### Meloxicam [^112Evzbb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs, including meloxicam, has resulted in renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

The renal effects of meloxicam may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Because some meloxicam metabolites are excreted by the kidney, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating meloxicam. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of meloxicam [see Drug Interactions (7)].

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease. Avoid the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If meloxicam is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions

Meloxicam has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to meloxicam and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1119hARd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

When not contraindicated, NSAIDs should be used for low back pain, painful musculoskeletal injuries (including minor pain related to fractures), dental pain, postoperative pain, and kidney stone pain; triptans, NSAIDs, or their combinations should be used along with antiemetics as needed for acute pain related to episodic migraine. NSAID use has been associated with serious gastrointestinal events and major coronary events, particularly in patients with cardiovascular or gastrointestinal comorbidities, and clinicians should weigh risks and benefits of use, dose, and duration of NSAIDs when treating older adults as well as patients with hypertension, renal insufficiency, heart failure, or those with risk for peptic ulcer disease or cardiovascular disease. Vasoactive effects of triptans and ergot alkaloids might preclude their use in patients with migraine who also have cardiovascular risk factors. Clinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy.

Pain Management for Pregnant and Postpartum Persons

For pain management in the postpartum period, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends stepwise, multimodal, shared decision-making, incorporating pharmacologic treatments that might include opioids. After vaginal delivery, ACOG recommends acetaminophen or NSAIDs, and if needed, adding an opioid. After cesarean delivery, ACOG recommends standard oral and parenteral medications such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or low-dose, low-potency, short-acting opioids with duration of opioid use limited to the shortest reasonable course expected for treating acute pain. ACOG recommends counseling persons who are prescribed opioids about the risk for central nervous system depression in the postpartum person and in the breastfed infant, noting that if a codeine-containing medication is selected, duration of therapy and neonatal signs of toxicity should be reviewed with patients and their families.

### Association of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescriptions with kidney disease among active young and middle-aged adults [^1167iqBD]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

We have identified modest but statistically significant associations between the highest level of observed NSAID exposure and incident AKI and CKD among active, largely healthy adults in the military. While recognizing that the pain burden in such active populations must be managed using the best-available measures, given the relatively high mean DDD per prescription we observed, providing lower doses is one approach to those with pain and/or inflammation. The increases in kidney disease risk that we observed for modifiable factors, such as body mass index and hypertension, reinforce the established importance of managing these conditions, regardless of patient age.

### Renal effects of cyclooxygyenase-2-selective inhibitors [^111wT3bX]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used. These agents are associated with adverse renal effects caused by the reduction in synthesis of renal prostaglandins through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). Both isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, are expressed in the kidney in constitutive and inducible forms. It is assumed therefore that the COX-2-selective inhibitors, rofecoxib and celecoxib, would have an effect on renal function similar to that of nonselective NSAIDs. Several studies have evaluated this issue, although they have different study models and some have design flaws that limit their interpretation. Therefore, conclusions should be based on the pattern of observed effects rather than on individual data. These studies suggest that both celecoxib and rofecoxib can cause sodium retention and decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to a similar extent as nonselective NSAIDs in patients at risk for adverse renal effects. Consequently, the same precautions regarding renal risk that are followed for nonselective NSAIDs should be used when selective COX-2 inhibitors are administered.

### Therapeutics in rheumatology and the kidney [^113gcbUr]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The field of rheumatology has advanced significantly in recent years to provide rheumatologists with an extensive array of medications to combat rheumatic joint conditions. In contrast to an older era, when NSAIDs and other nephrotoxic agents were the mainstay of treatment, modern DMARDs vary considerably in their nephrotoxic potential and their use is not always precluded in populations with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review will explore in detail the safety and efficacy profiles of medications used to treat rheumatologic disease, specifically in the setting of CKD. Specifically, we discuss both traditional agents used, i.e. NSAIDs, CSs and conventional synthetic DMARDs, as well as novel biologic DMARDs and targeted synthetic DMARDs. Anti-gout prescribing in CKD is also reviewed. We aim to provide practical guidance to rheumatologists, nephrologists and general physicians when prescribing these medications in the setting of CKD.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^116bgxqN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest investigation of real-world use of prescription analgesics among older adults with and without CKD in the US, covering 2006 to 2015. Use of analgesics, particularly opioids, was high in the Medicare CKD population, increasing substantially between 2006 and 2013, then stabilizing or decreasing slightly thereafter. A higher proportion of opioid vs prescription NSAID use was found in patients with CKD compared with non-CKD Medicare beneficiaries. As expected, cumulative use of analgesics, both opioids and prescription NSAIDs, decreased with CKD progression. This prescription pattern could be associated with patients with advanced CKD being more susceptible to toxic effects and adverse effects in the setting of reduced kidney function. Additionally, NSAIDs were widely used in earlier stages of CKD while opioids were more frequently used in patients with advanced CKD. This finding may reflect both the variation in severity of pain by CKD stage, as opioids are typically used to treat moderate to severe pain, and avoidance of NSAIDs in patients with more advanced CKD, in whom risk of progression is higher with use of this class of medication owing to the inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on prostaglandin synthesis in the kidneys, with resultant potential for intrakidney ischemia.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113wfE6S]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis to examine associations between NSAID exposure and AKI in the general community-dwelling population and people with CKD. A previous systematic review which was conducted in 2014 included five observational studies and reported risk of AKI by individual NSAID exposure, finding a statistically significant elevated AKI risk among most of the traditional NSAIDs but did not achieve a statistical significance for COX-2 inhibitors or traditional NSAIDs with higher COX-2 selectivity (meloxicam and diclofenac). Our study used a more comprehensive search and included additional studies, and found a similar estimate of pooled risk but statistically significantly increased risk irrespective of COX-2 selectivity. Another systematic review specifically focused on myocardial, vascular and renal risks of COX-2-selective meloxicam allowed a broad definition of renal outcomes and it did not find a significantly increased renal risk. A third systematic review examined the risk of CKD progression associated with NSAID use, finding that high (but not standard) dose NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of CKD progression.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^117Ljd9e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacological management: NSAIDs — "When not contraindicated, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) should be used to reduce pain and improve function in the treatment of symptomatic hip osteoarthritis", with "Quality of Evidence: High" and "Strength of Recommendation: Strong". The guideline rationale states "Five studies (three moderate quality and two high quality) compared oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) with placebo for treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip and showed improvement in pain and function scores", that "Compared to placebo, all five studies reported on pain and uniformly reported improvement in pain with the use of oral NSAIDs", and that "The Western Ontario McMaster Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score was reported in all studies, all of which reported improvement in WOMAC function with NSAIDs compared to placebo". Head-to-head articles reported "lumiracoxib showed similar efficacy to celecoxib", "celecoxib 200mg/day and 400mg/day showed similar efficacy to naproxen", and "similar efficacy between valdecoxib 10mg and naproxen". Under benefits/harm, "Contraindications that should be considered include, but are not limited to, patients with chronic kidney disease or patients with significant cardiac conditions that may be at an elevated risk of myocardial infarction". Outcome importance notes "The use of non-opioid medications such as NSAIDs for nonoperative treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip is extremely important to minimize the use of opioids". Cost/resource statements note NSAIDs are "widely available and an extremely cost-effective treatment" but "there is limited comparative data on the cost-effectiveness of oral NSAIDs compared to other nonoperative treatments of osteoarthritis of the hip". For implementation, "This recommendation should be readily implemented as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice" and "Oral NSAIDs are widely available. Thus, this recommendation should be easily implemented with no apparent barriers to adoption".

### Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (truvada) [^116Np5vP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of TDF, a component of TRUVADA [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Prior to initiation and during use of TRUVADA, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all individuals. In individuals with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.

TRUVADA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in individuals at risk of renal dysfunction.

Treatment of HIV-1 Infection

Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with estimated creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received TRUVADA using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of TRUVADA therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. TRUVADA is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis.

HIV-1 PrEP

TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP is not recommended in uninfected individuals with estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance is observed while using TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### A randomized clinical trial assessing the effect of automated medication-targeted alerts on acute kidney injury outcomes [^111LxZK4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) — an abrupt decline in kidney function — is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, associated with an increased hospital length of stay and a 10-fold increase in inpatient mortality –. AKI also carries an independent risk for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage kidney disease, and death –.

Despite current international best practice guidelines for management of AKI focusing on avoidance of nephrotoxic exposures, studies have shown that AKI, often asymptomatic in presentation, frequently goes unnoticed, and appropriate workup and treatment is inconsistently performed –. For example, a retrospective study of 9534 hospitalized patients with severe AKI found that the rate of discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic medications is low in the early stages of AKI, revealing an opportunity for early intervention that could potentially prevent progression to more severe forms of AKI.

Medications that affect kidney function are common contributors to AKI in hospitalized patients. However, international guidelines vary with respect to discontinuation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Observational studies have shown that NSAIDs, potentially by increasing kidney vasoconstriction, increase the risk of AKI both in and out of the hospital –. International guidelines strongly recommend the discontinuation of NSAIDs in the context of AKI. RAASi lower hydrostatic pressure at the glomerulus, thus decreasing the glomerular filtration rate and inhibiting the clearance of uremic toxins. Interestingly, RAASi may also increase kidney peritubular blood flow, potentially protecting against ischemic damage. There is thus debate regarding the utility of RAASi discontinuation during AKI, and this is reflected in guideline recommendations to "consider" discontinuation. PPIs have long been associated with the development of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), a form of AKI, and have been linked to the progression of CKD –. As AIN is likely underdiagnosed in hospitalized patients, and PPIs are likely overprescribed, there is significant interest in whether empiric discontinuation of PPI would affect the course of AKI in this population –. To date, international guidelines do not address empiric discontinuation of PPI among patients with AKI. The EL ectronic A lerts for AK I A melioration 2 (ELAIA-2) investigators set out to evaluate the aggregate and individual effect of prompting discontinuation of NSAID, RAASi, and PPI within a single trial framework to provide higher quality evidence to clinicians caring for patients with AKI exposed to these agents.

### Influence of creatinine versus glomerular filtration rate on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescriptions in chronic kidney disease [^112NHusj]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, are generally contraindicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This investigation sought to identify the frequency of NSAID/COX-2 prescription and to determine the influence of serum creatinine (Cr) versus estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on this practice pattern.

Methods

An established Veterans Health Administration CKD safety cohort (n = 70,154) was examined to determine the frequency of NSAID/COX-2 in fiscal year 2005 (FY05) for up to 30 days preceding the index hospitalization and as many as 365 days during that year. Binomial regression was used to determine adjusted prevalence ratios for prescription of NSAID/COX-2 with respect to continuous eGFR measurement and serum Cr categories. CKD was defined as eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).

Results

15.4% of the subjects had an NSAID/COX-2 prescription during the observation period. The proportion of these prescribed agents decreased with declining renal function, but remained significant at any stage of CKD given the renal harm related to these medications. At specific GFR estimates, serum Cr remained a significant predictor of NSAID/COX-2 prescription. At GFR set at 42 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the predicted proportion of prescribed NSAID/COX-2 was 0.29 (95% CI 0.24, 0.36), 0.23 (95% CI 0.22, 0.26), 0.20 (95% CI 0.19, 0.22), and 0.12 (95% CI 0.10, 0.14) for Cr strata of ≤ 1.3, 1.4–1.6, 1.7–2.1, and ≥ 2.2 mg/dl, respectively (all p < 0.05).

Conclusion

A significant proportion of individuals with CKD continue to be prescribed NSAID/COX-2 and serum Cr remains an influential guide to NSAID/COX-2 prescription, even in GFR ranges where these agents are ill advised.

### A community based study of adverse effects of NSAIDS… [^1139mHZV]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, are widely available over the counter in pharmacies, wholesale stores, gas stations, and convenience stores for the treatment of fever and pain. In addition, more than 111 million people in the U. S., including many older Americans, take prescription NSAIDs each year. In certain high-risk patients, NSAIDs can significantly disrupt blood flow to the kidneys and precipitate community-acquired acute kidney injury. CA-AKI can lead to hospitalization, new-onset chronic kidney disease, and more rapid progression of existing chronic kidney disease. Many patients are unaware of NSAID-associated risks and the importance of appropriate use to prevent NSAID-induced CA-AKI. Current patient education materials, including the medication guide, may focus too narrowly on bleeding risks associated with NSAID use and thereby fail to describe the potential for CA-AKI.

Project Description Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences implemented a research project to assess NSAID use and the potential for reducing preventable harm from both prescription and over-the-counter use. The project evaluated adverse renal risks among a large population of patients in primary care settings. An informed community-based pilot program was developed to educate providers, patients, and pharmacists and determine if NSAID risk awareness could be improved. Project Goals
- Evaluate a nationwide cohort of patients in the DARTNet Practice Performance Quality Improvement Registry in collaboration with American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network to determine NSAID prescribing patterns and associated effects on kidney function.
- Develop and implement an innovative community-based NSAID education program to target providers, patients, and pharmacists.
- Evaluate effects of the education program on provider NSAID prescribing patterns and electronic medical record documentation, patient awareness, and pharmacist counseling efforts. Project Results The final report from the researchers to the FDA included the following results:

- Patients exposed to NSAIDS were older, having more co-morbidities and kidney impairment than the general population. Primary care providers commonly prescribed NSAIDS to patients at high risk for NSAID-related kidney injury.
- A majority of patients preferred educational materials in print form. Patients who viewed educational materials in print form achieved higher scores related to NSAID and kidney risk knowledge than those who viewed a video.
- More than half of patients exposed to education materials regarding NSAID-related kidney risks reported they would avoid future NSAID use.

are used at least weekly by one quarter of US adults. 1–3 High acute doses of analgesics, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, have been implicated as causes of acute renal failure, 4–7 which is most commonly seen among patients with impaired renal function. It has. have raised the possibility of an association between use of various analgesics and chronic renal disease. With respect to different types of analgesics, the association between phenacetin and kidney disease has been quite strong. 9–11 In the United States, phenacetin was banned from the market in 1983. 12 Whether other analgesics are implicated in renal. dysfunction is less clear, with some studies showing no association between regular use of analgesics such as acetaminophen, aspirin, and other NSAIDs and chronic renal dysfunction9, 13 and other studies showing increased risk. 10, 11, 14–16 A recent case-control study, for example, reported a 2-fold increased risk.

of end-stage renal disease among individuals with lifetime use of more than 1000 acetaminophen pills and an 8-fold increased risk among those with a lifetime cumulative dose of more than 5000 NSAID pills. 16 These case-control studies, however, have significant methodologic limitations, including difficulty in establishing the time order of exposure, confounding. The Physicians' Health Study cohort provided such an opportunity. In this group of more than 11 000 initially healthy men who provided blood samples, we evaluated the association between retrospective self-reported intake of acetaminophen, aspirin, and other NSAIDs and renal function, as measured by creatinine levels and creatinine clearance. for acetaminophen, 1. 35 for aspirin, and

### NSAID use among patients with a musculoskeletal disorder and hypertension, heart failure, or CKD… [^112pd8VW]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Within a sample of 35 552 matched patient pairs, each consisting of an exposed and nonexposed patient matched on the logit of their propensity score for prescription NSAID use, the study found similar rates of cardiac complications, renal complications, and death. For cardiovascular and renal-safety related outcomes, there was no difference between exposed patients and nonexposed patients. Conclusions and Relevance While prescription NSAID use in primary care was frequent among high-risk patients, with widespread physician-level variation, use was not associated with increased risk of short-term, safety-related outcomes. Patients with and without prescription NSAID use had similar rates of cardiac complications, renal complications, and death. Exposed patients were as likely to experience any cardiovascular or renal safety-related outcome as nonexposed patients. Among a large, Ontario-based cohort of primary care visits involving older adults with a musculoskeletal disorder and recent history of hypertension, heart failure, or CKD, we found that almost 10% resulted in prescription NSAID use despite patients' high risk for cardiovascular and renal complications. We observed widespread prescribing variation, up to 77-fold, among primary care practices and physicians and identified several patient, physician, and practice characteristics associated with NSAID use. We found that prescription NSAID use was not associated with significantly higher risk of cardiovascular or renal safety-related outcomes.

Last, we found that rates of acute cardiovascular or renal safety-related outcomes were low and statistically equivalent between patients with and without prescription NSAID use.

1984. 03340340039023. The relationship between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and deterioration of renal function was examined in a large group of hospitalized patients carefully monitored for adverse drug effects and in a large group of outpatients whose discharge diagnoses after subsequent hospital admission were recorded. In the in-hospital study, no association between the use of NSAIDs and drug-attributed elevation of serum urea nitrogen levels diagnosed during hospitalization was present. In the outpatient study, none of the patients who used NSAIDs was hospitalized for acute renal disease. The majority of the available data related to indomethacin, ibuprofen, and phenylbutazone.
