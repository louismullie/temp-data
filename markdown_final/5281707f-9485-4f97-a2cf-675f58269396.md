## Question

Hypoxia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of hypoxia, covering definitions, mechanisms, organ-specific consequences, diagnostics, and management, with explicit self-verification of reasoning steps and corrections where needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and classifications of hypoxia. Then, I should verify the molecular sensing mechanisms, especially the HIF pathway. Next, I will examine organ-specific pathophysiology and outcomes. After that, I need to review diagnostic tools and biomarkers. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, including oxygen therapy, permissive hypoxemia, and hypoxia-targeted therapies, and close with a concise clinical take-home message.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't conflate terms. Hypoxia refers to inadequate tissue oxygenation, whereas hypoxemia refers to low arterial oxygen content or pressure; clinically, severe hypoxemia is often defined as SpO2 ≤ 90% at rest, with severe hypoxemia at SpO2 < 85%, though cyanosis may be absent in anemia, so I need to be cautious about equating cyanosis with hypoxemia [^1143UCrQ]. I should also distinguish diffusion-limited chronic hypoxia from perfusion-limited acute hypoxia in tumors, because these subtypes have different implications for therapy and imaging, and I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize across contexts [^116eSpiw].

> Wait, let me verify the molecular oxygen-sensing mechanism before proceeding. The canonical pathway centers on HIF, stabilized under low oxygen and degraded via PHD/VHL in normoxia; HIF regulates hundreds of genes governing angiogenesis, metabolism, erythropoiesis, and survival, and its regulation is sensitive to both oxygen and iron availability, which explains some interindividual variability in hypoxic responses [^11644psB] [^114pq5tb]. Hold on, I should also note that transcriptional responses to hypoxia are both specific and diverse, shaped by cofactors and chromatin context, which helps explain why hypoxia can have different phenotypic effects across tissues and time scales [^116USm9E].

> Next, I will examine tumor hypoxia, but I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions about uniform effects. Hypoxia is prevalent in solid tumors due to abnormal vasculature and high oxygen consumption, driving selection of aggressive clones, genomic instability, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy; HIF-1 activation contributes to angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, and stem-like phenotypes, and hypoxia-associated radioresistance is a key clinical barrier [^115ySWjt] [^114AzRSb] [^1128T29G]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that all hypoxic tumors behave identically; I should correct that: hypoxia's impact is heterogeneous and context-dependent, and not every hypoxic tumor will benefit from hypoxia-targeted therapy, underscoring the need for precision approaches and robust biomarkers [^115ySWjt].

> I will now examine neurologic consequences, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. Hypoxia worsens outcomes in traumatic brain injury, with retrospective and prospective data linking early hypoxia to higher mortality and morbidity; neurocritical care guidance cautions against relying on hypoxia alone as a reliable predictor of long-term mortality, so I need to be precise in my claims and avoid overstating predictive value [^notfound]. Let me also consider that brain tissue oxygen monitoring has not yet yielded definitive treatment-linked outcome benefits, so I should not overinterpret its use in routine practice [^113ZG6jJ].

> Turning to the respiratory system, I should confirm the role of intermittent hypoxia in obstructive sleep apnea. Chronic intermittent hypoxia in OSA is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and emerging "hypoxic burden" metrics that integrate depth and duration of desaturations may outperform AHI for prognostication; however, I need to ensure I acknowledge that definitions vary and standardization is still evolving before endorsing any single metric [^112KpfL4] [^114hNkN2]. Hold on, I should verify that these hypoxic burden measures are derived from routine polysomnographic oximetry and are sensitive to oximeter averaging times and preprocessing, which affects comparability across studies and labs [^114hNkN2].

> Let me consider cardiovascular effects next, and I should confirm the balance of benefit and harm. In COPD, long-term oxygen therapy improves survival in severe resting hypoxemia, but benefits in moderate hypoxemia are uncertain; recent randomized data suggest no advantage of 24-hour versus 15-hour daily oxygen for hard outcomes, reinforcing the need to reassess indications and duration periodically [^115USDfY] [^1166FHwu]. I need to ensure I also emphasize that oxygen is a drug with dose-related toxicity, including oxidant stress and vasoconstrictive effects, which complicates liberal use in acute heart failure and other normoxemic states [^114kjWbz] [^114AHLMo].

> For critical illness broadly, I should review oxygen targets and permissive hypoxemia concepts. Meta-analyses of ICU oxygenation strategies show no consistent mortality benefit of higher versus lower targets, with signals of harm from higher oxygenation in some analyses; permissive hypoxemia remains investigational and requires careful monitoring and validated tissue oxygenation surrogates before routine adoption [^113uGtLH] [^116B7bxv] [^113PascJ]. But wait, what if I'm overstating certainty? The evidence quality is low to very low, so I should frame these as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive practice standards [^113uGtLH].

> Next, I should review diagnostics, and I need to check the strengths and limitations of each modality. Pulse oximetry is ubiquitous but imperfect, with accuracy limits in low perfusion, dark skin pigmentation, and arrhythmias; arterial blood gas remains the gold standard for defining hypoxemia and CO2 retention, and should be used to confirm chronic hypoxemia before committing to long-term oxygen therapy [^111VuTQ1]. In oncology, hypoxia PET tracers and MRI-based oxygenation mapping can noninvasively assess tumor hypoxia, but I should confirm that reproducibility, tracer pharmacokinetics, and standardization remain barriers to routine clinical use [^112gtCNV] [^113yQEN5] [^113C1hGA].

> I will now examine management principles, starting with oxygen therapy, and I need to ensure I align with guideline targets. For most acutely ill adults, target SpO2 94–98% is reasonable, whereas patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure warrant lower targets (commonly 88–92%) to avoid precipitating CO2 narcosis; oxygen should be titrated to a prescribed target and weaned promptly when stable, with explicit documentation and monitoring plans [^116MWJjq]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance as well: oxygen is commonly used for hypoxemia in children, but device selection, flow, and vigilance for hyperoxia are essential to avoid toxicity and absorption atelectasis [^116zE7Yv].

> Let me reconsider the concept of permissive hypoxemia, and I should be explicit about uncertainty. Proposed strategies of accepting lower arterial oxygenation to avoid hyperoxia-related harm are theoretically grounded but lack robust clinical evidence; until better tissue oxygenation monitoring and safety thresholds are defined, permissive hypoxemia should be viewed as investigational and individualized rather than a blanket approach [^113PascJ] [^111zZFh1]. I should double-check that current ICU evidence does not establish a clear optimal target, reinforcing the need for ongoing trials and careful bedside titration [^113uGtLH].

> For hypoxia-targeted cancer therapies, I need to ensure I don't overpromise. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs and HIF pathway modulation have compelling rationales, but failures in broad trials reflect tumor heterogeneity, variable reductase expression, and inadequate biomarker selection; precision strategies that identify "hypoxia-driven" phenotypes and match therapy to biology are critical moving forward [^114fHffs] [^115ySWjt]. Let me verify that imaging and molecular profiling efforts are underway to enable such selection, but translation remains challenging and will require prospective validation [^112gtCNV].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical clinical message and make sure it reflects the evidence. Hypoxia is a pathophysiologic state with context-specific consequences: in tumors it drives aggressiveness and treatment resistance, in the brain it worsens secondary injury, in OSA it tracks cardiovascular risk, and in COPD it identifies patients who benefit from long-term oxygen; management hinges on precise measurement, guideline-concordant oxygen titration, and emerging precision strategies where hypoxia is a primary driver of disease, while avoiding both under-treatment and hyperoxia-related harm [^115ySWjt] [^112KpfL4] [^115USDfY] [^116MWJjq] [^114kjWbz].

Hypoxia is a **reduction in tissue oxygen availability** or saturation, with **HIF-1α as the master regulator** of the cellular response [^11644psB] [^116USm9E]. It drives adaptive changes (angiogenesis, glycolysis, erythropoiesis) [^111J6yU5] [^115FJn32] [^115UX6hb] but also contributes to pathology, including tissue injury, fibrosis, and tumor progression [^114AzRSb] [^115ySWjt]. Clinically, hypoxia is managed by correcting the cause and using **targeted oxygen therapy** [^114oUNs1] to maintain SpO2 94–98% (or 88–92% in hypercapnic patients) [^116MWJjq]; avoid both hypoxemia and hyperoxia [^112QdGzW] to prevent complications [^114kjWbz]. Persistent or severe hypoxia worsens outcomes in cancer, cardiovascular disease, and critical illness, so early detection and precise correction are essential [^115ySWjt] [^112KpfL4] [^112of3EC].

## Molecular mechanisms of hypoxia

- **HIF pathway**: HIF-1α is stabilized under low oxygen, activating genes for angiogenesis, glycolysis, and erythropoiesis [^111J6yU5] [^114pq5tb].

- **Metabolic reprogramming**: Cells shift to glycolysis, increasing lactate and acidosis [^notfound].

- **Genomic instability**: Hypoxia impairs DNA repair, promoting mutations and tumor progression [^1128T29G].

---

## Physiological responses to hypoxia

| **System** | **Physiological response** |
|-|-|
| Respiratory | Increased ventilation (hyperventilation) [^notfound] |
| Cardiovascular | Increased cardiac output, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and erythropoiesis [^114pq5tb] |
| Metabolic | Shift to anaerobic glycolysis, increased lactate production [^115UX6hb] |
| Cellular | HIF-1α stabilization, angiogenesis, and erythropoietin production [^114pq5tb] |

---

## Pathological consequences of hypoxia

- **Tissue injury**: Hepatic, renal, and cerebral injury from sustained hypoxia [^notfound].

- **Fibrosis**: Chronic hypoxia drives fibrotic remodeling in lung and liver [^notfound].

- **Tumor progression**: Hypoxia promotes angiogenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance [^116MSw9d] [^114AzRSb].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Intermittent hypoxia from sleep apnea increases dementia risk [^112E4CCk].

---

## Clinical management of hypoxia

- **Oxygen therapy**: Titrate to SpO2 94–98% (88–92% in hypercapnic patients) [^116MWJjq] [^112QdGzW].

- **Non-invasive ventilation**: For acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia [^1154cnW7].

- **Treat underlying cause**: Correct airway, ventilation, circulatory, or cellular defects [^111eSqh9].

- **Avoid hyperoxia**: Excess oxygen can cause oxidative injury and worsen outcomes [^112QdGzW] [^113uGtLH].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Hypoxia is associated with **worse outcomes** across settings: in cancer, it confers resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and correlates with poorer survival [^111J6yU5] [^112u8eUb]; in cardiovascular disease, it exacerbates ischemia, heart failure, and arrhythmias; and in critical illness, it increases mortality and organ failure risk. Early, precise correction of hypoxia improves prognosis [^notfound].

---

Hypoxia is a **reduction in tissue oxygen availability** [^112wD751] that triggers adaptive and pathological responses; **management requires targeted oxygen therapy** [^114oUNs1] and treatment of the cause, with careful avoidance of hyperoxia [^112QdGzW].

### The clinical significance of hypoxia in human cancers [^116PidiD]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypoxia is present to some extent in most solid malignant human cancers because of an imbalance between the limited oxygen delivery capacity of the abnormal vasculature and the high oxygen consumption of tumor cells. This drives a complex and dynamic compensatory response to enable continued cell survival, including genomic changes leading to selection of hypoxia-adapted cells with a propensity to invade locally, metastasize, and recur following surgery or radiotherapy. There is indisputable clinical evidence from numerous observational and therapeutic studies across a range of tumor types to implicate hypoxia as a key determinant of cancer behavior and treatment outcome. Despite this, hypoxia-targeted treatment has failed to influence clinical practice. This is explained, in part, by emerging findings to indicate that hypoxia is not equally important in all patients even when present to the same extent. The impact of hypoxia on patient outcome and the benefit of hypoxia-targeted treatments are greatest in situations where hypoxia is a primary biological driver of disease behavior-patients with tumors having a "hypoxic driver" phenotype. The challenge for the clinical and scientific communities moving forward is to develop robust precision cancer medicine strategies for identifying these patients in the setting of other etiologic, genomic, and host-tumor factors, considering not only the state of the tumor at diagnosis but also changing patient and tumor characteristics over time.

### Hypoxia-inducible factors: where, when and why? [^11644psB]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a family of transcription factors that regulate the homeostatic response to oxygen deprivation during development, physiological adaptation, and pathological processes such as ischemia and neoplasia. Our understanding of the function of different HIF isoforms is being advanced by understanding the processes that regulate their activity, learning where and when they are expressed and what genes they regulate.

### Generating specificity and diversity in the transcriptional response to hypoxia [^116USm9E]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2009). Medium credibility.

The sensing of oxygen levels and maintenance of oxygen homeostasis is crucial for cells. The hypoxic-sensitive regulation of gene expression allows information about the oxygen status to be converted into appropriate cellular responses. Although there is a core transcriptional pathway, the signalling cascade can be modified to allow diversity and specificity in the transcriptional output. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms and factors that contribute to the observed diversity and specificity. A deeper knowledge about how hypoxic signalling is tuned will further our understanding of the cellular hypoxic response in normal physiology and how it becomes derailed in disease.

Here, we review both the opportunities and obstacles involved in making CCH a therapy. First, we review pre-clinical models in which CCH has been showing promise and discuss the purported in vivo mechanisms of rescue. Second, we highlight new concepts in oxygen biology that have emerged from preclinical studies of CCH. Third, we provide a rationale for nominating new diseases that might be amenable to CCH. Fourth, we discuss different modalities to achieve therapeutic hypoxia. Fifth, we articulate key barriers that must be considered for clinical translation. Finally, we propose a framework for advancing CCH into clinical trials.

### Special issue on hypoxia [^1158x1YW]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Due to the undisputed biological importance and protective function of HIF and its downstream targets, hypoxia and the HIF signaling pathways are emerging as novel therapeutic options to treat various organ injuries. The review by Holger K. Eltzschig's group highlights the current understanding of hypoxia signaling in different human diseases related to four different organ systems: the heart, lung, liver, and kidney. This review also discusses the divergent roles of HIFs in acute and chronic disease conditions in these four organ systems. In general, HIF stabilization by preconditioning/postconditioning or pharmacologic intervention confers a protective phenotype across all organs during acute conditions, as shown in various in vivo studies and human clinical trials. However, modulating the HIF pathway in chronic disease conditions seems to be more complex than in acute conditions, because the effects of HIF stabilization are controversial in different studies. Nonetheless, targeting the HIF signaling pathway in chronic disease conditions still holds promise in effectively managing or delaying the progression of disease. Finally, the review introduces some efforts to translate current knowledge about hypoxia signaling to clinical medicine. As our understanding of the pathophysiology of diseases and its relation to hypoxia signaling deepens, it will be possible to discover additional therapeutic targets and niches for intervention.

### Therapeutic targeting of the hypoxic tumour microenvironment [^115ySWjt]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Hypoxia is prevalent in human tumours and contributes to microenvironments that shape cancer evolution and adversely affect therapeutic outcomes. Historically, two different tumour microenvironment (TME) research communities have been discernible. One has focused on physicochemical gradients of oxygen, pH and nutrients in the tumour interstitium, motivated in part by the barrier that hypoxia poses to effective radiotherapy. The other has focused on cellular interactions involving tumour and non-tumour cells within the TME. Over the past decade, strong links have been established between these two themes, providing new insights into fundamental aspects of tumour biology and presenting new strategies for addressing the effects of hypoxia and other microenvironmental features that arise from the inefficient microvascular system in solid tumours. This Review provides a perspective on advances at the interface between these two aspects of the TME, with a focus on translational therapeutic opportunities relating to the elimination and/or exploitation of tumour hypoxia.

### Tissue hypoxia: implications for the respiratory clinician [^1173y3SL]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Oxygen is essential for normal aerobic metabolism in mammals. Hypoxia is the presence of lower than normal oxygen content and pressure in the cell. Causes of hypoxia include hypoxemia (low blood oxygen content and pressure), impaired oxygen delivery, and impaired cellular oxygen uptake/utilization. Many compensatory mechanisms exist at the global, regional, and cellular levels to allow cells to function in a hypoxic environment. Clinical management of tissue hypoxia usually focuses on global hypoxemia and oxygen delivery. As we move into the future, the clinical focus needs to change to assessing and managing mission-critical regional hypoxia to avoid unnecessary and potential toxic global strategies. We also need to focus on understanding and better harnessing the body's own adaptive mechanisms to hypoxia.

### Hypoxia: developments in basic science, physiology and clinical studies [^115kDsV1]. Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Airway management is primarily designed to avoid hypoxia, yet hypoxia remains the main ultimate cause of anaesthetic-related death and morbidity. Understanding some of the physiology of hypoxia is therefore essential as part of a 'holistic' approach to airway management. Furthermore, it is strategically important that national specialist societies dedicated to airway management do not only focus upon the technical aspects of airway management, but also embrace some of the relevant scientific questions. There has been a great deal of research into causation of hypoxia and the body's natural protective mechanisms and responses to it. This enables us to think of ways in which we might manipulate the cellular and molecular responses to confer greater protection against hypoxia-induced tissue injury. This article reviews some of those aspects.

### Is enough oxygen too much? [^116BLorn]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Human cells require O2 for their energy supply, and critical illness can threaten the efficient delivery of O2 in accordance with tissue metabolic needs. In the accompanying article, Martin and colleagues point out that hypoxia is a normal and well-tolerated stress during embryonic development. A better understanding of how fetal cells survive these conditions and how adult cells adapt to high altitude exposure may provide insight into how these mechanisms might be engaged in the treatment of hypoxemic patients. They suggest that 'permissive hypoxia' represents a therapeutic possibility. But before we turn down the inspired O2 levels we should consider the broader effects of hypoxia on tissue repair in critical illness.

### Immunologic consequences of hypoxia during critical illness [^1157zLRq]. Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Hypoxia and immunity are highly intertwined at clinical, cellular, and molecular levels. The prevention of tissue hypoxia and modulation of systemic inflammation are cornerstones of daily practice in the intensive care unit. Potentially, immunologic effects of hypoxia may contribute to outcome and represent possible therapeutic targets. Hypoxia and activation of downstream signaling pathways result in enhanced innate immune responses, aimed to augment pathogen clearance. On the other hand, hypoxia also exerts antiinflammatory and tissue-protective effects in lymphocytes and other tissues. Although human data on the net immunologic effects of hypoxia and pharmacologic modulation of downstream pathways are limited, preclinical data support the concept of tailoring the immune response through modulation of the oxygen status or pharmacologic modulation of hypoxia-signaling pathways in critically ill patients.

### Hypoxia as a medicine [^111fjids]. Science Translational Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Oxygen is essential for human life, yet a growing body of research demonstrates that chronic continuous hypoxia can be beneficial in preclinical models of mitochondrial disease, auto-immunity, ischemia, and aging. This research is revealing new and unexpected facets of oxygen biology, but translating these findings to patients poses major challenges, as hypoxia can be dangerous. Overcoming these barriers will require integrating insights from high-altitude medicine, sports technology, basic science, and clinical disciplines. Here, we explore the foundations of this nascent field and outline a path to determine how chronic continuous hypoxia can be safely, effectively, and practically delivered to patients.

### Virus-host interactions under hypoxia [^116QforZ]. Microbes and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Oxygen tension can exert a significant effect on viral propagation in vitro and possibly in vivo. In general, hypoxia restricts the replication of viruses that naturally infect tissues exposed to ambient oxygen and induces the growth of viruses that naturally target tissues exposed to low oxygen. Some viruses can reprogram cell bioenergetics towards lowering cellular respiration and therefore oxygen consumption in order to support their replication. Aim of this review is to summarize findings on the interplay between viral infection and oxygen levels, highlighting the implicated oxygen tension-sensitive elements and metabolic determinants and concluding with possible therapeutic approaches targeting these mediators.

### Hypoxia and predicting radiation response [^115Da1Dw]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

The results from many studies indicate that most solid tumors, regardless of site of origin, contain hypoxic regions. Experimental studies have demonstrated that, apart from the well-known protective effect of hypoxia on the radiation response of cells and tissues, hypoxic conditions can also result in modified gene expression patterns, causing (to a greater or lesser extent in different cell populations) genomic instability, increased invasive capacity, higher propensity to metastasize, enhanced stem cell properties, and ability to survive nutrient deprivation. Clinical trials of hypoxia-targeted treatments have demonstrated improved local tumor control and patient survival in a number of tumor sites. However, our improved understanding of the underlying biology of cellular responses to hypoxia, and its potential interactions with the heterogeneous nature of tumor phenotypes, makes it likely that not every tumor that contains regions of hypoxia would necessarily need (or benefit from) such treatments. New more effective treatments are emerging, but it is likely that these treatments would have the biggest clinical effect in situations where tumor hypoxia is a primary driver of cancer behavior. The challenge for the Radiation Oncology community is the development of robust precision cancer medicine strategies for identifying patients with such tumors, in the setting of other etiological, genomic, and host-tumor factors, and treating these patients with the appropriate hypoxia-targeting strategy to reduce the effect of hypoxia on radiation treatment response. In this context, it is important to consider not only the hypoxic state of the tumor at diagnosis but also the changing characteristics of this state during the course of treatment.

### Measurement of tumor hypoxia using single-cell methods [^117XDroe]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

A growing appreciation for the importance of hypoxia in tumor progression and response to treatment has driven efforts to develop methods that could be used routinely in the clinic to identify tumors containing hypoxic cells. The ideal method would be noninvasive and could be used both before treatment to determine the presence of hypoxia and during therapy to assess tumor reoxygenation. Although this goal is being approached, there are still questions about how best to measure tumor oxygenation and whether noninvasive imaging methods can provide the necessary sensitivity. Analysis of hypoxia at the level of the individual cell can provide the following information that cannot be obtained in other ways: the degree of hypoxia, the lifetime of hypoxic cells, and the dynamic nature of hypoxia. This review will describe methods that have been used to detect hypoxia in individual cells, the relation between these measurements and patient response to treatment, and indicate where these methods can provide important additional insights into the consequences of tumor hypoxia.

### Hypoxic burden-definitions, pathophysiological concepts, methods of evaluation, and clinical relevance [^112KpfL4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic condition that affects over a billion people worldwide and is associated with adverse cardio- and cerebrovascular consequences. Currently, the go-to clinical measure that determines the presence and severity of OSA is the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). The AHI captures the frequency of respiratory events due to changes in ventilation that are associated with either oxygen desaturations or arousal from sleep. The AHI is poorly correlated to adverse outcomes in OSA with poor prognostic ability. To overcome the limitations of AHI and perhaps driven by the ease of acquisition, several studies have suggested characterizing nocturnal hypoxia in OSA, termed as "hypoxic burden". The purpose of this review is to focus on the hypoxic burden in OSA, its various definitions, and its utility in moving OSA diagnosis beyond the AHI.

Recent findings

Several measures and definitions of hypoxic burden have been proposed and studied that show promise in overcoming limitations of AHI and also have a greater prognostic ability than AHI. More recently, area-based measures that attempt to characterize the depth and duration of oxygen desaturations, i.e. nocturnal hypoxia in OSA, have been shown to better relate to incident cardiovascular disease than AHI. In this review, we delve into the evidence for these novel area-based metrics and also delve into the pathophysiological concepts underlying nocturnal hypoxia while cautioning the reader on interpretation of the recent findings relating hypoxic burden to adverse outcomes in OSA.

Summary

In this review on hypoxic burden, we focus on the need that has driven the sudden influx of studies assessing hypoxic burden for various outcomes of OSA, its underlying pathophysiology, the various definitions, and clinical relevance. We hope that the reader can appreciate the nuances underlying hypoxic burden in OSA and suggest the need for a cohesive framework for moving beyond the AHI with hypoxic burden.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF HYPOXIC BURDEN

Ultimately, utility of novel measures that characterize hypoxic burden in OSA is judged by their clinical relevance. Overnight pulse oximetry is a relatively low-cost endeavor that can be used to monitor patients either in clinic or remotely. Thus, the measures of hypoxic burden are significantly relevant to the clinic. Although it is rare to base a diagnosis for a patient solely on a single measure, that is, without regard to patient history, based on the availability of pulse oximetry, its ease of use, perhaps hypoxic burden can serve to be used as the go-to measure for OSA. Further research is needed into what constitutes normal vs. abnormal levels of hypoxic burden. Consider this that most of the studies that have analyzed the relationship between hypoxic burden and cardiovascular disease, have used one group as a reference group, and as such a logical question is whether that reference group constitutes "normal/no OSA" group. Further, it is not yet clear how a given value of hypoxic burden would guide treatment preference in OSA, given that on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), hypoxic burden theoretically should be zero or at the very least a relatively lower value which remains to be defined. Recent study by Azarbarzin et al. and data from our group provides evidence using a secondary analysis of the APPLES study that baseline hypoxic burden may be able to predict treatment response in OSA as it relates to vigilance and daytime sleepiness. However, it must be noted that the predictive power was still not sufficient for use on an individual level, which is crucial for it to be embedded in a clinic as a diagnostic aid. As such, data are currently lacking on whether hypoxic burden can outperform AHI in predicting immediate response to treatment in the clinic. A technological hurdle that must be crossed when implementing hypoxic burden in the clinic is the fact that current CPAP devices do not have any measure of nocturnal hypoxia and doing so would require putting additional burden on the patient.

### Hypoxia-activated prodrugs: paths forward in the era of personalised medicine [^114fHffs]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Tumour hypoxia has been pursued as a cancer drug target for over 30 years, most notably using bioreductive (hypoxia-activated) prodrugs that target antineoplastic agents to low-oxygen tumour compartments. Despite compelling evidence linking hypoxia with treatment resistance and adverse prognosis, a number of such prodrugs have recently failed to demonstrate efficacy in pivotal clinical trials; an outcome that demands reflection on the discovery and development of these compounds. In this review, we discuss a clear disconnect between the pathobiology of tumour hypoxia, the pharmacology of hypoxia-activated prodrugs and the manner in which they have been taken into clinical development. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs have been evaluated in the manner of broad-spectrum cytotoxic agents, yet a growing body of evidence suggests that their activity is likely to be dependent on the coincidence of tumour hypoxia, expression of specific prodrug-activating reductases and intrinsic sensitivity of malignant clones to the cytotoxic effector. Hypoxia itself is highly variable between and within individual tumours and is not treatment-limiting in all cancer subtypes. Defining predictive biomarkers for hypoxia-activated prodrugs and overcoming the technical challenges of assaying them in clinical settings will be essential to deploying these agents in the era of personalised cancer medicine.

### Imaging hypoxia to improve radiotherapy outcome [^112gtCNV]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Reduced oxygen levels (hypoxia) is one of the most important factors influencing clinical outcome after radiotherapy. This is primarily because hypoxic cells are resistant to radiation treatment; hence, the greater the number of clonogenic cancer stem cells that exist under hypoxia, the lower the local tumour control. Reduced local control will influence overall survival, as may the hypoxic conditions by increasing malignant progression; however, to fight hypoxia, we should first be able to see it. We need noninvasive approaches that can accurately and reliably image hypoxia in tumours, especially using techniques that are routinely available in the clinic, such as PET, MRI and CT. All these imaging methods are already under clinical evaluation in this context. Such data should allow us to identify those patients on an individual basis who have hypoxic tumours and, thus, at the very least should receive some form of hypoxic modifier in conjunction with radiotherapy. Alternatively, the radiation dose could be either increased to the whole tumour or, if the imaging is accurate enough, only to the hypoxic subvolumes. The aim of this Review is to critically assess the potential use of imaging to help improve clinical outcome to radiotherapy.

### Hypoxic burden-definitions, pathophysiological concepts, methods of evaluation, and clinical relevance [^114Gv5er]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The history of AHI, the evolution of its variations (e.g. with/without arousal etc.), similarly ODI and its variations, as well as T90, is a cautionary tale as we look forward to utilizing "hypoxic burden" as a measure beyond the AHI in characterizing OSA. Already, a number of area-based measures have been published in the field, all termed hypoxic burden, that may possibly lead to confusion for researchers and clinicians interested in fully characterizing nocturnal hypoxia in OSA patients. Although a clear path forward is not evident currently, perhaps a simple change and consensus around nomenclature may suffice. Whether area-based measures that are the holy grail of a single measure that is capable of capturing the underlying pathophysiology of nocturnal hypoxia in OSA, and one that shows promise in predicting adverse consequences of OSA, remains to be tested.

More recently, area-based measures that attempt to characterize the depth and duration of oxygen desaturations, i.e., nocturnal hypoxia in OSA, have been shown to better relate to incident cardiovascular disease than AHI. In this review, we delve into the evidence for these novel area-based metrics and also delve into the pathophysiological concepts underlying nocturnal hypoxia while cautioning the reader on interpretation of the recent findings relating hypoxic burden to adverse outcomes in OSA.

Summary

In this review on hypoxic burden, we focus on the need that has driven the sudden influx of studies assessing hypoxic burden for various outcomes of OSA, its underlying pathophysiology, the various definitions, and clinical relevance. We hope that the reader can appreciate the nuances underlying hypoxic burden in OSA and suggest the need for a cohesive framework for moving beyond the AHI with hypoxic burden.

### Balancing the risks and benefits of oxygen therapy in critically III adults [^112yEykv]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Oxygen therapy is an integral part of the treatment of critically ill patients. Maintenance of adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs often requires the administration of supplemental oxygen, sometimes at high concentrations. Although oxygen therapy is lifesaving, it may be associated with deleterious effects when administered for prolonged periods at high concentrations. Here, we review the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular responses to hypoxia and high levels of oxygen and review the current guidelines for oxygen therapy in critically ill patients.

### PET of hypoxia: current and future perspectives [^111kCpsN]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

In the past 25 y, a large amount of clinical experience with hypoxia PET tracers has accumulated. This article discusses recent improvements in image acquisition protocols and tracer pharmacology that have resulted in improved understanding of the underlying physiologic processes. The widespread clinical adoption of hypoxia PET tracers will depend largely on their utility in treatment prescription and in outcome monitoring. The establishment and validation of hypoxia-directed treatment protocols are still under development, and it is envisaged that the design and use of future hypoxia PET tracers will develop as part of this process.

### Hypoxia – a key regulatory factor in tumour growth [^114AzRSb]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2002). Medium credibility.

Cells undergo a variety of biological responses when placed in hypoxic conditions, including activation of signalling pathways that regulate proliferation, angiogenesis and death. Cancer cells have adapted these pathways, allowing tumours to survive and even grow under hypoxic conditions, and tumour hypoxia is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to radiation therapy. Many elements of the hypoxia-response pathway are therefore good candidates for therapeutic targeting.

### The human side of hypoxia-inducible factor [^115FJn32]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Hypoxic regulation of erythropoiesis provided the paradigm through which HIF was discovered and initially investigated. Convergent discoveries in the biochemistry of oxygen sensing and in cardiopulmonary physiology have since established that the PHD-VHL-HIF axis is important in regulating both intracellular and systems-level human biology. The emerging role of HIF in systemic physiology, described here in terms of the response to high altitude, in fact translates to any clinical scenario in which hypoxia is a feature. Functional differences arising from common genetic variation or the availability of cofactors, such as iron, may therefore influence the clinical response to any such physiological or pathological disturbance.

### Hypoxia and metabolism. hypoxia, DNA repair and genetic instability [^1128T29G]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2008). Medium credibility.

Areas of hypoxic tumour tissue are known to be resistant to treatment and are associated with a poor clinical prognosis. There are several reasons why this might be, including the capacity of hypoxia to drive genomic instability and alter DNA damage repair pathways. Significantly, current models fail to distinguish between the complexities of the hypoxic microenvironment and the biological effects of acute hypoxia exposures versus longer-term, chronic hypoxia exposures on the transcription and translation of proteins involved in genetic stability and cell survival. Acute and chronic hypoxia might lead to different biology within the tumour and this might have a direct effect on the design of new therapies for the treatment of hypoxic tumours.

Brain tissue oxygen (PbrO₂) monitoring — evidence evaluation indicates that one Class 2 study showed hypoxia detected by monitors is associated with worse outcomes but did not link treatment in response to PbrO2 monitoring to outcomes, leading to overall evidence insufficient to support a Level II recommendation; six Class 3 studies addressed PbrO2 monitoring, three finding an effect and three not, and the inconsistency prevents its use to support a Level III recommendation.

Although care should be taken in assuming these cellular results apply in vivo, they imply that there are clear differences in the effects of physiological hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics. The magnitude of the observed changes from intact mass profiles differ considerably among hypoxia and chemical interventions. Given the complexity of the mammalian hypoxic response, these differences are not surprising, but they are nonetheless striking.

### Perioperative hypoxia. the clinical spectrum and current oxygen monitoring methodology [^111eSqh9]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

When searching for the source of hypoxia, the anesthesiologist and intensivist one served best by treating the patient in an organized approach — beginning with the environmental and pulmonary sources, searching for anemic and circulatory sources, and finally ruling out the less common histocytic causes. When treating hypoxia, the first maneuver should be to administer oxygen, ensure airway, ventilation, and circulation (the ABCs of basic life support). Further monitoring is addressed at global assessments and specific organ systems (especially in high-risk patients or during high-risk procedures). The ability to directly measure the oxygenation, blood flow, and function in each individual organ of the body is not yet available. Efforts are advancing in the ability to measure the function of important tissue beds, such as the brain and splanchnic circulation. In this regard, Table 5 provides a summary of the spectrum of monitoring technology available for various organs.

### Physiological and pathological responses to hypoxia [^111L98Xg]. The American Journal of Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

As the average age in many countries steadily rises, heart infarction, stroke, and cancer become the most common causes of death in the 21st century. The causes of these disorders are many and varied and include genetic predisposition and environmental influences, but they all share a common feature in that limitation of oxygen availability participates in the development of these pathological conditions. However, cells and organisms are able to trigger an adaptive response to hypoxic conditions that is aimed to help them to cope with these threatening conditions. This review provides a description of several systems able to sense oxygen concentration and of the responses they initiate both in the acute and also in long-term hypoxia adaptation. The role of hypoxia in three pathological conditions, myocardial and cerebral ischemia as well as tumorigenesis, is briefly discussed.

### Hypoxia and its therapeutic possibilities in paediatric cancers [^1143Wcc9]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

In tumours, hypoxia — a condition in which the demand for oxygen is higher than its availability — is well known to be associated with reduced sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and with immunosuppression. The consequences of hypoxia on tumour biology and patient outcomes have therefore led to the investigation of strategies that can alleviate hypoxia in cancer cells, with the aim of sensitising cells to treatments. An alternative therapeutic approach involves the design of prodrugs that are activated by hypoxic cells. Increasing evidence indicates that hypoxia is not just clinically significant in adult cancers but also in paediatric cancers. We evaluate relevant methods to assess the levels and extent of hypoxia in childhood cancers, including novel imaging strategies such as oxygen-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Preclinical and clinical evidence largely supports the use of hypoxia-targeting drugs in children, and we describe the critical need to identify robust predictive biomarkers for the use of such drugs in future paediatric clinical trials. Ultimately, a more personalised approach to treatment that includes targeting hypoxic tumour cells might improve outcomes in subgroups of paediatric cancer patients.

### Supplemental oxygen needs during sleep. who benefits? [^113cUGRk]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

The physiologic changes that occur in ventilation during sleep contribute to nocturnal oxygen desaturation in those with lung disease. Nocturnal supplemental oxygen is often used as therapy, although convincing data exist only for those who are hypoxemic both during sleep and wake. Ongoing trials may help address whether oxygen should be used in those with only desaturation during sleep. If used, oxygen should be dosed as needed, and patients should be monitored for hypercapnia. Because of its prevalence, obstructive sleep apnea may commonly overlap with lung disease in many patients and have important consequences. Patients with overlap syndromes may be good candidates for noninvasive ventilation during sleep.

### Oxygen toxicity in major emergency surgery-anything new? [^1172vqr3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

There is a liberal use of oxygen in anaesthesia and intensive care. The rationale is to create high levels of oxygen tension in arterial blood that, together with satisfactory tissue perfusion, should prevent hypoxemic events at a cellular level. Patients undergoing major and emergency surgery are at particular risk of low tissue perfusion. Thus, hyperoxia may appear a reasonable thinking and has received support in guidelines by the World Health Organisation, WHO, with a recently published update after criticism of the initial document. The updated version suggests to use 80% oxygen in intubated patients undergoing surgery and for some hours afterwards in an attempt to reduce postoperative surgical site infections. However, the criticism of the WHO guidelines remains as emphasised in a new editorial view by our group, where we conclude that "suggesting hyperoxia has very little scientific support and it may instead be erroneous and possibly harmful".

### Optimizing hypoxia detection and treatment strategies [^1127KdHV]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical studies using Eppendorf needle sensors have invariably documented the resistance of hypoxic human tumors to therapy. These studies first documented the need for individual patient measurement of hypoxia, as hypoxia varied from tumor to tumor. Furthermore, hypoxia in sarcomas and cervical cancer leads to distant metastasis or local or regional spread, respectively. For various reasons, the field has moved away from direct needle sensor oxygen measurements to indirect assays (hypoxia-inducible factor-related changes and bioreductive metabolism) and the latter can be imaged noninvasively. Many of hypoxia's detrimental therapeutic effects are reversible in mice but little treatment improvement in hypoxic human tumors has been seen. The question is why? What factors cause human tumors to be refractory to antihypoxia strategies? We suggest the primary cause to be the complexity of hypoxia formation and its characteristics. Three basic types of hypoxia exist, encompassing various diffusional (distance from perfused vessel), temporal (on or off cycling), and perfusional (blood flow efficiency) limitations. Surprisingly, there is no current information on their relative prevalence in human tumors and even animal models. This is important because different hypoxia subtypes are predicted to require different diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, but the implications of this remain unknown. Even more challenging, no agreement exists for the best way to measure hypoxia. Some results even suggest that hypoxia is unlikely to be targetable therapeutically. In this review, the authors revisit various critical aspects of this field that are sometimes forgotten or misrepresented in the recent literature. As most current noninvasive imaging studies involve PET-isotope-labeled 2-nitroimidazoles, we emphasize key findings made in our studies using 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)acetamide (EF5) and F-18-labeled EF5. These show the importance of differentiating hypoxia subtypes, optimizing drug pharmacology, ensuring drug and isotope stability, identifying key biochemical and physiological variables in tumors, and suggesting therapeutic strategies that are most likely to succeed.

### The endothelial response to oxygen deprivation: biology and clinical implications [^112n4p77]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This review provides the theoretical background of phenotypic and gene-based changes in the vessel wall triggered by acute hypoxia. Only in the last few decades has the endothelium been ascribed a prominent role as a modulator of vascular homeostasis under both physiological and pathological conditions. Molecular mechanisms leading to endothelial activation are being rapidly elucidated and their contribution to vascular dysfunction during hypoxia becoming better understood. New insights gained from hypoxic cell culture and ischaemic organ models may ultimately lead to new treatment strategies. If nothing else, insights gained from vascular research will lead to a more complete understanding of the inflammatory processes in blood vessels and how they impact on human disease.

Integrative human hypoxia physiology: the response to high altitude

Lowland residents travelling to high altitude experience profound physiological changes as a result of environmental hypoxia. This acclimatisation process conveniently demonstrates the systemic effects of isolated hypoxia, which are less pleiotropic than might be expected from the great functional diversity present within the HIF-regulated transcriptome. Haematological, respiratory and cardiovascular responses predominate and are described in this section.

### Ambulatory home oxygen: what is the evidence for benefit, and who does it help? [^111BSC6r]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

The beneficial effects of ambulatory home oxygen have been demonstrated since the 1950s, when Cotes and Gibson gave oxygen to ambulatory COPD patients from small portable high pressures cylinders in the United Kingdom. Over the ensuing 7 decades, oxygen has been prescribed to millions of COPD patients in the home setting. Additionally, it is common clinical practice to prescribe supplemental oxygen when chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure not due to COPD (eg, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, kyphoscoliosis, and cystic fibrosis) is present or in patients with hypoxemia at hospital discharge following flares of their underlying chronic respiratory disorder, without any substantial evidence. Despite the importance of long-term oxygen therapy in clinical home management, there are many gaps in our current knowledge regarding its mechanisms of action, indications for prescription, and its effects on important patient outcomes. Research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s still provides the basis for clinical decision making and insurance coverage policies regarding long-term oxygen administration. Remarkably, little current research is being conducted to extend our knowledge regarding the indications, mechanisms, and benefits of long-term oxygen therapy. This review will focus on our current knowledge of the end points for supplemental oxygen at home, such as mortality, effects on functional performance, sensation of dyspnea, cognitive function, and quality of life, and highlight areas where future research is needed.

### Molecular imaging of tumor hypoxia with positron emission tomography [^113yQEN5]. Radiation Research (2014). Low credibility.

The problem of tumor hypoxia has been recognized and studied by the oncology community for over 60 years. From radiation and chemotherapy resistance to the increased risk of metastasis, low oxygen concentrations in tumors have caused patients with many types of tumors to respond poorly to conventional cancer therapies. It is clear that patients with high levels of tumor hypoxia have a poorer overall treatment response and that the magnitude of hypoxia is an important prognostic factor. As a result, the development of methods to measure tumor hypoxia using invasive and noninvasive techniques has become desirable to the clinical oncology community. A variety of imaging modalities have been established to visualize hypoxia in vivo. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, in particular, has played a key role for imaging tumor hypoxia because of the development of hypoxia-specific radiolabelled agents. Consequently, this technique is increasingly used in the clinic for a wide variety of cancer types. Following a broad overview of the complexity of tumor hypoxia and measurement techniques to date, this article will focus specifically on the accuracy and reproducibility of PET imaging to quantify tumor hypoxia. Despite numerous advances in the field of PET imaging for hypoxia, we continue to search for the ideal hypoxia tracer to both qualitatively and quantitatively define the tumor hypoxic volume in a clinical setting to optimize treatments and predict response in cancer patients.

### Oxygen therapy in critical illness: precise control of arterial oxygenation and permissive hypoxemia [^113PascJ]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The management of hypoxemia in critically ill patients is challenging. Whilst the harms of tissue hypoxia are well recognized, the possibility of harm from excess oxygen administration, or other interventions targeted at mitigating hypoxemia, may be inadequately appreciated. The benefits of attempting to fully reverse arterial hypoxemia may be outweighed by the harms associated with high concentrations of supplemental oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation strategies. We propose two novel related strategies for the management of hypoxemia in critically ill patients. First, we describe precise control of arterial oxygenation involving the specific targeting of arterial partial pressure of oxygen or arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation to individualized target values, with the avoidance of significant variation from these levels. The aim of precise control of arterial oxygenation is to avoid the harms associated with inadvertent hyperoxia or hypoxia through careful and precise control of arterial oxygen levels. Secondly, we describe permissive hypoxemia: the acceptance of levels of arterial oxygenation lower than is conventionally tolerated in patients. The aim of permissive hypoxemia is to minimize the possible harms caused by restoration of normoxemia while avoiding tissue hypoxia. This review sets out to discuss the strengths and limitations of precise control of arterial oxygenation and permissive hypoxemia as candidate management strategies in hypoxemic critically ill patients.

Design

We searched PubMed for references to "permissive hypoxemia/hypoxaemia" and "precise control of arterial oxygenation" as well as reference to "profound hypoxemia/hypoxaemia/hypoxia", "severe hypoxemia/hypoxaemia/hypoxia". We searched personal reference libraries in the areas of critical illness and high altitude physiology and medicine. We also identified large clinical studies in patients with critical illness characterized by hypoxemia such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Subjects

Studies were selected that explored the physiology of hypoxemia in healthy volunteers or critically ill patients.

Setting

The data were subjectively assessed and combined to generate the narrative.

Results

Inadequate tissue oxygenation and excessive oxygen administration can be detrimental to outcome but safety thresholds lack definition in critically ill patients. Precise control of arterial oxygenation provides a rational approach to the management of arterial oxygenation that reflects recent clinical developments in other settings. Permissive hypoxemia is a concept that is untested clinically and requires robust investigation prior to consideration of implementation. Both strategies will require accurate monitoring of oxygen administration and arterial oxygenation. Effective, reliable measurement of tissue oxygenation along with the use of selected biomarkers to identify suitable candidates and monitor harm will aid the development of permissive hypoxemia as viable clinical strategy.

Conclusions

Implementation of precise control of arterial oxygenation may avoid the harms associated with excessive and inadequate oxygenation. However, at present there is no direct evidence to support the immediate implementation of permissive hypoxemia and a comprehensive evaluation of its value in critically ill patients should be a high research priority.

### The human side of hypoxia-inducible factor [^114pq5tb]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

When humans are exposed to hypoxia, systemic and intracellular changes operate together to minimise hypoxic injury and restore adequate oxygenation. Emerging evidence indicates that the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors plays a central regulatory role in these homeostatic changes at both the systemic and cellular levels. HIF was discovered through its action as the transcriptional activator of erythropoietin, and has subsequently been found to control intracellular hypoxic responses throughout the body. HIF is primarily regulated by specific prolyl hydroxylase-domain enzymes (PHDs) that initiate its degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein (VHL). The oxygen and iron dependency of PHD activity accounts for regulation of the pathway by both cellular oxygen and iron status. Recent studies conducted in patients with rare genetic diseases have begun to uncover the wider importance of the PHD-VHL-HIF axis in systems-level human biology. These studies indicate that, in addition to regulating erythropoiesis, the system plays an important role in cardiopulmonary regulation. This article reviews our current understanding of the importance of HIF in human systems-level physiology, and is modelled around the classic physiological response to high-altitude hypoxia.

### The hypoxic tumour microenvironment [^113KkZ99]. Oncogenesis (2018). Low credibility.

Cancer progression often benefits from the selective conditions present in the tumour microenvironment, such as the presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), deregulated ECM deposition, expanded vascularisation and repression of the immune response. Generation of a hypoxic environment and activation of its main effector, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), are common features of advanced cancers. In addition to the impact on tumour cell biology, the influence that hypoxia exerts on the surrounding cells represents a critical step in the tumorigenic process. Hypoxia indeed enables a number of events in the tumour microenvironment that lead to the expansion of aggressive clones from heterogeneous tumour cells and promote a lethal phenotype. In this article, we review the most relevant findings describing the influence of hypoxia and the contribution of HIF activation on the major components of the tumour microenvironment, and we summarise their role in cancer development and progression.

### Special issue on hypoxia [^115UX6hb]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The critical roles of oxygen (O 2) in aerobic respiration and metabolism are indisputable. Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor in the mitochondrial electron transport chain to generate ATP within eukaryotic cells. Therefore, an adequate concentration of oxygen is required by eukaryotic cells to maintain a variety of biological activities and ensure survival. When oxygen levels in the whole body or local tissues are severely reduced, hypoxia occurs, leading to a metabolic crisis and threatening physiological functions and viability. Because of the importance of oxygen, eukaryotes have developed an efficient and rapid oxygen-sensing system: hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Hypoxic responses are controlled by HIF stabilization, which induces the expression of more than 100 downstream target genes to increase the oxygen supply and support anaerobic ATP generation in eukaryotic cells. Over the past two decades, HIF isotypes and their functions, and binding factors/coactivators, and the regulatory mechanisms by which cells sense hypoxia and transduce a signal to the HIF pathway have been intensively studied by many researchers and expanded our knowledge of hypoxia to the cellular and molecular levels. The HIF pathway is summarized in the introduction section of the review by Holger K. Eltzschig's group (The University of Texas Health Science Center) and in the first section ("Hypoxia and the HIF pathway") of the review by Eui-Ju Yeo (Gachon University).

### Hypoxic burden-definitions, pathophysiological concepts, methods of evaluation, and clinical relevance [^114hNkN2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

EVALUATING HYPOXIC BURDEN IN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA

All currently studied metrics of hypoxic burden rely on the use of the pulse oximetry signal obtained during a routine sleep study or nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG). It is worth noting that hypoxic burden as a concept is different from oxygen desaturation metrics that are termed "hypoxic burden". In OSA, hypoxic burden as a concept is defined to be measure the load of nocturnal hypoxia and it is assumed that any measure of OSA-related hypoxic burden would also account for the intermittent nature of oxygen desaturations. On the other hand, as will be discussed in depth below, published metrics that characterize oxygen desaturations overnight that are termed as "hypoxic burden" refer to a particular method of defining the underlying nocturnal hypoxia in OSA. As such, conceptually, there is only one hypoxic burden in OSA, but the ways to derive it could be several.

Pulse oximetry measured oxygen saturation (SpO 2) forms the basis for all hypoxic burden measures. Pulse oximetry is routinely acquired during NPSG and although its administration is relatively standardized across different sleep labs, key parameters of each pulse oximeter must be considered to ensure fair comparison and reproducibility of developed methods for hypoxic burden. Most notably, depending on the manufacturer, the averaging time for each pulse oximeter is different and several hypoxic burden measures may be sensitive to it. Further, although pulse oximetry administration as part of a routine NPSG is also standardized across sleep labs, sampling rates should be standardized to 1 Hz to avoid any nonphysiological artifacts. The preprocessing of SpO 2 signals (e.g. removal of invalid signal periods, disconnects etc.) for evaluating hypoxic burden is another consideration that must be noted when comparing metrics or determining their utility.

Broadly, the definitions can be categorized into three groups: index-based, Time-based, and area-based measures. All measures aim to characterize intermittency of nocturnal hypoxia and their severity in OSA.

### Modulation of cell death in the tumor microenvironment [^116MSw9d]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The microenvironment of solid human tumors is characterized by heterogeneity in oxygenation. Hypoxia arises early in the process of tumor development because rapidly proliferating tumor cells outgrow the capacity of the host vasculature. Formation of solid tumors thus requires coordination of angiogenesis with continued tumor cell proliferation. However, despite such neovascularization, hypoxia is persistent and frequently found in tumors at the time of diagnosis. Tumors with low oxygenation have a poor prognosis, and strong evidence suggests this is because of the effects of hypoxia on malignant progression, angiogenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance. The presence of viable hypoxic cells is likely a reflection of the development of hypoxia tolerance resulting from modulation of cell death in the microenvironment. This acquired feature has been explained on the basis of clonal selection-the hypoxic microenvironment selects cells capable of surviving in the absence of normal oxygen availability. However, the persistence and frequency of hypoxia in solid tumors raises a second potential explanation. We suggest that stable microregions of hypoxia may play a positive role in tumor growth. Although hypoxia inhibits cell proliferation and in tumor cells will eventually induce cell death, hypoxia also provides angiogenic and metastatic signals. The development of hypoxia tolerance will thus allow prolonged survival in the absence of oxygen and generation of a persistent angiogenic signal. We will discuss the concept of hypoxia tolerance and review mechanisms used by cancer cells to acquire this phenotype. The concept of hypoxia tolerance has important implications for current and future therapeutic approaches. Most therapeutic efforts to combat hypoxia have focused on targeting the presence of hypoxia itself. Our hypothesis predicts that targeting the biological responses to hypoxia and the pathways leading to hypoxia tolerance may also be attractive therapeutic strategies.

### Higher versus lower fractions of inspired oxygen or targets of arterial oxygenation for adults admitted to the intensive care unit [^113uGtLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated review concerning 'Higher versus lower fractions of inspired oxygen or targets of arterial oxygenation for adults admitted to the intensive care unit'. Supplementary oxygen is provided to most patients in intensive care units (ICUs) to prevent global and organ hypoxia (inadequate oxygen levels). Oxygen has been administered liberally, resulting in high proportions of patients with hyperoxemia (exposure of tissues to abnormally high concentrations of oxygen). This has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity in some settings, but not in others. Thus far, only limited data have been available to inform clinical practice guidelines, and the optimum oxygenation target for ICU patients is uncertain. Because of the publication of new trial evidence, we have updated this review.

Objectives

To update the assessment of benefits and harms of higher versus lower fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) or targets of arterial oxygenation for adults admitted to the ICU.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS Previews, and LILACS. We searched for ongoing or unpublished trials in clinical trial registers and scanned the reference lists and citations of included trials. Literature searches for this updated review were conducted in November 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared higher versus lower FiO 2 or targets of arterial oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2), peripheral or arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2 or SaO 2)) for adults admitted to the ICU. We included trials irrespective of publication type, publication status, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants to hypoxaemia (FiO 2 below 0.21, SaO 2 /SpO 2 below 80%, or PaO 2 below 6 kPa) or to hyperbaric oxygen, and cross-over trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors independently, and in pairs, screened the references identified in the literature searches and extracted the data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events (SAEs), and quality of life. We analysed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. Only three trials reported the proportion of participants with one or more SAEs as a composite outcome. However, most trials reported on events categorised as SAEs according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) criteria. We, therefore, conducted two analyses of the effect of higher versus lower oxygenation strategies using 1) the single SAE with the highest reported proportion in each trial, and 2) the cumulated proportion of participants with an SAE in each trial. Two trials reported on quality of life. Secondary outcomes were lung injury, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sepsis. No trial reported on lung injury as a composite outcome, but four trials reported on the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and five on pneumonia. We, therefore, conducted two analyses of the effect of higher versus lower oxygenation strategies using 1) the single lung injury event with the highest reported proportion in each trial, and 2) the cumulated proportion of participants with ARDS or pneumonia in each trial. We assessed the risk of systematic errors by evaluating the risk of bias in the included trials using the Risk of Bias 2 tool. We used the GRADEpro tool to assess the overall certainty of the evidence. We also evaluated the risk of publication bias for outcomes reported by 10b or more trials.

Main Results

We included 19 RCTs (10,385 participants), of which 17 reported relevant outcomes for this review (10,248 participants). For all-cause mortality, 10 trials were judged to be at overall low risk of bias, and six at overall high risk of bias. For the reported SAEs, 10 trials were judged to be at overall low risk of bias, and seven at overall high risk of bias. Two trials reported on quality of life, of which one was judged to be at overall low risk of bias and one at high risk of bias for this outcome. Meta-analysis of all trials, regardless of risk of bias, indicated no significant difference from higher or lower oxygenation strategies at maximum follow-up with regard to mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (C)I 0.96 to 1.06; I² = 14%; 16 trials; 9408 participants; very low-certainty evidence); occurrence of SAEs: the highest proportion of any specific SAE in each trial RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.06; I² = 36%; 9466 participants; 17 trials; very low-certainty evidence), or quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.5 points in participants assigned to higher oxygenation strategies (95% CI -2.75 to 1.75; I² = 34%, 1649 participants; 2 trials; very low-certainty evidence)). Meta-analysis of the cumulated number of SAEs suggested benefit of a lower oxygenation strategy (RR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.07; I² = 74%; 9489 participants; 17 trials; very low certainty evidence)). However, trial sequential analyses, with correction for sparse data and repetitive testing, could reject a relative risk increase or reduction of 10% for mortality and the highest proportion of SAEs, and 20% for both the cumulated number of SAEs and quality of life. Given the very low-certainty of evidence, it is necessary to interpret these findings with caution. Meta-analysis of all trials indicated no statistically significant evidence of a difference between higher or lower oxygenation strategies on the occurrence of lung injuries at maximum follow-up (the highest reported proportion of lung injury RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.38; I² = 0%; 2048 participants; 8 trials; very low-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis of all trials indicated harm from higher oxygenation strategies as compared with lower on the occurrence of sepsis at maximum follow-up (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.93; I² = 0%; 752 participants; 3 trials; very low-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis indicated no differences regarding the occurrences of myocardial infarction or stroke.

Authors' Conclusions

In adult ICU patients, it is still not possible to draw clear conclusions about the effects of higher versus lower oxygenation strategies on all-cause mortality, SAEs, quality of life, lung injuries, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sepsis at maximum follow-up. This is due to low or very low-certainty evidence.

### Pre-hospital oxygen therapy [^111XkaeA]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Oxygen use in prehospital care is aimed at treating or preventing hypoxemia. However, excess oxygen delivery has important consequences in select patients, and hyperoxia can adversely impact outcome. The unique environment of prehospital care poses logistical and educational challenges. Oxygen therapy in prehospital care should be provided to patients with hypoxemia and titrated to achieve normoxemia. Changes to the current practice of oxygen delivery in prehospital care are needed.

### Beyond the guidelines for non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure: implications for practice [^1154cnW7]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation is standard therapy in the management of both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure of various causes. The evidence base for its use and when and how it should be used has been reviewed in two recent guidelines. In this Series paper, we look beyond the guidelines to what is happening in everyday clinical practice in the real world, how patient selection can be refined to maximise the chances of a successful outcome, and emerging alternative therapies. Real-world application of non-invasive ventilation diverges from guideline recommendations, particularly with regard to patient selection and timing of initiation. To improve patient outcomes education programmes need to stress these issues and the effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation that is delivered needs to be monitored by regular audit.

### Molecular imaging of hypoxia with radiolabelled agents [^111UShgL]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Tissue hypoxia results from an inadequate supply of oxygen (O2) that compromises biological functions. Structural and functional abnormalities of the tumour vasculature together with altered diffusion conditions inside the tumour seem to be the main causes of tumour hypoxia. Evidence from experimental and clinical studies points to a role for tumour hypoxia in tumour propagation, resistance to therapy and malignant progression. This has led to the development of assays for the detection of hypoxia in patients in order to predict outcome and identify patients with a worse prognosis and/or patients that would benefit from appropriate treatments. A variety of invasive and non-invasive approaches have been developed to measure tumour oxygenation including oxygen-sensitive electrodes and hypoxia marker techniques using various labels that can be detected by different methods such as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. This review aims to give a detailed overview of non-invasive molecular imaging modalities with radiolabelled PET and SPECT tracers that are available to measure tumour hypoxia.

Hypoxia imaging

Non-invasive imaging methods to repeatedly and rapidly quantify the extent and heterogeneity of hypoxia within an individual tumour in vivo would offer a clinical benefit in personalised treatment planning. There is a pressing need for imaging biomarkers not only to identify patients with hypoxic tumours, but also to map the degree and distribution of hypoxia to optimise radiotherapy planning and to assess the effects of hypoxia-modifying approaches for therapeutic gain.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a non-invasive approach for monitoring cancer. MRI exploits the magnetic moment of protons in water within the tissue to create high-resolution anatomical images with exquisite soft-tissue contrast. As non-ionising radiation is used, MRI lends itself well to repeat investigations. Image acquisition can be sensitised to numerous independent contrast mechanisms, from which parametric maps can be calculated and used to provide additional information on tumour structure and function. Such multiparametric MRI strategies can thus be used to evaluate intratumoural heterogeneity and its relationship to tumour progression and treatment response.

The significance of tumour hypoxia

Tissue hypoxia is the result of inadequate tissue oxygenation due to an imbalance between oxygen supply and consumption. Hypoxia in solid tumours is largely due to the decreased delivery of oxygenated blood to meet the increased metabolic demands of the rapidly proliferating tumour cells. Other pathogenetic factors pre-eminent in the aetiology of tumour hypoxia lie in the chaotic and primitive tumour microvasculature, which exhibits severe structural and functional abnormalities, heterogeneous microcirculation patterns, and an adverse geometry that poses limitations to oxygen diffusion. In addition, the reduced oxygen binding ability and/or transport capacity of haemoglobin, due to rouleaux formation, and the presence of disease- or therapy-related anaemia may also exacerbate hypoxia.

Tumour hypoxia may be broadly classified as chronic and acute. Chronic or diffusion-limited hypoxia primarily arises as a consequence of the disorganised vascular architecture of tumours, where the distances between tumour microvessels are often increased from normal. Consequently, the diffusion distances of oxygen in perivascular space — typically 70–180 μ m from the nearest capillary — are often exceeded. In addition, an adverse vascular geometry and prolonged reductions in blood oxygen content due to anaemia can also result in chronic hypoxia. By contrast, acute or perfusion-limited hypoxia is characterised by fluctuations in tumour blood flow that are caused by transient reductions in perfusion. Both chronic and acute hypoxia can concur in tumours, leading to the formation of a highly dynamic microenvironment, where cells are exposed to differential oxygen gradients both spatially and temporally. Owing to the dynamic and heterogeneous character of tumour hypoxia, imaging with PET presents an attractive alternative, as it does not require invasive biopsies, provides information across the entire tumour, and allows repeated and quantifiable measurements.

### Oxygen use in critical illness [^114kjWbz]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Oxygen is the most commonly used drug in critical care. However, because it is a gas, most clinicians and most patients do not regard it as a drug. For this reason, the use of medical oxygen over the past century has been driven by custom, practice, and "precautionary principles" rather than by scientific principles. Oxygen is a life-saving drug for patients with severe hypoxemia, but, as with all other drugs, too much can be harmful. It has been known for many decades that the administration of supplemental oxygen is hazardous for some patients with COPD and other patients who are vulnerable to retention of carbon dioxide (ie, hypercapnia). It has been recognized more recently that excessive oxygen therapy is associated with significantly increased mortality in critically ill patients, even in the absence of risk factors for hypercapnia. This paper provides a critical overview of past and present oxygen use for critically ill patients and will provide guidance for safer oxygen use in the future.

### Should oxygen therapy Be tightly regulated to minimize hyperoxia in critically ill patients? [^112SbxGz]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

Oxygen is both lifesaving and toxic. Appropriate use of oxygen aims to provide a balance between the two effects. Although local oxygen toxicity to the lung is well accepted, recent evidence has called into question the negative consequences of hyperoxemia in other organ beds. Hyperoxia following cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, and stroke has been shown to worsen outcomes. The role of hyperoxemia in mechanically ventilated patients, in the face of non-toxic inspired oxygen concentrations, is less clear. This paper will review the data for and against the use of conservative oxygen targets and the avoidance of hyperoxemia in mechanically ventilated patients.

### Imaging tumour hypoxia with positron emission tomography [^112nUr1s]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Hypoxia, a hallmark of most solid tumours, is a negative prognostic factor due to its association with an aggressive tumour phenotype and therapeutic resistance. Given its prominent role in oncology, accurate detection of hypoxia is important, as it impacts on prognosis and could influence treatment planning. A variety of approaches have been explored over the years for detecting and monitoring changes in hypoxia in tumours, including biological markers and noninvasive imaging techniques. Positron emission tomography (PET) is the preferred method for imaging tumour hypoxia due to its high specificity and sensitivity to probe physiological processes in vivo, as well as the ability to provide information about intracellular oxygenation levels. This review provides an overview of imaging hypoxia with PET, with an emphasis on the advantages and limitations of the currently available hypoxia radiotracers.

### Hypoxic burden-definitions, pathophysiological concepts, methods of evaluation, and clinical relevance [^116vitgm]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

One possible reason that AHI, as a universally used metric for presence of OSA as well as its severity, is inconsistently associated with adverse outcomes, is that it fails to capture the depth and breadth of OSA as a disease. It has been shown that not only individuals have differing degrees of ventilatory deficit, but the responses to those ventilatory deficit differ as well. AHI disregards this heterogeneity and groups individuals into similar groups, and while one way to capture this heterogeneity might be to design a completely new measure, or perhaps two, one for the presence and another for severity of OSA, a simpler alternative might be to re-examine AHI and its usage. AHI can be considered a fixed combination of three possibly independent domains: ventilatory, hypoxic, and arousal. Several studies have suggested that measures that characterize OSA along these domains have better prognostic ability than AHI. Butler et al. studied event duration of respiratory events and found that it was associated with CVD more so than AHI. Along the respiratory domain, work from our group also suggests that the breath-by-breath amplitudes, derived in an automated fashion, is a strong predictor of incident CVD than AHI. Azarbarzin et al. studied the area under candidate oxygen desaturation events and similarly found that their measure of nocturnal hypoxia was better related to CVD than AHI. And along the arousal domain, measures of arousal intensity were likewise shown to be stronger predictors of CVD than AHI. Furthermore, work from our group also suggests that a data-driven combination of measures along these three domains may better predict immediate and long-term consequences of OSA.

In our continually evolving understanding of OSA as a disease, evidence from several studies suggests that changes in ventilation, whether due to single or multiple factors underlying pathogenesis of OSA, precipitates changes in blood gas which leads to increased nocturnal hypoxia that may or may not culminate in arousal from sleep. It is thought that hypoxia dominant OSA, subtype of OSA in which ventilatory changes during the night result in oxygen desaturation, but not necessarily arousal from sleep, can increase vascular inflammation, sympathetic nervous system activity, and as a result may lead to an increased risk for CVD. As such, it is thought that when considering cardiovascular disease, assessing severity of OSA should perhaps be made synonymous with assessing severity of nocturnal hypoxia.

### Oxygen therapy in patients with acute Heart failure: friend or foe? [^114AHLMo]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Supplemental oxygen, a therapy that has been used for more than a century, is recommended in all practice guidelines in the management of hypoxemic (peripheral oxygen saturation < 90% to 94% or partial arterial oxygen pressure < 60 mm Hg) patients with acute heart failure, but its use in normoxemic patients is controversial. Several pre-clinical and early clinical studies have shown the detrimental effects of oxygen therapy and subsequent hyperoxia in patients with normal oxygen saturation levels. These effects are suggested to be gauged by the increased production of reactive oxygen species and the related oxidative stress and by the reductions in coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption resulting from hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction in the cerebral, coronary, and systemic vasculature. Considering these findings, recent practice guidelines are diverging from the previous consensus that oxygen should be administered routinely in patients with cardiac disease, but this new direction is also based on expert opinions rather than evidence such as well-designed trials. In this review, the authors summarize current evidence regarding the cardiovascular effects of supplemental oxygen therapy, particularly evidence from the field of acute heart failure, and delineate knowledge gaps in the field and future directions in research.

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — background on pediatric oxygen therapy emphasizes common use for hypoxemia in acute conditions but highlights risks and the need for appropriate delivery selection. Oxygen is one of the most commonly delivered medications to children for the treatment of hypoxemia caused by many acute conditions such as lower respiratory tract infections, sepsis, or shock. Oxygen therapy does, however, have consequences of over-use and hyperoxia, such as oxygen toxicity and absorption atelectasis. The delivery of oxygen in pediatric patients requires appropriate selection of the delivery device, concentration, and flow for the most effective therapy to avoid both hypoxia and hyperoxia.

Hypoxia-targeted treatment strategy 3: targeting the downstream effects of tumour hypoxia

The activation of HIFs in hypoxic tissues promotes angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and a stem-cell-like phenotype, which collectively increases tumour invasion and metastasis.HIF-mediated resistance to chemotherapy is linked to the induction of autophagy, defective apoptosis, reduction of DNA damage and overexpression of drug efflux proteins. In hypoxic conditions, resistance to radiotherapy is primarily due to the lack of oxygen to stabilise radiation-induced free radicals. Additionally, increased HIF activity has a protective effect on the tumour vasculature. Higher HIF-1 expression levels after radiation lead to the secretion of VEGF, which inhibits apoptosis in endothelial cells, thereby reducing the vascular damage normally caused by radiation. The discovery of this key regulatory pathway has led to several attempts to inhibit HIF and its downstream targets.

### Targeting hypoxia to improve non-small cell lung cancer outcome [^112u8eUb]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2018). Low credibility.

Oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an important factor in treatment resistance and poor survival. Hypoxia is an attractive therapeutic target, particularly in the context of radiotherapy, which is delivered to more than half of NSCLC patients. However, NSCLC hypoxia-targeted therapy trials have not yet translated into patient benefit. Recently, early termination of promising evofosfamide and tarloxotinib bromide studies due to futility highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in our approach to avoid disappointments in future trials. Radiotherapy dose painting strategies based on hypoxia imaging require careful refinement prior to clinical investigation. This review will summarize the role of hypoxia, highlight the potential of hypoxia as a therapeutic target, and outline past and ongoing hypoxia-targeted therapy trials in NSCLC. Evidence supporting radiotherapy dose painting based on hypoxia imaging will be critically appraised. Carefully selected hypoxia biomarkers suitable for integration within future NSCLC hypoxia-targeted therapy trials will be examined. Research gaps will be identified to guide future investigation. Although this review will focus on NSCLC hypoxia, more general discussions (eg, obstacles of hypoxia biomarker research and developing a framework for future hypoxia trials) are applicable to other tumor sites.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115eHJQ2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Proper reassessment of home oxygen needs is so important that it has been identified as one of the top five areas for further improvement in adult respiratory medicine by the Choosing Wisely Campaign. According to the TSANZ guideline, patients who commence LTOT after a COPD exacerbation should be reassessed 4–8 weeks after hospital discharge to ensure continued eligibility. In patients prescribed home oxygen for severe chronic resting room air hypoxemia, the 2020 GOLD initiative recommends reassessing the need for oxygen after 60–90 days; when home oxygen is started to treat severe hypoxemia after a COPD exacerbation, the GOLD initiative recommends reassessing the home oxygen requirement at 1–4 weeks and again at 12–16 weeks to update the oxygen prescription as clinically indicated. At the time of reassessments, SpO₂ (or arterial blood gases) at rest and with exertion should be considered. Ideally, reevaluation should occur at home to capture context and barriers to use. Expert opinion suggests that patients should be monitored, at minimum, every 6 months to confirm continued oxygen use, a current oxygen prescription, and adequacy of the equipment used.

Values and preferences

This recommendation places a high value on reducing mortality and a lower value on cost and resource use.

Research needs

The practice of initiating short-term oxygen therapy on hospital discharge in patients with severe hypoxemia is based on indirect evidence from the NOTT and MRC clinical trial populations with chronic hypoxemia. The harms and benefits of prescribing short-term oxygen therapy on hospital discharge deserves further study. The panel recommends studies to develop and test the acceptability and effectiveness of easy-to-use ambulatory oxygen equipment that can facilitate LTOT use by patients, to identify strategies that improve adherence to LTOT, and to develop and test strategies to discontinue home oxygen in patients who recover sufficiently after an exacerbation or no longer have a clinical indication for its use. Studies to examine whether some subgroups of patients with COPD and severe hypoxemia (e.g. higher hematocrit, higher mean PAP, early hemodynamic impairment) are more or less likely to benefit from LTOT are also needed.

### Oxygen therapy in COPD [^113JYrXd]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is a mainstay treatment for patients with severe resting hypoxemia secondary to chronic respiratory conditions including COPD. The evidence for LTOT is based on two trials that are now several decades old but have been insufficiently revisited. Therefore, many questions remain about precisely which patients experience the most benefit from LTOT, as well as how to define that benefit. Most studies have examined LTOT's effect on longevity rather than its impact on quality of life. In addition, many challenges exist in training both clinicians and patients on best practices for LTOT and associated equipment. Reimbursement policies have reduced the kinds of equipment available to the LTOT patient community, presenting additional challenges. This paper will review the current evidence for LTOT in COPD, the challenges involved with providing optimal therapy, and potential avenues of modernizing this essential intervention.

### Higher versus lower fraction of inspired oxygen or targets of arterial oxygenation for adults admitted to the intensive care unit [^116B7bxv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The mainstay treatment for hypoxaemia is oxygen therapy, which is given to the vast majority of adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The practice of oxygen administration has been liberal, which may result in hyperoxaemia. Some studies have indicated an association between hyperoxaemia and mortality, whilst other studies have not. The ideal target for supplemental oxygen for adults admitted to the ICU is uncertain. Despite a lack of robust evidence of effectiveness, oxygen administration is widely recommended in international clinical practice guidelines. The potential benefit of supplemental oxygen must be weighed against the potentially harmful effects of hyperoxaemia.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of higher versus lower fraction of inspired oxygen or targets of arterial oxygenation for adults admitted to the ICU.

Search Methods

We identified trials through electronic searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS Previews, CINAHL, and LILACS. We searched for ongoing or unpublished trials in clinical trials registers. We also scanned the reference lists of included studies. We ran the searches in December 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared higher versus lower fraction of inspired oxygen or targets of arterial oxygenation for adults admitted to the ICU. We included trials irrespective of publication type, publication status, and language. We included trials with a difference between the intervention and control groups of a minimum 1 kPa in partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2), minimum 10% in fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2), or minimum 2% in arterial oxygen saturation of haemoglobin/non-invasive peripheral oxygen saturation (SaO 2 /SpO 2). We excluded trials randomizing participants to hypoxaemia (FiO 2 below 0.21, SaO 2 /SpO 2 below 80%, and PaO 2 below 6 kPa) and to hyperbaric oxygen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently, and in pairs, screened the references retrieved in the literature searches and extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events, and quality of life. None of the trials reported the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) criteria. Nonetheless, most trials reported several serious adverse events. We therefore included an analysis of the effect of higher versus lower fraction of inspired oxygen, or targets using the highest reported proportion of participants with a serious adverse event in each trial. Our secondary outcomes were lung injury, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and sepsis. None of the trials reported on lung injury as a composite outcome, however some trials reported on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia. We included an analysis of the effect of higher versus lower fraction of inspired oxygen or targets using the highest reported proportion of participants with ARDS or pneumonia in each trial. To assess the risk of systematic errors, we evaluated the risk of bias of the included trials. We used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 10 RCTs (1458 participants), seven of which reported relevant outcomes for this review (1285 participants). All included trials had an overall high risk of bias, whilst two trials had a low risk of bias for all domains except blinding of participants and personnel. Meta-analysis indicated harm from higher fraction of inspired oxygen or targets as compared with lower fraction or targets of arterial oxygenation regarding mortality at the time point closest to three months (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.37; I² = 0%; 4 trials; 1135 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis indicated harm from higher fraction of inspired oxygen or targets as compared with lower fraction or targets of arterial oxygenation regarding serious adverse events at the time point closest to three months (estimated highest proportion of specific serious adverse events in each trial RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.23; I² = 0%; 1234 participants; 6 trials; very low-certainty evidence). These findings should be interpreted with caution given that they are based on very low-certainty evidence. None of the included trials reported any data on quality of life at any time point. Meta-analysis indicated no evidence of a difference between higher fraction of inspired oxygen or targets as compared with lower fraction or targets of arterial oxygenation on lung injury at the time point closest to three months (estimated highest reported proportion of lung injury RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.36; I² = 0%; 1167 participants; 5 trials; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included trials reported any data on acute myocardial infarction or stroke, and only one trial reported data on the effects on sepsis.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain about the effects of higher versus lower fraction of inspired oxygen or targets of arterial oxygenation for adults admitted to the ICU on all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and lung injuries at the time point closest to three months due to very low-certainty evidence. Our results indicate that oxygen supplementation with higher versus lower fractions or oxygenation targets may increase mortality. None of the trials reported the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events according to the ICH-GCP criteria, however we found that the trials reported an increase in the number of serious adverse events with higher fractions or oxygenation targets. The effects on quality of life, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and sepsis are unknown due to insufficient data.

### Supporting oxygenation in acute respiratory failure [^111zZFh1]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Strategies to support oxygenation can cause substantial harm through lung stretch injury, oxygen toxicity, transfusion risks and cardiac over-stimulation. Traditional goals of maintaining near normal cardiorespiratory parameters are most likely overly simplistic and are insensitive and nonspecific for tissue hypoxic effects. In order to reduce iatrogenic harm, it is conceivable that clinicians could be comfortable with lower levels of arterial oxygen content (eg, oxyhemoglobin values of < 88%: so called "permissive hypoxemia"), provided that there are ways to effectively monitor tissue hypoxia. We can learn more about hypoxic compensatory mechanisms from the fetus and from high altitude residents. We also need to learn better ways of monitoring tissue oxygenation, especially in "mission critical" tissues. Ultimately clinical trials will be needed to determine appropriate oxygenation targets to allow permissive hypoxemia.

### British thoracic society guideline for oxygen use in adults in healthcare and emergency settings [^116MWJjq]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Philosophy of the guideline

✓ Oxygen is a treatment for hypoxaemia, not breathlessness. Oxygen has not been proven to have any consistent effect on the sensation of breathlessness in non-hypoxaemic patients.
✓ The essence of this guideline can be summarised simply as a requirement for oxygen to be prescribed according to a target saturation range and for those who administer oxygen therapy to monitor the patient and keep within the target saturation range.
✓ The guideline recommends aiming to achieve normal or near-normal oxygen saturation for all acutely ill patients apart from those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure or those receiving terminal palliative care.

Assessing patients For critically ill patients, high concentration oxygen should be administered immediately (table 1 and figure 1) and this should be recorded afterwards in the patient's health record. Clinicians must bear in mind that supplemental oxygen is given to improve oxygenation, but it does not treat the underlying causes of hypoxaemia which must be diagnosed and treated as a matter of urgency. The oxygen saturation should be checked by pulse oximetry in all breathless and acutely ill patients, 'the fifth vital sign' (supplemented by blood gases when necessary), and the inspired oxygen concentration should be recorded on the observation chart with the oximetry result. (The other vital signs are pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature and respiratory rate). Pulse oximetry must be available in all locations where emergency oxygen is used. Clinical assessment is recommended if the saturation falls by ≥ 3% or below the target range for the patient. All critically ill patients outside of a critical care area (e.g. intensive care unit (ICU), high dependency unit (HDU), respiratory HDU), should be assessed and monitored using a recognised physiological track and trigger system such as the National Early Warning Score (NEWS).
Target Oxygen prescription Oxygen should be prescribed to achieve a target saturation of 94–98% for most acutely ill patients or 88–92% or patient-specific target range for those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (tables 1–4). Best practice is to prescribe a target range for all hospital patients at the time of admission so that appropriate oxygen therapy can be started in the event of unexpected clinical deterioration with hypoxaemia and also to ensure that the oximetry section of the early warning score (EWS) can be scored appropriately. The target saturation should be written (or ringed) on the drug chart or entered in an electronic prescribing system (guidance on figure 1).
Oxygen administration Oxygen should be administered by staff who are trained in oxygen administration. These staff should use appropriate devices and flow rates in order to achieve the target saturation range (figure 2). Staff should be trained in the use of a range of different oxygen delivery devices to ensure oxygen is delivered safely.
Monitoring and maintenance of target saturation Oxygen saturation and delivery system (including flow rate) should be recorded on the patient's monitoring chart. Oxygen delivery devices and flow rates should be adjusted to keep the oxygen saturation in the target range. Prompt clinical assessment is required if oxygen therapy needs to be initiated or increased due to a falling saturation level. Oxygen should be prescribed and a signature should be entered on the drug chart on each drug round.
Weaning and discontinuation of oxygen therapy Oxygen should be reduced in stable patients with satisfactory oxygen saturation. Oxygen should be discontinued once the patient can maintain saturation within or above the target range breathing air but the prescription for a target range should be left in place in case of future deterioration and to guide early warning scores (EWS/NEWS).

### Hypoxia and aging [^113ZYXrR]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Eukaryotic cells require sufficient oxygen (O 2) for biological activity and survival. When the oxygen demand exceeds its supply, the oxygen levels in local tissues or the whole body decrease (termed hypoxia), leading to a metabolic crisis, threatening physiological functions and viability. Therefore, eukaryotes have developed an efficient and rapid oxygen sensing system: hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). The hypoxic responses are controlled by HIFs, which induce the expression of several adaptive genes to increase the oxygen supply and support anaerobic ATP generation in eukaryotic cells. Hypoxia also contributes to a functional decline during the aging process. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms regulating HIF-1α and aging-associated signaling proteins, such as sirtuins, AMP-activated protein kinase, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1, UNC-51-like kinase 1, and nuclear factor κB, and their roles in aging and aging-related diseases. In addition, the effects of prenatal hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-induced intermittent hypoxia have been reviewed due to their involvement in the progression and severity of many diseases, including cancer and other aging-related diseases. The pathophysiological consequences and clinical manifestations of prenatal hypoxia and OSA-induced chronic intermittent hypoxia are discussed in detail.

### Dangers of hyperoxia [^112QdGzW]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

ARDS

Clinicians should titrate O₂ therapy to avoid both hypoxaemia and hyperoxaemia. While the harmful effects of tissue hypoxia are clearly understood, over-correction leads to tissue hyperoxia which may also be deleterious. Hyperoxia injures the lung via ROS production, causing oxidant stress with pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects. Pathophysiologic consequences include arterial vasoconstriction, alveolar-capillary "leak" and even fibrogenesis. Clinicians use higher FIO₂ than necessary to correct hypoxia in the critically ill, possibly to avoid (occult) tissue hypoxia, to provide a "buffer" should rapid clinical deterioration occur, or because the consequences of hyperoxia are considered less severe. The lack of clearly defined targets for PaO₂ and/or SaO₂ is also an issue. The ARDS Network trials targeted a PaO₂ of 55–80 mmHg, while the British Thoracic Society suggests a target SpO₂ of 94–98% in acutely ill patients.

### Oxygen toxicity [^111pYbFj]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Oxygen is one of the most widely available and used therapeutic agents in the world. However, it is all too easy forget that oxygen is a prescribable drug with specific biochemical and physiologic actions, a distinct range of effective doses and well-defined adverse effects at high doses. The human body is affected in different ways depending on the type of exposure. Short exposures to high partial pressures at greater than atmospheric pressure lead to central nervous system toxicity, most commonly seen in divers or in hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity results from longer exposure to elevated oxygen levels at normal atmospheric pressure.

### Long-term oxygen therapy for 24 or 15 hours per day in severe hypoxemia [^1166FHwu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study REDOX was published by Magnus Ekström and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyspnea in palliative care, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and Connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease. In the REDOX study, the trial question was: what is the role of long-term oxygen supplementation for at least 24 hours per day in patients with severe hypoxemia? In the REDOX study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the REDOX study, the population was: 241 patients (141 female, 100 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who were starting oxygen therapy for chronic severe hypoxemia at rest. The key exclusion criteria were active smoking; anticipated repeated contact with fire; inability to safely adhere to long-term oxygen therapy or other treatments used in the trial; inability to provide written informed consent. In the REDOX study, the interventions were: n = 117 long-term O2 therapy for 24 hr/day (supplemental oxygen prescribed for 24 hours per day) n = 124 long-term O2 therapy for 15 hr/day (supplemental oxygen while sleeping during the nighttime and not exceeding oxygen use for a total of 9 hours during the daytime). In the REDOX study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of hospitalization or death from any cause within 1 year (64.1% vs. 63.7%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.72 to 1.36). In the REDOX study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from any cause (31.6% vs. 27.4%; HR 1.26, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.01) No significant difference in hospitalization for any cause (57.3% vs. 57.3%; HR 1, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.4) No significant difference in mean Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy scale score for fatigue (22.51 vs. 22.2; MD 0.31, 95% CI -4.07 to 4.7). In the REDOX study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the REDOX study, the conclusion was: in patients who were starting oxygen therapy for chronic severe hypoxemia at rest, long-term O2 therapy for 24 hr/day was not superior to long-term O2 therapy for 15 hr/day with respect to the rate of hospitalization or death from any cause within 1 year.

### Has oxygen administration delayed appropriate respiratory care? Fallacies regarding oxygen therapy [^116bQC4x]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Modern clinical use of supplemental oxygen supposes that: (1) exposure to FIO₂ ≤ 60% is without adverse effects, (2) an individual at risk of developing arterial hypoxemia can be protected by administering high F(IO)(2), and (3) routine administration of supplemental oxygen is useful, harmless, and clinically indicated. There is now substantial evidence that none of those 3 suppositions are correct, and, on the contrary, supplemental oxygen is actually detrimental to many of the patients who receive it. Supplemental oxygen is much overused and its use should be limited to the few conditions and situations in which it is truly effective, useful, and non-detrimental.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115USDfY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

After a systematic literature review, the guideline panel created final recommendations on the basis of the available evidence. Table 4 summarizes these findings for questions related to patients with COPD and ILD as well as for questions related to the use of LOX. A best-practice statement was included to address education and safety needs for all home oxygen users.

Summary of ATS Recommendations

Question 1: Should long-term oxygen be prescribed for adults with COPD who have severe chronic resting room air hypoxemia?

Background

Hypoxemia is common in people with COPD, particularly those with more advanced disease, because of worseningmismatch and decreased diffusion capacity. In some patients, hypoxemia can be sufficiently severe to occur at rest and is associated with dyspnea, worsening neurocognitive function, PH, and mortality.

In 1917, Haldane described the therapeutic potential of providing supplemental oxygen. Since then, several studies have examined the role of oxygen therapy in patients with COPD. "LTOT" refers to supplemental oxygen for a period of years, and in most cases for the remainder of the patient's life (Table 3). LTOT can be delivered through a combination of stationary equipment (e.g. stationary oxygen concentrator and liquid reservoirs) and ambulatory oxygen equipment (e.g. compressed-oxygen cylinders, portable oxygen concentrators [POCs], and LOX canisters) (Figure 1). In this section, we discuss the role of LTOT for adults with COPD and severe resting hypoxemia. The critical outcome for this question was mortality, and important outcomes included dyspnea, healthcare resource use, exercise capacity, fatigue, health-related quality of life (HRQL), physical activity, and safety.

Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) AP classification — hypoxemia/hypoxia/cyanosis defines hypoxemia as oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry at rest ≤ 90% and severe hypoxemia as oxygen saturation at rest ≤ 85%; in patients with normal or high hemoglobin concentrations, severe hypoxemia will be associated with visible cyanosis, which requires ≥ 5 g/dl desaturated hemoglobin to be appreciated, and the terms cyanosis and hypoxemia (or hypoxia) are sometimes used interchangeably but severe hypoxemia can be present without visible cyanosis in anemia.

DISCUSSION

The main findings of this study are that under fully controlled conditions and matched PIO₂ corresponding to an equivalent altitude of ~4000 m, HH and NH elicit similar acute physiological responses at rest, but with increasing exercise intensity, differences in breathing pattern or mechanics occur, which can improve SpO₂ andin HH.

### Tumor hypoxia imaging [^112UKNxR]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2011). Low credibility.

There is a need to measure tumor hypoxia in assessing the aggressiveness of tumor and predicting the outcome of therapy. A number of invasive and noninvasive techniques have been exploited to measure tumor hypoxia, including polarographic needle electrodes, immunohistochemical staining, radionuclide imaging (positron emission tomography [PET] and single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical imaging (bioluminescence and fluorescence), and so on. This review article summarizes and discusses the pros and cons of each currently available method for measuring tissue oxygenation. Special emphasis was placed on noninvasive imaging hypoxia with emerging new agents and new imaging technologies to detect the molecular events that are relevant to tumor hypoxia.

### Oxygen in respiratory care: a personal perspective from 40 years in the field [^113tTgkr]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Oxygen is necessary for all aerobic life, and nothing is more important in respiratory care than its proper understanding, assessment, and administration. By the early 1970s PaO₂ had become the gold standard for clinically assessing oxygenation in the body. Since the 1980s the measurement of arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry has also been increasingly used as an adjunct to (but not a replacement for) P(aO(2)). Despite the desirability of measuring tissue oxygenation directly, no reliable and clinically relevant such measure has emerged. The 2 areas in which oxygen has proven most important in respiratory care are long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) and the management of potentially life-threatening hypoxemia in acute respiratory failure. That LTOT improves survival in appropriately selected patients with COPD was demonstrated by multicenter studies published more than 30 years ago, and their original selection criteria have so far not been improved upon. Severe hypoxemia in acute lung injury and ARDS can be improved by ventilation with PEEP, and also in many patients by various adjunctive techniques and alternative support strategies. However, the latter measures have not brought clear improvements in survival or other patient-relevant outcomes. In addition, the original goals of "normalizing" arterial oxygenation with high tidal volumes and lung-distending pressures have required modification as appreciation for ventilator-related lung injury has emerged. High concentrations of inspired oxygen may play a role in such injury, but aggressive measures to reduce them in order to avoid oxygen toxicity-which dominated ventilator management in previous decades-have been tempered in the present era of lung-protective ventilation. Although some additions and modifications have emerged, much of what we understand today about oxygen in respiratory care is owed to the pioneering work of Thomas L Petty more than 40 years ago.

### Pulse oximetry [^1127HXFn]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pulse oximetry is ubiquitously used for monitoring oxygenation in the critical care setting. By forewarning the clinicians about the presence of hypoxemia, pulse oximeters may lead to a quicker treatment of serious hypoxemia and possibly circumvent serious complications. In this review, I update the principles of pulse oximetry from my article in 1999 and discuss recent technological advances that have been developed to enhance the accuracy and clinical applications of this monitoring technique. Finally, available studies evaluating the impact of pulse oximetry on patient outcome will also be reviewed.

Objective

The findings of hypoxia in the term neonate are unique; neonatal brain imaging findings differ from those of older children. Evaluation of neonatal brain images for signs of hypoxic injury requires attention to a specific set of signs.

Conclusion

Imaging findings in term neonates must be assessed according to different rules from those used in other age groups. Four major signs are proposed as a means of facilitating the diagnosis of hypoxia in the neonate.

Breathlessness in advanced disease is a common problem, with the majority of people experiencing breathlessness in the weeks before death. The thrust of the new British Thoracic Society guidelines for home oxygen in adults is that oxygen therapy for home use is most useful in chronic hypoxaemia. However, clinicians make individual clinical decisions, cognisant of the guidelines but ultimately determined by what relieves the symptoms of the individual most effectively.

### Oxygen therapy for patients with COPD: current evidence and the long-term oxygen treatment trial [^113TGQ9k]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Long-term use of supplemental oxygen improves survival in patients with COPD and severe resting hypoxemia. However, the role of oxygen in symptomatic patients with COPD and more moderate hypoxemia at rest and desaturation with activity is unclear. The few long-term reports of supplemental oxygen in this group have been of small size and insufficient to demonstrate a survival benefit. Short-term trials have suggested beneficial effects other than survival in patients with COPD and moderate hypoxemia at rest. In addition, supplemental oxygen appeared to improve exercise performance in small short-term investigations of patients with COPD and moderate hypoxemia at rest and desaturation with exercise, but long-term trials evaluating patient-reported outcomes are lacking. This article reviews the evidence for long-term use of supplemental oxygen therapy and provides a rationale for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial. The trial plans to enroll subjects with COPD with moderate hypoxemia at rest or desaturation with exercise and compare tailored oxygen therapy to no oxygen therapy.

hypoxia-inducible factorListen to pronunciationOne of a group of proteins that play an important role in how cells respond to changing levels of oxygen. When oxygen levels in cells are low, hypoxia-inducible factors activate certain genes involved in cell growth and survival. This allows the cells to function and survive even in low oxygen conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factors may be made in larger than normal amounts by some types of cancer cells. This may cause cancer cells to grow and spread to other parts of the body. Also called HIF.

### Sleep-disordered breathing, hypoxia, and risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older women… [^112E4CCk]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

We also investigated the relationship of hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, and a measure of sleep duration on risk for mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Two measures of hypoxia were associated with higher incidence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Among older women, sleep-disordered breathing was associated with an increased risk of developing cognitive impairment 5 years later. In addition, even after adjusting for demographic risk factors and comorbidities, we found that 2 of 3 indices of hypoxia but not sleep fragmentation or sleep duration were associated with incident mild cognitive impairment or dementia, suggesting that hypoxia is a likely mechanism through which sleep-disordered breathing increases risk for cognitive impairment.

In our study, none of the sleep fragmentation or duration measures had a significant association with cognitive impairment after accounting for potential confounders, while the hypoxia measures were consistently associated with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. This suggests that hypoxia is a likely mechanism for this relationship, which is supported by recent animal models of chronic hypoxia that demonstrated similar impairments in cognition with possible implications for apolipoprotein E, inflammatory, and regulatory pathways. 34 However, it is important to note that because cerebral blood flow may be affected in elderly patients, 35 other mechanisms such as hypercapnia could also be involved. Both the oxygen desaturation index and percentage time in apnea or hypopnea were associated with incident cognitive impairment.

The oxygen desaturation index is a measurement of intermittent hypoxemia while the time in apnea or hypopnea estimates the proportion of the sleep period during which the respiration consists of apneas and hypopneas. We found that among women with a mean age of 82 years, sleep-disordered breathing was associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Our results indicate that this relationship seems to be related primarily to measures of hypoxia. Given the high prevalence of both sleep-disordered breathing and cognitive impairment among older adults, the possibility of an association between the 2 conditions, even a modest one, has the potential for a large public health impact.

### Hypotension, hypoxia, and head injury… [^112NTLdJ]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

When the number of hypotensive episodes increased from 1 to 2 or more, the odds ratio for death increased from 2. 1 to 8.

1. Forty-one patients had hypoxia, with an average of 2. 1 episodes per patient. Of these 41 patients with hypoxia, 18 died. Retrospective studies1, 2 from large databases have suggested that early hypotension following brain injury doubles the mortality. The influence of hypoxia alone on mortality is less dramatic, but has not been intensively studied in a prospective fashion. In addition, little is known about the outcome of patients who have sustained early secondary brain injuries but survived. The neurological outcome of patients with hypoxia alone was not significantly different from that of patients with neither hypotension nor hypoxia. In this study, the combination of hypotension and hypoxia did not appear to be additive.

A prospective observation of patients with moderate to severe brain injury revealed a significant relationship between the frequency and duration of hypotensive episodes and poor outcome. Although the association between systemic hypotension and worsened outcome from severe brain injury has been reported in retrospective studies, 1, 3 we have extended these observations to define the frequency and duration of this potentially preventable secondary brain injury. Injury to the central nervous system is responsible for more deaths and more permanent disabilities, and is more costly than any other type of trauma. Traumatic brain injury may be significantly worsened by secondary events surrounding the injury. Of the 161 patients with hypoxia alone, 50% had a good to moderate recovery and 28% died. Among those with hypotension, only 33% had a good to moderate recovery and 50% died. The presence of both insults increased the mortality to 57%.

Overall, hypotensive events, with or without hypoxia, doubled the mortality and significantly increased the morbidity of severe head injury. While hypoxia alone did not significantly increase mortality, children who were both hypotensive and hypoxic on arrival had a mortality of 85%. These researchers suggested that the presence of hypotension following head injury negates the survival advantage normally seen in children compared with adults with similar GCSs. These reports underscore the concept that adequate resuscitation is the single most critical factor for survival following traumatic brain injury in children and in adults.
