## Question

Clear thin Vaginal discharge

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage clear, thin vaginal discharge. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this discharge is physiologic or pathologic. Then, I should verify the key distinguishing features on history and exam. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and the diagnostic approach, including pH, whiff test, microscopy, and when to use NAATs. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause. Finally, I will outline management principles and follow-up, making sure I double-check where guidelines differ and reconcile those differences with the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: clear, thin vaginal discharge can be normal physiologic leukorrhea, especially in reproductive-age women with estrogen dominance, but I should not jump to conclusions because it can also signal early bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, cervicitis, or even a fistula depending on context, so I need to check for accompanying features like odor, pruritus, irritation, timing, and sexual exposures before labeling it benign [^d5606dc3] [^f77384bd].

> Wait, let me verify the normal variant characteristics. Physiologic discharge is typically clear or white, creamy or watery, homogeneous, and adheres to the vaginal walls; microscopy shows mature squamous cells, rare PMNs, and lactobacillus-predominant flora with pH less than 4.5, and importantly, it lacks odor, pruritus, or irritation, which helps distinguish it from pathologic causes [^d5606dc3] [^23eb3878].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about infection just because the discharge is thin. Bacterial vaginosis often presents with thin, homogeneous, gray-white discharge and a fishy odor, and many patients are asymptomatic, so absence of odor or irritation makes BV less likely but does not exclude it, especially if pH is elevated or clue cells are present on microscopy [^60351d53] [^e81a2968].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach next. The initial evaluation should include a focused history, speculum exam of the vulva and vagina, and office-based testing with vaginal pH, KOH whiff test, and saline and KOH microscopy; if these are not available, FDA-cleared molecular panels can be used, recognizing that microscopy has limited sensitivity compared with NAATs for trichomonas and culture for yeast, so a negative wet mount does not rule out infection [^b4bd0478] [^c8bd9178] [^341900c5].

> Let me think about the key discriminators. Odor, pruritus, and erythema shift the probability toward BV, VVC, or trichomoniasis respectively, whereas clear, odorless, nonpruritic discharge without inflammatory signs favors physiologic leukorrhea; pH greater than 4.5 supports BV or trichomoniasis, while pH less than 4.5 supports candidiasis or normal discharge, though pH alone is nonspecific and must be interpreted with microscopy and symptoms [^5ba24c45] [^c8bd9178].

> I will now examine the differential more systematically. Physiologic discharge is common and benign. Bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of abnormal discharge in reproductive-age women and can be asymptomatic. Trichomoniasis may be frothy and malodorous but can also be subtle. Cervicitis from chlamydia or gonorrhea can produce mucopurulent discharge and warrants STI testing when risk factors are present. Noninfectious causes include atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and irritant or allergic vaginitis, which may present with discharge and discomfort without classic infectious features [^e81a2968] [^0e3e5cf0] [^253f0ea7].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or postpartum. In pregnancy, physiologic discharge increases, yet I should maintain a low threshold to evaluate for rupture of membranes if there is sudden clear leakage, using sterile speculum and appropriate testing; in the postpartum period, lactational hypoestrogenism and lochia can alter discharge, and BV may be more prevalent, so I should tailor testing and counseling accordingly [^4fad5802] [^1e7b575d].

> Let me reconsider the role of molecular testing. NAATs for trichomonas and panels for BV, VVC, and TV improve sensitivity over wet mount and can be performed on self-collected swabs, which is useful when microscopy is unavailable or when symptoms persist despite negative office tests; however, I should confirm that positive results are interpreted in clinical context to avoid overtreatment of colonization [^341900c5] [^e73c2f39].

> Next, I should review management principles. If the discharge is physiologic, reassurance and hygiene counseling suffice. If BV is diagnosed by Amsel criteria or Nugent score, treat with metronidazole or clindamycin per guidelines, and consider partner management in recurrent cases. If trichomoniasis is confirmed, treat with metronidazole or tinidazole and ensure partner treatment. If candidiasis is diagnosed, use topical azoles or oral fluconazole as appropriate. If no infectious etiology is found, evaluate for noninfectious causes and avoid empiric antibiotics, as inappropriate treatment increases return visits without benefit [^e81a2968] [^9d8cf791] [^bed66702].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential inconsistency. Earlier I recalled Amsel sensitivity around 92% and specificity around 77% compared with Gram stain, but wait, the CDC cites sensitivity 37–70% and specificity 94–99% versus Nugent, which is the stricter reference standard; reconciling this, Amsel performs variably depending on the comparator and operator expertise, so I should emphasize that microscopy skills and, when available, molecular tests can improve diagnostic accuracy in real-world practice [^6303a8de] [^cd20b593] [^341900c5].

> I need to ensure follow-up and prevention are addressed. Recurrent or persistent symptoms warrant repeat evaluation and consideration of alternative diagnoses such as DIV, atrophic vaginitis, or resistant organisms; counseling on avoiding irritants, douching, and unnecessary antibiotics can reduce recurrence, and in selected cases, suppressive or probiotic strategies may be considered, though evidence varies and should be individualized [^e22e52e7] [^e81a2968].

> In summary, clear, thin vaginal discharge is often physiologic when odorless, nonpruritic, and associated with normal pH and lactobacilli on microscopy, but I should double-check for subtle signs of BV, trichomoniasis, cervicitis, or noninfectious causes using pH, whiff test, and microscopy, escalating to NAATs when needed, and I should avoid empiric treatment unless the clinical picture is compelling, aligning management with guideline-based therapy and follow-up to prevent misdiagnosis and recurrence [^d5606dc3] [^b4bd0478] [^9d8cf791].

Clear, thin vaginal discharge is most often **physiologic** (normal) due to estrogen-driven cervical mucus changes across the menstrual cycle, especially around ovulation and mid-cycle [^d5606dc3]. It is typically clear, stretchy, and odorless, with a pH ≤ 4.5 and lactobacilli on microscopy [^d5606dc3]. Persistent clear, watery discharge with odor, irritation, or pH > 4.5 suggests **bacterial vaginosis** or **trichomoniasis**, and should be evaluated with pH, whiff test, and microscopy; NAATs improve sensitivity when available [^c8bd9178] [^341900c5]. Management is cause-specific: treat BV or trichomoniasis if confirmed, and reserve antibiotics for documented infections to avoid overtreatment [^e81a2968] [^9d8cf791].

---

## Physiological causes

Physiological discharge is normal and reflects healthy vaginal physiology; **estrogen** drives cervical mucus production, producing clear, stretchy discharge that peaks at ovulation and diminishes in the luteal phase [^d5606dc3]. Characteristics include:

- **Appearance**: Clear, stretchy, watery, or milky; homogeneous and adherent to vaginal walls [^d5606dc3].
- **Odor**: Typically absent or mild, non-offensive.
- **pH**: ≤ 4.5 due to lactic acid from lactobacilli [^23eb3878].
- **Microscopy**: Predominantly lactobacilli; rare PMNs; mature squamous cells [^d5606dc3].

---

## Pathological causes

Persistent clear, watery discharge with abnormal features suggests pathology; **bacterial vaginosis (BV)** is common and presents with thin, homogeneous, gray-white discharge, fishy odor, pH > 4.5, clue cells, and reduced lactobacilli [^60351d53]. Trichomoniasis can cause clear or frothy discharge with irritation, pH > 4.5, and motile trichomonads on microscopy [^c8bd9178]. Cervicitis from chlamydia or gonorrhea may produce mucopurulent discharge with cervical friability and abundant WBCs on wet prep [^9f500678]. Noninfectious causes include atrophic vaginitis (thin, clear discharge with dryness and irritation) and desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (purulent discharge with vaginal erythema and parabasal cells) [^253f0ea7].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach prevents misdiagnosis; **history** should cover onset, duration, odor, pruritus, irritation, dyspareunia, sexual exposures, douching, and medications [^b4bd0478]. The **physical examination** should inspect the vulva, vagina, and cervix for discharge characteristics, erythema, edema, and lesions [^cf8368ae]. Office-based tests include pH measurement, KOH whiff test, and saline/KOH microscopy for clue cells, motile trichomonads, and yeast [^c8bd9178]. NAATs improve sensitivity for BV, trichomoniasis, and candidiasis when available [^341900c5].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **etiology**:

| **Condition** | **Treatment** |
|-|-|
| Bacterial vaginosis | Metronidazole or clindamycin (oral or intravaginal) [^e81a2968] |
| Trichomoniasis | Metronidazole or tinidazole; treat partners [^2ea3e024] |
| Cervicitis (chlamydia/gonorrhea) | Ceftriaxone plus doxycycline or azithromycin per guidelines [^notfound] |
| Atrophic vaginitis | Topical estrogen or nonhormonal moisturizers [^2ea3e024] |
| Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis | Topical clindamycin ± corticosteroids [^253f0ea7] |

---

## Patient education and counseling

Education should clarify normal versus abnormal discharge and discourage **douching**, which disrupts flora and increases infection risk [^notfound]. Emphasize **safe sex** and partner treatment for STIs to prevent reinfection [^2ea3e024]. Reinforce adherence to prescribed therapy and arrange follow-up for persistent or recurrent symptoms [^e22e52e7].

---

Clear, thin vaginal discharge is usually **physiologic** and cycle-related, but persistent or abnormal features warrant evaluation for BV, trichomoniasis, cervicitis, or noninfectious causes. Use pH, whiff test, and microscopy to guide diagnosis, and treat confirmed infections while avoiding empiric antibiotics.

### Vaginitis: diagnosis and treatment [^f77384bd]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is a general term for inflammation of the vagina with symptoms such as vulvovaginal itching, burning, irritation, dyspareunia, odor, or abnormal vaginal discharge. It is a common condition that results in 5 million to 10 million office visits annually. The leading infectious causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Noninfectious causes include atrophic, irritant, and inflammatory vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis usually presents with a thin, homogenous vaginal discharge and a fishy odor. Vulvovaginal candidiasis often manifests with a white, thick, curd-like discharge, pruritus, and vulvar erythema. Trichomoniasis usually presents with a green or yellow frothy discharge, and speculum examination may reveal cervical erythema with petechiae. Noninfectious vaginitis can present with clear or purulent discharge and can be pruritic depending on the etiology. Bacterial vaginosis can be diagnosed using Amsel criteria, Gram stain, or a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be diagnosed by visualization of yeast hyphae or budding yeast on microscopy, vaginal fungal culture, polymerase chain reaction testing, or NAAT. Trichomoniasis can be diagnosed with visualization of motile, flagellated protozoa on saline microscopy, NAAT, or DNA probe test. Bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral or intravaginal metronidazole or intravaginal clindamycin. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is managed with topical or oral antifungals. Trichomoniasis is treated with oral metronidazole or tinidazole. When treating trichomoniasis, testing for reinfection, as well as other sexually transmitted infections, is recommended. Treatments for noninfectious vaginitis include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, topical hormones, and topical steroids, depending on the cause.

More than half of the women with diagnosable BV have no clear symptoms. Patients' perception of their vaginal symptoms varies significantly and does not necessarily correlate with signs of BV. Some women do not report symptoms; nevertheless, discharge is noted on examination by a clinician, and diagnostic criteria are present, highlighting that many women with BV may consider their discharge to be normal. These women may be asymptomatic despite the presence of BV. This may contribute to the debate regarding the definition of "normal" VMB, as was discussed in part I.

### Nonspecific vaginitis. diagnostic criteria and microbial and epidemiologic associations [^fd6d8b59]. The American Journal of Medicine (1983). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Amsel's diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis" for bacterial vaginosis.

Calculator Name: Amsel's Diagnostic Criteria for Bacterial Vaginosis

Amsel's Diagnostic Criteria for Bacterial Vaginosis is a clinical tool used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. This calculator applies to women presenting with symptoms of vaginal discharge, discomfort, or odor.

The clinical utility of Amsel's criteria is to aid in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, which can help guide appropriate treatment and prevent potential complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections.

The criteria include the presence of at least three of the following: thin, white, yellow, homogeneous discharge; clue cells on microscopy; pH of vaginal fluid > 4.5; and a fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition of 10% KOH (whiff test).

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of Amsel's criteria. However, it should be noted that this diagnostic tool may not be as accurate in postmenopausal women, as the vaginal environment naturally changes with age and may affect the results. Additionally, it should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with other clinical findings and tests.

The Amsel's diagnostic criteria calculator helps determine the likelihood of bacterial vaginosis based on four specific clinical features. Each feature is assessed to ascertain its presence:

- Homogeneous vaginal discharge
- Fishy odor when potassium hydroxide solution is added to vaginal secretions
- Presence of clue cells on wet mount microscopy
- Vaginal pH greater than 4.5

To compute the likelihood of bacterial vaginosis, each of these features is evaluated as true or false. If a feature is present, it is assigned a score of 1; if not, a score of 0. The scores for all four criteria are then summed to obtain a total score, ranging from 0 to 4.

The interpretation of the total score is as follows:

- If the score is 3 or 4, bacterial vaginosis is likely.
- If the score is 0, 1, or 2, bacterial vaginosis is unlikely.

This approach provides a straightforward method of assessment, facilitating quick clinical decision-making based on the presence of key symptoms and observations.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^9d8cf791]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Homogeneous, thin discharge (milklike consistency) that smoothly coats the vaginal walls
Clue cells (e.g. vaginal epithelial cells studded with adherent bacteria) on microscopic examination
pH of vaginal fluid > 4.5
A fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition of 10% KOH (i.e. the whiff test)

Detection of at least three Amsel criteria has been correlated with results by Gram stain. The sensitivity and specificity of the Amsel criteria are 37%–70% and 94%–99%, respectively, compared with the Nugent score.

In addition to the Amsel criteria, multiple POC tests are available for BV diagnosis. The Osom BV Blue test (Sekisui Diagnostics) detects vaginal sialidase activity. The Affirm VP III (Becton Dickinson) is an oligonucleotide probe test that detects high concentrations of G. vaginalis nucleic acids (> 5 × 10⁵ CFU of G. vaginalis/ mL of vaginal fluid) for diagnosing BV, Candida species, and T. vaginalis. This test has been reported to be most useful for symptomatic women in conjunction with vaginal pH measurement and presence of amine odor (sensitivity of 97%); specificity is 81% compared with Nugent. Finally, the FemExam Test Card (Cooper Surgical) measures vaginal pH, presence of trimethylamine (a metabolic by-product of G. vaginalis), and proline aminopeptidase. Sensitivity is 91% and specificity is 61%, compared with Nugent. This test has primarily been studied in resource-poor settings, and although it has been reported to be beneficial compared with syndromic management, it is not a preferred diagnostic method for BV diagnosis.

### Noncandidal vaginitis: a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management [^98d8b6d5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is one of the most common causes of patient visits to gynecologists, primary care providers, and urgent care centers. However, many women leave without a clear diagnosis or experience recurrent symptoms despite treatment. The 3 most common etiologies of vaginitis are trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, which account for an estimated 70% of cases. The remaining 30% may be related to other causes of vaginitis, including atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and vaginal erosive disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the noncandidal causes of acute and recurrent vaginitis, with the goal of improving the likelihood of accurate diagnosis as well as efficient and effective therapy. We excluded candidal vaginitis from our review because there was a recently published review on this topic in the Journal. The clinical presentation and evaluation of patients with symptoms of vaginitis can be triaged into 1 of 2 diagnostic pathways: noninflammatory and inflammatory vaginitis. The most common noninflammatory cause is bacterial vaginosis. Features such as irritation, purulent discharge, and the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils are more suggestive of an inflammatory process. Trichomoniasis is the most common cause of inflammatory vaginitis. Other well-described forms of inflammatory vaginitis include atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and erosive disease. We present a review of the pathogenesis, symptoms, examination findings, diagnostic testing, and treatment for each of these causes of noncandidal vaginitis.

### Evaluation of vaginal complaints [^5ba24c45]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Vaginal symptoms are one of the most common reasons for gynecological consultation. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis using some combination of physical examination, pH, the wet mount, and the whiff test.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of the clinical examination and determine the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) for the diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis.

Data Sources

Using a structured literature review, we abstracted information on sensitivity and specificity for symptoms, signs, and office laboratory procedures. We chose published (1966 to April 2003) articles that appeared in the MEDLINE database and were indexed under the combined search terms of diagnosis with vaginitis, vaginal discharge, candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis.

Study Selection

Included studies of symptomatic premenopausal women seen in primary care settings. Tests were evaluated only if they would provide diagnostic information during the office visit and were compared with an acceptable criterion standard.

Data Extraction

All 3 authors extracted the data and computed sensitivity and specificity from each article independently. The absence of standard definitions for symptoms and signs made it impossible to combine results across studies.

Data Synthesis

Symptoms alone do not allow clinicians to distinguish confidently between the causes of vaginitis. However, a patient's lack of itching makes candidiasis less likely (range of LRs, 0.18 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05–0.70] to 0.79 [95% CI, 0.72–0.87]) and lack of perceived odor makes bacterial vaginosis unlikely (LR, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01–0.51]). Similarly, physical examination signs are limited in their diagnostic power. The presence of inflammatory signs is associated with candidiasis (range of LRs, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.5–2.8] to 8.4 [95% CI, 2.3–31]). Presence of a "high cheese" odor on examination is predictive of bacterial vaginosis (LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 2.1–4.7]) while lack of odor is associated with candidiasis (LR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.4–5.0]). Office laboratory tests, particularly microscopy of vaginal discharge, are the most useful way of diagnosing these 3 conditions.

Conclusions

The cause of vaginal complaints may be easily diagnosed when typical findings appear in microscopy. However, the poor performance of individual symptoms, signs, and office laboratory tests often makes it problematic to identify the cause of vaginal symptoms.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^e73c2f39]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The results of the present study suggest that the current approach to management of vaginal discharge provides suboptimal care. Significant time burdens placed on primary care providers and the time and effort necessary to perform inexpensive point-of-care tests are likely balanced against other competing priorities. Different models of care may be warranted for women having vaginal discharge syndromes. This requires a combination of sensitive and specific laboratory testing as well as careful patient evaluation and clinical acumen to accurately diagnose women presenting with symptoms of vaginitis. One approach could be to ask women who contact a clinician's office with vaginal symptoms to provide self-collected vaginal swab samples, which have been proven to be equivalent to clinician-collected samples, for testing. Prescriptions could be written to cover the specific pathogens identified and women having no infectious etiology identified could be counseled that no antifungal or antibiotic therapy is warranted. The excess healthcare costs associated with empiric treatment deserves further study.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^c8bd9178]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the etiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can identify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is discussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to each condition. In the clinician's office, the cause of vaginal symptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) test, and microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated pH (i.e. > 4.5) is common with BV or trichomoniasis (although trichomoniasis can also be present with a normal vaginal pH). Because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be further examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.9% normal saline solution on one slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution (samples that emit an amine odor immediately upon application of KOH suggest BV or trichomoniasis). Coverslips are then placed on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope at low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might display motile trichomonads or clue cells (i.e. epithelial cells with borders obscured by small anaerobic bacteria), which are characteristic of BV. The KOH specimen typically is used to identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. However, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements in KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT (trichomoniasis) or culture (yeast). Presence of WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also indicate cervicitis (see Cervicitis).

In settings where pH paper, KOH, and microscopy are unavailable, a broad range of clinical laboratory tests, described in the diagnosis section for each disease, can be used. Presence of objective signs of vulvovaginal inflammation in the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing indicates the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or other noninfectious causes of vulvovaginal signs or symptoms. For women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, referral to a specialist should be considered.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^6303a8de]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis diagnosis — The use of Amsel clinical criteria or Gram stain with Nugent scoring is recommended for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and bacterial culture is not recommended for the diagnosis. Bacterial vaginosis can be diagnosed based on the presence of three of the following four Amsel criteria: homogeneous, thin, white-gray discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls; more than 20% clue cells on saline microscopy; a pH of vaginal fluid greater than 4.5; and a positive KOH whiff test in which an amine or fishy odor is detected before or after mixing discharge with 10% KOH. Amsel clinical criteria have a reported sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 77% compared with Gram stain with Nugent scoring, and if microscopy is not available Amsel criteria can still be fulfilled by using the patient report of vaginal discharge, elevated pH, and positive whiff test result. Although Gram stain with Nugent scoring is the reference standard and is generally limited to research settings, Nugent score interpretation is defined as 0–3 normal flora, 4–6 intermediate flora, and 7–10 bacterial vaginosis flora. Bacterial vaginosis presents with a watery gray homogeneous discharge that often is accompanied by an amine ("fishy") odor.

### Exploring the vaginal ecosystem: insights into host-microbe interactions and microbial community dynamics [^190963b9]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

States of vaginal dysbiosis: BV, AV, VVC, and CV

BV is the most common type of vaginitis experienced among reproductive age women, with a worldwide prevalence of 23%–29% of women affected. BV is associated with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria from genera such as Gardnerella, Prevotella, Sneathia, Mobiluncus, Fannyhessea, and Finegoldia to name a few. Individuals who present with BV-associated microbes are at an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and cervical dysplasia, and while screening for BV is not recommended during pregnancy, a meta-analysis study indicated that BV-positive individuals have twice the risk of preterm labor and nine times higher risk of spontaneous abortion. BV is diagnosed by Amsel's criteria or Nugent score. Amsel's criteria assess clinical signs and symptoms including the presence of thin homogeneous discharge, vaginal fluid pH > 4.5, discharge with a fishy odor (i.e. the whiff test), and presence of "clue cells" by examination of vaginal epithelial cells with adherent bacteria. Nugent scores are based on Gram stain interpretation of microbial morphology from a vaginal smear. In addition to these standard methods, multiple point-of-care and molecular-based tests are commercially available; however, they are still recommended for use in association with a standard method of diagnosis. Although these methods can be useful at identifying patients with active BV, there are disparities between the diagnosis and the symptoms experienced. A recent metagenomic study found that of patients who were BV-positive based on Amsel's criteria, only 12.3% had confirmed BV and were actively symptomatic.

Vaginal symptoms — office-based evaluation and microscopy — can often be assessed by pH, potassium hydroxide (KOH) testing, and microscopic examination of a wet mount; an elevated pH (i.e., > 4.5) is common with bacterial vaginosis (BV) or trichomoniasis, but because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.9% normal saline solution and a second sample in 10% KOH solution. On saline preparation, motile trichomonads or clue cells may be seen, and the KOH specimen is used to identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis; however, absence of these organisms does not rule out infection because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT or culture. Presence of WBCs without trichomonads or yeast might indicate cervicitis, and for women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, referral to a specialist should be considered.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^9e9ba0f2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms note that acute-onset symptoms attributable to the urinary tract typically include dysuria in conjunction with variable degrees of increased urinary urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence. Dysuria (urethral burning during voiding) is central in the diagnosis of UTI, and acute-onset dysuria is a specific symptom, with more than 90% accuracy for UTI in young women in the absence of concomitant vaginal irritation or increased vaginal discharge. Dysuria can have other causes (e.g., atrophic vaginitis, pelvic floor myofascial pain, vulvar lichen sclerosus), and the specificity of this symptom outside of this narrow population has not been defined. In older adults, the symptoms of UTI may be less clear, and careful evaluation of their chronicity becomes an important consideration when the diagnosis of UTI is in doubt.

Diagnostic Considerations

A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH (< 4.5). Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. The majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA cleared, and providers who use these tests should be familiar with the performance characteristics of the specific test used. Yeast culture, which can identify a broad group of pathogenic yeasts, remains the reference standard for diagnosis.

### Diagnostic performance of a molecular test versus clinician assessment of vaginitis [^322ff186]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The investigational molecular test used in this study is the first Food and Drug Administration-cleared nucleic acid amplification test for detection of the three major causes of vaginitis: bacterial vaginosis, spp. and. For these three causes, the investigational test consistently outperformed in-clinic testing and clinician diagnosis for sensitivity, with no depreciation in specificity (Tables 1 to 3 and Fig. 2 and 3). Importantly, the investigational test had the highest OPA with the reference test and better NPV for all causes compared to in-clinic testing and clinician diagnosis. Finally, the investigational test resulted in high diagnostic accuracy and likelihood ratios across all three vaginitis causes.

Traditionally, a diagnosis of vaginitis has been performed through clinical findings, medical history, and in-clinic testing, with the last representing an essential component for the establishment of a clinician diagnosis. For bacterial vaginosis, some combination of the Amsel's criteria is the mainstay for standard of care diagnosis in the clinic. CDC guidelines suggest that three out of four Amsel's criteria should be positive (Amsel's original). However, Amsel's criteria are known to be highly subjective and open to interpretation. In the current study, of all Amsel's components, pH had the highest sensitivity, while the whiff test had the highest specificity (Table 1). Other studies have reported that the presence of clue cells is the key pathognomonic feature of bacterial vaginosis, but this requires high technical expertise and appropriate laboratory infrastructure. Also, previous data showed better agreement between the Nugent score and Amsel's criteria when the latter did not include vaginal discharge as a criterion. Our findings confirm this, as we showed that removing discharge as a criterion and looking for two out of three positive Amsel's criteria (modified Amsel 2/3 without discharge) improved test sensitivity, NPV, and OPA compared to Amsel's original testing. In this study, clinician diagnosis reported an OPA that matched better with the Amsel's original test than the modified Amsel 2/3 without discharge (Table 1). This suggests that clinician diagnosis in our study likely involved Amsel's original test. When considering applicability, it should be noted that Amsel's criteria were applied during this study within a highly controlled research environment involving consistent prestudy and ongoing training and quality monitoring; this may not accurately reflect the empirical nature of Amsel's criteria performance as typically used in clinical practice.

### Lactate: creatinine ratio in babies with thin meconium staining of amniotic fluid [^8877fb20]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Methods

The study was conducted at St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi India. It is a 600 bedded tertiary level postgraduate teaching hospital, conducting 5000 deliveries annually, equipped with a 75 bedded nursery and level III neonatal intensive care unit.

Of 1415 deliveries between January to March 2000 at our hospital, 212 babies were born through MSAF. Some of these mothers were referred from other centers in labor and antenatal records were not available. These mothers were excluded. The number of eligible mothers was thus 112. From among these, post term mothers and mothers with a history suggestive of infection were excluded. 86 consecutive newborns of 36–42 weeks of gestation with meconium staining of amniotic fluid, without evidence of maternal infection (indicated by fever, premature rupture of membranes, or foul smelling vaginal discharge), were thus subjects of the study. None of the babies had any renal abnormality, or other congenital anomalies detected at antenatal ultrasonographic examination. 28 babies did not pass urine within six hours. Urine from 6 babies could not be analyzed as volume available, after centrifugation (to remove the heavy precipitates in neonatal urine), storage, and transportation to the laboratory was found inadequate. Finally more than 1 mL of clear supernatant urine passed within six hours of birth was available for testing from 52 babies and this group of samples was analyzed. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of how the cases were recruited.

### Vulvovaginal-STI treatment guidelines… [^5049cd7f]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Error processing SSI file Diseases Characterized by Vulvovaginal Itching, Burning, Irritation, Odor or Discharge The majority of women will have a vaginal infection, characterized by discharge, itching, burning, or odor, during their lifetime. With the availability of complementary and alternative therapies and over-the-counter medications for candidiasis, symptomatic women often seek these products before or in addition to an evaluation by a medical provider. Obtaining a medical history alone has been reported to be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can lead to inappropriate administration of medication test, and microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated pH is common with BV or trichomoniasis. Because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be further examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0. 9% normal saline solution on one slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution. Coverslips are then placed on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope at low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might display motile trichomonads or clue cells, which are characteristic of BV. The KOH specimen typically is used to identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. However, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements in KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT or culture. Presence of WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also indicate cervicitis.

### Multidetector CT of expected findings and complications after hysterectomy [^3516cd33]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Alternatively, hysterectomy may result in formation of a vesico-vaginal fistula (VVF), which accounts for over two thirds of iatrogenic pelvic fistulas. The risk is highest (0.74%) during radical AH secondary to extensive parametrial and nodal dissection. The typical manifestations include continuous urinary leakage, foul odours or discharge from the vagina. Clinical diagnosis of VVF is often challenging, and requires a combination of vaginal examination, cystoscopy, bladder filling with dye and biochemical assay of discharge fluid for high creatinine levels.

At imaging, a VVF is suggested by identification of air and/or fluid in the vaginal lumen. Excretory-phase CT or CT cystography are useful for treatment planning as they can confirm and directly visualise the opacified abnormal track (Fig. 17). Albeit some VVF seal during with prolonged catheterisation, most cases ultimately require surgical repair.

Different Bacteria, Different BV Symptoms, and Different Pathogenic Potential

Associations between certain bacteria and BV symptoms were reported. These findings may account for discrepancies often observed between Amsel and Nugent diagnostic criteria among women with BV, as well as between symptomatic and asymptomatic women. In a study investigating associations of Amsel criteria with bacterial taxa, it was described that Eggerthella species and Leptotrichia amnionii were the only BV-associated bacteria that were positively associated with all 4 Amsel criteria. Lactobacillus crispatus was the only Lactobacillus species associated with low pH, negative whiff test, absence of clue cells, and normal vaginal discharge. In contrast, women with high L. iners levels can have either low or high pH. The fishy amine odor is attributed to polyamines such as putrescine, cadaverine, and trimethylamine. Several bacteria including Prevotella species, BVAB1, and Dialister micraerophilus were associated with a positive whiff test. Gardnerella vaginalis and A. vaginae were each associated with 3 criteria: G. vaginalis was not associated with abnormal vaginal discharge, whereas A. vaginae was not associated with amine odor. Lactobacillus iners was not associated with any of Amsel clinical criteria for BV.

The difference in bacteria composition in BV not only may be meaningful regarding symptoms but also may bear pathogenetic importance. Studies have reported elevated inflammatory mediators` levels in vaginal washes from women with BV; however, the metabolite profile is different concerning the various bacteria. Gardnerella vaginalis does not induce production of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas A. vaginae induces a broad range of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides.

Several BV-associated bacteria produce sialidase, which promotes breakdown of the protective mucus layer on the vaginal epithelium and possibly contributes to the characteristically thin discharge typical of BV. The loss of protective mucus may lead to increased adherence of other BV-associated bacteria, to the formation of a mature biofilm, and to enhancing susceptibility to ascending infection in the female genital tract. Overall, these data suggest that the pathogenic potentials of many BV-associated bacteria are strain or species specific.

### Molecular diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis: an update [^cfc5475e]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women. BV has been associated with poor reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV represents the acquisition of a diverse community of anaerobic and facultative bacteria and a reduction in lactobacilli. It can be diagnosed using several tests ranging from clinical indicators, point-of-care tests, and molecular assays. Molecular technologies are objective, are able to detect fastidious bacteria, enable quantitation, and are ideal for self-collected vaginal swabs. This paper reviews the currently available BV diagnostic tests in the United States.

### Inguinal hyperhidrosis: case report of an uncommon cause of Vaginitis [^9a59a62f]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) affects 1%-3% of the population. Primary focal hyperhidrosis most commonly affects the axilla, palms, and soles. There are few case reports of hyperhidrosis of the genital region, typically described as inguinal hyperhidrosis or Hexsel's hyperhidrosis.

Case

A 17-year-old girl presented with 3 years of copious, clear "vaginal" discharge causing significant emotional distress. After extensive gynecologic and urologic workup was negative, further review of her history was notable for excessive axillary sweating. Inguinal hyperhidrosis was suspected and she was treated with topical aluminum chloride hexahydrate with complete resolution of her symptoms.

Summary and Conclusions

Inguinal hyperhidrosis, compared with other sites, is not widely described in the literature. Awareness of inguinal hyperhidrosis is important because it causes significant social embarrassment but is a treatable condition.

The efficacy of XACIATO as a treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in females 12 years of age and older was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study (Trial 1, NCT04370548). A single dose of XACIATO (clindamycin phosphate vaginal gel, 2%) was compared to a single dose of placebo vaginal gel (hydroxyethylcellulose [HEC] Universal Placebo Gel) for the treatment of BV. Patients were evaluated at 3 timepoints: a Day 1 Screening/Randomization visit, a Day 7 to 14 Interim Assessment visit, and a Day 21 to 30 Test of Cure visit. The total study duration was up to approximately 1 month for each individual patient.

To be eligible, patients had to have a clinical diagnosis of BV defined as an off-white (milky or gray), thin, homogeneous discharge with minimal or absent pruritus and inflammation of the vulva and vagina, clue cells > 20% of the total epithelial cells on microscopic examination of the saline wet mount, vaginal secretion pH of > 4.5, and a fishy odor of the vaginal discharge with the addition of a drop of 10% KOH (i.e., a positive whiff test).

### Comprehensive assessment of vaginal infections using a single swab [^933b626d]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the population of symptomatic women evaluated in this study, of which nearly two-thirds (65.3%) were recruited from OB/GYN or family planning clinics, positivity for causes of vaginitis was quite high (81.8% positive for BV or VVC) regardless of STI infection. While the rate of BV was significantly higher among women with a concurrent STI, the positivity of both BV and VVC was high enough to warrant testing for all pathogens. Regardless of STI positivity, BV positivity was high (> 50%); however, significantly more cases of BV were found among women with an STI. This high frequency of co-infection and the lack of specific symptoms that could differentially identify the cause strongly support the use of tests that can identify both STI and vaginitis. Anecdotally, many clinicians believe that if a woman has VVC, she will not have an STI because the vulvar vestibulitis is likely the result of antibiotic use, which might have cleared the STI. Our findings suggest that this is not the case, as over one-quarter of women with an STI also had VVC.

Collectively, these data demonstrate the need for comprehensive testing for women presenting with vaginal symptoms including discharge, dysuria and other common complaints associated with either vaginitis or cervical infections. Adoption of such testing can be facilitated by using assays that allow the collection of a single vaginal sample as this reduces the burden on clinical staff related to sample collection and handling. Moreover, because these samples can be self-collected, women reporting vaginal symptoms as the reason for an office visit can be provided with a collection device immediately following registration and before doctor consultation, as this process has been shown to be effective for STI testing. The sample can then be used for comprehensive testing, avoiding the need for additional sample collection during the examination. This strategy can be adopted in settings where a full examination is being performed or where only limited examinations are offered (eg, emergency or urgent care settings).

Limitations

This study has limited ability to accurately predict the impact of STI and vaginitis causes on one another since only a subset of the population from the parent study was tested. However, applying statistical weight allowed us to determine the expected positivity for vaginitis causes based on the presence or absence of an STI. Further, the estimates for BV and VVC are likely conservative as this study was performed using stored, residual specimens.

The majority of women with PID have either mucopurulent cervical discharge or evidence of WBCs on a microscopic evaluation of a saline preparation of vaginal fluid (i.e. wet prep). If the cervical discharge appears normal and no WBCs are observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid, a PID diagnosis is unlikely, and alternative causes of pain should be considered. A wet prep of vaginal fluid also can detect the presence of concomitant infections (e.g. BV or trichomoniasis).

14.1 Bacterial Vaginosis

Two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) with similar designs were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of SOLOSEC 2 gram for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. A diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was defined as all of (a) the presence of an off-white (milky or gray), thin, homogeneous vaginal discharge; (b) a vaginal pH ≥ 4.7; (c) the presence of Clue cells ≥ 20% of the total epithelial cells on a microscopic examination of the vaginal saline wet mount; (d) a positive "whiff" test (detection of amine odor on addition of 10% KOH solution to a sample of the vaginal discharge); and (e) a Nugent score ≥ 4.

Trial 1 enrolled 144 non-pregnant female patients aged 19 to 54 years and Trial 2 enrolled 189 non-pregnant females aged 18 to 54 years. Black or African American subjects in both trials were 54%. Efficacy was assessed by clinical outcome evaluated 21 to 30 days following a single dose of SOLOSEC. A clinical responder was defined as "normal" vaginal discharge, negative "whiff" test, and clue cells < 20%. Additional endpoints included Nugent score cure (Nugent score of 0–3) and therapeutic outcome. A therapeutic responder was defined as a clinical responder with a Nugent score cure. In Trial 2, the endpoints were also assessed at Day 7–14.

In both trials, a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients experienced clinical response, Nugent score cure, and therapeutic response at 21 to 30 days following a single dose of SOLOSEC compared to placebo. Statistically significant results for the endpoints were also achieved at Day 7–14 in Trial 2.

The percentage of patients with clinical response was also consistently higher in both trials in the SOLOSEC arm compared to placebo among all subsets of patients: number of prior episodes of bacterial vaginosis (≤ 3 episodes and ≥ 4 episodes) in past 12 months, baseline Nugent score (score 4–6 and score 7–10), and race (Black/African American and White).

### Phenomenology, disability and sexual functioning in female dhat syndrome: a study of tertiary care gynaecology outpatients [^245da807]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Weakness in the body, decreased stamina, a thin physique, irritability before and after menstruation, loss of facial and body beauty, mental illness, loss of sexual desire and impaired sexual performance were the commonly perceived consequences of vaginal discharge (table 2). Patients also reported various depressive, anxious and somatic complaints (table 2). Other researchers also found that patients complaining of vaginal discharge presented various physical and mental symptoms. Of note, the symptoms perceived by these women can be explained by Ayurvedic concepts. According to this ancient tradition of medical practice, vaginal fluids are believed to provide strength, power and sexual vigour; therefore, their loss drains a woman's strength, leading to weakness. A belief deeply rooted in South Asian men is '40 drops of food are required to form one drop of blood, in turn, 40 drops of blood are needed to form 1 drop of flesh, and 40 drops of flesh are needed to form 1 drop of marrow, and finally, 40 drops of marrow are required to form one drop of semen'. According to the dietary theory of Ayurveda, semen is formed as the seventh stage product after a high degree of successive refinement/assimilation of food, passing through six stages: viz chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone and marrow. Semen in Ayurvedic literature is equated to vaginal discharge. This gives rise to a belief system that vaginal discharge is formed from the dissolution of bones. Bone formation is a precursor to the production of vaginal fluids; thus, 'melting' bones lead to excessive discharge. For example, backache is believed to be caused by the melting of the backbone.

Identified lesions should be well examined, and the patient should be asked whether they are the perceived source of itch, are painful, or are tender to touch. If vaginal itching is present, a wet mount preparation with microscopy of vaginal discharge, STI testing, and pH testing are often the first line, with DNA probe testing having higher accuracy. A speculum exam may not be needed, as specimens may be collected using a swab that can be inserted into the vagina without a speculum. However, a speculum exam is helpful with visualizing vaginal lesions, such as herpetic lesions or condylomas in the vaginal canal or with cervical visualization. If a provider is unable to perform a speculum exam or if there are upper vaginal or cervical symptoms or lesions that cannot be assessed, a referral to gynecology may be necessary. Additionally, concerning symptoms such as ulcerated, eroded, or discolored vulvar lesions, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, or abnormal vaginal bleeding may also warrant a referral. Vulvoscopy is used for magnified visualization of external vulvar lesions. For uncertain or persistent lesions that do not respond to treatment, punch biopsy may be necessary, and microbiological tests may help confirm diagnoses in cases of refractory infections. The goal is to create diagnostic algorithms based on symptoms, signs, and morphological features.

Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating vulvovaginal pruritus, it is essential to consider a broad differential diagnosis, encompassing infectious, inflammatory, hormonal, neoplastic, neuropathic, systemic, and psychogenic causes. Given the overlapping presentations of these conditions, a systematic approach is necessary to narrow down the most likely etiology. Of note, if hormonal causes are suspected, referral to a gynecologist is warranted for further workup. If a psychogenic cause is suspected or a psychiatric condition is suspected to be an aggravating factor, psychiatric evaluation is warranted. A detailed discussion on these topics is beyond the scope of this review.

Formation of a differential is led by the timing, absence or presence of lesions, location, absence or presence of abnormal discharge, age, and other risk factors. Medical history, contacts, and other elements of history may increase clinical suspicion for causes of vaginal itch originating from certain domains.

### Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis as a cause of vaginal bleeding&discharge: a case report [^68a9f988]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prepubertal vaginal bleeding is a common presentation for pediatric adolescent gynecologists with a broad differential diagnosis that historically may not have included complex lymphatic anomalies. However, given recent consensus criteria and imaging capabilities, this may be a condition that pediatric adolescent gynecologists see more frequently in the future.

Case

We present a case of a 5-year-old pre-pubertal girl whose only presenting symptoms of a rare complex lymphatic anomaly was copious vaginal bleeding. After three vaginoscopies, two hysteroscopies, two pelvic MRIs, and a percutaneous ultrasound guided core needle biopsy, this patient was eventually diagnosed with Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis at age 9 years-old, and she is now being treated medically with sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, with improvement in her symptoms.

Summary and Conclusion

Complex lymphatic anomalies should be considered after initial and secondary workups for pre-pubertal vaginal bleeding or copious vaginal discharge are negative. Furthermore, this case illustrates the value of pelvic MRI in the setting of unknown cause of vaginal bleeding when typical workup is negative.

### A phase 3, multicenter, prospective, open-label study to evaluate the safety of a single dose of secnidazole 2 g for the treatment of women and postmenarchal adolescent girls with bacterial vaginosis [^645f0ea2]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A novel formulation of secnidazole is under development in the United States for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Efficacy and safety of other formulations of secnidazole have been reported. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of a single-dose oral granule formulation of secnidazole in a U.S. population of women with BV.

Methods

In this open-label study, patients were enrolled based on the following criteria: off-white, thin, homogeneous vaginal discharge; vaginal pH ≥ 4.7; presence of ≥ 20% clue cells; and positive potassium hydroxide whiff test. Eligible patients received a single dose of secnidazole 2g at baseline. Patients were contacted on days 8–10 and were assessed for safety at an end-of-study visit (days 21–30). Additional endpoints included investigator assessment of the need for additional treatment and a post hoc analysis of clinical response to treatment.

Results

Of 321 patients, 283 (88.2%) completed the study. The mean age was 32 ± 8.5 years; most patients were white (51.4%) or black/African American (46.1%). Most (79.1%) reported ≤ 3 episodes of BV in the past year. The overall number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was 95 (29.6%), of which 53 (16.5%) were treatment related. Common treatment-related TEAEs were vulvovaginal mycotic infection (5.3%), nausea (4.4%), and dysgeusia (3.1%). The proportion of patients not requiring additional BV treatment, as assessed by investigators, was 72.5%.

Conclusions

Single-dose secnidazole 2g was well tolerated, with a low overall number of TEAEs, most of which were mild to moderate.

### Diagnostic performance of an automated microscopy and pH test for diagnosis of vaginitis [^15b1bd4d]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of the specific cause of vaginitis based on clinical presentation is limited, due to the similarity of symptoms and signs, such as itching, erythema, malodor, and vaginal discharge. Therefore, to obtain an accurate diagnosis additional procedures or diagnostic tests are required. Clinical guidelines suggest that pH and wet mount microscopy of fresh vaginal samples constitute the in-clinic standard practice for the diagnosis of vaginitis. However, the actual level of use of these two measures is low. Hillier et al. reported that among women with vulvovaginitis symptoms, microscopy was conducted in only 17.4% of 281 visits. An earlier study showed that microscopic assessment of vaginal discharge was not performed in 37% of 150 clinic visits, and 42% of 50 different physicians did not perform microscopy as part of the evaluation of vaginitis. Additionally, in > 90% of office visits, pH measurement of vaginal discharge was not performed. A review of 149,934 American patients' files found that over 60% did not include procedure codes for any form of vaginitis diagnostic testing. High rates of antifungal and antibacterial use were found, suggesting common empiric treatment, and likely over-prescription of antifungal and antibacterial medications. A study from the Netherlands found that only 16% (61/380) of GPs reported "always" or "often" using microscopy to diagnose vulvovaginal candidiasis, while only 7.9% (30/380) reported "always" or "often" using culture for the same purpose. Other reports found high levels of misdiagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), regardless of utilization of microscopy, suggesting inadequate use of microscopy as a possible explanation. Underutilization of these simple in-clinic tests often leads to inadequate treatment, with up to 47% of patients receiving one or more inappropriate prescriptions, as well as treatment without adequate evaluation in 54% of visits, implying appropriate treatment in fewer than half of the cases.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^341900c5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of vaginitis has been inaccurate. – Wet mount microscopy has very low sensitivity for all three causes of vaginitis. Availability of a microscope, appropriate training, and certification (eg, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)are required to perform microscopy in the clinic setting and to accurately identify the correct causes of vaginitis. Non–microscopy-based diagnostic criteria, with either low sensitivity (eg, vaginal discharge, whiff test) or low specificity (eg, vaginal pH), thus, do not consistently facilitate the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Women who receive empiric treatment for vaginitis, without a known etiology, are more likely to return for a physician visit within 90 days.

New technologies, using molecular (DNA) targets that identify the etiologic factors for vaginitis, have recently been developed to address some limitations associated with onsite testing during clinical visits. Nucleic acid amplification tests can achieve both high sensitivity and specificity for detection of the three main infectious causes of vaginitis. In a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study, the BD MAX Vaginal Panel demonstrated higher sensitivity for detection compared with Amsel's criteria for bacterial vaginosis, and compared with wet mount microscopy for vulvovaginal candidiasis and T vaginalis, while maintaining a comparable specificity. This work suggests that nucleic acid amplification tests are a diagnostic improvement over the traditional clinical algorithms largely used in settings such as primary care physician offices. The objective of this study was to determine the agreement of clinical diagnosis (standard of care) with a vaginal panel assay for diagnosis of vaginitis in a real-world setting.

### Primary small cell neuroendocrine tumor within a urethral diverticulum [^2f3c42d7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the urinary tract is a very rare cancer, accounting for fewer than 0.5% of urinary tract tumors. These are aggressive neoplasms with high rates of metastases. Urethral diverticula can be found in up to 6% of women.

Case

A 31-year-old woman presented with a clear vaginal discharge and an anterior vaginal wall mass that was thought to be a recurrent cyst. After surgical dissection, she was noted to have a urethral diverticulum with a solid nodule at the base. Final pathology showed a high-grade small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.

Conclusion

Malignancy in a urethral diverticulum can occur in young patients. Clinicians should be aware of this possibility when choosing to manage urethral lesions expectantly.

### Does this woman have an acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection? [^abb92430]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Symptoms suggestive of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) constitute one of the most common reasons for women to visit clinicians. Although the clinical encounter typically involves taking a history and performing a physical examination, the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical assessment for UTI remains uncertain.

Objective

To review the accuracy and precision of history taking and physical examination for the diagnosis of UTI in women.

Data Sources

We conducted a MEDLINE search for articles published from 1966 through September 2001 and manually reviewed bibliographies, 3 commonly used clinical skills textbooks, and contacted experts in the field.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they contained original data on the accuracy or precision of history or physical examination for diagnosing acute uncomplicated UTI in women. One author initially screened titles and abstracts found by our search. Nine of 464 identified studies met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data from the included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly increased the probability of UTI: dysuria (summary positive likelihood ratio [LR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–2.0), frequency (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0), hematuria (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–2.9), back pain (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.1), and costovertebral angle tenderness (LR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5). Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly decreased the probability of UTI: absence of dysuria (summary negative LR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7), absence of back pain (LR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7–0.9), history of vaginal discharge (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9), history of vaginal irritation (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9), and vaginal discharge on examination (LR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–0.9). Of all individual diagnostic signs and symptoms, the 2 most powerful were history of vaginal discharge and history of vaginal irritation, which significantly decreased the likelihood of UTI when present (LRs, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively). One study examined combinations of symptoms, and the resulting LRs were more powerful (24.6 for the combination of dysuria and frequency but no vaginal discharge or irritation). One study of patients with recurrent UTI found that self-diagnosis significantly increased the probability of UTI (LR, 4.0).

Conclusions

In women who present with 1 or more symptoms of UTI, the probability of infection is approximately 50%. Specific combinations of symptoms (eg, dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation) raise the probability of UTI to more than 90%, effectively ruling in the diagnosis based on history alone. In contrast, history taking, physical examination, and dipstick urinalysis are not able to reliably lower the posttest probability of disease to a level where a UTI can be ruled out when a patient presents with 1 or more symptoms.

### What's new in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis? [^b85b6e13]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The use of biochemical profiles and new molecular microbiologic methodologies is transforming our understanding of BV. Most important is the recognition of different subgroups of women who have BV who are at variable risk of certain obstetric and gynecologic complications. New diagnostic tests may soon be available that will allow women to test self-obtained specimens. Treatment of BV has lagged, although innovative methods appear to be helpful in managing recurrent diseases.

Cervicitis and endometritis

Cervicitis and endometritis represent early manifestations of PID and are often subclinical; when present, symptoms include pelvic pain, fever, vaginal discharge and menstrual abnormalities. In the former, MRI may demonstrate an enlarged uterine cervix with a prominent enhancement of the endocervical canal reflecting inflammation and hyperaemia (Fig. 9). Free pelvic effusion may be associated.

The corresponding post-gadolinium sagittal (c) and oblique-coronal (d) fat-suppressed T1-weighted images show prominent enhancement along the cervical canal (arrowheads)

On the other hand, endometritis may be encountered during pregnancy, during the postpartum period, following invasive gynaecologic procedures or in the setting of PID. CT (Fig. 10) and MRI (Fig. 11) may demonstrate the presence of fluid in the endometrial cavity and abnormal endometrial enhancement. Additionally, the lack of a clear separation of the uterus from adnexal and parametrial tissue, with "indistinct uterine border", may be detected.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^5b76b71c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Although vaginal symptoms are common, diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) is not standardized. Diagnostic approaches and appropriateness of treatment were evaluated for women with symptoms of vaginitis who were seeking care at community practice sites.

Methods

Three hundred three symptomatic women, across 8 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center–affiliated clinics, were evaluated per standard office-based practice. Four of 5 vaginal swabs (1 cryopreserved) were collected for a US Food and Drug Administration–authorized nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for vaginitis/vaginosis diagnosis; Nugent scoring (BV); yeast culture (VVC); and a second NAAT (for TV). Two hundred ninety women had evaluable samples. Medical record extraction facilitated verification of treatments prescribed within 7 days of the index visit and return visit frequency within 90 days.

Results

Women had a mean age of 29.4 ± 6.5 years, 90% were not pregnant, 79% were of white race, and 38% reported vaginitis treatment within the past month. Point-of-care tests, including vaginal pH (15%), potassium hydroxide/whiff (21%), and wet mount microscopy (17%), were rarely performed. Of the 170 women having a laboratory-diagnosed cause of vaginitis, 81 (47%) received 1 or more inappropriate prescriptions. Of the 120 women without BV, TV, or VVC, 41 (34%) were prescribed antibiotics and/or antifungals. Among women without infectious vaginitis, return visits for vaginitis symptoms were more common among women treated empirically compared to those not receiving treatment (9/41 vs 5/79, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Within a community practice setting, 42% of women having vaginitis symptoms received inappropriate treatment. Women without infections who received empiric treatment were more likely have recurrent visits within 90 days.

### Diagnosis and management of vulvar skin disorders: ACOG practice bulletin, number 224 [^acd22b08]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Lichen planus diagnosis — ACOG Practice Bulletin 224 describes vulvar and vaginal involvement with multiple variants, characteristic symptoms, examination findings, and evaluation steps. Lichen planus can affect the vulva and vagina and has classical reticulate striae, a least common hypertrophic form with white, thick, warty plaques, and an erosive form with deep, painful erosions that may lead to synechiae and complete obliteration of the vaginal space. Because oral involvement is common among patients with erosive lichen planus, evaluation of the oral cavity is recommended, and referral to an oral specialist (periodontist) is recommended if oral disease is present. Vaginal discharge typically shows inflammatory cells and immature parabasal and basal epithelial cells, and the vaginal pH is increased, usually in the range of 5–6. Absence of purulent discharge does not rule out disease. Biopsy should be performed if indicated, and direct immunofluorescence should be considered when immunobullous diseases that may mimic lichen planus are possible.

Discussion

In this study of 290 women seeking healthcare for symptoms of vaginitis, more than half had a laboratory-diagnosed condition, with 30% of women having BV, 34% having VVC, and 7% having TV based on laboratory testing. This study documents how infrequently CDC-recommended point-of-care testing, such as assessment of vaginal pH, microscopic examination of vaginal fluid, or the whiff test, is performed when women present with vaginal symptoms in primary women's healthcare settings. Similarly, low rates of evaluation have been reported among women referred for management of recurrent vaginitis.

Nearly half of the 170 women having a laboratory-diagnosed cause of vaginitis received 1 or more prescriptions that were inappropriate, and one-third of the 120 women without any of the known infectious causes of vaginitis were prescribed treatment inappropriately. Overall, 4 of 10 women seeking healthcare for symptoms of vaginitis in this study were prescribed inappropriate treatments. Return visits for symptoms of vaginitis were common, occurring over the next 3 months in 20% of the women. The frequency of return visits ranged from 17% of women with VVC, 35% of women having BV, and 42% of women with TV. Surprisingly, follow-up visits for vaginal symptoms were also common for women having no laboratory-diagnosed vaginitis at the index visit, with 12% of women returning with symptoms of vaginitis. The women who were treated empirically for vaginitis were significantly more likely to return in the subsequent 3 months vs those who were not treated (22% vs 6%, P = 0.02). Empiric treatment of women having symptoms of vaginitis is common and is perceived to cause no harm. However, these data suggest that empiric treatment of women having symptoms, but no infectious cause of vaginitis, may result in more symptom-triggered visits and a greater burden both for women and health systems.

### Bacterial vaginosis: a practical review [^167bd829]. JAAPA (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.
- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition, to a decrease in lactobacilli.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.
- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

### Management of acute obstructive uterovaginal anomalies: ACOG committee opinion, number 779 [^84c18579]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Obstructive uterovaginal anomalies — background and evaluation — Obstetrician–gynecologists should be familiar with uterovaginal anomalies, which may have an incidence as high as 7% in females, and obstructive anomalies may present after puberty with amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, recurrent vaginal discharge, or infertility. The evaluation of a patient with a suspected obstructive reproductive anomaly should include a detailed medical history, physical examination, and imaging, and accurate diagnosis is critical to manage the obstruction properly. The best long-term outcome is achieved with a complete evaluation, clear understanding of the anomaly, mobilization of appropriate surgical resources, sufficient preoperative counseling, and planned surgical intervention, and females at high risk of obstruction should be monitored closely for early signs and symptoms of obstruction during pubertal development and initial menses.

Bacterial vaginosis — characterized by a change in the normal vaginal microbiome with overgrowth of facultative anaerobic organisms and a lack of hydrogen peroxide–producing lactobacilli — is the most common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge in patients of reproductive age, with higher prevalence in black, Hispanic, and Mexican American women compared with white non-Hispanic women; although associated with sexual activity, it is not directly caused by the sexual transmission of a single pathogen, and in nonpregnant patients it is associated with increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, postprocedural gynecologic infections, and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2; many patients are asymptomatic, but symptomatic patients commonly report abnormal vaginal discharge and a fishy odor, particularly after vaginal intercourse and menses.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^cf8368ae]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Physical examination and clinical testing — vaginitis evaluation should begin with thorough inspection of the vulva and perianal skin, and during speculum exam vaginal discharge from the walls or fornix should be collected for testing; the appearance of discharge alone is not diagnostic. It is important that pH swabs be obtained from the mid-portion of the vaginal side wall to avoid false elevations from contaminants. Office-based testing includes pH, a KOH whiff test (amine odor test), and microscopy with 0.9% saline and 10% KOH, and FDA-approved commercial tests can be used when pH paper, KOH, and microscopy are not available. Bacterial vaginosis does not affect the vulva and is not inflammatory, whereas candidiasis and trichomoniasis may cause vulvar erythema and edema in addition to vaginal findings.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^23eb3878]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Estrogen and the vaginal environment describes that during the reproductive years estrogen increases glycogen content in vaginal epithelial cells, encouraging colonization by lactobacilli, leading to lactic acid production and a decrease in vaginal pH to less than 4.5, which protects against pathogenic organisms; it notes that normal vaginal flora remains heterogeneous with Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, genital Mycoplasma species, and Candida albicans commonly found; it contrasts that in prepubertal girls and postmenopausal women the lack of estrogen inhibits normal growth of the vaginal bacterial ecosystem, microscopy typically shows a paucity of epithelial cells and background bacteria, the vaginal epithelium is thin and the pH is elevated (higher than 4.5) because lactic acid-producing lactobacilli are sparse, and that growth of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis and yeast forms are less common, so these groups not using estrogen uncommonly have bacterial vaginosis or vaginal candidiasis.

### Uretero-fallopian fistula after hysteroscopy fallopian tube embolization: a case report [^8fd3ea2d]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

On December 3rd, 2016, a 41-year old woman presented to the ER with colic pain in lower left abdomen. She had tenderness in her lower left abdomen, with no fever or hematuria. Emergency CT scan showed a thick-walled cystic mass (size: 2.1 × 1.5 cm) in the region of left adnexa (Fig. 1). The adjacent left ureter could not be clearly identified, and left proximal ureter dilated. It also revealed severe hydronephrosis on the left kidney with a very thin cortex. She was referred to urology department for further investigation.

Fig. 1
Pelvic CT scan showed a thick-walled cystic mass (arrow). The left ureter could not be clearly identified

Her past medical history was significant only for bilateral hysteroscopic fallopian tube embolization in 2009. It was an interventional birth control method. Four months later, she began noticing small amount of "clear vaginal discharge" which periodically started 3–5 days before period and ended in the last day of period. In the following 2 years, she underwent multiple gynecologic ultrasound exams and a hysteroscopy exam, but nothing abnormal was found. The patient didn't seek further treatment, until the sudden occur of abdominal pain.

At our institution, she received various imaging exams. Gynecology ultrasound reported multiple myomas and otherwise nothing abnormal. To find the reason of hydronephrosis, we performed CT retrograde ureterogram. The exam showed that contrast media could reach left proximal ureter and pelvis (Fig. 2a), but extravasation of contrast media into the uterus could be clearly seen (Fig. 2b), confirming the presence of uretero-fallopian fistula. Consulting gynecologist performed hysteroscopy but no fistulous opening in the uterus could be seen. Given the fact that the glomerular filtration rate of her left kidney was less than 10 ml/min, left nephrectomy was carried out. We found her left ureter closely adhered to the fallopian tube and iliac artery during operation, so we only removed proximal ureter, leaving the distal part untouched. Her postoperative course was uneventful without vaginal discharge, and her creatinine level remained normal.

### Automated microscopy and pH test for diagnosis of vaginitis-the end of empiricism? [^276250b9]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

There is a unanimous verdict regarding the universal phenomenon of decline in medical practitioners traditional clinical and hence diagnostic skills. To the rescue has arrived cutting edge molecular diagnostic techniques now widely available commercially, providing increased diagnostic sensitivity but not specificity with generated detailed information often exceeding the practitioner's ability to assimilate the sophisticated molecular answers. This situation is identical to that seen decades ago when new cultures methods introduced annually increasingly were able to identify microorganisms previously "uncultivatable", but never enhanced causality, i.e. establishing a causal role for the microorganism identified. Needless to say the frequency of women presenting with lower genital tract symptoms has only increased, at a time when clinical diagnostic skills, expressed in taking an adequate history and performing a competent physical examination, has dramatically declined. Practitioners increasingly descend into the world of empiricism or guessing and are thrust into obtaining readily available expensive PCR-based commercial tests that often do not facilitate diagnosis. Why not? — Lower genital tract symptoms in women are caused by a wide variety of causes, only a fraction of which are microbial or infectious in origin. Identifying these microorganisms by molecular methods clearly is now possible and superior to older culture techniques and use of traditional point of care rapid techniques including microscopy and pH measurement. Frequent causes of symptoms include hormonal factors, inflammation or relate to immune mechanisms as well as those causes that originate outside the vagina.

The most common causes of infectious vaginitis are yeast, bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and parasites. Infections of the vagina produce an increase in vaginal secretion, vulvar symptoms of itching or irritation from contact with irritating vaginal fluid, and sometimes odor. A careful microscopic examination of vaginal secretions generally yields the correct diagnosis, but atypical or recalcitrant disease deserves a confirmatory culture, as noninfectious inflammatory processes can produce similar symptoms.

### Management of persistent vaginitis [^e22e52e7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

With vaginitis remaining a common condition that leads women to seek care, it is not surprising that some women develop chronic vulvovaginal problems that are difficult to diagnose and treat. With a differential diagnosis that encompasses vulvar disorders and infectious and noninfectious causes of vaginitis, accurate diagnosis is the cornerstone of choosing effective therapy. Evaluation should include a symptom-specific history, careful vulvar and vaginal examination, and office-based tests (vaginal pH, amine test, saline and 10% potassium hydroxide microscopy). Ancillary tests, especially yeast culture with speciation, are frequently crucial to obtaining a correct diagnosis. A heavy but normal physiologic discharge can be determined by excluding other causes. With vulvovaginal candidiasis, differentiating between Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida infection has important treatment ramifications. Most patients with C albicans infections can be successfully treated with maintenance antifungal therapy, usually with fluconazole. Although many non-albicans Candida, particularly Candida glabrata, may at times be innocent bystanders, vaginal boric acid therapy is an effective first choice for many true non-albicans Candida infections. Recurrent bacterial vaginosis, a difficult therapeutic challenge, can often be controlled with maintenance therapy. Multiple options, especially high-dose tinidazole, have been used for metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis. With the aging of the U.S. population, atrophic vaginitis and desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, both associated with hypoestrogenism, are encountered frequently in women with persistent vaginitis.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^dfbbe4da]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Between 6 and 10 million health care visits in the United States by women are related to symptoms of vaginitis. The most common causes are bacterial vaginosis (40–50% of cases), vulvovaginal candidiasis (20–25% of cases), and trichomoniasis (15–20% of cases). The laboratory reference gold standards for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (Gram staining in combination with Nugent criteria scoring)and vulvovaginal candidiasis (culture)are time-consuming, involve a delayed time-to-result, and are not widely available in most clinical settings. Recent Centers for Disease Control guidelines state that nucleic acid amplification tests have a high sensitivity for detection of Trichomonas vaginalis, compared with wet mount microscopy. Diagnosis of vaginitis typically involves clinical findings, medical history, and in-clinic testing — with the latter representing the most essential component. In-clinic testing for bacterial vaginosis relies on Amsel's criteria (vaginal discharge, clue cells, positive whiff test, and a vaginal pH greater than 4.5). Wet mount microscopy is used for detection of clue cells; budding yeast or pseudohyphae, indicative of vulvovaginal candidiasis; and visualization of motile trichomonads, indicative of T vaginalis.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: CT and MRI findings with differential diagnosis-part II: uterine emergencies and pelvic inflammatory disease [^55313d6f]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Uterine inversion

Uterine inversion (UI) refers to inside-out overturning and protrusion of the uterine fundus downwards up to or through the cervix that may occur either as an acute (within 24 h) life-threatening obstetric complication of mismanaged labour or in multiparous post-menopausal women from pulling effect of submucosal or pedunculated leiomyomas attached to the fundus; in the latter case, symptoms include pelvic tenderness or pain, vaginal discharge and irregular uterine bleeding. Physically, the vagina is occupied by the inverted uterus, but the clinical diagnosis is challenging without a high index of suspicion. Imaging is crucial to avoid misinterpretation as cervical tumour and to obviate biopsy which may cause profuse bleeding.

Whereas the nature of the "mass" protruding into the vagina is difficult to identify at US, MRI generally clinches the diagnosis. The hallmark of UI on sagittal viewing is a U-shaped uterus with indentation and depression of the fundus, and a "bulls-eye" transverse configuration reflecting the zonal anatomy (Fig. 7 d, f). Additionally, MRI may detect the possible presence of T2-hypointense submucosal fibroids or heterogeneously hyperintense mass-forming tumours. Albeit with limited contrast resolution, in acute settings, CT with adequate image reformation may also allow recognition of UI (Fig. 7 a, c).

Fig. 7
Surgically confirmed, spontaneous uterine inversion without mass lesions in a 79-year-old woman experiencing muco-haemorrhagic vaginal discharge. Precontrast (a) and contrast-enhanced (b, c) CT images showed a solid, mass-like enhancing structure (plus sign) surrounded by air coursing through the dilated uterine cervix. Loss of the normally convex uterine fundus (thin arrows) was noted. Physically, the upper vagina was occupied by the inverted uterus. Sagittal (d) and axial (e) T2-weighted MRI images confirmed the diagnosis by showing lost convexity and depression of the uterine fundus (thin arrows), U-shaped inverted uterus (plus sign) with preserved zonal anatomy for age and normal homogeneous enhancement on post-gadolinium T1-weighted image (f), which coursed downwards through the hypointense uterine cervix walls (thin arrows) [adapted from Open Access ref. no]

Treatment of UI should consider the fertility and reproductive wishes of the patient, stage of inversion and underlying (benign or malignant) pathology. Whereas in puerperium manual repositioning is possible, post-menopausal UI requires abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy.

Diseases characterized by vulvovaginal itching, burning, irritation, odor, or discharge — obtaining a medical history alone has been reported to be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can lead to inappropriate administration of medication; therefore, a careful history, examination, and laboratory testing to determine the etiology of any vaginal symptoms are warranted, and the majority of women will have a vaginal infection, characterized by discharge, itching, burning, or odor, during their lifetime.

### Sexually transmitted infections part 2: discharge syndromes and pelvic inflammatory disease [^ab3013ff]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect young people, with more than half of the infections occurring in youth aged 15 to 25 years. (1)(2) This review, the second in a 2-part series on STIs, focuses on infections that may cause abnormal vaginal or penile discharge, including trichomonas, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Most infected persons, however, are asymptomatic. Nucleic acid amplification tests are the most sensitive and specific for the detection of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, and they can be performed on provider- or patient-collected swabs. Providers should have a low threshold for diagnosing and treating PID because untreated PID can have serious long-term complications for young women. Indications for hospitalization for PID include the presence of a tubo-ovarian abscess, severe illness with systemic symptoms, pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and failure to respond to outpatient oral treatment (within 48–72 hours) or inability to tolerate the oral treatment.

### Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis and plasma cell vulvitis represent a spectrum of hemorrhagic vestibulovaginitis [^253f0ea7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (DIV) is a poorly understood disorder that presents with abnormal discharge and vulvovaginal discomfort. Examination shows increased white-yellow discharge and vaginal erythema in a confluent or petechial pattern. Prevalence is uncertain as diagnosis may require access to specialized clinics but is estimated at 0.8%–4%. Diagnosis involves point-of-care microscopy showing parabasal cells and more inflammatory than squamous cells, elevated pH, and purulent discharge not explained by other entities. For clinicians without access to microscopy, Bradford and Fischerdescribe a diagnostic approach using history, nonerosive vaginitis, negative microbiologic swab, and response to topical clindamycin or corticosteroids. Several authors postulate that DIV is a reactive phenomenon — an inflammatory condition due to immune dysregulation, proposed to result from cross-reactivity between self-proteins and foreign antigens after exposure to infection, medication, systemic illness, or other triggers. This hypothesis is also expressed in reference to plasma cell vulvitis (PCV), balanitis, and gingivostomatitis. – Also called Zoon vulvitis, PCV presents with pain and well-demarcated shiny red-orange macules or patches at vulvar vestibule. Similar to DIV, treatment usually involves topical corticosteroids and clindamycin.

At present, the main utility of biopsy in suspected PCV or DIV is to exclude erosive lichen planus (LP) or neoplasia, the former distinguished by basal layer degeneration or regeneration and the latter by basal layer atypia and immunohistochemical staining patterns. Most DIV cases are easily distinguished clinically from LP and neoplasia, so biopsies are infrequent and highly selected; the result is scant literature on the histopathology of DIV. One series of 18 specimens showed focally dense lymphocytic infiltrate underlying thinned spongiotic epithelium with vascular congestion. Multiple studies of PCV exist but are limited by several issues: (1) combination with or extrapolation from Zoon balanitis, (2) minimal data on PCV within a survey of vulvar dermatopathology, and/or (3) analysis focused on specific features like plasma cells, hemosiderin, or lozenge-shaped keratinocytes. The synopsis of PCV histopathology is dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate underneath thinned spongiotic epithelium, accompanied by vascular congestion, hemorrhage, and/or hemosiderin. Given the similarities between DIV and PCV in presentation and histopathology, it is possible that they represent points on a disease spectrum in which similar etiologic events manifest differently according to anatomic site and severity.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^0e3e5cf0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Trichomoniasis in nonpregnant patients — caused by Trichomonas vaginalis — is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with approximately 3–5 million cases annually; African American women are ten times more commonly affected compared with non-Hispanic white women; More than 50% of patients are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms, whereas symptomatic patients may report abnormal vaginal discharge, itching, burning, or postcoital bleeding; because asymptomatic carriage can occur for prolonged periods in men and women, a recent diagnosis does not necessarily establish recent acquisition unless prior negative Trichomonas testing is documented.

Initial evaluation for patients with symptoms of vaginitis — a complete medical history, physical examination of the vulva and vagina, and clinical testing of vaginal discharge (ie, pH testing, a potassium hydroxide [KOH] "whiff test", and microscopy) — are recommended for the initial evaluation of patients with vaginitis symptoms; the history should be focused to elicit location, description, and duration of symptoms, and clinicians should also inquire about sexual history (including number and gender identification of sex partners and specific sexual practices), self-treatment with over-the-counter or prescription medications, and vulvovaginal hygiene practices (eg, shaving, douching).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^a4b45fb0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic testing for T. vaginalis should be performed for women seeking care for vaginal discharge. Annual screening might be considered for persons receiving care in high-prevalence settings (e.g. STD clinics and correctional facilities) and for asymptomatic women at high risk for infection (e.g. multiple sex partners, transactional sex, drug misuse, or a history of STIs or incarceration). However, data are lacking regarding whether screening and treatment for asymptomatic trichomoniasis in high-prevalence settings for women at high risk can reduce any adverse health events and health disparities or reduce community infection burden. Decisions about screening can be guided by local epidemiology of T. vaginalis infection. Routine annual screening for T. vaginalis among asymptomatic women with HIV infection is recommended because of these adverse events associated with trichomoniasis and HIV infection.

Extragenital T. vaginalis is possible but highly uncommon compared with genital infections. A study of 500 men in San Francisco, California, reported a 0.6% rate of rectal T. vaginalis; however, this might reflect deposition of T. vaginalis DNA and not necessarily active infection. Few studies of extragenital T. vaginalis among women have been published. The efficacy, benefit, and cost-effectiveness of extragenital screening are unknown, and no tests are FDA cleared for extragenital testing; therefore, rectal and oral testing for T. vaginalis is not recommended.

### Vaginitis: diagnosis and treatment [^2ea3e024]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as any condition with symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, itching, or burning. The most common causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is implicated in 40% to 50% of cases when a cause is identified, with vulvovaginal candidiasis accounting for 20% to 25% and trichomoniasis for 15% to 20% of cases. Noninfectious causes, including atrophic, irritant, allergic, and inflammatory vaginitis, are less common and account for 5% to 10% of vaginitis cases. Diagnosis is made using a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and office-based or laboratory testing. Bacterial vaginosis is traditionally diagnosed with Amsel criteria, although Gram stain is the diagnostic standard. Newer laboratory tests that detect Gardnerella vaginalis DNA or vaginal fluid sialidase activity have similar sensitivity and specificity to Gram stain. Bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral metronidazole, intravaginal metronidazole, or intravaginal clindamycin. The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is made using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms with potassium hydroxide microscopy; DNA probe testing is also available. Culture can be helpful for the diagnosis of complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis by identifying nonalbicans strains of Candida. Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis involves oral fluconazole or topical azoles, although only topical azoles are recommended during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nucleic acid amplification testing for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis in symptomatic or high-risk women. Trichomoniasis is treated with oral metronidazole or tinidazole, and patients' sex partners should be treated as well. Treatment of noninfectious vaginitis should be directed at the underlying cause. Atrophic vaginitis is treated with hormonal and nonhormonal therapies. Inflammatory vaginitis may improve with topical clindamycin as well as steroid application.

### Vaginal packing after vaginal hysterectomy: systematic review and recommendations [^04052af7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Vaginal packing is often used after vaginal hysterectomy to reduce the risk of haemorrhagic and infectious complications, but the procedure may impair spontaneous bladder emptying and necessitate permanent bladder catheterization, which itself increases the risk of urinary infection, patient bother, delayed discharge, and increased costs. This systematic review was aimed at assessing the complications and outcomes associated with vaginal packing after vaginal hysterectomy.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement, using the Population, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study design (PICOS) framework to define eligibility. Following data synthesis and subgroup analyses, we assessed the certainty of evidence according to GRADE guidance and formulated a clinical recommendation.

Results

The review included four clinical trials (involving 337 participants). These provided no clear evidence that vaginal packing led to clinically meaningful reductions in adverse effects, such as vaginal bleeding, hematoma formation, or postoperative vaginal cuff infection. Overall, the intervention produced no clear benefit regarding the predefined outcomes.

Conclusions

Routine vaginal packing after vaginal hysterectomy had no clear benefit on outcomes. We therefore advise against this procedure.

### Thin endometrial echo complex on ultrasound does not reliably exclude type 2 endometrial cancers [^fc91103c]. Gynecologic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine the ultrasonographic characteristics of the uterus and endometrial echo-complex (EEC) of postmenopausal patients diagnosed with type 2 endometrial cancer, including uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC), clear cell carcinoma (CCC), and other endometrial high-grade carcinomas (HGC).

Methods

Postmenopausal patients with type 2 endometrial cancer who underwent preoperative pelvic ultrasound were identified. Histologic diagnoses were made by biopsy or hysterectomy. Ultrasound reports were abstracted for the following parameters: EEC thickness, presence of intracavitary fluid or lesion, myometrial mass, uterine size, and adnexal mass. Ultrasound films were re-reviewed by a single gynecologic ultrasonographer.

Results

Fifty-two patients with detailed ultrasound reports comprised the study population. Twenty-six films were available for re-review and inter-examiner agreement was 92%. Forty-four women (85%) presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding. Thirty-four patients (65%) had a thickened EEC measuring > 5 mm. In 9 cases (17%), the EEC measured < 4 mm. In an additional 9 patients (17%) the EEC was indistinct. One or more other ultrasound abnormalities were found in each of the 18 cases with a non-thickened EEC: intracavitary fluid or lesion (8; 44%), myometrial mass (12; 67%), enlarged uterus (13; 72%), or adnexal mass (5; 28%).

Conclusion

A thin or indistinct endometrial stripe, especially when associated with other ultrasound abnormalities does not reliably exclude type 2 endometrial cancer. Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding requires endometrial sampling despite a thin EEC in the presence of other ultrasonographic abnormalities or persistent bleeding.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^fd8c9568]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis — screening indications and HIV/PID associations: T. vaginalis infection is associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk for HIV acquisition and with increased HIV vaginal shedding that is reduced with treatment among women without viral suppression; among women with HIV infection, it is associated with increased risk for PID. Diagnostic testing for T. vaginalis should be performed for women seeking care for vaginal discharge. Annual screening might be considered for persons receiving care in high-prevalence settings and for asymptomatic women at high risk for infection, and routine annual screening for T. vaginalis among asymptomatic women with HIV infection is recommended. Decisions about screening can be guided by local epidemiology of T. vaginalis infection.

### Management of vaginitis [^25210346]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Common infectious forms of vaginitis include bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Vaginitis also can occur because of atrophic changes. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by proliferation of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes. The diagnosis is based primarily on the Amsel criteria (milky discharge, pH greater than 4.5, positive whiff test, clue cells in a wet-mount preparation). The standard treatment is oral metronidazole in a dosage of 500 mg twice daily for seven days. Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be difficult to diagnose because characteristic signs and symptoms (thick, white discharge, dysuria, vulvovaginal pruritus and swelling) are not specific for the infection. Diagnosis should rely on microscopic examination of a sample from the lateral vaginal wall (10 to 20 percent potassium hydroxide preparation). Cultures are helpful in women with recurrent or complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, because species other than Candida albicans (e.g. Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis) may be present. Topical azole and oral fluconazole are equally efficacious in the management of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, but a more extensive regimen may be required for complicated infections. Trichomoniasis may cause a foul-smelling, frothy discharge and, in most affected women, vaginal inflammatory changes. Culture and DNA probe testing are useful in diagnosing the infection; examinations of wet-mount preparations have a high false-negative rate. The standard treatment for trichomoniasis is a single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole. Atrophic vaginitis results from estrogen deficiency. Treatment with topical estrogen is effective.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^e71f0410]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) diagnosis and empiric treatment — Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active young women and other women at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness. Requiring that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in insufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis, and after deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STIs. In addition to one of the three minimum criteria, one or more additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a PID diagnosis, including oral temperature > 38.3°C (> 101°F), abnormal cervical mucopurulent discharge or cervical friability, presence of abundant numbers of white blood cells (WBCs) on saline microscopy of vaginal fluid, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, and laboratory documentation of cervical infection with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis. The majority of women with PID have either mucopurulent cervical discharge or evidence of WBCs on a wet prep, and if the cervical discharge appears normal and no WBCs are observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid, a PID diagnosis is unlikely, and alternative causes of pain should be considered; a wet prep of vaginal fluid also can detect the presence of concomitant infections such as bacterial vaginosis (BV) or trichomoniasis. Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and of the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the clinical diagnosis of PID, and more elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity.

### Trichomoniasis: clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management [^c28e851e]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis was originally considered a commensal organism until the 1950s when the understanding of its role as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) began to evolve. Trichomoniasis has been associated with vaginitis, cervicitis, urethritis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and adverse birth outcomes. Infection with T vaginalis could have an important role in transmission and acquisition of HIV. T vaginalis is site specific for the genitourinary tract and has been isolated from virtually all genitourinary structures. Asymptomatic disease is common in both men and women, thus screening for disease is important. Various sociodemographic factors have been correlated with presence of T vaginalis, and may be used to predict infection. Diagnosis is usually made from wet mount microscopy and direct visualisation, which are insensitive. DNA amplification techniques perform with good sensitivity, but are not yet approved for diagnostic purposes. In areas where diagnostic methods are limited, management of trichomoniasis is usually as part of a clinical syndrome; vaginal discharge for women and urethral discharge for men. A single dose of metronidazole is effective in the majority of cases. Outside of the United States, other nitroimidazoles may be used and are as effective as metronidazole. Metronidazole resistance is an emerging problem, but its clinical importance is not yet clear. Concomitant treatment of sexual partners is recommended.

### Abrupt perturbation and delayed recovery of the vaginal ecosystem following childbirth [^1e7b575d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The vaginal ecosystem is attuned to the human life cycle. In the context of reproductive maturation, circulating estrogen plays a pivotal role. Among numerous effects on the vagina, estrogen promotes epithelial thickening and intracellular glycogen accumulation, and also influences the quantity and quality of the cervical mucus. Glycogen liberated from exfoliated epithelial cells, and the breakdown products of glycogen, are major substrates for vaginal bacteria, especially Lactobacillus species. While it remains unclear whether circulating estrogen, vaginal cell-free glycogen, and Lactobacillus levels are precisely synchronized –, optimal states appear to prevail during more estrogenic life phases, emerging briefly in neonates owing to the action of residual maternal estrogen, receding in childhood, reemerging postmenarche, and receding again postmenopause. With respect to pregnancy, estrogen levels peak late in gestation, plummet with the expulsion of the placenta, and remain low while ovarian cycling is suppressed, the timing of which is regulated in part by the intensity and duration of breastfeeding. Therefore, the postpartum vaginal ecosystem integrates an immediate aftermath of delivery, including an alkaline lochial discharge and any mechanical trauma, with a longer-term, host physiological trajectory involving the course of lactation and return of fertility, phases that vary in length from woman to woman.

A handful of studies have characterized postpartum vaginal bacterial communities, mainly at six or fewer weeks after delivery, and often as extensions of pregnancy-focused work. These studies, while modest in number and scope, have consistently portrayed early postpartum vaginal bacterial communities as being Lactobacillus -depleted and more diverse than those of pregnant or not-recently-pregnant women –. Whether such communities provoke vaginal pro-inflammatory responses in the postpartum period remains an open question (although see refs.). Our prior work has indicated that nonoptimal vaginal bacterial communities may persist in some women for up to a year after delivery, but only a few women were followed for that length of time. Taken together, these previous findings suggest that delivery may have a relatively large effect on the vaginal microbiota, but that longitudinal follow-up studies are still needed. Without a more comprehensive view of the dynamics of the postpartum vaginal ecosystem, our concept of the natural history of the human microbiome would remain incomplete, as too might our understanding of why postpartum women are at increased risk of developing endometritis, acquiring HIV, and experiencing adverse birth outcomes associated with a short interpregnancy interval (IPI).

### Uretero-fallopian fistula after hysteroscopy fallopian tube embolization: a case report [^901254de]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Uretero-fallopian fistula (UFF) is a very rare surgery complication which usually happens after surgeries of fallopian tube or ureter. There has been no report of interventional operations of fallopian tube causing UFF.

Case Presentation

A 41-year-old female received fallopian tube embolization for birth control. After that she noticed "clear vaginal discharge". She neglected that symptom for 7 years, until a sudden onset of abdominal pain brought her to the ER. Retrograde ureterogram confirmed UFF and revealed severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney. She received left nephrectomy afterwards and recovered well, with no urine leakage from her vagina.

Conclusion

UFF could be caused by interventional operations of fallopian tube, and could lead to severe consequences. The application of fallopian tube embolization should be carefully controlled.
