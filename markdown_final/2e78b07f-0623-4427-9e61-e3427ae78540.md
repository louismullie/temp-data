## Question

liver cyrrhosis - for fever and pain - best management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best management of fever and pain in a patient with liver cirrhosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and stabilization. Then, I should verify the infection-focused diagnostic workup, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Next, I will review pain assessment and safe pharmacologic choices in cirrhosis. After that, I need to consider special scenarios and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized action plan and highlight key principles to guide decisions, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: fever in cirrhosis is a red flag for infection, and delays in antibiotics increase mortality, so I need to ensure hemodynamic stability, obtain cultures, and start empiric antibiotics promptly if infection is suspected, ideally within the first hour in septic shock or high-risk presentations, because mortality rises about 7% per hour of delay in this population [^1132XD33] [^111yrti3].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic workup for suspected infection in cirrhosis: I should obtain two sets of blood cultures, urinalysis with culture, a chest radiograph, and, if ascites is present, perform a diagnostic paracentesis with cell count and differential, bedside inoculation of ascitic fluid into blood culture bottles, and culture, because fever, abdominal pain, or clinical deterioration in ascites mandates exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and early therapy improves outcomes [^116sj21P] [^116VMyG8] [^113zjcZu].

> Hold on, I should verify the SBP threshold and what to do next: an ascitic polymorphonuclear count greater than 250 cells/mm³ confirms SBP and mandates immediate empiric IV antibiotics. If the PMN count is below 250 but cultures are positive with systemic inflammation, that is bacterascites and also warrants antibiotics, so I need to ensure I do not miss these entities by delaying paracentesis or waiting for culture results before treating [^112obxBj] [^114rjs7T] [^116sj21P].

> I need to check antibiotic choices and context: for community-acquired SBP, a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone is first-line. For healthcare-associated or nosocomial infections, or in settings with high resistance, broader coverage with piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem is appropriate, and in severe Gram-positive resistance settings, adding a glycopeptide or daptomycin or linezolid may be needed. Importantly, I should start albumin at 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1 g/kg on day 3 to reduce renal failure and mortality in SBP, and I should reassess clinically at 48 hours to de-escalate based on cultures and response [^113XYeNa] [^111uapik] [^116sj21P] [^113wTPu1].

> But wait, what if there is no ascites or the fever source is elsewhere? I should double-check for other common infections in cirrhosis such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infection, and tailor empiric therapy to local resistance patterns and severity, keeping in mind that typical inflammatory markers and SIRS criteria can be unreliable in cirrhosis, so a low threshold for empiric therapy is justified when clinical suspicion is high [^1132XD33] [^113gYvsW].

> Next, I should review pain assessment and classification because management depends on mechanism: nociceptive pain from tissue injury, neuropathic pain from nerve injury, and nociplastic pain from central sensitization can coexist, and identifying the dominant phenotype helps me choose safer, more effective therapies and avoid opioid-related harms in cirrhosis [^11682Vxg] [^116X5vox].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacologic pain management in cirrhosis: acetaminophen up to 2 g/day in divided doses is preferred for mild to moderate nociceptive pain because it is hepatically metabolized but safe at this dose with monitoring. Systemic NSAIDs are contraindicated due to risks of renal injury, bleeding, and precipitating hepatorenal syndrome, so I should avoid them entirely in this population [^112TA27V] [^113Yxcz9] [^1175Lgav].

> Let me consider localized pain strategies before escalating: topical NSAIDs such as diclofenac gel have minimal systemic absorption and can be reasonable for focal musculoskeletal pain, and topical lidocaine or capsaicin can help neuropathic pain. I should confirm platelet counts before procedures like acupuncture and generally avoid it if platelets are below 50,000, favoring these lower-risk local options first [^112kknEF] [^1175Lgav].

> Hold on, I should verify adjuvant options for neuropathic pain: gabapentinoids can be effective but start very low, for example gabapentin 300 mg/day or pregabalin 50 mg twice daily, and titrate cautiously due to sedation and potential to worsen hepatic encephalopathy. SNRIs at low doses can be considered for neuropathic pain or coexisting mood symptoms, whereas tricyclics are generally avoided for anticholinergic effects and cognitive clouding in cirrhosis [^114RdnsA] [^112kknEF].

> I need to ensure I am not overusing opioids: if pain remains severe despite these measures, short courses of low-dose oxycodone or hydromorphone can be used prn with close monitoring, but I should avoid fentanyl patches in patients with fever or cachexia and avoid chronic opioid therapy when possible due to prolonged half-life, encephalopathy risk, and limited efficacy in chronic noncancer pain. Multimodal nonpharmacologic therapies such as physical therapy, mindfulness, and cognitive behavioral strategies should be emphasized early and often [^113v4r41] [^112kknEF] [^111ESeVx].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios that can masquerade as infection or pain: portal vein thrombosis with mesenteric ischemia can present with pain out of proportion and sepsis physiology and requires urgent anticoagulation and multidisciplinary care. Hepatocellular carcinoma can cause pain and paraneoplastic fever. And rare infections like alveolar echinococcosis can mimic malignancy with fever and pain, so I should keep a broad differential when the course is atypical or refractory to standard therapy [^112W8hzf] [^116CRDQe].

> I should double-check monitoring and follow-up: reassess pain and infection response within 24 to 48 hours, repeat paracentesis at 48 hours if SBP response is inadequate, de-escalate antibiotics based on cultures, monitor renal function closely given high AKI and HRS risk, and screen for hepatic encephalopathy because psychoactive medications and opioids can precipitate or worsen it. If ACLF is suspected, escalate to higher-acuity care and address precipitants including infection and alcohol use [^116sj21P] [^111yrti3] [^115oz3js].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized action plan to ensure nothing is missed: stabilize and start sepsis care if indicated, obtain cultures and perform diagnostic paracentesis urgently if ascites is present, start empiric antibiotics tailored to acquisition setting and severity with albumin for SBP, classify pain mechanism and begin with acetaminophen and local therapies, escalate cautiously to gabapentinoids or short-course opioids only if necessary, and reassess at 48 hours to de-escalate antibiotics and adjust analgesia based on response and cultures [^1132XD33] [^116sj21P] [^112TA27V].

> Finally, I need to ensure the overarching principles are explicit: fever in cirrhosis equals infection until proven otherwise, so act early with diagnostics and antibiotics. Avoid systemic NSAIDs entirely. Prefer acetaminophen, topical agents, and nonpharmacologic strategies. Use opioids only as a last resort and in minimal doses. And maintain a low threshold for repeat evaluation and specialty input given the atypical presentations and high stakes of missed infection or undertreated pain in decompensated cirrhosis [^113Yxcz9] [^112kknEF] [^111yrti3].

For a cirrhotic patient with fever and pain, **immediate diagnostic paracentesis** is essential to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) [^116sj21P], as SBP is common and life-threatening [^113zjcZu]. Start **empiric IV antibiotics** promptly (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) [^113XYeNa] if SBP is suspected or confirmed, and add albumin to prevent renal failure and mortality [^113wTPu1]. For pain, use acetaminophen ≤ 2 g/day [^112TA27V]; avoid NSAIDs due to renal and bleeding risks [^113Yxcz9], and reserve short-course, low-dose opioids for severe pain with close monitoring [^113v4r41]. Always obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible, and reassess at 48 hours to tailor therapy and check for response [^111yrti3].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Fever evaluation

- **Blood cultures**: Obtain at least two sets before antibiotics when feasible [^1132XD33].
- **Urinalysis and urine culture**: Rule out urinary tract infection [^113KYxRN].
- **Chest radiograph**: Evaluate for pneumonia or other respiratory infections [^111yrti3].
- **Ascitic fluid analysis**: Perform diagnostic paracentesis [^116sj21P] immediately in all cirrhotic patients with ascites and fever to rule out SBP [^116VMyG8]; send cell count with differential, culture, and sensitivity [^113zjcZu].

---

### Pain evaluation

Pain evaluation should include a **focused history and examination** to characterize the pain (location, intensity, quality, duration) and identify potential sources such as SBP, musculoskeletal pain, or neuropathic pain [^111ESeVx]. Order **targeted laboratory tests**, including liver function tests, renal function tests, coagulation profile, and inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin) [^1132XD33].

---

## Management of fever

### Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be **initiated immediately** when SBP or other bacterial infection is suspected, ideally after obtaining cultures [^1132XD33]. For community-acquired SBP, use a **third-generation cephalosporin** (ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV every 24 hours or cefotaxime 2 g IV every 6 hours) [^113XYeNa]. In healthcare-associated or nosocomial infections, or when multidrug-resistant organisms are suspected, use **piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem** [^111uapik]; add glycopeptide or daptomycin if MRSA is suspected [^111uapik].

---

### Adjunctive therapy

Adjunctive therapy includes **intravenous albumin** [^113wTPu1] — 1.5 g/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis and 1 g/kg on day 3 — to reduce renal impairment and mortality in SBP [^113zjcZu].

---

## Management of pain

### Pharmacological management

- **Acetaminophen**: Preferred first-line agent at ≤ 2 g/day (500 mg every 6 hours) [^112TA27V]; monitor liver function [^notfound].
- **NSAIDs**: Contraindicated due to risk of renal impairment, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome [^113Yxcz9].
- **Opioids**: Reserve for severe pain unresponsive to acetaminophen; use short-term, low-dose regimens (e.g. oxycodone 2.5–5 mg every 6–8 hours PRN) with close monitoring for sedation, constipation, and hepatic encephalopathy [^113v4r41] [^1175Lgav].
- **Adjunctive agents**: Gabapentin or pregabalin for neuropathic pain; start low and titrate slowly due to risk of sedation and encephalopathy [^114RdnsA].

---

### Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacological management includes **physical therapy** for musculoskeletal pain and functional improvement, and **cognitive-behavioral therapy** for chronic pain and coping strategies [^112kknEF].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **reassessment at 48 hours** [^111yrti3] to evaluate clinical response, repeat paracentesis if SBP is suspected, and tailor antibiotics based on culture results. Continue to monitor liver and renal function, electrolytes, and coagulation parameters throughout treatment [^notfound], and coordinate care with hepatology, infectious disease, and palliative care specialists as needed [^113hWy2Q].

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of SBP, antibiotic therapy, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that healthcare-associated and nosocomial spontaneous bacterial infections are more likely to harbor resistance to antibiotics. Administer piperacillin/tazobactam in areas with a low prevalence of multidrug resistance and carbapenem in areas with a high prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Combine carbapenem with glycopeptides or daptomycin or linezolid in areas with a high prevalence of Gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacteria.

How is PSC diagnosed?

Consensus diagnostic criteria for PSC have been published as a workshop summary on behalf of the American College of Gastroenterology. Consensus guidelines relating to IgG4-SC, the biliary manifestation of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), and on PSC/AIH variant syndrome, have also been published. A summary is outlined in figure 1.

Figure 1
Algorithm for the management of suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Modes of presentation

Symptoms are rare in early disease. In more established cases, symptoms such as right upper quadrant pain, pruritus, fatigue, jaundice, fever and weight loss are present in 47–56% of patients. Patients usually present in one of several ways: (i) no symptoms or signs but with an incidental finding of abnormal liver biochemistry, (ii) biochemical screening of patients with newly diagnosed or pre-existing IBD, (iii) jaundice and pruritus secondary to cholestasis, (iv) cholangitis, (v) jaundice secondary to liver failure, (vi) variceal bleeding and/or ascites from portal hypertension or (vii) cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).

Blood tests

Serum liver biochemistry tests are abnormal in approximately 75% of patients with PSC. The most common pattern is of a cholestatic picture with raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. An elevated serum bilirubin is reported to be present in 28–40% and is a marker of poor prognosis, but this is likely to be an overestimate with more advanced cases reported by published series. An elevated ALP is a sensitive marker for diagnosis but is not specific. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are often mildly raised and do not necessarily suggest additional features of autoimmune hepatitis. As with other causes of liver disease, a raised AST > ALT may be an indicator of cirrhosis and poor prognosis. Other indicators of cirrhosis or portal hypertension include an elevated prothrombin time or international normalised ratio, low albumin and low platelets. There are no autoantibodies diagnostic of PSC. Serum perinuclear antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody is positive in 33–88% of those with PSC but is not specific and is not related to disease activity or prognosis.

Table 1
Predictive models used in patients with cirrhosis undergoing surgery

In patients with cirrhosis, non-urgent surgery should be deferred until an adequate assessment has been undertaken and their liver disease optimised. The clinical team should consider referral to a unit with experience in managing patients with cirrhosis, where appropriate. Consideration should also be given to non-surgical options if available/appropriate. Care should be taken to optimise nutrition. For patients with compensated cirrhosis, after appropriate perioperative risk stratification and counselling, surgery may then be indicated.

Emergency surgery in patients with cirrhosis carries an increased mortality risk, and cirrhosis is an independent predictor of death. In the emergency setting, where deferring surgery may not be feasible, the patient and surgical, anaesthetic and medical teams must weigh the potential benefits and risks collaboratively. Table 2 summarises the anaesthetic considerations when planning surgery in patients with cirrhosis.

Table 2
Anaesthetic considerations in the cirrhotic patient

Surgery in decompensated cirrhosis

Surgery in patients with decompensated cirrhosis carries a significantly higher mortality risk than compensated cirrhosis. Eligibility for liver transplantation, if the patient was to decompensate following surgery, should be determined prior to surgery. In patients with Child-Pugh C or MELD > 20, surgery should be avoided or delayed until after liver transplantation, if possible, for all but the most urgent and lifesaving procedures. Good palliation of symptoms is crucial in patients unsuitable for transplant where surgery is considered too high risk, as well as in all patients waiting for surgery post-transplant.

Abdominal wall hernias are common in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and mortality is high in those undergoing surgery. The clinical team should consider discussion with an experienced centre to guide management of recurrent ascites with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) and other sequelae of decompensation in the perioperative/postoperative period. The decision to offer hernia repair and its timing will be influenced by the patient's eligibility for liver transplantation and the nature of their presentation. Where patients have undergone assessment and are awaiting liver transplantation, hernia repair may be deferred until the time of transplantation (when it can be undertaken during or following liver transplantation). In patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation elective repair of symptomatic umbilical hernia (if feasible) can be undertaken and may avoid the added risk of emergency surgery. In patients who develop life-threatening complications of an abdominal wall hernia (skin breakdown with leaking ascites, incarceration, obstruction or strangulation) emergency repair may still be undertaken but the morbidity and mortality increases significantly.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure clinical guidelines [^113KZZoB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis and chronic liver disease, acute-on-chronic liver failure is emerging as a major cause of mortality. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The workup of a patient with cirrhosis and chronic pain should begin with a comprehensive history and physical. The clinical history should evaluate the location, quality, and severity of the pain, as well as functional interference; associated symptoms, including fatigue, sleep difficulty, mood disturbance, and cognitive difficulties; additional sensory sensitivity (e.g. sensitivity to light or sound); and symptoms in other body systems unrelated to the site of pain. In addition to patient history, questionnaires can be useful to evaluate pain location, as well as pain mechanism. For instance, a body map can be useful to assess pain widespreadedness, with multisite pain indicating a greater likelihood of nociplastic pain. The contribution of nociplastic pain can be further assessed using the 2016 Fibromyalgia Survey Criteria. The contribution of neuropathic pain can be assessed using the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaireor painDETECT, for example. Physical examination can be useful to identify possible pain generators or sources of nociceptive pain.

In general, the treatment of any type of chronic pain should begin with self‐directed nonpharmacologic interventions, as well as the improvement of associated symptoms and treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders. The efficacy of any class of analgesic for chronic pain is small to modest, improving symptoms in approximately one of three patients who try them. Opioids are largely ineffective in treating chronic pain, especially nociplastic pain, which can be exacerbated by opioid use. Paired with the significant risks of analgesic use in patients with cirrhosis, the risk/benefit ratio is far greater for pharmacologic therapies than nonpharmacologic options in this population; thus, the goal should be to engage patients in actively pursuing these complementary therapies. A recent study to develop a pain self‐management intervention for patients with cirrhosis found that participants were highly motivated to pursue nonpharmacologic pain treatments; however, participants cited a lack of simple, evidence‐based therapies as a barrier to implementation. In addition to further research on self‐management programs, such as PainGuide,–that can be readily accessed by patients at home, a helpful strategy can be to produce a list of self‐directed nonpharmacologic therapies available to treat chronic pain, including exercise, diet modification, and sleep hygiene. The patient should be counseled to choose the interventions they wish to try, with reinforcement from the physician of the import of self‐directed management.

### Management of sepsis in patients with cirrhosis: current evidence and practical approach [^113gYvsW]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sepsis in patients with cirrhosis is associated with high mortality. An impaired immune response accounts for the increased infection risk observed in these patients. Hemodynamic and systemic changes suggestive of sepsis may be observed in patients with cirrhosis in the absence of infection; therefore, diagnosis and treatment of sepsis may be delayed. The optimal management of the critically ill patient with sepsis and cirrhosis has not been well established and is generally extrapolated from consensus guidelines and expert recommendations made for management of patients without cirrhosis with sepsis. Despite the lack of strong evidence, we propose a contemporary pragmatic approach to sepsis management in patients with cirrhosis, including the choice of fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^116sj21P]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out SBP in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm 3 count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate, Recommendation: strong)
Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong, Recommendation: strong)
Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^117EqfXN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of portal vein thrombosis, ACG 2020 guidelines recommend to consider administering either UFH or LMWH once a decision is made to initiate anticoagulation in patients with portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis. Prefer UFH in the presence of renal insufficiency, and prefer LMWH in the presence of thrombocytopenia.

---

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^114RdnsA]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Pain management in cirrhosis — adjuvant analgesics are characterized by the following: Gabapentinoids are effective in treating neuropathic pain but are potentially habit forming and associated with somnolence and mental status changes, and for patients with cirrhosis, very low starting doses of gabapentin (e.g., < 300 mg/d) are recommended. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can provide good adjuvant pain medication at low doses with a low risk of hepatotoxicity, whereas tricyclic antidepressants' anticholinergic effects and associated mental status impairments generally preclude their use in patients with cirrhosis. Medical cannabinoids are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, cannabis (marijuana) is not FDA approved for any indication at this time, and significantly more data are needed before recommending cannabinoid/cannabis as an analgesic for patients with DC.

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) – A call for new research standards and updated clinical management [^115QePFm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Prolonged fever of 38.3°C or higher for at least 3 weeks' duration has been termed fever of unknown origin if unexplained after preliminary investigations. Initially codified in 1961, classification with subgroups was revised in 1991. Additional changes to the definition were proposed in 1997, recommending a set of standardized initial investigations. Advances in diagnosis and management and diagnostic testing over the last 3 decades have prompted a needed update to the definition and approaches. While a 3-week fever duration remains part of the criteria, a lower temperature threshold of 38°C and revised minimum testing criteria will assist clinicians and their patients, setting a solid foundation for future research.

### When to use antibiotics in the cirrhotic patient? The evidence base [^112CMdbp]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Bacterial infections are very common in advanced cirrhosis and are a leading cause of death of these patients. Early and appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment of infection is essential in determining patient's outcome. A strategy of careful restriction of prophylactic antibiotics to the high-risk populations could contribute to the reduction of multidrug resistant bacteria. This article reviews and reports the current knowledge in the use of antibiotics in the cirrhotic patient.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^113v4r41]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Decompensated cirrhosis — pain management options include nonpharmacological strategies such as "Hot/cold", "Physical therapy", "Mindfulness/meditation", other behavioral therapies, and "Acupuncture (caution if platelets ≤ 50,000)", along with topical agents ("Lidocaine patches", "Capsaicin cream or patch", and "Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., diclofenac sodium 1% gel)"). Systemic options and starting doses include "APAP 500 mg q6h for a maximum of 2 g/d" and "Gabapentin 300 mg daily (starting dose) or pregabalin 50 mg b.i.d. (starting dose) (for neuropathic pain)", with the footnote "Renal dosing adjustments needed; cannot be stopped without tapering; can cause nausea, sedation, and ataxia". Opioid starts listed include "Fentanyl patch 12-μg starting dose (typically not recommended as the initial agent; avoid in patients with sarcopenia/cachexia or fever)" and "Oxycodone 2.5-mg p.o. q6–8h prn starting dose", and once comfort is the priority, "opioid medications should be titrated to meet the patient's needs without concerns for longer term impacts".

### Non-traumatic hepatobiliary emergencies [^114DZdms]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatobiliary emergencies typically present with a constellation of different symptoms including abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, coagulopathy, and in some instances, encephalopathy. The differential can be broad and may include infectious, inflammatory, and even iatrogenic etiologies. Workup with appropriate lab and imaging studies can help discern between different pathologies and thus guide their management. Interventions can range broadly from conservative management with medical therapy to endoscopic options or surgery. This article explores the diagnostic workup and evaluation as well as the current therapeutic interventions for a variety of these nontraumatic hepatobiliary emergencies based on the most current literature.

NOCICEPTIVE PAIN

Epidemiology

Nociceptive pain is the most well‐understood type of pain, arising from actual or threatened tissue damage. This is pain that occurs as a result of nociceptor activation in a normal sensory nervous system. Although nociceptive pain may play a role in the development of chronic pain, this type of pain is more likely to be acute, resolving when the injury heals and inflammation decreases. In patients with cirrhosis, nociceptive pain can result from diverse causes, including pathologic fractures, ascites, splenomegaly, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal disease (e.g. avascular necrosis, cellulitis, septic arthritis, spondylodiscitis), and mastalgia, for instance. Whereas the overall prevalence of nociceptive pain in cirrhosis is not known, the high rate of opioid prescription, suggests that a substantial proportion of these individuals are at least thought to be experiencing nociceptive pain.

Diagnosis

Generally, somatic nociceptive pain is well‐localized, reproducible, and proportional to the injury. Visceral nociceptive pain, conversely, may be diffuse, with referred pain to superficial areas, and can be associated with autonomic symptoms (e.g. sweating, heart rate changes, nausea). Pain descriptors with high specificity for nociceptive pain include heavy, stinging, lacerating, and suffocating. Although diagnosis is not always straightforward, given that pain may be mixed (i.e. with nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic components), definitive physical examination or testing (e.g. imaging) can reveal a pain source that is amenable to treatment.

Naltrexone, 50 mg daily Cholestyramine: efficacy data from trials enrolling people with cirrhosis are lacking but considered first-line therapy given safety Naltrexone: placebo-controlled RCT of 16 patients followed up for 4 wk; naltrexone significantly improved pruritus as measured by a 100-mm VAS of pruritus severity with a mean 54% reduction from baseline compared with an 8% with placebo. Observational study of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: compared with no treatment, antiviral therapy was associated with a lower risk of HCC, decompensation, and death in people with cirrhosis from Hong Kong, South Korea, and California. Lamivudine associated with cough relative to placebo Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with decreased bone density after 48 wk of therapy Among patients with hepatitis B and HIV coinfection, 0% receiving tenofovir alafenamide discontinued therapy for kidney complications within 144 wk compared with 3. 6% receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Conclusions and Relevance Approximately 2. 2 million US adults have cirrhosis. Many symptoms, such as muscle cramps, poor-quality sleep, pruritus, and sexual dysfunction, are common and treatable. First-line therapies include carvedilol or propranolol to prevent variceal bleeding, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, combination aldosterone antagonists and loop diuretics for ascites, and terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome. What can be done to improve survival among patients with compensated cirrhosis. Survival for patients with cirrhosis is improved with control of their underlying chronic liver disease.

Beyond that, screening for liver cancer with biannual ultrasound and α-fetoprotein is associated with higher rates of curative treatment when cancer is detected. When patients develop portal hypertension, nonselective β-blockers are associated with lower rates of decompensation or death.

Treatment goals for hepatic encephalopathy include provision of supportive care, identification and removal of precipitating factors, reduction in the nitrogenous load from the gut, and optimization of long-term therapy. 7 Therapy should be directed toward improving mental status via bowel cleansing with lactulose orally or with enemas. One randomized trial demonstrated that diets with normal protein content can be followed safely during episodic hepatic encephalopathy caused by cirrhosis, and that protein restriction has no beneficial effect during such episodes. 11In patients who are refractory to lactulose alone, neomycin can be added.
8. These guidelines also suggest that the most effective pharmacotherapy is propranolol at a dosage of 40 mg twice daily, increasing to 80 mg twice daily if necessary.

9If propranolol is contraindicated or not tolerated, isosorbide mononitrate at a dosage of 20 mg twice daily is the treatment of choice. 9Studies conducted since these guidelines have titrated the dosage of propranolol based on a reduction of the pulse rate by 25 percent. 15, 16. The goals of treatment in acute variceal bleeding include hemodynamic resuscitation, treatment of active bleeding, and prevention of rebleeding. Band ligation is the standard for the control of variceal bleeding. 9 If banding is difficult because of continued variceal bleeding, endoscopic sclerotherapy with vasoconstrictors or a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube insertion may be used until TIPS or surgical treatment can be arranged.
9. 9 This treatment option should be performed in medical centers with particular expertise.

TIPS has been shown to reduce portal hypertension and can be effective in converting patients with diuretic-resistant ascites to diuretic-sensitive ascites, as well as reducing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. Evidence regarding whether or not TIPS improves survival is conflicting. 3 Compared with large-volume paracentesis plus albumin, TIPS improves survival without liver transplantation in patients with refractory or recidivant ascites.

AASLD Practice Guidance — Infection in ACLF and cirrhosis notes that infection is the most common precipitant of ACLF worldwide, with a prevalence of 48%. High-risk groups include younger male patients, alcohol-associated cirrhosis, and those with a high MELD score. In patients without ACLF who develop infection, risk factors for progression to ACLF include the presence of ascites, HE, higher MELD score, nosocomial infection, inadequate first antibiotic treatment, and type of infection (pneumonia > SBP). The most common infections are SBP, urinary tract infection skin/soft-tissue infections, and respiratory infections in descending order, and therefore a high level of suspicion for infection is needed in all patients with cirrhosis who present to the emergency room. Biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate, and bacterial DNA are often elevated in patients with cirrhosis both with and without infection, and a persistent elevation of these markers is a poor prognostic indicator. Patients with ACLF and infection have more severe systemic inflammation and a higher probability of death than patients with ACLF without infection. Even if patients survive ACLF, they have an increased risk of subsequent infections; 45% of patients with cirrhosis discharged after successful treatment of one infection acquire another infection within 6 months. Infection prevention measures are crucial in the hospitalized patient and are outlined in Table 5 and Supplemental Materials.

### The emergency medicine evaluation and management of the patient with cirrhosis [^112EEBDv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cirrhosis is a significant cause of death in the U.S. and has a variety of causes, most commonly Hepatitis C and alcohol. Liver fibrosis and nodule formation result in significant complications due to portal system hypertension. There are several deadly complications emergency physicians must consider.

Objective Of The Review

Provide an evidence-based update for the resuscitation of decompensating cirrhotic patients and an overview of cirrhosis complications.

Discussion

Cirrhosis is a common condition in the U.S. and leads to several deadly complications. The disease develops from liver fibrosis, elevating portal pressures and modifying patient hemodynamics. Cirrhosis results in significant anatomic and physiologic modifications involving the gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary, neurologic, renal, immunologic, and hematologic systems. The disease can be divided into compensated and decompensated states, with decompensation associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Complications include variceal hemorrhage, ascites, increased risk of bacterial infection, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome, umbilical hernia, and hepatic hydrothorax. Resuscitation including airway and circulation measures is paramount in these patients, and several new techniques are offered for the approach to intubation and resuscitation for patients with severe cirrhosis.

Conclusions

Decompensating cirrhotics may require extensive resuscitation, and knowledge of the evaluation and management of complications associated with cirrhosis can improve care for patients with severe liver disease.

Hepatitis C is a common cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplant. Although it is usually asymptomatic, new screening recommendations will lead to increased recognition by primary care physicians. Rapidly evolving treatment recommendations are making this a treatable infection for many patients. Recognition of the infection and initiation of treatment for appropriate patients will decrease the likelihood of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Primary care physicians have the difficult task of managing comorbid conditions, such as chronic pain and hyperlipidemia, in patients with hepatitis C, as well as a potential for treating hepatitis C.

OPPORTUNITIES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN

Pain management is moving toward a precision approach based on the type of pain a patient is experiencing (Figure 2). This is especially true in the setting of central sensitization or nociplastic pain, for which the effective treatments are different than those used to treat nociceptive pain. There are limited data mapping the types of chronic pain that individuals with cirrhosis might experience and to consider the concept of nociplastic pain or "central sensitization" in addition to pain from tissue damage (nociceptive) or nerve damage (neuropathic). Patients with cirrhosis have a disproportionately high burden of nociceptive pain (e.g. fractures, abdominal distension, muscle cramping)and neuropathic pain (e.g. peripheral neuropathy),–as well as an unknown prevalence of nociplastic pain (e.g. disorders of the brain–gut interaction). However, it is likely that nociplastic pain contributes to the burden of chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis given that multiple common conditions, such as low back pain and osteoarthritis, can be considered "mixed pain" states, in that they can have nociceptive, neuropathic, and/or nociplastic elements. Furthermore, continuous nociceptive pain states (e.g. arthritis, cancer) can lead to nociplastic pain.

FIGURE 2
Algorithm for the treatment of chronic pain based on mechanism. Summary of recommendations for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis, emphasizing nonpharmacologic therapies as first‐line treatment. BID, two times a day; PRN, as needed; q6, every six hours; qHS, every night at bedtime; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug; SNRI, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; TCA, tricyclic antidepressant.

Optimal treatment for nociplastic pain contrasts with that for nociceptive pain, where therapy is generally peripherally directed (e.g. analgesics, opioids, injections), and instead involves an emphasis on nonpharmacologic therapies. Failure to select therapies for the mechanism of pain will result in suboptimal outcomes. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to apply tools to identify nociplastic pain in cirrhosis and develop interventions to address it.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^116fERSi]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with poor health‐related quality of life and poor functional status. However, there is limited guidance on appropriate pain management in this population, and pharmacologic treatment can be harmful, leading to adverse outcomes, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal injury, falls, and hepatic encephalopathy. Chronic pain can be categorized mechanistically into three pain types: nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic, each responsive to different therapies. By discussing the identification, etiology, and treatment of these three mechanistic pain descriptors with a focus on specific challenges in patients with cirrhosis, we provide a framework for better tailoring treatments, including nonpharmacologic therapies, to patients' needs.

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) — intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma evidence and selection: TACE is the primary treatment option for patients with BCLC Stage B HCC. Meta-analyses of RCTs comparing TACE and best supportive care demonstrate significant improvements in OS among patients with BCLC Stage B HCC, leading to adoption of TACE in management guidelines. A systematic review of 101 articles evaluating outcomes of conventional TACE reported ORRs of 52.5% (95% CI, 43.6%–61.5%) and median survival of 19.4 (95% CI, 16.2–22.6) months. Those who achieve objective response by modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors have prolonged survival compared with those without response. The most common AEs were liver enzyme abnormalities (18.1%), fever (17.2%), bone marrow toxicity (13.5%), pain (11%), and vomiting (6%), although mortality was low at 0.6%. RCTs comparing conventional and DEB-TACE methods show similar responses and safety profiles and have not consistently identified one approach as superior. Patient selection and vascular selectivity are critical factors to optimize TACE outcomes, and patients at a higher risk of hepatic decompensation after TACE may be considered TACE unsuitable; however, established cutoffs for liver dysfunction or tumor burden have not been well defined. Several trials comparing TACE alone versus TACE with multikinase inhibitors failed to show significant improvements in PFS or OS, and based on current data, the AASLD advises against combination therapy outside of clinical trials.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^115M3jqg]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Chronic pain is highly prevalent in cirrhosis, negatively impacting functional status,–quality of life, and results in increased health care use. Data to guide approaches to chronic pain in cirrhosis are lacking, and pharmacologic intervention is complex with significant potential dangers, namely for opioids and gabapentin, which increase the risk of HE. Chronic pain has multiple phenotypes that are currently not adequately addressed by analgesic therapies. Thus, approaching the treatment of chronic pain with a mechanistic focus is important to improve pain control while maximizing patient safety.

In addition to pain from tissue damage (nociceptive) or nerve damage (neuropathic), nociplastic pain can result from central sensitization, characterized by aberrant pain processing in the peripheral and CNS that leads to increased pain sensitivity, augmented pain processing, and diminished pain inhibition. Patients with cirrhosis experience a high prevalence of nociceptive painand neuropathic pain,–but the prevalence of nociplastic pain in this population is understudied. Existing research on FM in cirrhosis, as well as on various symptomatic proxies of central sensitization, such as sleep disturbance, mood dysregulation, memory problems, and fatigue, in cirrhosis suggest that nociplastic pain contributes to chronic pain in this population, as well.

Because all pain types can co‐occur, interventions to address nociplastic pain may be broadly therapeutic. The treatment of nociplastic pain emphasizes nonpharmacologic management, including self‐management techniques addressing mood, cognitions, behaviors, sleep, and environment. Future research should continue to explore methods of pain phenotyping, as well as self‐management therapies, including implementation tools (e.g. digital programs, app‐based programs, etc.). An additional area of future research could involve mechanistic, pharmacologic, and clinical studies to determine the therapeutic windows for currently available pharmacologic therapies for pain in this population, which has been explored for opioids.

Summary

A complex liver lesion presents a significant challenge in terms of diagnosis and management. This case is an illustrative example, highlighting the steps involved in managing such complex scenarios. This patient, in her early 20s, presented with a fever associated with worsening abdominal pain, as well as a background history of chronic abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, constipation and weight loss. The radiology revealed an irregular complex cyst in the liver with biliary and vascular invasion, raising concerns about hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis was changed to alveolar echinococcosis after the infectious diseases consultant gave helpful advice, and echinococcosis antibodies were found. We subsequently started the patient on albendazole therapy. Following prudent advice from hepatobiliary surgeons and given the complexity of the hepatic lesion, a liver transplant was considered the best management option due to the extensive involvement of the biliary and venous systems. The combined approach of albendazole and a liver transplant marked a transformative phase for this patient, putting an end to her prolonged suffering.

Pharmacologic therapy can be used as an adjunct or to address comorbid symptoms in the general population; however, options are very limited in patients with cirrhosis and are associated with adverse effects. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac gel, or acetaminophen (500 mg every 6 h, maximum dose of 2 g per day) can be used for nociceptive pain. If necessary, opioids can be used in the short term for acute pain (e.g. hydromorphone 1 mg every 6 h as needed; oxycodone 2.5 mg by mouth every 6–8 h as needed; or fentanyl patch in select patients).TCAs (e.g. nortriptyline 10 mg nightly) can be used with caution for multiple symptoms, as well as neuropathic pain. Low‐dose SNRIs can be used for neuropathic pain or to relieve associated depression or fatigue with a small risk of hepatotoxicity. Gabapentin at low starting doses (e.g. 300 mg per day) or pregabalin (e.g. 50 mg twice per day) can relieve neuropathic pain or associated sleep difficulties or anxiety. Lidocaine patches can be used for peripheral neuropathic pain or postherpetic neuralgia. Topical capsaicin can also be used for peripheral neuropathic pain.

Infections

Patients with cirrhosis have impaired defence against bacteria due to immune dysfunction, and as a result, bacterial infections are one of the most frequent reasons for admission and are associated with a high mortality rate. A careful assessment for infection is critical in all patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis, as prompt treatment with antibiotics improves prognosis. The most common infections in cirrhotics are SBP, followed by urinary tract infections and pneumonia, and Gram-negative bacilli, such as Escherichia coli, are the most frequently encountered pathogens. There has been a recent increase in the prevalence of infections with multidrug resistant bacteria in patients with cirrhosis, which emphasises the importance of taking the appropriate samples for culture and sensitivity, so patients can have their antibiotics modified accordingly. Importantly, patients with cirrhosis do not always display typical signs of infection, such as pyrexia or rise in CRP, so clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for infection. Once suspected clinically, infection should be treated promptly with broad spectrum antibiotics as per hospital protocol.

SBP is defined as infection of the ascitic fluid in the absence of a secondary cause, such as intestinal perforation, and occurs in approximately 10% of hospitalised patients with cirrhosis. Although abdominal pain and fever are commonly seen in patients with SBP, symptoms are frequently absent. It is, therefore, recommended that all patients presenting with ascites have a diagnostic ascitic tap to exclude SBP on admission to hospital, or if there is deterioration in their clinical status. Diagnosis of SBP is made when the absolute number of PMN cells is > 250/mm 3 of ascitic fluid. Upon diagnosis, SBP should be empirically treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, such as third-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), co-amoxiclav or ciprofloxacin, according to hospital policy, with modifications made in light of subsequent culture results. Patients with SBP are at high risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and should have intravenous albumin administered to prevent worsening of renal function. Studies have shown that intravenous albumin 1.5 g/kg at diagnosis and 1 g/kg at 72 h reduces the incidence of HRS from 30% to 10% and reduces mortality from 29% to 10%.

Treatment

The treatment of nociceptive pain generally involves analgesics or interventions directed at the pain source (e.g. surgery to decompress nerves, intra‐articular injections). Common analgesics, such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs (topical and oral), and opioids, are used. Topical NSAIDs treat musculoskeletal injuries with low risk. Oral NSAIDs in patients without portal hypertension, acetaminophen, or both are first‐line treatments for mild to moderate pain, based on individual patient risk factors. Muscle relaxants can be used to relieve acute low back and neck pain. Opioids, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, may be used for acute pain that is severe or unresponsive to initial therapies; however, the recommended usage is for no more than three days given the risks of adverse effects, including complex dependency or even addiction. First‐line medications should be continued during this period.

In light of the potential for chronic pain to be mixed, as well as for peripheral nociceptive input to lead to central sensitization and nociplastic pain, the first‐line self‐directed nonpharmacologic, noninterventional therapies recommended for nociplastic pain may also be useful in patients who appear to have primarily nociceptive pain. Beginning with these treatments before considering pharmacologic agents or other interventions also aligns with the stepped method recommended for addressing chronic pain, generally.

Workup should be initiated promptly, including skin examination, leukocyte count with differential, blood cultures, and urinalysis, and if clinical suspicion is strong (e.g., association with systemic inflammatory response), empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as samples for cultures have been collected, particularly in the presence of hemodynamic instability.

### Emergency medicine updates: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^113zjcZu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common infection in patients with cirrhosis and ascites and is associated with significant risk of mortality. Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning SBP for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

SBP is commonly due to Gram-negative bacteria, but infections due to Gram-positive bacteria and multidrug resistant bacteria are increasing. The typical presentation of SBP includes abdominal pain, worsening ascites, fever, or altered mental status in a patient with known liver disease; however, some patients may be asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms. Paracentesis is the diagnostic modality of choice and should be performed in any patient with ascites and concern for SBP or upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or in those being admitted for a complication of cirrhosis. Ultrasound should be used to optimize the procedure. An ascites absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 250 cells/mm 3 is diagnostic of SBP. Ascitic fluid should be placed in blood culture bottles to improve the culture yield. Leukocyte esterase reagent strips can be used for rapid diagnosis if available. While many patients will demonstrate coagulation panel abnormalities, routine transfusion is not recommended. Management traditionally includes a third-generation cephalosporin, but specific patient populations may require more broad-spectrum coverage with a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. Albumin infusion is associated with reduced risk of renal impairment and mortality.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the care of patients with suspected SBP.

AASLD practice guidance — Diagnosis and management of infection/sepsis in patients with cirrhosis/acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) outlines an algorithm beginning with immediate infection workup, including 2 sets of blood cultures, urinalysis, urine culture, chest x-ray, and paracentesis with bedside inoculation and cell count/differential; give the first dose of antibiotics immediately in the emergency room (ER) if there is concern for active infection or gastrointestinal bleed. Antibiotics are based on infection type and severity, local resistance patterns, and mode of acquisition, and to decrease nosocomial infections (diagnosed > 48 hours after admission) avoid proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use when possible and avoid Foley catheter use. A history of procedure, hospitalization, dialysis, or inpatient rehabilitation within last 90 days directs antibiotics tailored to healthcare associated infection; otherwise tailor to community acquired infection. Reassess for clinical improvement in 48 hours; if improved, de-escalate antibiotics when culture results return and complete the recommended treatment course, and if not improved, broaden antibiotics to cover multi-drug resistant organisms and reconsider fungal infections. A separate branch notes no infection with Rx other causes.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^112kknEF]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD decompensated cirrhosis — pain management emphasizes that acute pain (≤ 12 weeks) is more responsive to short-term opioid therapy than chronic pain, and optimal chronic pain management often involves multimodal, nonpharmacological approaches, including behavioral management, physical therapy, and procedural approaches. Behavioral approaches have not been specifically evaluated in patients with cirrhosis, but pain self-management programs, cognitive behavioral therapy, and physical and occupational therapy are safe and efficacious in other populations for the management of chronic pain. Procedural approaches have been largely untested in cirrhosis, but acupuncture is effective for chronic musculoskeletal pain and headache in general populations, and although there are no direct data about safety of acupuncture in patients with cirrhosis, observational studies of drug-related thrombocytopenia indicate that acupuncture is likely safe in patients with platelets > 50,000/mL, with a review evaluating potential benefits. Similarly, injections can be used for limited indications, such as knee osteoarthritis, though physical therapy remains first line. Because of impaired hepatic metabolism and the risk of precipitating encephalopathy, lower doses and less systemic therapies are generally preferred for pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis. Local pharmacotherapies are generally first line for localized pain, and lidocaine patches and topical creams for localized neuropathic (e.g., capsaicin) and musculoskeletal pain (e.g., topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) are effective and have limited systemic absorption, rendering them likely safe (though untested) in persons with cirrhosis. Acetaminophen (APAP) dosing is described as up to 2 g daily (typically prescribed as 500 mg, every 6 hours, as needed).

Table 2
Symptoms and management of long-term complications

Successful antibiotic treatment of bacterial colonisation of the pump or catheters is possible, but explant may be indicated. However, it should be considered that any surgical intervention, including for pump removal, also carries a substantial risk in this patient type. Decisions on management of such infections should be guided by a risk–benefit analysis for each individual patient and follow institutional standards. Patients should receive a discharge letter advising them to immediately contact their hepatologist in case of wound leakage, implant site redness, swelling or pain, ascites accumulation, fever for > 2 days, urination problems or suspicion of a bladder infection.

It is encouraged to promptly initiate antibiotic treatment in case of infection and, in parallel, consult local infection management to identify the causative agent and determine its antibiotic susceptibility profile, whenever feasible and even if the decision is taken to explant the device. This approach will accelerate appropriate treatment in case of MDR infection.

If a patient dies with the alfapump ®, device removal is mandatory (except in Israel).

Recommendations

(18) "System or implant site infection may be successfully treated with antibiotics, or the system may be explanted. The decision to explant should be made on a case-by-case basis. Patients should be provided with a discharge letter advising them of signs and symptoms that may indicate infection or other serious complications".
(19) "The patient and caregiver should be trained using all available material. The GP should receive a discharge letter detailing all important aspects of alfapump ® treatment (ascites-related proteinuria, referral to the expert centre in case of infection, ascites build-up, reduced kidney function, wound healing issues or intended changes in antibiotic regimen, no MRI examinations)".
(20) "Patients should maintain a protein-rich normal diet avoiding high-salt foods and aim for moderate fluid intake".
(21) "Albumin should be substituted per current guidelines or institutional guidelines of the expert centre".
(22) "Antibiotic prophylaxis should continue for the duration of alfapump ® treatment".

AASLD Practice Guidance — symptom prevalence and assessment in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) highlights common symptoms, assessment tools, and rating practices. Based on a recent systematic review, the most frequently reported symptoms are pain (prevalence range, 30%–79%), breathlessness (20%–88%), muscle cramps (56%–68%), sleep disturbance (insomnia, 26%–77%; daytime sleepiness, 29.5%–71.0%), psychological symptoms (depression, 4.5%–64.0%; anxiety, 14%–45%), and sexual dysfunction (53%–93%). Clinicians should assess symptom severity, exacerbating and relieving factors, and the functional impact of symptom(s) to the patient, and symptom ratings should be interpreted relative to past ratings from the same person over time. Several such instruments have been used in palliative care, including the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–Palliative Care and the Edmonton Symptom Assessment scales. Nonpharmacologic approaches, such as physical therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, should be tried when possible. Choice of medications can be challenging in patients with cirrhosis, so a conservative, "start low, go slow" approach is generally recommended.

This patient, in her early 20s, presented with a fever associated with worsening abdominal pain, as well as a background history of chronic abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, constipation and weight loss. The radiology revealed an irregular complex cyst in the liver with biliary and vascular invasion, raising concerns about hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis was changed to alveolar echinococcosis after the infectious diseases consultant gave helpful advice, and echinococcosis antibodies were found. We subsequently started the patient on albendazole therapy. Following prudent advice from hepatobiliary surgeons and given the complexity of the hepatic lesion, a liver transplant was considered the best management option due to the extensive involvement of the biliary and venous systems. The combined approach of albendazole and a liver transplant marked a transformative phase for this patient, putting an end to her prolonged suffering.

Bacterial infections are very frequent in advanced cirrhosis and become the first cause of death of these patients. Despite numerous experimental data and significant advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of sepsis in cirrhosis, the outcome remains poor. Classical diagnostic parameters such as C-reactive protein and SIRS criteria have less diagnostic capacity in the cirrhotic population, often delaying the diagnosis and the management of bacterial infection. Prompt and appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment of infection and early resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock are essential in determining patient's outcome. A strategy of careful restriction of prophylactic antibiotics to the high-risk populations could reduce the spread of multidrug resistant bacteria. This review is focused on the currently recommended diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for bacterial infections in the cirrhotic population.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^114Hq3D6]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic pain in cirrhosis is common, poorly characterized, and uniquely morbid. Reported by 40%–79% of patients with cirrhosis, it is a key driver of poor functional status and quality of life.–Patients with cirrhosis and chronic pain also have significantly greater health care use. Pain management in cirrhosis can be complex because of challenges in diagnosis and medical management. Unfortunately, there is limited guidance outlining optimal pain therapies in this population. Recent guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease for palliative care and symptom management in decompensated cirrhosis recommend consulting experts in palliative care, psychiatry, and physical therapy, but pain is common across the spectrum of disease severity, and access to these supportive services can be difficult in many settings. Furthermore, pain phenotypes, each requiring specific treatments, have been poorly characterized in cirrhosis. Thus, proper evaluation and diagnosis are crucial to minimize unnecessary pharmacotherapy and maximize clinical and patient reported outcomes in patients with cirrhosis. Herein, we will define chronic pain mechanistically and discuss the identification, etiology, and treatment options for each type of pain with a focus on unique challenges in patients with cirrhosis.

CHALLENGES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN

Cirrhosis presents unique challenges in pain management. First, consensus is lacking for the management of pain, and pharmacologic options are limited. There are recommendations to limit the use of acetaminophen (≤ 2 g per day) and avoid nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/opioids. If opioids are to be considered, expert opinion recommends weak opioids such as tramadol or hydromorphone for nociceptive pain and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Efficacy data, however, are limited.

Second, virtually any pharmacologic intervention can be difficult and dangerous for patients with cirrhosis. For example, NSAIDs are used by 10%–30% of patients with cirrhosis, increasing the risk of ascites, kidney injury, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Even short‐term use of NSAIDs can be deleterious, as just five doses of 500 mg of naproxen has been correlated with decreased kidney function, decreased response to furosemide, and inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane B 2 production in patients with cirrhosis. Prescription rates for gabapentin have also increased severalfold. Both opioids and gabapentinoids are associated with unique harms in cirrhosis, including worse health‐related quality of life (HRQOL)and increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a frequent complication of cirrhosis that markedly increases mortality. The mechanisms for the harms of psychoactive medications are multifold. First, cirrhosis pushes toxins from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. ammonia) that would be normally detoxified by the liver into the bloodstream. These toxins impact brain and muscle function, leading to depression, sleep disturbance, impaired physical function, and poor HRQOL. These toxins lead to a dominant inhibitory tone in the brain that is exacerbated by drugs like gabapentin and benzodiazepines. Second, because opioids prolong intestinal transit time, a key determinant of toxin translocation from the gut, increased toxin load results. Despite the fact that opioids are not thought to be efficacious in chronic noncancer painand are associated with significant side effects, as many as half of patients with cirrhosis are prescribed opioids. Opioid prescription occurs more frequently in cirrhosis than in other chronic diseasesand is associated with a higher risk of opioid‐related toxicity and overdose in patients with liver disease. Furthermore, opioids are often prescribed with benzodiazepines, compounding the risk of adverse events, including fallsand potential overdose deaths. Thus, it is imperative to select pain management modalities to improve pain control while avoiding serious complications (Figure 1). To do so, we need to better understand and characterize the mechanistic drivers of pain in cirrhosis.

### Management of the major complications of cirrhosis: beyond guidelines [^111bSgeR]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Along with a growing understanding of the pathophysiology of cirrhosis and its complications, new therapies and management strategies have emerged in recent years. Many of these advances have helped inform the current EASL clinical practice guidelines 1 on the management of some of the key complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites, variceal bleeding and infection. However, there are still some aspects of management where the evidence base is less clear, and/or where opinions amongst practitioners remain divided. Some of these more controversial areas are explored in this section, wherein we present evidence culminating in a suggested management approach based on expert opinion and extending beyond the current guidelines.

AASLD practice guidance — hospice and end-of-life care in cirrhosis emphasizes addressing palliative needs by eliciting end-of-life treatment preferences, creating care plans, and educating about possible scenarios, including infection, bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Hospice is described as a patient- and caregiver-centered option for end-of-life care (EoLC) that is underused by patients dying with cirrhosis. For hospice prognostic eligibility considerations, hepatology teams may consider using MELD > 21 and Child-Pugh > 12 to identify patients with estimated survival of ≤ 6 months. Providing caregivers with information about imminent death may help support decisions aligned with the patient's prognosis, such as providing pain medications despite past substance use disorder at the end of life.

Travel in people with cirrhosis

Increasing prevalence, earlier recognition and better management of liver disease mean more people with cirrhosis enjoy a good quality of life and wish to travel. Patients increasingly seek advice around travel during outpatient appointments.

Some considerations are common across all chronic diseases: advise patients to carry a list of medications, a summary of conditions, complications and therapies in an accessible format. Within the UK, electronic prescribing allows prescriptions to be collected from pharmacies near to the place of stay. If travelling abroad then it is important patients take an adequate supply of their prescribed medications with them. It is advisable to carry a limited supply of medication in hand in case luggage is lost. Additional vaccinations (such as hepatitis A/B) may be required prior to travel if not already taken up. Patients on immunosuppression may be advised against live vaccines such as yellow fever(see part 1).

Adequate travel insurance is crucial — many companies will cover compensated liver disease, but some insurance companies specialise in insuring people with liver disease. Patients should be advised to shop around and consider seeking advice from patient support groups to get the best cover.

People with cirrhosis are often anxious about air travel or visiting destinations at high altitude. However, there is no documented increase in variceal bleeding associated with altitude. Nevertheless, anecdotally, variceal bleeding while on a flight can occur, and it is prudent to ensure appropriate primary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding is initiated prior to travel.

Travel with decompensated liver disease is higher risk and should be considered on an individual basis, considering the destination, the degree of decompensation, suitability for transplant, and mode and duration of travel. Patients on the transplant list should inform their transplant co-ordinator.

Reasons for travel differ — some may have had their decompensation episode away from home and need to get back to their base; others may feel recovered and wish to contemplate holidays; for some it may be important for their quality of life and palliative care.

Once decompensation is declared, insurance premiums increase significantly and for some individuals or destinations may not even be available. It may be advisable to delay travel following an acute decompensation, for example, to complete a banding programme following variceal haemorrhage, and to ensure liver disease is optimised. It is important patients understand the potential risks of travel in order to make an informed decision.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^112W8hzf]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis with intestinal ischemia — urgent management: Best Practice Advice 4 states that patients with cirrhosis and PVT with evidence of intestinal ischemia require urgent anticoagulation to minimize ischemic injury and, if available, these patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team including gastroenterology and hepatology, interventional radiology, hematology, and surgery. This complication is associated with significant morbidity and mortality up to 10%–20%, ischemia may present acutely with complete mesenteric venous occlusion or more insidiously, and clinical features include abdominal pain out of proportion to examination, sepsis, elevated lactate, and imaging findings such as mesenteric fat stranding or dilated bowel loops. Timely anticoagulation significantly decreases the need for bowel resection compared to delayed administration, endovascular approaches with thrombolysis and thrombectomy have been successful and should be considered if no clinical improvement is observed with anticoagulation, and patients should be transferred to a center with these services if not available.

Outpatient management of ascites

The onset of ascites signifies an important stage in cirrhosis evolution: the 2-year and 5-year cumulative mortality after ascites development is 38% and 78%, respectively.

Ascites is a clinical manifestation of portal hypertension related renal dysfunction, leading to sodium and water retention and impaired free water clearance. This presents progressively as ascites, refractory ascites, hyponatraemia and ultimately hepatorenal syndrome.

New-onset ascites should be evaluated to ensure it is related to portal hypertension, including calculating serum albumin gradient (SAAG) where SAAG > 11 g/L is consistent with portal hypertension. In the absence of another clear cause of decompensation, CT scan of the liver to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma or portomesenteric vein thrombosis should be considered. Any significant increase in the volume of ascites, abdominal pain or fever should prompt an ascitic tap with fluid sent for white cell count to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and ascitic fluid culture. A neutrophil count of > 250/mm 3 confirms SBP requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics.

Considerations in cirrhosis

NSAIDs are metabolized by the liver and are largely protein‐bound, leading to elevated serum levels in patients with cirrhosis. Furthermore, NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal perfusion and increased risk of hepatorenal syndrome.NSAIDs also inhibit thromboxane A2 production, increasing bleeding risk. Given these risks, oral NSAIDs are contraindicated in cirrhosis. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac gel, have not been researched in patients with cirrhosis; however, their use is generally accepted because the level of systemic absorption is low. Acetaminophen, although associated with hepatotoxicity when taken in excessive doses, can be used in patients with cirrhosis up to 2 g per day (500 mg every 6 h). Muscle relaxants (e.g. cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol) are associated with sedation and should be avoided in older individuals; however their use in cirrhosis has not been studied. Opioids are primarily metabolized by the liver and are associated with unique risks in cirrhosis, including altered pharmacokinetics (i.e. prolonged half‐lives), HE, and risk of addiction in a population with a higher rate of alcoholism. However, opioids can be started if needed, for instance hydromorphone (1 mg every 6 h as needed) or oxycodone (2.5 mg by mouth every 6–8 h as needed). A fentanyl patch (12 mcg starting dose) can be used in patients without sarcopenia/cachexia or fever.

AASLD Practice Guidance — guidance statements on symptom assessment and management in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) stress systematic, staged, and interdisciplinary care. A wide range of symptoms co-occur in patients with DC, and addressing these symptoms is a key component of high-quality cirrhosis care. For patients with DC, following general palliative care principles, we recommend systematically evaluating the presence and severity of a wide range of symptoms and addressing the symptoms most important to patients. Often, the first approach to symptom management may be nonpharmacological, such as behavioral intervention, physical therapy, or other modalities that address multiple symptoms. Underlying causes of symptoms should be identified and managed first. Symptom management should consider best practices, disease stage, and patient goals and preferences, and evaluation and management of symptoms should be interdisciplinary, when possible, including nursing, social work, and chaplaincy.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^112WEbk7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare, acute, potentially reversible condition resulting in severe liver impairment and rapid clinical deterioration in patients without preexisting liver disease. Due to the rarity of this condition, published studies are limited by the use of retrospective or prospective cohorts and lack of randomized controlled trials. Current guidelines represent the suggested approach to the identification, treatment, and management of ALF and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence was reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation process to develop recommendations. When no robust evidence was available, expert opinions were summarized using Key Concepts. Considering the variety of clinical presentations of ALF, individualization of care should be applied in specific clinical scenarios.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^114SBgFY]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of hepatopulmonary syndrome, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of medical therapy or TIPS placement for the treatment of patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome.

### Management of infections in cirrhotic patients: report of a consensus conference [^1139jtrT]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The statements produced by the consensus conference on infection in end-stage liver disease promoted by the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver, are here reported. The topics of epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patient with compensated and decompensated liver cirrhosis were reviewed by a scientific board of experts who proposed 26 statements that were graded according to level of evidence and strength of recommendation, and approved by an independent jury. Each topic was explored focusing on the more relevant clinical questions. By systematic literature search of available evidence, comparison and discussion of expert opinions, pertinent statements answering specific questions were presented and approved. Short comments were added to explain the basis for grading evidence particularly on case of controversial areas.

TYPES OF PAIN

Chronic pain can be characterized using three mechanistic descriptors: nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, and nociplastic pain (Table 1). Nociceptive pain is characterized by ongoing tissue damage or inflammation. Neuropathic pain is characterized by nerve damage in the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS). In contrast, the term "nociplastic pain" was introduced in 2016 to describe pain with no evidence of tissue or nerve damage but with "clinical and psychophysical findings that suggest altered nociception", such as pain associated with fibromyalgia (FM) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients with nociplastic pain may present with a history of widespread pain refractory to intervention (e.g. opioids, surgery), as well as accompanying CNS‐driven complaints (e.g. fatigue, sleep difficulty, mood dysregulation, and memory or concentration problems). The three pain types are not mutually exclusive and can co‐occur with variable degrees of overlap.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^113AEJjG]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD — end-of-life care in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) highlights symptom burden, goals, and planning. The burden of symptoms and distress that patients with DC experience at the end of life is comparable to that of patients with advanced colorectal and lung cancer, and symptoms commonly include pain, lack of energy, drowsiness, insomnia, and difficulty concentrating. Eliciting treatment preferences for EoLC and addressing palliative needs based on priority are critical to ensuring that care at the end of life is patient and caregiver centered. Health care teams should provide education about prognosis and help patients and caregivers develop plans for addressing infection, hemorrhage, and encephalopathy, which are the most common scenarios leading to death. Care plans may often require balancing goals that are simultaneously aggressive and nonaggressive, and this can be challenging for those wishing to pursue EoLC at home or in the community, though the majority of patients with cirrhosis die in a health care facility.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^115Vm862]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of SBP, antibiotic therapy, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antibiotics known to be highly nephrotoxic in patients with cirrhosis, such as vancomycin or aminoglycosides, in cases of severe infections sustained by extensively drug-resistant bacteria. Monitor serum levels of these drugs in accordance with local policy thresholds.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^112TA27V]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD guidance statements — pain in patients with cirrhosis emphasize that multimodal pain management approaches are ideal and include a person-centered holistic, multidisciplinary approach, engaging a combination of expertise from across a number of specialties; pain in patients with DC requires a systematic approach that starts with assessing and treating reversible causes of pain; and localized pain should first be addressed with local, rather than systemic, therapies. Acetaminophen, 500 mg every 6 h, up to a maximum dose of 2 g/d, is the preferred first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of pain in patients with cirrhosis, and systemic NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. We recommend avoiding opioids, when possible, for chronic pain. However, when necessary, opioid use should be approached with caution and with careful discussion with patients and caregivers. Low-dose oxycodone or hydromorphone can be started in select cases on an as-needed basis and titrated to effect, often in consultation with pain management experts.
