## Question

Should patients under the age of 50 receive shingrick's vaccine if they have had shingles?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a person under 50 years old who has already had shingles should receive the Shingrix (recombinant zoster) vaccine, and under what circumstances that would be appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current age-based recommendations for Shingrix in immunocompetent adults. Then, I should verify the rules for vaccinating after a prior shingles episode and whether a waiting period is required. Next, I will check the expanded indications for adults aged 19 and older who are immunocompromised or at increased risk. After that, I need to review which younger high-risk conditions specifically warrant vaccination. Finally, I will consider special scenarios such as recurrent shingles at a young age, pregnancy, and practical administration details like timing and reactogenicity, and then synthesize a clear recommendation anchored to FDA and ACIP guidance.

> Let me first confirm the routine recommendation for immunocompetent adults. CDC and ACIP recommend Shingrix for all immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older as a two-dose series given 2 to 6 months apart, regardless of prior shingles or prior receipt of Zostavax, so there is no age-based routine indication for immunocompetent adults under 50 years old at this time [^114NAcr6] [^114tV59z] [^114FjT23].

> Wait, let me verify the prior-episode rule because that's easy to misstate. I initially thought vaccination should be delayed for 12 months after a shingles episode, but hold on, that 12-month figure aligns with the old live vaccine (Zostavax) context. With Shingrix, the correct guidance is to wait until the acute episode has resolved and symptoms have abated, and there is no specific minimum interval required beyond that, so vaccinating once the patient is clinically recovered is acceptable [^112EPPQE] [^114FjT23].

> Next, I should review the expanded indication for immunocompromised adults. The FDA expanded Shingrix's indication to adults aged 18 years and older who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed because of disease or therapy, and ACIP subsequently recommended a two-dose series for immunocompromised adults aged 19 years and older, regardless of prior shingles or prior Zostavax, so immunocompromised adults under 50 can and should receive Shingrix when indicated [^114QuFjr] [^1137fhkA] [^116BB9NS].

> I need to check concrete examples of high-risk conditions in younger adults where vaccination is recommended. Guidelines explicitly support Shingrix for adults with HIV aged 19 years and older, regardless of CD4 count, with the caveat to avoid vaccination during an acute shingles episode; other conditions frequently cited as qualifying include solid organ or hematologic malignancy, solid organ transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids and biologics, and select inflammatory diseases, and multiple respiratory sources emphasize higher shingles risk in asthma and COPD, prompting many systems to vaccinate these patients starting at age 19 if they are or will be immunosuppressed or at increased risk [^115PgcDV] [^1132z87w] [^112tHAja] [^112TxL2E] [^114RsV9Z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about purely immunocompetent adults under 50. I should confirm that even with a history of shingles, an immunocompetent person under 50 still does not meet routine indications; ACIP's routine recommendation remains age 50 and older for immunocompetent hosts, and while prior shingles increases risk of recurrence, this alone has not been adopted as a standalone indication for routine vaccination in adults younger than 50, though some clinicians may consider shared decision-making in select recurrent or high-burden cases outside formal indications [^114NAcr6].

> Let me consider a scenario where an otherwise healthy person under 50 has already had shingles. Recurrence risk exists and may justify discussion, but standard U.S. recommendations still do not endorse routine Shingrix in immunocompetent adults under 50. Thus, the prudent approach is to reassess immunocompromise, medications, and comorbidities that might shift risk, and if none are present, vaccination is generally deferred until age 50 unless new guidance emerges or a compelling individual risk profile is identified [^114NAcr6] [^114FjT23].

> I should double-check special situations and precautions. Vaccination should be postponed during an acute shingles episode and resumed once the illness has resolved. Pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication, but vaccination is generally delayed until after pregnancy. Shingrix is non-live and can be coadministered with other adult vaccines at different anatomical sites, and patients should be counseled about expected local and systemic reactogenicity to support series completion [^114FjT23] [^114tV59z] [^111zQk4D] [^114v1994].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. For an immunocompetent adult under 50 who has had shingles, Shingrix is not routinely recommended. Vaccination should be delayed until age 50 unless the patient is or will be immunocompromised or otherwise meets the expanded indication for adults aged 19 years and older at increased risk due to disease or therapy, in which case a two-dose Shingrix series is appropriate once the acute episode has resolved and symptoms have abated [^114NAcr6] [^1137fhkA] [^112EPPQE] [^114FjT23].

---

Shingrix is not routinely recommended for immunocompetent adults under 50, even if they have had shingles. It is indicated for **immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years** [^1137fhkA] [^112tHAja] and for **immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years** [^114NAcr6]. If a patient under 50 is immunocompromised or has frequent, severe, or complicated shingles, consider Shingrix after discussing risks, benefits, and insurance coverage; otherwise, **routine use is not advised**.

---

## Current recommendations for Shingrix vaccination

According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Shingrix is recommended for the following groups:

- **Immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years**: Routine vaccination with two doses administered 2–6 months apart [^114NAcr6] [^114FjT23].

- **Immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years**: Vaccination is recommended regardless of prior history of shingles or previous vaccination with live zoster vaccine (Zostavax), which is no longer available in the United States [^1137fhkA] [^115LZroM].

- **Adults with a history of shingles**: Vaccination is recommended regardless of prior shingles episodes, as the risk of recurrence remains significant [^113fAjmg] [^114FjT23].

---

## Efficacy and safety of Shingrix in younger adults

Clinical trials and real-world studies have demonstrated Shingrix's high efficacy in preventing shingles and its complications, including **postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)** [^114LSHkv]. However, most trials enrolled **adults aged ≥ 50 years**, and data on efficacy and safety in younger adults are limited. In immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years, Shingrix has demonstrated **acceptable safety and immunogenicity profiles**, supporting its use in this population [^112tHAja] [^114bPkGF].

---

## Risk of shingles recurrence in younger adults

While shingles is more common in older adults, younger adults can also experience shingles, particularly if they have underlying **immunocompromised conditions** or other risk factors [^112TxL2E]. The risk of shingles recurrence is **approximately 2–6% within five years** following the initial episode, regardless of age. This risk underscores the importance of **vaccination** in individuals with recurrent or severe shingles, especially if they have underlying immunocompromised conditions.

---

## Clinical considerations for vaccinating patients under 50 with prior shingles

For immunocompetent adults under 50 with prior shingles, routine Shingrix vaccination is not currently recommended by ACIP or CDC. Clinicians may consider vaccination on a case-by-case basis, particularly if the patient has:

- **Frequent or severe shingles episodes**: Recurrent or severe shingles may indicate an underlying immunocompromised condition or increased susceptibility to VZV reactivation.

- **Immunocompromised status**: Patients with immunocompromising conditions or therapies may benefit from vaccination, as recommended for adults aged ≥ 19 years [^1137fhkA] [^112tHAja].

- **High-risk occupations or lifestyle factors**: Healthcare workers, teachers, or individuals with frequent exposure to VZV may be considered for vaccination based on individual risk assessment.

---

## Potential benefits and risks of Shingrix vaccination in younger adults

### Benefits

Potential benefits include a **reduced risk of recurrence** — Shingrix has demonstrated high efficacy in preventing shingles and PHN, which may benefit younger adults with recurrent episodes — and **protection against complications**, as vaccination may reduce the risk of PHN and other complications associated with shingles.

---

### Risks

Potential risks include **adverse reactions**, as Shingrix is associated with mild to moderate local and systemic reactions, including injection site pain, fatigue, and myalgia [^114v1994] [^115bk6o9], and **limited data**, given the scarcity of evidence regarding efficacy and safety in immunocompetent adults under 50.

---

## Insurance coverage and cost considerations

Currently, most insurance plans in the United States do not cover Shingrix vaccination for immunocompetent adults under 50, as it is not part of routine recommendations. Patients may need to pay out-of-pocket, which can be a significant financial burden.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Immunocompetent adults ≥ 50 years | Routine vaccination recommended |
| Immunocompromised adults ≥ 19 years | Vaccination recommended |
| Immunocompetent adults < 50 years with prior shingles | Not routinely recommended; consider case-by-case |

---

Shingrix vaccination is **not routinely recommended** for immunocompetent adults under 50, including those with prior shingles. Clinicians may consider vaccination on a case-by-case basis for patients with frequent, severe, or complicated shingles episodes or underlying immunocompromised conditions. Routine vaccination is recommended for **immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years** and **immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years**.

Introduction

Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV). Around 30% of the general population are estimated to develop HZ in their lifetime. Patients with RA are at increased risk of HZ, with 1.5–2 times greater age-specific incidence ratios, and treatment with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) exacerbates this risk.

Until recently, the only available vaccine against HZ was a live vaccine, contraindicated for patients with strong immunosuppressive therapies such as JAKis. In 2018, a novel non-live subunit vaccine against HZ (HZ/su; Shingrix), consisting of recombinant VZV antigen glycoprotein E (gE) and the adjuvant system AS01B, was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The HZ/su vaccine has been shown to be safe, immunogenic and effective in healthy adults ≥ 50 years of age. It has also been shown to be safe and immunogenic for certain immunosuppressed populations, including autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients and patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The HZ/su vaccine is approved for adults ≥ 50 years of age and adults ≥ 18 years of age at increased risk of HZ.

Two retrospective studies on the safety of the HZ/su vaccine in patients with rheumatic diseases, including a total of 1025 patients, of whom 69 received JAKi, demonstrated an acceptable vaccine safety profile in this population. Additionally, one prospective study including 26 RA patients receiving JAKi found an acceptable safety profile and similar serological immunogenicity after HZ/su vaccination compared with healthy controls.

In this study, we aimed to further investigate the serological immunogenicity and safety of the HZ/su vaccine in patients with RA treated with JAKi.

Concise clinical guidance use and scope — Shared decision-making should be utilized to ensure optimal patient care decisions are made, and these decisions should jointly reflect patient preference and those of the managing clinician, especially in areas of management uncertainty. This CCG does not supersede good clinical judgment, and the clinician should seek input as needed from relevant experts. Although this CCG focuses on respiratory vaccinations, the writing committee acknowledges emerging evidence suggesting that other vaccines — such as the herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine — may offer cardiovascular protective benefits. This CCG is based on the best data currently available, with new information to inform guidance being rapidly generated; these updates will influence the considerations presented in the document, and it is essential that clinicians stay current with emerging evidence and updates following the publication of this CCG.

Zoster vaccination — Indication is age ≥ 18 years, regardless of a past episode of herpes zoster or receipt of attenuated ZVL (Zostavax). Recommendations list a two-dose (0.5 mL IM) series of RZV (Shingrix) IM 2–6 months apart (AIII). RZV is not recommended in pregnancy (AIII). To maximize immunologic response to the vaccine, consider delaying vaccination until patient is virologically suppressed on ART (CIII) or wait for immune reconstitution in those who had a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 (CIII). Do not give RZV (Shingrix) during an acute episode of herpes zoster (AIII). ACIP recommends RZV for adults aged ≥ 19 years who are or will be at risk for herpes zoster.

### The impact of routine vaccinations on Alzheimer's disease risk in persons 65 years and older: a claims-based cohort study using propensity score matching [^111wvuFM]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus. Estimates of lifetime HZ incidence show that nearly one-third of the world's population will develop HZ. Patients with a history of HZ have an increased risk for developing dementia. The HZ vaccine currently recommended in the US, Shingrix, has been available since 2017 to patients 50 years and older and immunocompromised patients 19 years and older. Shingrix is a recombinant vaccine containing varicella-zoster glycoprotein E antigen and an adjuvant which is given as a two-dose series. It has been demonstrated to be 97% effective at preventing HZ in patients 50 to 69 years old, and 91% effective in patients 70 years and older. From 2008 to 2020, the live-attenuated varicella vaccine, Zostavax, was recommended in the US for the prevention of HZ among those 60 and older. The Zostavax vaccine reduces the risk of HZ by 51%.

Pneumococcal infection is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (i.e. pneumococcus). Patients 65 and older are at higher risk for severe disease. There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines for adults: the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV-23) and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, PCV15, or PCV20). The PPSV-23 vaccine contains the purified capsular polysaccharide for twenty-three different serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae; whereas the PCV-13 vaccine only contains thirteen serotypes, but also contains a modified diphtheria toxin protein as a conjugant. PPSV-23 was first approved for use in 1983, and until 2021, the CDC recommended that all adults 65 and older receive a dose of PPSV-23. Between 2014–2019, the CDC recommended that adults aged 65 years and older receive a dose of PCV-13 prior to the PPSV-23. Since June 2019, however, PCV-13 is no longer routinely recommended for immunocompetent adults 65 or older. Instead, it is given after "shared clinical decision-making". PCV-13 is 75% effective at preventing invasive serotype-specific pneumococcal disease, while PPSV-23 is 60–70% effective.

Herpes zoster vaccination in inflammatory bowel disease — Recombinant herpes zoster vaccine, adjuvanted: Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline) is for all adults ≥ 19 y of age; for patients not on immune-modifying therapy, 2-dose series 8–12 wk apart; for patients on immune-modifying therapy, 2-dose series 4–8 wk apart.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on adult immunizations as part of cardiovascular care: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112RMjqn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Zoster (shingles) vaccination — cardiovascular associations, benefits, and adult recommendations are presented. Infection with herpes zoster is known to induce an inflammatory state with increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI), and those with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are more likely to have zoster infection. Multiple observational studies have found reduced cardiovascular events among patients vaccinated for herpes zoster; in a South Korea study of over 1 million individuals, zoster vaccination was significantly associated with reduced MI, stroke, heart failure (HF), and arrhythmia, and this benefit lasted for 8 years post-vaccination. Randomized data indicate that patients with coronary artery disease receive as good or greater effectiveness from vaccination compared with those with other chronic conditions. The current national recommendations for zoster vaccination are that all adults aged ≥ 50 years should receive 2 doses of the zoster (shingles) vaccine separated by 2 to 6 months.

### Update on recommendations for use of herpes zoster vaccine [^114JuiSH]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

With FDA approval, Zostavax is available in the United States and indicated for use among adults aged ≥ 50 years. Vaccination providers considering the use of Zostavax among certain persons aged 50 through 59 years despite the absence of an ACIP recommendation should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their patients. Although the vaccine has short-term efficacy, there have been no long-term studies of vaccine protection in this age group. In adults vaccinated at age ≥ 60 years, vaccine efficacy wanes within the first 5 years after vaccination, and protection beyond 5 years is uncertain; therefore, adults receiving the vaccine before age 60 years might not be protected when their risks for herpes zoster and its complications are highest. CDC is actively monitoring postmarketing data on duration of vaccine protection in adults vaccinated at age ≥ 60 years. As additional data become available, ACIP will reevaluate the optimal age for vaccination and the need for revaccination to maintain protection against herpes zoster and its complications.

### Bullous fixed drug eruption following administration of the recombinant adjuvant shingrix vaccine [^116pcYMv]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

This case highlights the possibility of an acute bullous reaction to the recombinant adjuvant Shingrix vaccine. The vaccine has been shown to be very effective at preventing VZV reactivation and postherpetic neuralgia and is well tolerated in most patients, so the benefits of receiving the vaccination outweigh the risks. Nonetheless, recognition of acute reactions associated with the vaccine such as the delayed-type immune dysregulation seen in this patient should be recognised and treated early.

Learning points

This is the first known case of a bullous fixed drug eruption associated with the recombinant adjuvant Shingrix vaccine.
Caution should be taken when administering the Shingrix vaccine to patients with autoimmune and/or immunocompromising conditions.
Bullous fixed drug eruptions due to medications and vaccinations are self-limited and treated with discontinuation of the offending agent and corticosteroids.

### Zoster vaccine: current status and future prospects [^117PL2zJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Live, attenuated Oka/Merck varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (zoster vaccine) protects immunocompetent adults from herpes zoster and its complications. Success of zoster vaccine in preventing the clinical manifestations of latent VZV reactivation contrasts with the failure to achieve similar results with vaccination to prevent recurrent herpes simplex. This reflects major differences in the pathophysiology of latency and reactivation of these 2 alphaherpesviruses. The Shingles Prevention Study and many others have demonstrated that VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity, but not VZV antibody, plays a critical role in limiting reactivation and replication of latent VZV and, thus, in preventing herpes zoster and its complications. Consequently, induction of VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity and not antibody should be used as a proxy for the clinical efficacy of new formulations and uses of zoster vaccine. Prospects for improved zoster vaccines and their use in immunocompromised patients are discussed, and questions related to zoster vaccine use are addressed.

### Risk factors for herpes zoster: should people with asthma or COPD be vaccinated? [^112TxL2E]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Without vaccination, an estimated 1 in 3 individuals will develop herpes zoster (HZ) in their lifetime. Increased risk of HZ is attributed to impaired cell-mediated immunity, as observed in age-related immunosenescence or in individuals immunocompromised due to disease or immunosuppressive treatments. Most vaccination guidelines recommend HZ vaccination in all adults ≥ 50 years of age, although Shingrix ® was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in individuals aged ≥ 18 years who are or will be at increased risk of HZ due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy, followed by approval by the European Medicines Agency for use in immunocompromised individuals aged ≥ 18 years. Chronic respiratory diseases are also risk factors for HZ. A new meta-analysis reported 24% and 41% increased risks of HZ in those with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), respectively, compared with healthy controls. Asthma and COPD increase a person's risk of HZ and associated complications at any age and may be further elevated in those receiving inhaled corticosteroids. Despite the increased risks, there is evidence that HZ vaccination uptake in those aged ≥ 50 years with COPD may be lower compared with the age-matched general population, potentially indicating a lack of awareness of HZ risk factors among clinicians and patients. The 2022 Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease report recognizes that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended to vaccinate those aged ≥ 50 years against HZ, although health systems should consider the inclusion of all adults with asthma or COPD into their HZ vaccination programs. Further research into HZ vaccine efficacy/effectiveness and safety in younger populations is needed to inform vaccination guidelines.

### Transient increased risk of shingles post shingrix vaccination: self-controlled case series analysis [^116hm8zk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Following the introduction of a funded recombinant shingles (RZV, Shingrix®) vaccination program in ≥ 65 years in Australia, clinician reports of shingles presentations shortly after vaccination emerged. We investigated whether there was an increase in shingles risk immediately post RZV vaccination in South-eastern Australia.

Methods

Two independent datasets- a general practice dataset and a statewide linked dataset- were analysed separately using self-controlled case series analyses (SCCS) with 21-days post-vaccination as the risk window. The observation period was 1 January 2023 to 30 April 2025. Adults ≥ 18 years old were included, with analyses stratified by age (< 65 and ≥ 65 years) and sex. We calculated the rate of incident shingles in time periods relative to vaccination, along with attributable risk and the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Results

The primary care SCCS analysis found an 11-fold increase (Risk Incidence [RI] 10·96, 95% CI 10.34, 11.62, p < 0·0001) in shingles presentations within 21 days post-dose 1 of RZV vaccination in adults ≥ 65 in the general practice dataset only. No increase was detected in younger adults. Following dose two the risk of shingles presentations was reduced in all age groups. Vaccine recipients had an 73% reduction in shingles following 2 doses. PHN risk was not increased.

Conclusions

There is a transient increase in shingles presentations shortly after dose one of RZV vaccination in adults ≥ 65 years of age; however, these cases are likely to be mild and there is clear evidence of vaccine effectiveness after the completion of two doses.

### Use of recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^116BB9NS]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to immunization, immunocompromised adults, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to administer the second dose of recombinant zoster vaccine typically 2–6 months after the first dose. Consider administering the second dose 1–2 months after the first dose in persons being or going to be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed and who would benefit from a shorter vaccination schedule. Repeat a valid second dose at least 4 weeks after the previous dose if the second recombinant zoster vaccine dose is given sooner than 4 weeks after the first. Do not restart the vaccine series if > 6 months have elapsed since the first dose.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111KgoKG]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The results suggest that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine is superior to the live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster infection, as measured by laboratory or doctor confirmed cases and suspected cases. Owing to a lack of data, the superiority of the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine over the live attenuated vaccine in reducing the number of cases of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and post-herpetic neuralgia is inconclusive. The adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was, however, associated with more adverse events at injection sites than the live attenuated vaccine. On the basis of the limited indirect evidence available, no statistically significant differences were shown between the vaccines for serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, potential immune mediated diseases, and death. A current randomised controlled trial comparing the immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine with the live attenuated vaccine will provide direct evidence on the relative safety of the two vaccines. As such, the results of this systematic review will need to be updated with evidence from this trial, as well as any additional new trials completed after the literature search. Differences between the dosages of the vaccine were not observed, suggesting the standard doses are appropriate for clinical use.

Strengths and limitations of this study

This systematic review has several strengths. As no trials currently compare the safety and effectiveness of the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine and live attenuated vaccine directly, this systematic review tackles an important evidence gap by indirectly comparing the two available vaccines using valid meta-analysis methods to inform clinicians and policy makers. We followed international guidelines on the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and network meta-analyses, including the Cochrane Handbook, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research tool, and PRISMA statements. Several limitations do, however, relate to the included studies as they might have been affected by several types of bias, such as from inadequate reporting of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and comparability of cohorts. Also, several of the planned analyses were not conducted owing to insufficient data, such as subgroup analysis on the age of participants, network meta-regression for duration of follow-up, or analyses restricted to immunocompromised patients across all outcomes. Furthermore, asymmetry was observed in the funnel plot for the suspected herpes zoster outcome, which is likely caused by variation in study characteristics; the sample sizes ranged from 309 to 762 patients in four studies and from 13 900 to 766 330 patients in another seven studies. After excluding three trials with large standard errors and negative centred effect sizes, the results from the meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were unchanged.

Discussion

Estimating infection risk

VZV is a ubiquitous, neurotropic virus. Although primary infection has declined since the introduction of the live-attenuated vaccine (Zostavax), in 1995, the majority of adults (and the patient in this case) acquired the infection in childhood. Following the primary infection, VZV becomes latent in the dorsal roots, cranial nerves, and autonomic ganglia throughout the neuroaxis. The virus is primarily contained by T-cell–mediated immunity for much of adulthood.

Certain risk factors are associated with virus reactivation. Advancing age (> 50 years) is associated with immune senescence, which either primarily or predominantly impacts memory T cells, and results in diminished immune protection. While B-cell–derived antibodies to primary infection or vaccination may exist as surrogates for immunity, these do not necessarily convey protection as T-cell function declines. In fact, it is estimated that 50% of individuals will experience VZV reactivation by age 85 years. As a means to boost immunity in the setting of immune senescence, the CDC recommends recombinant shingles vaccine (Shingrix) for all immunocompetent patients aged 50 years and older. Our patient is older than 50 years and had not yet received the shingles vaccine. Moreover, immunosuppressive conditions from disease states such as HIV or from medications (evidenced by lymphopenia in this case) also increase the risk of VZV reactivation.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2018 [^114tV59z]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Changes in the 2018 Adult Immunization Schedule

Zoster Vaccination. On October 20, 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of RZV (SHINGRIX, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) for adults aged 50 years or older for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and its complications. On October 25, ACIP recommended the use of 1) RZV among immunocompetent adults aged 50 years or older for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications, 2) RZV among adults aged 50 years or older who previously received the zoster vaccine live (ZVL) (ZOSTAVAX, Merck and Co.), and 3) either RZV or ZVL for adults aged 60 years or older (RZV is preferred). On October 26, 2017, ACIP recommended the following in the 2018 adult immunization schedule:

Administer 2 doses of RZV 2–6 months apart to adults aged 50 years or older regardless of past episode of herpes zoster or receipt of ZVL.
Administer 2 doses of RZV 2–6 months apart to adults who previously received ZVL at least 2 months after ZVL.
For adults aged 60 years or older, administer either RZV or ZVL (RZV is preferred).

The clinical trials for RZV excluded pregnancy and confirmed or suspected immunocompromising conditions that can result from disease (e.g. malignancy, HIV infection) or therapy (e.g. cancer chemotherapy, treatment for autoimmune disorders). Therefore, no ACIP recommendation currently exists for use of RZV among pregnant women (health care providers should consider delaying administration of RZV for pregnant women) or adults with immunocompromising conditions, including HIV infection (additional discussions and recommendations by ACIP on the use of RZV in adults with immunocompromising conditions are pending).

Methods

Study design and data source

We conducted retrospective cohort studies using TriNetX US Collaborative Network, a federated EHR network with anonymised data from 120 million patients in 69 healthcare organisations in the USA. The participating healthcare organisations are a mixture of hospitals, primary care and specialist providers, including insured and uninsured patients, and both academic and non-academic centres. This implies that the sample is at least broadly representative of the American population, but generalisation beyond the USA requires replication in other cohorts. The process of data de-identification is attested by a qualified expert as defined in Section 164.514(b) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. No further ethical approval was needed. As we used anonymised, routinely collected data, no participant consent was required.

Cohorts and exposures

Three primary cohorts were defined: individuals who received only the AS01 RSV vaccine, those who received only the AS01 shingles vaccine, and those who received both vaccines (with the RSV vaccine following the shingles vaccine by a median time of 4 years). The index date for follow-up was the vaccination date (set as the date of the RSV vaccine for those who received both). The index date had to be on or after 1 May 2023, when the AS01 RSV vaccine became available in the USA. Individuals had to be aged 60 or older at the time of vaccination, aligning with the age range for which both vaccines are licensed. The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the recombinant shingles vaccine for anyone over 50 and the RSV vaccine for anyone over 60. Beneficiaries of Medicare have both vaccines covered under Part D of the programme. Others might have it covered by their health insurance or need to pay for it out of pocket.

Measles, varicella, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening in persons with HIV: Acceptable evidence of immunity against measles includes at least 1 of the following — written documentation of adequate vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or birth in the United States before 1957. It is advisable to determine anti-varicella IgG levels for patients who are unable to verify a history of chickenpox or shingles, and STI screening should be obtained as part of the initial assessment.

OTHER ZOSTER VACCINES

Both currently licensed vaccines have disadvantages: ZOSTAVAX efficacy for HZ incidence is low, compared with SHINGRIX, and the efficacy wanes over several years. In addition, as a live-attenuated vaccine, it cannot be used in severely immunocompromised patients. On the other hand, SHINGRIX requires 2 doses, separated by 2–6 months, and the potent AS01B adjuvant makes SHINGRIX more reactogenic. Furthermore, the association of GBS with SHINGRIX is of concern, although at present it is unclear if there is a causal relationship. In addition, due to significant supply shortages, most countries where SHINGRIX is licensed have yet to administer it. Thus, the development of further zoster vaccines, either based on ZVL and RZV, or on different vaccine platforms, is being pursued. Two clinical trials to assess safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of different formulations of adjuvanted VZV gE subunit vaccines are currently registered in the United States (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03820414 and NCT04210752). However, results are not yet available. A placebo-controlled trial to assess safety and efficacy of a live-attenuated VZV vaccine in healthy adults ≥ 40 yoa is currently registered in China (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04334577), but enrollment has not yet started.

The recent findings of safety and impressive efficacy of 2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-lipid vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that were granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA may lead to new mRNA vaccines for other diseases, including HZ [258, 259]. In a nonhuman primate model, an mRNA-lipid vaccine expressing VZV gE induced gE-specific antibody and CD4 + T-cell responses comparable to RZV and superior to those induced by ZVL [260]. A different adjuvanted formulation with a single-stranded RNA derived from the cricket paralysis virus is also in the early stages of development [261]. Several other zoster vaccines are also in development (see Table 2).

Key points Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent shingles. Overview Shingles, or herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash that develops on one side of the face or body. Available vaccines & manufacturer package inserts
- The FDA licensed Shingrix in 2017 to prevent shingles. CDC recommends that adults age 50 years and older receive two doses of Shingrix.
- Shingrix is the preferred vaccine to prevent shingles.
- Shingrix is the preferred vaccine to prevent shingles.
- The FDA licensed Zostavax in 2006 to prevent shingles. CDC recommends one dose of Zostavax for adults age 60 years and older. This vaccine may be used in certain cases, such as when a person prefers Zostavax or is allergic to Shingrix. Keep Reading: Shingles Vaccine Information Statements Who should & should not get the vaccine Many people should get vaccinated; others should consult with their healthcare provider first.

Common side effects Shingrix
- Pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site.
- Muscle pain.
- Tiredness.
- Headache.
- Shivering.
- Fever.
- Upset stomach. Most side effects are mild to moderate — lasting 2–3 days — and could affect normal daily activities. Side effects are more common in younger people. Zostavax
- Redness, pain, swelling, warmth, or itching at the injection site.
- Headache. Most side effects are mild to moderate, and last 1–3 days. When to call 911 Severe allergic reactions following vaccination are rare, but can be life threatening. If someone experiences symptoms of a severe allergic reaction, which can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Because the two herpes zoster vaccines are different in composition, their potential side effects can differ.

A closer look at the safety data Both Shingrix and Zostavax shingles vaccines have been shown to be safe and well tolerated. Common side effects, such as soreness and redness at the injection site, are usually mild to moderate in intensity and resolve quickly on their own. Shingrix In 8 clinical trials of more than 10, 000 participants:

- Grade 3 reactions were common after patients received Shingrix.
- About 1 out of 10 adults who received Shingrix reported grade 3 injection-site symptoms such as pain, redness, and swelling.
- About 1 out of 10 reported grade 3 systemic reactions such as myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, fever, and gastrointestinal illness.
- Most people who got Shingrix reported at least some pain at the injection site.

Zostavax
- A 2013 study showed that patients with a history of a previous shingles rash had the same side effects after Zostavax as those with no history of shingles.
- A 2012 study found a small risk for allergic reactions 1 to 7 days after Zostavax.
- In rare cases, people who got vaccinated with Zostavax experienced a blister-like rash; some were found to have been caused by the vaccine. How CDC monitors vaccine safety CDC and FDA are committed to monitoring the safety of vaccines. Once vaccines are licensed or authorized by FDA for use in the United States, CDC, FDA, and other federal agencies work together to monitor them using several safety systems.

Studies of Efficacy and Duration of Protection

One randomized, placebo-controlled trial has evaluated short-term efficacy of herpes zoster vaccine administered to adults aged 50 through 59 years. This study of 22,439 adults in this age group showed a vaccine efficacy of 69.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 54.1%–80.6%) for the prevention of herpes zoster over a mean follow up period of 1.3 years. Efficacy for prevention of PHN and long-term vaccine efficacy in this age group were not studied.

Two studies have evaluated the short-term efficacy of the zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 60 years. The shingles prevention study (SPS), a randomized controlled trial, followed 38,546 subjects for up to 4.9 years after vaccination (median = 3.1 years) and found a vaccine efficacy of 51.3% (CI = 44.2%–57.6%) for prevention of herpes zoster and 66.5% (CI = 47.5%–79.2%) for prevention of PHN. The short-term persistence substudy (STPS) followed a subset of 14,270 SPS subjects primarily 4 to 7 years after vaccination and found a vaccine efficacy of 39.6% (CI = 18.2%–55.5%) for prevention of herpes zoster and 60.1% (CI = −9.8%–86.7%) for prevention of PHN. The point estimates for vaccine efficacy for prevention of herpes zoster by year after vaccination from the combined SPS and STPS studies decreased from 62.0% (CI = 49.6%–71.6%) in the first year after vaccination to 43.1% (CI = 5.1%–66.5%) in year 5. The 95% CIs around the point estimates for years 6 (30.6%) and 7 (52.8%) included zero; therefore vaccine protection could not be demonstrated after year 5. Vaccine efficacy for prevention of PHN decreased from 83.4% (CI = 56.7%–95.0%) in year 1 to 69.8 (CI = 27.3%–89.1%) in year 2. Estimates for years 3 through 7 after vaccination were not statistically significantly different from zero, although point estimates were generally higher compared with estimates of vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1157ahXc]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

We calculated the 95% prediction interval for all network meta-analysis estimates; this statistic predicts the interval within which the results of a future study might lie. To examine the hierarchy of vaccines, we used the Surface Under the Cumulative RAnking curves, along with the 95% credible intervalsand plotted these using the rank heat plot. To examine potential publication bias and small study effects, we produced an adjusted funnel plot for outcomes including at least 10 studies. To examine the dose effects of the vaccine, we applied a hierarchical model — the exchangeable subnodes model with subnode consistency.

To examine the robustness of results, we planned several additional analyses a priori: sensitivity analysis restricted to studies with a low risk of bias, subgroup analysis of age (eg, 50–64 years v ≥ 65 years), health status (healthy adults with no immune compromising conditions referred to as immunocompetent versus adults with at least one immune comprising condition referred to as immunocompromised), sex (women versus men), herpes zoster status (previous herpes zoster infection versus herpes zoster naïve), herpes zoster ophthalmicus (previous herpes zoster ophthalmicus versus none), vaccine status (previous vaccination with herpes zoster live attenuated vaccine versus vaccine naïve), and study design (randomised controlled trials versus non-randomised studies versus randomised controlled trials+non-randomised studies). When data on 10 or more studies were available we examined the duration of follow-up and age distribution through network meta-regression analysis, which was only possible for two outcomes: adverse events at injection sites and suspected herpes zoster. We only considered additional analyses when the number of studies was greater than the number of treatments for each outcome.

GRADE appraisal

Technical leads and clinical expert members of the NACI Working Group graded the quality (or certainty) of the available evidence. The results of the GRADE assessments are in the report released by NACI.

Patient and public involvement

No patients or the public were involved in setting the research question or outcome measures, nor were they involved in the design and implementation of the study. This is because the commissioning agency and the primary knowledge user, NACI, did not allow for patient engagement, as they had an expedited timeline to make policy decisions on herpes zoster vaccines.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^111TCiCg]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Antiviral prophylaxis with tenofovir or entecavir is effective in preventing IST-related HBV relapse in patients at risk. Thus, in the few HBV sAg positive patients who have AIH, routine prophylaxis during IST is recommended. In the larger number with prior but resolved HBV (sAg and DNA negative, cAb positive), mostfavour HBV DNA monitoring at 1–3 monthly intervals while patients remain on > 10 mg prednisolone per day, with antiviral therapy if HBV DNA levels rise. Routine antiviral prophylaxis might be needed in patients receiving high-dose steroids (> 40 mg/day), receiving B cell-depleting therapies and those for whom regular HBV DNA monitoring is unfeasible. A similar strategy seems reasonable for budesonide therapy.

Severe varicella infection might occur in previously unexposed patients receiving steroidsThe prevalence of varicella antibodies (indicating prior infection) is over 80% even in those not reporting prior varicella infection. However, patients starting treatment for AIH should be advised to avoid people with chicken pox or with shingles on exposed regions. Those reporting recent exposure should (even if also reporting prior exposure) be tested for varicella antibodies, and if absent (or if results are unavailable within 7 days), should have oral antiviral prophylaxis from days 7 to 14 post exposure. For further details, see references.

Patients starting steroids should also (if not immunised) be offered the COVID-19, influenzavirus and pneumococcalvaccines. Also, if under 25 or if gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and under 45, human papilomavaccines and if over 50, the shingles (herpes zoster) recombinant vaccines.

Children with acute liver disease should have viral aetiologies excluded and children with AIH should receive their normal vaccinations, including HBV and HAV.

Once receiving steroid and/or thiopurine therapy, live vaccines are not recommended and so, whenever possible, (in both adults and children) routine immunisations should be up to date before starting IST.

### Recombinant zoster vaccine (shingrix): real-world effectiveness in the first 2 years post-licensure [^114LSHkv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Shingrix (recombinant zoster vaccine) was licensed to prevent herpes zoster, dispensed as 2 doses given 2–6 months apart among adults aged ≥ 50 years. Clinical trials yielded efficacy of > 90% for confirmed herpes zoster, but post-market performance has not been evaluated. Efficacy of a single dose and a delayed second dose and efficacy among persons with autoimmune or immunosuppressive conditions have not been studied. We aimed to assess post-market vaccine effectiveness of Shingrix.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study among Medicare Part D community-dwelling beneficiaries aged > 65 years. Herpes zoster was identified using a medical office visit diagnosis with treatment, and postherpetic neuralgia was identified using a validated algorithm. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to improve cohort balance and marginal structural models to estimate hazard ratios.

Results

We found a vaccine effectiveness of 70.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 68.6–71.5) and 56.9% (95% CI, 55.0–58.8) for 2 and 1 doses, respectively. The 2-dose vaccine effectiveness was not significantly lower for beneficiaries aged > 80 years, for second doses received at ≥ 180 days, or for individuals with autoimmune conditions. The vaccine was also effective among individuals with immunosuppressive conditions. Two-dose vaccine effectiveness against postherpetic neuralgia was 76.0% (95% CI, 68.4–81.8).

Conclusions

This large real-world observational study of the effectiveness of Shingrix demonstrates the benefit of completing the 2-dose regimen. Second doses administered beyond the recommended 6 months did not impair effectiveness. Our effectiveness estimates were lower than the clinical trials estimates, likely due to differences in outcome specificity.

### ACG clinical guideline: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^113CD6tn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — herpes zoster vaccination in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) states that adults with IBD over the age of 50 should consider vaccination against herpes zoster, including certain subgroups of immunosuppressed patients, noted as a Strong recommendation, with low level of evidence. Zoster vaccine is administered subcutaneously as a single dose, and the minimum potency of zoster vaccine is at least 14 times the potency of varicella vaccine. Zostavax was licensed in 2006 and recommended by the ACIP in 2008 for prevention among adults aged ≥ 60 years; the FDA approved Zostavax in 2011 for adults aged 50 through 59 years, although the ACIP elected not to recommend vaccination for individuals for 50–59. Patients with a history of zoster are eligible to receive the shingles vaccine, and it is not recommended to ask about prior varicella infection or to check serologic titers before administration.

### Influenza vaccine uptake in the year after concurrent vs separate influenza and zoster immunization [^115tu7Ub]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite its being universally recommended, fewer than half of US adults receive an influenza vaccine each year. Among those who choose not to get vaccinated, 3 in 10 cite concerns about potential side effects. This vaccine hesitancy based on perceived side effects exists despite evidence that rates of systemic side effects (eg, fatigue, myalgias, headaches, and fever or chills) are comparable among patients receiving the influenza vaccine and those receiving a placebo. Only local injection site symptoms (eg, pain, redness, or swelling) are known to be caused by the influenza vaccine.

By contrast, the recombinant varicella zoster vaccine used to prevent shingles is often highly reactogenic, causing systemic reactions in half of patients compared with one-quarter of patients receiving a placebo. The recombinant zoster vaccine, approved in 2017, has now replaced the live attenuated zoster vaccine, which caused fewer side effects but was far less effective in preventing shingles among older adults. The recombinant vaccine is now recommended for most adults aged 50 years or older as a 1-time, 2-dose series.

Coadministration of vaccines is common in medical offices and pharmacies because patients are often due for multiple vaccines at the same time, and administration of more than 1 vaccine is not generally thought to undermine efficacy. A single randomized clinical trialspecifically evaluated coadministration of the influenza and recombinant zoster vaccines and found similar immunogenicity compared with separate administration of the 2 vaccines. However, self-reported local and systemic side effects were more common after the zoster vaccine than the influenza vaccine and were even more frequent when the 2 vaccines were administered together.

If the zoster vaccine is due at the same time as other recommended vaccines, including the annual influenza vaccine, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends simultaneous administration. However, given the different reactogenicity of the zoster and influenza vaccines and the fact that so many Americans avoid the influenza vaccine because of concerns about side effects, receiving the 2 vaccines together could lower patients' willingness to receive influenza vaccines in subsequent years because of misattribution of the systemic side effects caused by the zoster vaccine to the influenza vaccine. We investigated whether concurrent administration of the influenza and zoster vaccines was associated with lower adherence to a subsequent influenza vaccine compared with separate administration of the 2 vaccines.

### Avoiding rash decisions about zoster vaccination: insights from cost-effectiveness evidence [^116NoC7D]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

de Boer and colleagues present a cost-effectiveness analysis based in the Netherlands of two vaccines available for the prevention of herpes zoster. Zostavax® was the first vaccine available for the prevention of herpes zoster in older adults. A live-attenuated vaccine, Zostavax is not free of limitations, which include a relatively low efficacy that wanes over time and its contraindication among immunocompromised individuals. The recently available adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine Shingrix® overcomes some of these limitations. The herpes zoster subunit vaccine is more efficacious than Zostavax, and it can be administered to immunosuppressed individuals. However, the herpes zoster subunit vaccine is considerably costlier and requires a booster injection. In order to clarify the value of each vaccine, de Boer and colleagues compare the cost-effectiveness of no vaccination, and of vaccination with Zostavax or the herpes zoster subunit vaccine in four cohorts of older adults from the perspective of the Netherlands. Whereas neither vaccine was cost-effective under the willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per quality-adjusted life year, the authors find the herpes zoster subunit vaccine to be cost-effective in some scenarios under a €50,000 per quality-adjusted life year threshold.

### Assessing herpes zoster vaccine efficacy in patients with diabetes: a community-based cohort study [^116V6mPx]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of herpes zoster (HZ) vaccines in patients with diabetes over the age of 50 remains an active area of research. Utilizing a real-world database from the US community, this study spanning from 2006 to 2023, aimed to evaluate the impact of HZ vaccination on newly diagnosed diabetes patients who received an HZ vaccination within 1 year of diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were established to omit patients with immune deficiencies. The cohort consisted of 53885 patients, with an average age of 63.5 years, including 43% females and 58% whites. After implementing 1:1 propensity score matching for age, sex, race, comorbidities, diabetes medication, and hemoglobin A1c to ensure comparability, the study population was further stratified into four groups: N1 comparing any HZ vaccination to non-HZ vaccination (53882 matched pairs), N2 for Shingrix versus non-HZ vaccination (16665 matched pairs), N3 for Zostavax versus non-HZ vaccination (12058 matched pairs), and N4 for Shingrix versus Zostavax (11721 matched pairs). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed a hazard ratio (HR) for HZ incidence post any HZ vaccination of 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83–1.01). Additional analyses yielded HRs of 1.12 (95% CI: 0.93–1.34) for Shingrix versus non-HZ vaccine, 1.02 (95% CI: 0.86–1.20) for Zostavax versus non-HZ vaccine, and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.87–1.29) for Shingrix versus Zostavax. Subgroup analyses across age, sex, and follow-up duration also showed no significant differences. These findings underscore the lack of a significant benefit from HZ vaccination in newly diagnosed diabetes patients aged over 50, highlighting the necessity for further prospective research.

### Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults [^115bk6o9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is a neurocutaneous disease caused by the reactivation of the virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). After resolution of the varicella episode, the virus can remain latent in the sensitive dorsal ganglia of the spine. Years later, with declining immunity, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can reactivate and cause herpes zoster, an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and significantly compromise the quality of life of the affected person. The natural process of ageing is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity, and this predisposes older adults to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of the VZV activates specific T-cell production avoiding viral reactivation. Two types of herpes zoster vaccines are currently available. One of them is the single-dose live attenuated zoster vaccine (LZV), which contains the same live attenuated virus used in the chickenpox vaccine, but it has over 14-fold more plaque-forming units of the attenuated virus per dose. The other is the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) which does not contain the live attenuated virus, but rather a small fraction of the virus that cannot replicate but can boost immunogenicity. The recommended schedule for the RZV is two doses two months apart. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010, and updated in 2012, 2016, and 2019.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.

Search Methods

For this 2022 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2022, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1948 to October 2022), Embase (2010 to October 2022), CINAHL (1981 to October 2022), LILACS (1982 to October 2022), and three trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included studies involving healthy older adults (mean age 60 years or older). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine (any dose and potency) versus any other type of intervention (e.g. varicella vaccine, antiviral medication), placebo, or no intervention (no vaccine). Outcomes were cumulative incidence of herpes zoster, adverse events (death, serious adverse events, systemic reactions, or local reaction occurring at any time after vaccination), and dropouts.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included two new studies involving 1736 participants in this update. The review now includes a total of 26 studies involving 90,259 healthy older adults with a mean age of 63.7 years. Only three studies assessed the cumulative incidence of herpes zoster in groups that received vaccines versus placebo. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries in Europe and North America and included healthy Caucasians (understood to be white participants) aged 60 years or over with no immunosuppressive comorbidities. Two studies were conducted in Japan and one study was conducted in the Republic of Korea. Sixteen studies used LZV. Ten studies tested an RZV. The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate, which indicates that the intervention probably works. Most data for the primary outcome (cumulative incidence of herpes zoster) and secondary outcomes (adverse events and dropouts) came from studies that had a low risk of bias and included a large number of participants. The cumulative incidence of herpes zoster at up to three years of follow-up was lower in participants who received the LZV (one dose subcutaneously) than in those who received placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56; risk difference (RD) 2%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; moderate-certainty evidence) in the largest study, which included 38,546 participants. There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups for serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21) or deaths (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; moderate-certainty evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher cumulative incidence of one or more adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.11; RD 23%; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.3) and injection site adverse events (RR 3.73, 95% CI 1.93 to 7.21; RD 28%; NNTH 3.6; moderate-certainty evidence) of mild to moderate intensity. These data came from four studies with 6980 participants aged 60 years or older. Two studies (29,311 participants for safety evaluation and 22,022 participants for efficacy evaluation) compared RZV (two doses intramuscularly, two months apart) versus placebo. Participants who received the new vaccine had a lower cumulative incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years follow-up (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.23; RD 3%; NNTB 33; moderate-certainty evidence), probably indicating a favourable profile of the intervention. There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups in cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03) or deaths (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; moderate-certainty evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher cumulative incidence of adverse events, any systemic symptom (RR 2.23, 95% CI 2.12 to 2.34; RD 33%; NNTH 3.0), and any local symptom (RR 6.89, 95% CI 6.37 to 7.45; RD 67%; NNTH 1.5). Although most participants reported that their symptoms were of mild to moderate intensity, the risk of dropouts (participants not returning for the second dose, two months after the first dose) was higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; RD 1%; NNTH 100, moderate-certainty evidence). Only one study reported funding from a non-commercial source (a university research foundation). All other included studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies. We did not conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: LZV (single dose) and RZV (two doses) are probably effective in preventing shingles disease for at least three years. To date, there are no data to recommend revaccination after receiving the basic schedule for each type of vaccine. Both vaccines produce systemic and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity. The conclusions did not change in relation to the previous version of the systematic review.

Zoster Vaccine Recombinant, Adjuvanted (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) is a 2-dose (0.5 mL each) subunit vaccine containing recombinant glycoprotein E in combination with adjuvant (AS01 B) that was licensed in the United States for prevention of herpes zoster for adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2017* (1). On July 23, 2021, the FDA expanded the indication for recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) to include adults aged ≥ 18 years who are or will be at increased risk for herpes zoster because of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy (2). On October 20, 2021, ACIP recommended 2 doses of RZV for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications in adults aged ≥ 19 years † who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed because of disease or therapy. RZV is the first herpes zoster vaccine approved for use in immunocompromised persons. With moderate to high vaccine efficacy and an acceptable safety profile, RZV has the potential to prevent considerable herpes zoster incidence and related complications. This report updates previous ACIP recommendations for the prevention of herpes zoster (1,3).

In 2006, zoster vaccine live was recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years. In 2011, zoster vaccine live was approved for use but not recommended for adults aged 50–59 years. This study assessed zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged 50–59 years and ≥ 60 years.

Methods

Data from the 2013–2017 National Health Interview Surveys were analyzed in 2019 to estimate national zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 50 years. State-specific zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 50 years was assessed using 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data.

Results

Among adults aged 50–59 years, zoster vaccine live coverage was 5.7% in 2017, ranging from 4% to 6% during 2013–2017 (test for trend, p > 0.05). Zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged 50–59 years ranged from 5.8% in Pennsylvania to 14.7% in South Dakota. By 2017, zoster vaccine live was received by 34.9% of adults aged ≥ 60 years, a significant increase from 24.2% in 2013. Zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 60 years in 2017 ranged from 26.0% in Mississippi to 51.8% in Vermont. In 2017, major characteristics significantly associated with increased likelihood of zoster vaccine live vaccination among adults aged 50–59 years and ≥ 60 years were older age, having 4 to 9 physician contacts in the past 12 months, and having a usual place for health care.

Conclusions

This study provides an assessment of zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 50 years before the newly recommended recombinant zoster vaccine came into widespread use. Providers should routinely assess adults' vaccination status and strongly recommend or offer needed vaccines to their patients.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114bPkGF]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster vaccination — one U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine is available for prevention in immunocompetent adults. In 2017, a subunit vaccine containing recombinant VZV glycoprotein E (gE) and adjuvant AS01B, the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix), was FDA approved and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to prevent herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years, given on a 2-dose schedule. Pivotal Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving > 30,000 participants aged ≥ 50 years showed vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster of 97.2% overall and 91.3% in those aged ≥ 70 years. The most common solicited adverse reactions were pain (78% of recipients), myalgia (45%), and fatigue (45%), with Grade 3 injection site reactions reported in 9.4% of vaccine recipients.

Results

Literature search

After screening 2037 titles and abstracts and 175 full text articles, 27 studiesproviding data on 2 044 504 patients, and 18 companion reports, met the eligibility criteria (fig 1). Twenty two studieswere included in the statistical analysis. The remaining five studiescompared the same vaccine by routes of vaccination, handling of the vaccines, storage of the vaccines, or by time between doses (see summary in appendix S6). Of the included studies, two were unpublished trial registry data. All were reported in English. Twelve authors were contacted for additional clarification or missing data and nine responded with data clarifications but no additional data.

Study and patient characteristics

The 27 studies were published between 1998 and 2017: nine in North America (33%), five in Europe (19%), two in Asia (7%), and 11 across several geographical regions (41%) (table 2, also see appendix S7). Twenty three of the trials were conducted across multiple study centres (74%) and 22 studies used a randomised controlled trial study design (81%). The average study duration was 30.9 months (SD 22.3 months). The live attenuated vaccine was the most commonly examined vaccine type (70%) and the incidence of suspected or confirmed herpes zoster was the most commonly examined outcome (81%).

Table 2
Characteristics of the 27 included studies

Twenty three studies (85%) included patients who were immunocompetent, and 22 studies (81%) included a sample consisting of more than 50% women (table 3, also see appendix S8). Twenty four studies (89%) included patients with no history of herpes zoster, and 18 studies included participants with documented varicella infection (67%).

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^117AgzK9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Low credibility.

These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (zoster) (i.e., shingles) and its sequelae, which was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 25, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of zoster and its sequelae, describes the zoster vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use among adults aged ≥ 60 years in the United States. Zoster is a localized, generally painful cutaneous eruption that occurs most frequently among older adults and immunocompromised persons. It is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) decades after initial VZV infection is established. Approximately one in three persons will develop zoster during their lifetime, resulting in an estimated 1 million episodes in the United States annually. A common complication of zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a chronic, often debilitating pain condition that can last months or even years. The risk for PHN in patients with zoster is 10%-18%. Another complication of zoster is eye involvement, which occurs in 10%-25% of zoster episodes and can result in prolonged or permanent pain, facial scarring, and loss of vision. Approximately 3% of patients with zoster are hospitalized; many of these episodes involved persons with one or more immunocompromising conditions. Deaths attributable to zoster are uncommon among persons who are not immunocompromised. Prompt treatment with the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir decreases the severity and duration of acute pain from zoster. Additional pain control can be achieved in certain patients by supplementing antiviral agents with corticosteroids and with analgesics. Established PHN can be managed in certain patients with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and other agents. Licensed zoster vaccine is a lyophilized preparation of a live, attenuated strain of VZV, the same strain used in the varicella vaccines. However, its minimum potency is at least 14-times the potency of single-antigen varicella vaccine. In a large clinical trial, zoster vaccine was partially efficacious at preventing zoster. It also was partially efficacious at reducing the severity and duration of pain and at preventing PHN among those developing zoster. Zoster vaccine is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 60 years who have no contraindications, including persons who report a previous episode of zoster or who have chronic medical conditions. The vaccine should be offered at the patient's first clinical encounter with his or her health-care provider. It is administered as a single 0.65 mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm. A booster dose is not licensed for the vaccine. Zoster vaccination is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing PHN, or to treat ongoing PHN. Before administration of zoster vaccine, patients do not need to be asked about their history of varicella (chickenpox) or to have serologic testing conducted to determine varicella immunity.

### Update on recommendations for use of herpes zoster vaccine [^115ydZbW]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax [Merck & Co, Inc.]) was licensed in 2006 and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2008 for prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and its complications among adults aged ≥ 60 years. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of Zostavax in 2011 for adults aged 50 through 59 years based on a large study of safety and efficacy in this age group. ACIP initially considered the use of herpes zoster vaccine among adults aged 50 through 59 years in June 2011, but declined to recommend the vaccine in this age group, citing shortages of Zostavax and limited data on long-term protection afforded by herpes zoster vaccine. In October 2013, ACIP reviewed the epidemiology of herpes zoster and its complications, herpes zoster vaccine supply, short-term vaccine efficacy in adults aged 50 through 59 years, short- and long- term vaccine efficacy and effectiveness in adults aged ≥ 60 years, an updated cost-effectiveness analysis, and deliberations of the ACIP herpes zoster work group, all of which are summarized in this report. No vote was taken, and ACIP maintained its current recommendation that herpes zoster vaccine be routinely recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years. Meeting minutes are available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/meetings-info.html.

### Time to talk to adults with rheumatic diseases about herpes zoster vaccination [^113hBzNY]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

The 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations on herpes zoster vaccination for adult patients with rheumatic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases stated that these patients are at increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population. However, these recommendations lack clarity and specificity and are cautiously phrased, which might cause physicians to underestimate the importance of herpes zoster vaccination for these patients, potentially resulting in suboptimal protection. Since the formulation of the 2019 EULAR guidelines, new data on herpes zoster in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases have been published. Moreover, a recombinant herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix) has become available that can be given to these patients in a more accessible manner than the original live-attenuated vaccine (Zostavax). Here, we evaluate existing evidence on risk factors for herpes zoster and the safety and efficacy of the recombinant vaccine in patients with rheumatic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and discuss the necessity of herpes zoster vaccination for these patients.

### Vaccines for preventing infections in adults with solid tumours [^114YCf8U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

Notably, the ASCO guidelines addressed a research question similar to ours by systematically reviewing studies published between 2013 and 2023 (Kamboj 2024). They focused on adults with solid tumours or haematological malignancies, including long‐term survivors and those who received haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, evaluating routine vaccines listed on the CDC immunisation schedules as well as travel vaccines. Their comparisons included placebo, different vaccines, or varying vaccination strategies. The outcomes assessed encompassed risk of infection, disease severity, mortality, immune responses, and vaccine safety (Kamboj 2024).

In terms of herpes zoster vaccines, Kamboj 2024 identified a study concerning solid tumours reporting adverse events (Vink 2019), but did not include Mullane 2013 and Mullane 2019 as the guidelines focused on recombinant zoster vaccines (RZV). RZV, commonly known by its brand name Shingrix, is a recombinant form of glycoprotein E from the varicella‐zoster virus, which is a key protein involved in the virus's ability to infect cells (Vink 2019). Our findings on herpes zoster vaccines align with those of a network meta‐analysis conducted by Xia 2022, which reported that RZV demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo in immunocompromised individuals, achieving 60% efficacy (95% CI 49% to 69%). Adverse events associated with RZV were primarily related to injection site reactions and systemic effects, with no increased risk of serious adverse events or death. Kamboj 2024 indicated that "grade three solicited general adverse events" (i.e. moderate‐to‐severe adverse events actively monitored during the study), were reported by adults with cancer in both the vaccine and placebo arms but were more prevalent in the vaccine arms. This finding is consistent with our observations regarding the safety profile of herpes zoster vaccines.

### Recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of herpes zoster vaccines [^114NAcr6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

On October 20, 2017, Zoster Vaccine Recombinant, Adjuvanted (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline, [GSK] Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), a 2-dose, subunit vaccine containing recombinant glycoprotein E in combination with a novel adjuvant (AS01 B), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of herpes zoster in adults aged ≥ 50 years. The vaccine consists of 2 doses (0.5 mL each), administered intramuscularly, 2–6 months apart (1). On October 25, 2017, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) for use in immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years.

- Tdap: The information for wound management has been updated: "Wound management: Persons with 3 or more doses of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine: For clean and minor wounds, administer Tdap or Td if more than 10 years since last dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine; for all other wounds, administer Tdap or Td if more than 5 years since last dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine. Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, use Tdap. For detailed information, see".

- Zoster vaccination: References have been removed to previous receipt of ZVL (zoster vaccine live or Zostavax) dose when considering vaccination of persons aged ≥ 50 years with RZV (recombinant zoster vaccines or Shingrix) and the bullet about ZVL for persons aged ≥ 60 years was deleted because ZVL is no longer available in the U.S. market.

### Zostavax: a subcutaneous vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster [^1132VMnf]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Herpes zoster (HZ) occurs as a reactivation of dormant varicella zoster virus (VZV), and occurs more frequently in the aging population or the immunocompromised due to waning cell-mediated immunity. Up to 1 million cases of HZ are reported annually in the USA with an estimated 10–30% of the population being affected by shingles in their lifetime. HZ is a debilitating illness, and while mortality is low, morbidity remains a significant cause for concern with prevention efforts aimed at reducing VZV reactivation and its complications. The HZ vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for individuals aged 50-years or older. However, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices recommends the vaccine in individuals aged 60-years or older.

Areas Covered

Recent literature investigating the efficacy and indications of live attenuated zoster vaccine.

Expert Opinion

Live attenuated zoster vaccine is safe and efficacious in preventing HZ and decreasing the morbidity associated with postherpetic neuralgia. The vaccine is FDA approved in individuals aged 50-years or older but further studies are warranted to investigate the vaccine's efficacy in immunosuppressed and immunocompromised patients.

### Risk factors for herpes zoster: should people with asthma or COPD be vaccinated? [^114RsV9Z]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendation of RZV vaccines for asthma and COPD populations

The EMA and FDA recently expanded the RZV indication to include subjects ≥ 18 years of age who are at increased risk of HZ; the FDA specifically referenced those with immunosuppression or immunodeficiency caused by known disease or therapy. Similarly, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends RVZ in immunodeficient or immunosuppressed adults ≥ 19 years of age, regardless of previous history of HZ infection or previous receipt of zoster vaccine. There are other groups of adults aged 18–49 years at higher risk of HZ; however, the EMA Shingrix product information highlights the limited data in these populations and in individuals with a history of HZ.

Table 1 outlines country-specific guidelines on the use of RZV. Guidelines for the USA, Germany and Italy recommend the use of RZV in adults ≥ 50 years of age, including in those with chronic conditions. RZV is to be incorporated into the 2022 Swiss vaccination plan, with recommendations outlined in a bulletin published in 2021. Their recommendations are divided into three categories: immunocompetent adults ≥ 65 years of age, adults ≥ 50 years of age with current or future (cellular) immunodeficiency associated with an increased risk for HZ, and adults ≥ 18 years of age with a current severe immunodeficiency or an immunosuppressive treatment in the foreseeable future. Importantly, the group of adults ≥ 50 years of age includes those with asthma or COPD. The German recommendations also mention COPD and asthma, which are listed among the risk groups in the ≥ 50 age category recommendation for RZV. The Comité sur l'immunisation du Québec (CIQ) published updated recommendations on RZV for those 18–49 years of age and adults with chronic disease, to complement the recommendations already in place for all those ≥ 50 years of age. They recommend RZV in immunosuppressed people ≥ 18 years of age, including chronically ill people who meet the immunosuppression criteria. These criteria include those receiving immunosuppressive medications, such as corticosteroids. Importantly, the CIQ also suggests the vaccine could be considered in those ≥ 18 years of age with chronic diseases who are at higher risk of HZ, who may not be considered immunocompromised. Within this consideration they mention COPD and asthma as chronic diseases known to increase the risk of HZ.

### Serologic immunogenicity and safety of herpes zoster subunit vaccine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving Janus kinase inhibitors [^115BSr8A]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

A non-randomized clinical trial was performed (NCT03886038). Ethical approval was granted by the regional Ethical Review Authority at Lund University in 2011 (Dnr 2011/341) and complemented in 2018 (Dnr 2018/240). Study participants received written and oral information about the study and provided written informed consent before study inclusion.

Study participants

Adult patients with RA in the Department of Rheumatology, Skåne University Hospital, Lund and Malmö, Sweden receiving JAKi treatment for ≥ 3 months (and two patients planning to start JAKi treatment) were consecutively offered study inclusion between March 2019 and February 2022. Adult volunteers with no diagnosis of rheumatic disorders or other conditions requiring immunosuppressive treatment served as controls. Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, pregnancy, having received the live zoster vaccine in the previous 5 years, known allergies to previous vaccines or vaccine components and current fever or infection.

Study protocol

Study participants received two doses of the HZ/su vaccine (Shingrix; 50 µg recombinant VZV gE antigen mixed with AS01B adjuvant; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) administered intramuscularly ≈2 months apart (first dose at t = 0, second dose at t ≈ 2 months). Blood samples were drawn immediately before the first dose (t = 0) and ≈6 weeks post-vaccination (t ≈ 3.5 months). Patients were encouraged to keep RA medications [including glucocorticoids (GCs)] unchanged, if possible, during the study period (from first vaccine dose until leaving post-vaccination blood samples). In case of a need for medication changes, patients were asked to report these to the researchers.

### Herpes zoster vaccines [^112yKzDW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Recombinant Zoster Vaccine

Recombinant zoster vaccine (SHINGRIX) has been approved in 35 countries and is available in 8 countries (including the US) (GlaxoSmithKline, written personal communication, February 8, 2021) (Supplementary Table 2). In 2018, the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization updated its HZ vaccine recommendations to provide a preferential recommendation for RZV over ZVL [256]. However, the recommendation still remains that ZVL may be considered for immunocompetent persons in whom RZV is contraindicated, unavailable, or inaccessible.

Recombinant zoster vaccine (SHINGRIX) was approved in Europe (EU countries) and Japan in March 2018, in China in May 2019, in New Zealand in Jan 2020, in Hong Kong in October 2020, and in Singapore in January 2021. Austria recommends administering 2 doses of SHINGRIX at least 2 months apart to all adults > 50 yoa, independent of immune status. In severely immunocompromised persons, off-label administration of RZV may be considered. However, RZV is not currently available in Austria, but it may be ordered through pharmacies in other European countries [248]. The German Standing Committee on Vaccination recommends 2 doses of SHINGRIX 2 to 6 months apart in the following: healthy adults ≥ 60 yoa; immunocompromised adults ≥ 50 yoa; and adults ≥ 50 yoa with underlying diseases such as diabetes, RA, IBD, COPD, and asthma [257]. The difficulty producing large amounts of SHINGRIX, the requirement for 2 doses, and the local and systemic AEs are significant barriers to the universal adoption of RZV.

### Herpes zoster vaccines [^115N32gf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Herpes zoster (HZ) affects approximately 1 in 3 persons in their lifetime, and the risk of HZ increases with increasing age. The most common, debilitating complication of HZ is the chronic neuropathic pain of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Two herpes zoster vaccines, a live-attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (zoster vaccine live [ZVL]; ZOSTAVAX [Merck]) and an adjuvanted VZV glycoprotein E (gE) subunit vaccine (recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV]; SHINGRIX [GlaxoSmithKline]) are licensed for the prevention of HZ and PHN in healthy older adults. The safety and efficacy of both vaccines has been demonstrated in clinical trials in immunocompetent adults and in selected immunocompromised persons and persons with immune-mediated diseases. Numerous real-world effectiveness studies have confirmed the safety and effectiveness of both ZVL and RZV. Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is more effective for prevention of HZ than ZVL. Recombinant zoster vaccine is nonreplicating and is thus safe in immunocompromised persons. Additional zoster vaccines are in different stages of development. Wider distribution of safe and effective zoster vaccines will improve the health and well being of the rapidly growing population of older adults around the world.

### Shingrix: the new adjuvanted recombinant herpes zoster vaccine [^115sZVnF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of the herpes zoster subunit vaccine (HZ/su) for use in adult patients for the prevention of shingles.

Data Sources

A literature search through PubMed was conducted (June 2008 to October 2017) using the terms shingles vaccine and varicella zoster virus. References from retrieved articles and the prescribing information were also reviewed for any additional material.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

The literature search was limited to human studies published in English. Randomized controlled, multicenter trials were reviewed and included to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HZ/su. Literature on the epidemiology and pathology of herpes zoster virus infections and recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

HZ/su is a new adjuvanted recombinant vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of herpes zoster in adults 50 years of age and older. HZ/su significantly reduced the risk of developing herpes zoster by more than 90% as compared with placebo and displayed a comparable adverse effect profile. The most common local adverse events were injection site pain, redness, and swelling, and the most common systemic adverse events were myalgia, fatigue, and headache. The ACIP recommends the routine use of HZ/su as the preferred vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults 50 years of age and older.

Conclusions

Based on published immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety data, as well as the recent recommendations by the ACIP, HZ/su should be included on both hospital and community pharmacy formularies and recommended to all immunocompetent patients older than 50 years to prevent herpes zoster.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114X1sFy]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Laboratory or doctor confirmed herpes zoster

Five randomised controlled trials including 90 605 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were included in the network meta-analysis of laboratory or doctor confirmed cases of herpes zoster. The adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was statistically superior to placebo (vaccine efficacy 94%, 95% credible interval 79% to 98%) and the live attenuated vaccine (85%, 31% to 98%), whereas the live attenuated vaccine was not statistically different from placebo (table 4 and table 5). These results were similar in the sensitivity analysis restricted to immunocompetent patients only (see appendix S14). Four randomised controlled trials were included in the dose effects analysis, and only the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was statistically superior to placebo (see appendix S23), which was consistent in additional network meta-analysis restricted to four randomised controlled trials including patients with no history of herpes zoster, and restricted to four randomised controlled trials with low risk of bias on random sequence generation. Additional analyses based on all study designs (five randomised controlled trials and one cohort study) and the efficacy comparison using informative priors(five randomised controlled trials) found that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was statistically superior to placebo and the live attenuated vaccine, and that the live attenuated vaccine was statistically superior to placebo.

### The safety and immunologic effectiveness of the live varicella-zoster vaccine in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy: a randomized controlled trial [^115SxPEF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The safety and effectiveness of live virus vaccines, such as the varicella-zoster vaccine, are unknown in patients with inflammatory diseases receiving immunomodulatory therapy such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis).

Objective

To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the live attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL) in patients receiving TNFis.

Design

Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02538341).

Setting

Academic and community-based rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology practices.

Patients

Adults aged 50 years or older receiving TNFis for any indication.

Intervention

Random assignment to ZVL versus placebo.

Measurements

Glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) from serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells measured at baseline and 6 weeks after vaccination. Suspected varicella infection or herpes zoster was clinically assessed using digital photographs and polymerase chain reaction on vesicular fluid.

Results

Between March 2015 and December 2018, 617 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ZVL (n = 310) or placebo (n = 307) at 33 centers. Mean age was 62.7 years (SD, 7.5); 66.1% of participants were female, 90% were White, 8.2% were Black, and 5.9% were Hispanic. The most common TNFi indications were rheumatoid arthritis (57.6%) and psoriatic arthritis (24.1%); TNFi medications were adalimumab (32.7%), infliximab (31.3%), etanercept (21.2%), golimumab (9.1%), and certolizumab (5.7%). Concomitant therapies included methotrexate (48.0%) and oral glucocorticoids (10.5%). Through week 6, no cases of confirmed varicella infection were found; cumulative incidence of varicella infection or shingles was 0.0% (95% CI, 0.0% to 1.2%). At 6 weeks, compared with baseline, the mean increases in geometric mean fold rise as measured by gpELISA and ELISpot were 1.33 percentage points (CI, 1.17 to 1.51 percentage points) and 1.39 percentage points (CI, 1.07 to 1.82 percentage points), respectively.

Limitation

Potentially limited generalizability to patients receiving other types of immunomodulators.

Conclusion

This trial informs safety concerns related to use of live virus vaccines in patients receiving biologics.

### Notes from the field: vaccine administration errors involving recombinant zoster vaccine-United States, 2017–2018 [^11368yFY]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Two vaccines for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) are licensed for use in the United States and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Zoster vaccine live (ZVL; Zostavax, Merck), licensed in 2006, * is a live attenuated virus vaccine administered as a single subcutaneous (SQ) dose. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ZVL for adults aged ≥ 50 years, ACIP recommends ZVL for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 60 years. Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline), licensed October 2017, † is also approved by the FDA for adults aged ≥ 50 years and is recommended by ACIP for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years. RZV is administered as a 2-dose intramuscular (IM) series, with the second dose given anytime from 2 to 6 months after the first. RZV is preferentially recommended by ACIP over ZVL. Furthermore, ACIP recommends that persons previously vaccinated with ZVL receive the full 2-dose RZV series.

RZV and ZVL differ with regard to vaccine type, dose, and schedule; ACIP recommendation; route of administration; and storage requirements (Table). Prior experience indicates that administration errors are reported most frequently shortly after vaccine licensure and publication of recommendations, likely because of lack of vaccine provider familiarity with the new vaccine.

### A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia [^116gdgbz]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Adults born immediately after the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility cut-off had a 47.2 percentage point higher probability (from 0.01% to 47.2%) of ever receiving the herpes zoster vaccine than those born immediately before this cut-off date. As expected, other than this abrupt change in herpes zoster vaccination uptake, patients were balanced across the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold in their uptake of other preventive health services, past common disease diagnoses and educational attainment. We then used this 'quasi-randomization' in a regression discontinuity analysis to first replicate the known finding from clinical trials that the herpes zoster vaccine reduces new diagnoses of shingles. Second, we extended this approach to an outcome — dementia — that was never assessed in clinical trials of the herpes zoster vaccine, and find that the vaccine reduces the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a seven-year follow-up period by approximately one-fifth. Third, we show that the herpes zoster vaccine did not affect the occurrence of any other common causes of mortality or morbidity other than shingles and dementia. Similarly, we show that receipt of the herpes zoster vaccine did not lead to increased uptake of other vaccinations or preventive health measures. Fourth, we provide evidence that no other intervention (such as health insurance eligibility) in Wales used the identical date of birth (2 September 1933) as eligibility cut-off as was used to define eligibility for the herpes zoster vaccine. Fifth, we show that all findings remain similar when using a different analysis approach. Sixth, we show that changes in healthcare pathways as a result of a shingles episode are unlikely to explain our findings. Seventh, we provide exploratory evidence from our electronic health record data on the mechanism through which herpes zoster vaccination could affect dementia. Our study focuses on the live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax; hereafter, zoster vaccine), because the newer recombinant subunit zoster vaccine (Shingrix) became available in the UK only after our follow-up period ended.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) — vaccinations: "AACE supports the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that all persons with DM receive age-appropriate vaccinations according to the CDC/ACIP schedule (7)", with specifics including: "Annual influenza vaccine is recommended for those with DM who are ≥ 6 mo old". For pneumococcal vaccination, "The 15- or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15 or PCV20) should be administered to all adults aged 19 to 64 y who have DM. When PCV15 is used, PPSV23 should be administered at least 12 mo following the dose of PCV15. A minimum interval of 8 wk may be used for adults with immunocompromising conditions". For older adults, "For adults over 65 who have not previously received PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown, PCV15 or PCV20 should be administered. When PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23". Hepatitis B guidance states, "It is recommended to administer hepatitis B vaccinations to all individuals as soon after diagnosis of DM as possible up to age 59 y", and "Consider hepatitis B vaccination of adults ≥ 60 y based on assessment of risk and likelihood of an adequate immune response". Tetanus boosters are addressed: "all adults with DM should receive a tetanus-diphtheria (Td) booster every 10 y". Regarding COVID-19, "persons with DM should be vaccinated against COVID-19 according to current guidelines". For shingles prevention, "Recombinant zoster vaccine is recommended for adults ≥ 50 y". The guideline also states, "Health care professionals should utilize interventions with demonstrated effectiveness in increasing vaccination rates to improve uptake of vaccination among persons with DM".

### Safety of zoster vaccine in elderly adults following documented herpes zoster [^115VPdR2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

After completion of the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS; Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Number 403), SPS participants who had initially received placebo were offered investigational zoster vaccine without charge. This provided an opportunity to determine the relative safety of zoster vaccine in older adults following documented herpes zoster (HZ).

Methods

A total of 13 681 SPS placebo recipients who elected to receive zoster vaccine were followed for serious adverse events (SAE) for 28 days after vaccination. In contrast to the SPS, a prior episode of HZ was not a contraindication to receiving zoster vaccine. The SPS placebo recipients who received zoster vaccine included 420 who had developed documented HZ during the SPS.

Results

The mean interval between the onset of HZ and the receipt of zoster vaccine in the 420 recipients with prior HZ was 3.61 years (median interval, 3.77 years [range, 3–85 months]); the interval was < 5 years for approximately 80% of recipients. The proportion of vaccinated SPS placebo recipients with prior HZ who developed ≥ 1 SAE (0.95%) was not significantly different from that of vaccinated SPS placebo recipients with no prior history of HZ (0.66%), and the distribution of SAEs in the 2 groups was comparable.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate that the general safety of zoster vaccine in older persons is not altered by a recent history of documented HZ, supporting the safety aspect of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation to administer zoster vaccine to all persons ≥ 60 years of age with no contraindications, regardless of a prior history of HZ.

Herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax, Merck & Co, Inc.) was licensed and recommended in 2006 for prevention of herpes zoster among adults aged 60 years and older. In March 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of Zostavax in adults aged 50 through 59 years. In June 2011, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) declined to recommend the vaccine for adults aged 50 through 59 years and reaffirmed its current recommendation that herpes zoster vaccine be routinely recommended for adults aged 60 years and older.

### Shingles vaccine [^114jZCdt]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Importance Of The Field

Herpes zoster or shingles is a condition with the potential to result in severe debilitation. It affects approximately 10–30% of the population. Until recently there were only treatments to shorten the duration and lessen the symptoms of herpes zoster, but no practical or approved method of prevention for susceptible immunocompetent adults. The live attenuated zoster vaccine (Zostavax, Merck & Co, Inc.) is effective in preventing shingles in individuals 60 years of age and older and recommended by the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP).

Areas Covered In This Review

Literature related to the live attenuated zoster vaccine is reviewed from its beginnings in the early 1970s through to the present.

What The Reader Will Gain

Background information on herpes zoster and up to date information on the live attenuated zoster vaccine including pharmacology, efficacy and safety are covered. New areas of research in zoster vaccination are also discussed.

Take Home Message

The live attenuated zoster vaccine is an effective and well-tolerated method of preventing zoster and the potentially debilitating sequelae and is recommended for immunocompetent patients 60 years of age and older. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating new means of effective prevention.

### Avoiding rash decisions about zoster vaccination: insights from cost-effectiveness evidence [^115cL1Ep]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The adjuvanted Shingrix® vaccine

Given the concerns regarding the ZVL, uptake was lower than expected. After 7 years on the market in the U.S. coverage with the ZVL in patients over 60 years was estimated at 19.5%. In this context, the approval of a newer zoster vaccine in 2017 was welcomed. Shingrix is an adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine (HZ/su) that overcomes many of the limitations of the ZVL. First, the HZ/su has significantly greater efficacy than the ZVL. In particular, among patients over 70 years the efficacy of the HZ/su has been estimated at 91% compared to 38% for the ZVL. Second, the HZ/su is not contraindicated in patients with immunocompromised states. Finally, the HZ/su is indicated in patients over the age of 50 (as opposed to 60 years for the ZVL).

While the HZ/su has significant advantages over the ZVL, it has three main limitations. Compared with placebo, those that received the HZ/su in clinical trials experienced a higher risk of adverse events, including grade 3 systemic reactions. These side effects are particularly concerning because they may discourage patients from obtaining the required booster injection within 2–6 months of the original vaccination. Of note, prior studies of vaccines that require a second shot indicate that adults frequently do not get the entire series. For example, only 43.6% and 61.1% of patients over 65 years receive the second hepatitis A and B immunizations, respectively, within 1 year of receiving the initial shots. The ZVL does not require a second injection; however, re-vaccination at 10 years has been studied to overcome its lack of efficacy over time. Additionally, it remains unknown whether the effectiveness of the HZ/su will decline as rapidly as does that of the ZVL, although it is expected that the immune response to the HZ/su will be better maintained owing to its superior initial antibody response. Finally, the HZ/su is costlier than the ZVL.

### Shingles vaccine fact sheet for healthcare providers… [^112xd8sj]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Shingles Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers CDC recommends the shingles vaccine for adults 50 and older. Who should get Shingrix Give Shingrix to immunocompetent adults 50 years and older, including those who
- had shingles in the past
- received Zostavax® at least 8 weeks prior
- have health conditions, such as chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic pulmonary disease
- are receiving other vaccines, such as influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, at the same visit
- are taking low-dose immunosuppressive therapy. Who should not get Shingrix You should not give Shingrix to a patient who has ever had a severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to a component of this vaccine, or after a dose of Shingrix. Consider delaying vaccination if your patient is pregnant, lactating, or experiencing an acute episode of shingles. About Shingrix Shingrix is a new adjuvanted, non-live recombinant shingles vaccine.

Two doses of Shingrix provides more than 90% protection against shingles and postherpetic neuralgia, the most common complication of shingles. Administering and storing Shingrix
- Adults 50 years and older should receive 2 dosesof Shingrix. Give the second dose 2 to 6 monthsafter the first.
- Administer Shingrix intramuscularlyin the deltoid region of the upper arm with a 1- to 1. 5-inch needle.
- Both vials of Shingrix must be refrigerated at a temperature of 36–46° F. Do not use if exposed to temperatures below 36° F. Reconstitution
- Prepare Shingrix by reconstituting the antigen component with the adjuvant suspension component.
- Either administer it immediately, or store it in the refrigerator and use it within 6 hours of reconstitution. Otherwise, discard it. Cost and insurance Shingrix is now covered by most health insurance plans. Tell your patients to contact their health insurance providers ahead of time to see if they will cover the vaccine.

Report adverse reactions to Shingrix Report clinically important adverse events that occur after vaccination, even if you are not sure whether the vaccine caused the adverse event, to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. Counseling patients about Shingrix Know the benefits and side effects of Shingrix so you're prepared to talk with your patients before administering the vaccine. What to tell patients about Shingrix benefits:

- You can protect yourself against shingles. Shingles is a very painful disease, and your risk of getting it increases as you age. Also, you are more likely to have severe, long-term pain if you get shingles when you are older. About 1 out of every 3 people in the United States will develop shingles in their lifetime.
- Shingrix provides strong protection against shingles and long-term pain from the disease. Two doses of Shingrix are more than 90% effective at preventing shingles.

So it's very important that you get this vaccine. What to tell patients about Shingrix side effects:

- Most people have a sore arm after they get Shingrix. Many people have redness and swelling on their arm spanning several inches where they got the shot. Many people also felt tired or experienced muscle pain, a headache, shivering, fever, stomach pain, or nausea. About 1 out of 6 people had symptoms severe enough to prevent them from doing regular activities. You should plan to avoid strenuous activities, such as yardwork or swimming, for a few days after vaccination. Side effects usually go away after 2 to 3 days. Remember that the pain from shingles can last a lifetime, and these side effects should only last a few days.
- If you do have side effects, you may choose to take over-the-counter pain medicine such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. You can submit a report of your side effects to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System through the website.

### Bullous fixed drug eruption following administration of the recombinant adjuvant shingrix vaccine [^116oZuFE]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

The recombinant adjuvant Shingrix vaccine is now the preferred vaccination to prevent varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation and subsequent postherpetic neuralgia due to its favourable side effect profile and efficacy compared with the live Zostavax vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that all adults ages 50 and older should receive two doses of the Shingrix vaccine separated by 2–6 months. Overall, the vaccine is usually well tolerated by patients. Common side effects of the Shingrix vaccine include redness, swelling and pain at the injection site; myalgias; fatigue; and headaches. We report the first known case of a bullous fixed drug eruption distant from the vaccination site following a second dose of the Shingrix vaccine. This case offers additional insight into the side effect profile of the Shingrix vaccine as it becomes more broadly used in the general population.

### Use of recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^112tHAja]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Zoster Vaccine Recombinant, Adjuvanted (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) is a 2-dose (0.5 mL each) subunit vaccine containing recombinant glycoprotein E in combination with adjuvant (AS01 B) that was licensed in the United States for prevention of herpes zoster for adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2017 *. On July 23, 2021, the FDA expanded the indication for recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) to include adults aged ≥ 18 years who are or will be at increased risk for herpes zoster because of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy. On October 20, 2021, ACIP recommended 2 doses of RZV for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications in adults aged ≥ 19 years † who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed because of disease or therapy. RZV is the first herpes zoster vaccine approved for use in immunocompromised persons. With moderate to high vaccine efficacy and an acceptable safety profile, RZV has the potential to prevent considerable herpes zoster incidence and related complications. This report updates previous ACIP recommendations for the prevention of herpes zoster.

Herpes zoster is a painful, cutaneous eruption, usually involving one to three adjacent dermatomes, § resulting from reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus. The incidence of herpes zoster and related complications (including the most common complication of postherpetic neuralgia) increase with age. The risk for herpes zoster and related complications is generally higher in immunocompromised compared with immunocompetent adults, although there is heterogeneity within and across immunocompromised groups. The risk for herpes zoster among younger adults with certain immunocompromising conditions can be comparable to or higher than that in the general adult population aged > 50 years. Because immunosuppression and immunodeficiency were contraindications for the previously available vaccine, zoster vaccine live, and RZV was originally recommended for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years, there has been an unmet need for vaccination against herpes zoster in immunocompromised adults.

### Potent and long-lasting humoral and cellular immunity against varicella zoster virus induced by mRNA-LNP vaccine [^1177rRUd]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Current treatment options include oral antivirals, such as acyclovir or valaciclovir, which can reduce illness severity and duration but may not reduce rates of PHN or other complications. This limitation, as well as the increasing incidence of herpes zoster and its complications, stimulated the development of vaccines to prevent herpes zoster, particularly in older adults and immunosuppressed individuals.

Two vaccines to prevent herpes zoster were approved in the United States: Zostavax® and Shingrix ®. Zostavax ® is a live attenuated vaccine manufactured by Merck Sharp & Dohme, USA, and Shingrix ® is an adjuvanted subunit vaccine manufactured by GSK. The efficacy of Zostavax ® is about 64% in 60–69 years old individuals, but the efficacy decreases with increasing age, with only 18% efficacy in individuals greater than 80 years old. Therefore, Zostavax ® has been discontinued in the United States since 2020. Shingrix ® contains the recombinant, soluble VZV glycoprotein E (gE), the most abundant glycoprotein on the virion envelope and expressed on the plasma membrane of infected cells, and the adjuvant AS01B. Shingrix ® is more than 90% effective at preventing shingles in adults older than 50 years. Despite the high efficacy, the administration immunization of Shingrix ® is accompanied by reports of high reactogenicity with frequent solicited reports of injection site pain and severe grade systemic reactions within 7 days after vaccination.

### Herpes zoster and tofacitinib therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^111xENBG]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

HZ is a preventable disease, and its prevention is of great interest among physicians treating patients with RA and other autoimmune diseases. Currently, the American College of Rheumatology recommends administration of Zostavax (Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. a subsidiary of Merck & Co. Inc.), a live attenuated VZV vaccine, prior to initiation of biologic therapy in patients with RA age 60 years and older. Despite these recommendations and despite studies showing patients with RA to be at high risk for HZ, < 5% of patients with RA have been vaccinated with Zostavax. While the barriers to such vaccination are not well defined, it is likely that contraindications against live vaccinations during biologic therapy preclude many physicians and patients from using this vaccine. Currently, the necessity of this contraindication is unclear, and limited specific data are available regarding the safety of this vaccine when used concomitantly with biologic agents, nonbiologic DMARDs, or prednisone.

One recent observational study suggested that a large number of patients being treated with biologic agents (n = 652, 551 of whom were taking anti-TNF agents) had been inadvertently vaccinated while actively receiving such therapies, without any resulting adverse sequelae or harm. That study also suggested that vaccinated patients had less subsequent risk of HZ, with a demonstrable vaccine efficacy similar to that observed in a large shingles prevention study. More recently, the vaccine was licensed for use in individuals age 50 years and older, although there is not currently a formal recommendation by professional organizations for use in this age group. Given the higher rates of HZ among patients with RA within this age group, it is likely that patients with RA between the ages of 50 years and 60 years would also benefit from vaccination. At this time, however, safety and efficacy information on Zostavax within RA populations is lacking. Studies should be undertaken to evaluate the utility of this vaccine among patients with RA who are receiving various immunosuppressant regimens, including tofacitinib.

In summary, within the tofacitinib development program for RA, higher-than-expected rates of HZ were documented, particularly within certain subregions of Asia. While a defined mechanism for JAK inhibition and HZ development has yet to be elucidated, further research should be conducted to identify potential explanations for these observations. Furthermore, and of utmost clinical importance, studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zostavax in the prevention of HZ among patients with RA are greatly needed.

### Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults [^1153TgqS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster, also known as 'shingles', is a neurocutaneous disease characterised by the reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus that causes chickenpox when immunity to VZV declines. It is an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and it can significantly compromise the quality of life of affected individuals. The natural process of aging is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity and this predisposes older people to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of VZV activates specific T cell production avoiding viral reactivation. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a herpes zoster vaccine with an attenuated active virus for clinical use among older adults, which has been tested in large populations. A new adjuvanted recombinant VZV subunit zoster vaccine has also been tested. It consists of recombinant VZV glycoprotein E and a liposome-based AS01B adjuvant system. This new vaccine is not yet available for clinical use.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.

Search Methods

For this 2015 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1948 to the 3rd week of October 2015), EMBASE (2010 to October 2015), CINAHL (1981 to October 2015) and LILACS (1982 to October 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine with placebo or no vaccine, to prevent herpes zoster in older adults (mean age > 60 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and analysed data using a data extraction form. They also performed 'Risk of bias' assessment.

Main Results

We identified 13 studies involving 69,916 participants. The largest study included 38,546 participants. All studies were conducted in high-income countries and included only healthy Caucasian individuals ≥ 60 years of age without immunosuppressive comorbidities. Ten studies used live attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccines. Three studies tested a new type of vaccine not yet available for clinical use. We judged five of the included studies to be at low risk of bias. The incidence of herpes zoster, at up to three years of follow-up, was lower in participants who received the vaccine than in those who received a placebo: risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56, risk difference (RD) 2%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 50; GRADE: moderate quality evidence. The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of mild to moderate intensity adverse events. These date came from one large study that included 38,546 people aged 60 years or older. A study including 8122 participants compared the new vaccine (not yet available) to the placebo; the group that received the new vaccine had a lower incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years of follow-up: RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.10, RD 3%, NNTB 33; GRADE: moderate quality evidence. The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of adverse events but most them were of mild to moderate intensity. All studies received funding from the pharmaceutical industry.

Authors' Conclusions

Herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster disease and this protection can last three years. In general, zoster vaccine is well tolerated; it produces few systemic adverse events and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity. There are studies of a new vaccine (with a VZV glycoproteic fraction plus adjuvant), which is currently not yet available for clinical use.

Herpes Zoster: Live-attenuated versus recombinant

Two HZ vaccines have been approved for use in the United States. Zostavax was recommended from 2008–2020. Like the vaccines against varicella recommended in children for protection against primary varicella infection, Zostavax contains a live-attenuated form, but at a much higher titer than currently approved pediatric varicella vaccines. Shingrix, on the other hand, is a recombinant vaccine against HZ that contains both the varicella-zoster glycoprotein E (gE) antigen and the AS01 B adjuvant system. The vaccine utilizes gE as an antigen since it is the glycoprotein that varicella-zoster exhibits most frequently; this glycoprotein is also the target for varicella-zoster CD4+ T cell response. Both Zostavax and Shingrix are capable of eliciting T-cell-independent and T-cell-dependent responses; however, the efficacy of protection provided by these two vaccines differs significantly. The efficacy of Zostavax in HZ risk reduction was only slightly over 50% in patients 60 years and over with previous varicella zoster infection, and the HZ protection provided by this live vaccine reduced after approximately five years. An advantage to Zostavax was that it was given as a one-time dose. Shingrix, in contrast, has an efficacy of over 90% in reducing HZ risk and, unlike Zostavax, can be safely administered to immunocompromised patients. Shingrix is administered over two doses, with protection lasting approximately seven years. It is now recommended by the CDC that those who previously received Zostavax also receive Shingrix.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing herpes zoster (shingles) — HIV adults and adolescents: RZV (Shingrix) is preferred over attenuated ZVL (Zostavax) for prevention of herpes zoster (AIII). RZV is recommended in adults with HIV aged ≥ 50 years, regardless of CD4 count, with a schedule of RZV 0.5 mL IM injection (2 dose series) at 0 and then at 2 to 6 months (AIII), and RZV should not be given during an acute episode of herpes zoster (AIII). Following initiation of ART, some experts would delay RZV vaccination until patients are virologically suppressed on ART (CIII) or until CD4 count recovery (CIII) to maximize immunologic response to the vaccine. If RZV is not available or cannot be given because of allergy or intolerance, ZVL can be administered (0.65 mL SQ for 1 dose) (BIII), but ZVL is contraindicated for persons with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 (AIII).

Patient Enrollment and Survey Administration

During weekdays (typically 9:00 a.m.–5:00 p.m. Monday–Friday), research staff members reviewed ED patient care dashboards (lists of patients in the ED with their age and primary symptoms) to identify adults aged ≥ 18 years who met inclusion and exclusion criteria †; they then offered enrollment to eligible patients using a scripted consent form. Age-specific surveys (i.e. for persons aged 18–26, § 27–49, 50–64, and ≥ 65 years) were administered in English, Spanish, or (at two sites) Mandarin. Participants were asked to respond to the following questions about each CDC-recommended vaccine for their age group as of April 2024: 1) "Have you heard about [VACCINE]?"; 2) "Have you received [VACCINE]?"; 3) (If no), "Why have you not received [VACCINE]?"; and 4) "Would you accept any of these [MISSING VACCINES] today during your ED visit if they could be provided to you?" Plain language accompanied by explanations was used whenever possible to describe the recommended vaccines (e.g. "shingles" rather than "varicella zoster"). Age thresholds for survey questions and time thresholds for up-to-date status were determined using the CDC Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule (as of April 2024). For example, age ≥ 60 years was used to prompt the series of questions about RSV, ** pneumococcal, shingles, COVID-19, influenza, and tetanus-containing vaccines; tetanus vaccination was considered up to date only if the most recent dose had been received within the previous 10 years. In addition to vaccination questions, participants were asked questions about their race, ethnicity, health insurance, primary care, and housing. ††

At a glance ACIP recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine for the prevention of shingles and related complications in adults aged ≥ 19 years who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed because of disease or therapy. Introduction Recombinant zoster vaccine was licensed in the United States for the prevention of herpes zoster, or shingles, for adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Food and Drug Administration and recommended for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years by the ACIP in 2017. This recommendation became official CDC policy in January
2018. On July 23, 2021, the FDA expanded the indication for RZV to include adults aged ≥ 18 years who are or will be at increased risk for shingles because of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy. On October 20, 2021, ACIP recommended 2 doses of RZV in adults aged ≥ 19 years who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed.

These clinical considerations are intended to supplement the MMWR policy note published in January 2022 and will be updated as new information becomes available. Dosing schedule Two doses of RZV are necessary regardless of previous history of shingles or previous receipt of zoster vaccine live. Zoster vaccine live is no longer available for use in the United States, as of November 18, 2020. Timing of vaccination When possible, patients should be vaccinated before becoming immunosuppressed. If vaccination before immunosuppression is not possible, providers should consider timing vaccination when the immune response is likely to be most robust. Factors to consider in assessing the general level of immune competence in a patient include:

- Disease severity and duration
- Clinical stability
- Complications and comorbidities
- Any potentially immunosuppressing treatment.

The risk of deferring vaccination, and thus not mitigating the increased risk for shingles and related complications in immunocompromised patients, should be weighed against a possible diminished response to RZV if given during periods of more intense immunosuppression. Solid organ transplant recipients
- When possible, administer RZV prior to transplantation.
- If vaccination prior to transplantation is not possible, administer RZV at least 6–12 months after transplantation, preferably at a time of stable graft function, and on maintenance immunosuppression. Patients with cancer
- When possible, administer RZV prior to chemotherapy, treatment with immunosuppressive medications, radiation therapy, or splenectomy.
- If vaccination prior to chemotherapy, treatment with immunosuppressive medications, radiation therapy, or splenectomy is not possible, administer RZV:
- When the immune system is no longer acutely suppressed, or.

Patients living with HIV
- Antiretroviral treatment for human immunodeficiency virus may improve immune response to vaccination.
- While greater immunogenicity has been seen in the setting of viral suppression or higher CD4 cell counts with some vaccines, administration of inactivated or recombinant vaccines does not have to be delayed if these criteria have not been met, especially if that would lead to a significant delay of vaccine administration.
- Patients with advanced HIV should receive RZV, because the risk of shingles is further increased in the setting of such immune compromise. Patients with prior varicella or herpes zoster vaccine RZV may be administered to people who previously received varicella vaccine. People who previously received ZVL should receive RZV. Studies have shown that ZVL effectiveness wanes substantially over time, leaving recipients with reduced protection against shingles.

### Herpes zoster vaccines [^113fAjmg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In October 2017, the FDA approved RZV (SHINGRIX) (Table 1), 2 doses administered intramuscularly 2–6 months apart, for prevention of HZ in adults ≥ 50 yoa. Subsequently, the ACIP recommended the 2-dose series of RZV (1) for immunocompetent adults ≥ 50 yoa and (2) for immunocompetent adults previously vaccinated with ZVL; RZV was preferred over ZVL. On July 23, 2021 the FDA approved SHINGRIX for the prevention of HZ in adults ≥ 18 yoa who are or will be at increased risk of HZ due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy [; accessed 09 August 2021].

An open-label, multicenter study demonstrated that 2 doses of RZV, administered 2 months apart to adults ≥ 50 yoa with a physician-documented history of HZ, was safe and immunogenic [141], supporting the ACIP recommendation that adults with a history of HZ should receive RZV.

In a cohort study among vaccinated and unvaccinated Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 65 yoa, VE for incidence of HZ was 56.9% and 70.1% for 1 and 2 doses of RZV, respectively. The 2-dose VE was similar in RZV recipients ≥ 80 yoa or when dose 2 was received ≥ 180 days after dose 1 [142]. Vaccine effectiveness for PHN was 76.0% and 66.8% for ophthalmic HZ after 2 doses of RZV [142]. The 2-dose RZV VE in patients with immunocompromising chronic conditions, or using immunocompromising drugs, was 64.1% versus 70.9% in immunocompetent patients, and this was not reduced in immunocompetent patients with autoimmune conditions [142].

In a retrospective cohort study in 4 769 819 patients > 50 yoa in 2018–2019, 3.6% of whom received 2 doses of RZV and were followed for a median of 7 months, VE for incidence of HZ was 85.5% in RZV recipients 50–79 yoa. Vaccine effectiveness for incidence of HZ in RZV recipients ≥ 80 yoa was 80.2%, compared with 89.8% in ZOE 70 [143].

### Cost-effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in older adults [^113wnjNt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A vaccine to prevent herpes zoster was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of this vaccine for different age groups.

Methods

We constructed a cost-effectiveness model, based on the Shingles Prevention Study, to compare varicella zoster vaccination with usual care for healthy adults aged > 60 years. Outcomes included cost in 2005 US dollars and quality-adjusted life expectancy. Costs and natural history data were drawn from the published literature; vaccine efficacy was assumed to persist for 10 years.

Results

For the base case analysis, compared with usual care, vaccination increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.0007–0.0024 quality-adjusted life years per person, depending on age at vaccination and sex. These increases came almost exclusively as a result of prevention of acute pain associated with herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. Vaccination also increased costs by $94-$135 per person, compared with no vaccination. The incremental cost-effectiveness ranged from $44,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved for a 70-year-old woman to $191,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved for an 80-year-old man. For the sensitivity analysis, the decision was most sensitive to vaccine cost. At a cost of $46 per dose, vaccination cost < $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved for all adults > 60 years of age. Other variables related to the vaccine (duration, efficacy, and adverse effects), postherpetic neuralgia (incidence, duration, and utility), herpes zoster (incidence and severity), and the discount rate all affected the cost-effectiveness ratio by > 20%.

Conclusions

The cost-effectiveness of the varicella zoster vaccine varies substantially with patient age and often exceeds $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved. Age should be considered in vaccine recommendations.

### Shingles vaccine recommendations… [^114FjT23]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine to prevent shingles and related complications in adults aged ≥ 50 years.
- CDC also recommends 2 doses of RZV for adults aged ≥ 19 years who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed. Introduction CDC recommends Shingrix for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications. This page summarizes CDC's current shingles vaccine recommendations. Access the official, full text below: Routine recommendations People 50 years old and older CDC recommends 2 doses of Shingrix separated by 2–6 months for immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older:

- Whether or not they report a prior episode of herpes zoster.
- Whether or not they report a prior dose of Zostavax, a shingles vaccine that is no longer available for use in the United States.
- It's not necessary to screen, either verbally or by laboratory serology, for evidence of prior varicella infection. Recombinant and adjuvanted vaccines can be administered concomitantly at different anatomic sites with other adult vaccines. This includes COVID-19 vaccines. Coadministration of RZV with adjuvanted influenza vaccine and COVID-19 vaccines is being studied. If more than 6 months elapsed since first dose Immunocompromised adults 19 years and older CDC recommends 2 doses of RZV to prevent shingles in adults aged ≥ 19 years who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed because of disease or therapy. The second dose of RZV should typically be given 2–6 months after the first. However, for persons who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed and who would benefit from completing the series in a shorter period, the second dose can be administered 1–2 months after the first.

Keep Reading: Shingrix Use in Immunocompromised Patients Timing considerations for giving Shingrix For patients who previously had herpes zoster There is no specific amount of time you need to wait before administering Shingrix to patients who have had herpes zoster. However, you should not give Shingrix to patients who are experiencing an acute episode of herpes zoster. For patients who previously received Zostavax Zostavax is no longer available for use in the United States, as of November 18, 2020. Consider the patient's age and when they received Zostavax to determine when to vaccinate with Shingrix. Studies examined the safety of Shingrix vaccination 5 or more years after Zostavax vaccination. Shorter intervals were not studied, but there are no theoretical or data concerns to indicate that Shingrix would be less safe or effective if administered less than 5 years after a patient received Zostavax.

You may consider an interval shorter than 5 years between Zostavax and Shingrix based on the age at which the patient received Zostavax. Differences in efficacy between Shingrix and Zostavax are most pronounced among older patients. Studies have shown that the effectiveness of Zostavax wanes substantially over time, leaving recipients with reduced protection against herpes zoster. For example, the vaccine efficacy among adults aged 70 to 79 years and adults aged 80 years and older is 41% and 18%, respectively, on average during the first 3 years following Zostavax vaccination. You should wait at least 8 weeks after a patient received Zostavax to administer Shingrix. For patients who don't report a prior episode of varicella When vaccinating immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older, there is no need to screen for a history of varicella or to conduct laboratory testing for serologic evidence of prior varicella.

Varicella and zoster vaccination — adults and adolescents with HIV: Varicella vaccination (Varivax) should be considered as 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine administered 3 months apart for adults and adolescents with HIV with a CD4 count > 200 cells/μL on suppressive ART who do not have prior evidence of immunity to varicella and with a CD4 cell percentage ≥ 15%; persons without evidence of immunity at risk after exposure should receive varicella zoster IG within 10 days. Varicella zoster IG is not indicated for persons who received 2 doses of varicella vaccine and became immunocompromised later in life. RZV (Shingrix) should be administered to adults aged ≥ 18 years using 2 doses 2–6 months apart for prevention of herpes zoster; those with virus suppressed on ART with CD4 count > 200 cells/μL may respond better, but the vaccine can be safely given regardless of CD4 cell count, and those who have not had varicella exposure should not be offered this vaccine. Data indicate that 99% of those born prior to 1980 have had varicella, and studies in HIV have found the vaccine to be safe and immunogenic after 2 doses.

### Safety of herpes zoster vaccine in the shingles prevention study: a randomized trial [^115t1buQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in immunocompetent older adults. However, its safety has not been described in depth.

Objective

To describe local adverse effects and short- and long-term safety profiles of herpes zoster vaccine in immunocompetent older adults.

Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled trial with enrollment from November 1998 to September 2001 and follow-up through April 2004 (mean, 3.4 years). A Veterans Affairs Coordinating Center generated the permutated block randomization scheme, which was stratified by site and age. Participants and follow-up study personnel were blinded to treatment assignments. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00007501)

Setting

22 U.S. academic centers.

Participants

38 546 immunocompetent adults 60 years or older, including 6616 who participated in an adverse events substudy.

Intervention

Single dose of herpes zoster vaccine or placebo.

Measurements

Serious adverse events and rashes in all participants and inoculation-site events in substudy participants during the first 42 days after inoculation. Thereafter, vaccination-related serious adverse events and deaths were monitored in all participants, and hospitalizations were monitored in substudy participants.

Results

After inoculation, 255 (1.4%) vaccine recipients and 254 (1.4%) placebo recipients reported serious adverse events. Local inoculation-site side effects were reported by 1604 (48%) vaccine recipients and 539 (16%) placebo recipients in the substudy. A total of 977 (56.6%) of the vaccine recipients reporting local side effects were aged 60 to 69 years, and 627 (39.2%) were older than 70 years. After inoculation, herpes zoster occurred in 7 vaccine recipients versus 24 placebo recipients. Long-term follow-up (mean, 3.39 years) showed that rates of hospitalization or death did not differ between vaccine and placebo recipients.

Limitations

Participants in the substudy were not randomly selected. Confirmation of reported serious adverse events with medical record data was not always obtained.

Conclusion

Herpes zoster vaccine is well tolerated in older, immunocompetent adults.

The global use of zoster vaccines

Approval of zoster vaccines

Zostavax ® (ZVL), a live attenuated vaccine, was the first vaccine to be licensed for use against HZ by the FDA in 2006 and was recommended for those ≥ 60 years of age. Since then, ZVL has been licensed in almost 60 countries. It was later approved by both the FDA in 2011 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2012 for use in adults ≥ 50 years of age for the prevention of HZ and PHN. Contraindications for the vaccine include pregnancy, primary or acquired immunodeficiency states, and concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. The latter does not include individuals who are receiving topical, inhaled, or low-dose systemic corticosteroids.

An adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix ®) is increasingly being recommended in national vaccine guidelines and is currently licensed in over 37 countries. The FDA approved the use of RZV in 2017 for use in adults ≥ 50 years of age. This was updated in July 2021 to include adults aged 18 years and older who are or will be at increased risk of HZ due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy. RZV was approved by the EMA in 2018 for use in adults ≥ 50 years of age and this indication was updated in September 2020 to include adults ≥ 18 years of age who are at increased risk of HZ.

Two other live attenuated vaccines have been approved for use. BIKEN ®, which is licensed in Japan, contains a higher vOka titre than in ZVL and is indicated for the prevention of HZ in individuals ≥ 50 years of age. Sky Zoster ®, a vaccine developed and licensed in Korea, has demonstrated non-inferiority to ZVL in healthy adults ≥ 50 years of age. As clinical trial and real-world data are limited for these two vaccines, the rest of this review will focus on ZVL and RZV.

### Update on recommendations for use of herpes zoster vaccine [^114oxE9t]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What recommendations are being reviewed?

Since 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended routine vaccination of all persons aged ≥ 60 years with 1 dose of herpes zoster vaccine.

Why are the recommendations being reviewed now?

After approval by the Food and Drug Administration for use of zoster vaccine in adults aged 50 through 59 years in 2011, ACIP initially considered use of the vaccine among adults in this age group, but declined to change its recommendations at that time, citing shortages of Zostavax and limited data on long-term protection afforded by herpes zoster vaccine. A new review was conducted because the manufacturer has resumed routine supply of Zostavax and additional data on long-term protection have become available.

What is currently recommended?

Considering that the burden of herpes zoster and its complications increases with age and that the duration of vaccine protection in persons aged ≥ 60 years is uncertain, ACIP's recommendation remains unchanged; herpes zoster vaccine is routinely recommended only for adults aged ≥ 60 years.

Because the protection offered by the herpes zoster vaccine wanes within the first 5 years after vaccination, and duration of protection beyond 5 years is uncertain, it is unknown to what extent persons vaccinated before age 60 years will be protected as they age and their risk for herpes zoster and its complications increases. Because duration of protection offered by the vaccine is uncertain, the need for revaccination is not clear. Assuming waning of vaccination protection according to currently available studies, the cost-effectiveness model projects a substantially greater reduction of disease burden, health care utilization, and costs with vaccination of older adults who have higher incidence of herpes zoster and related complications. Considering that the burden of herpes zoster and its complications increases with age and that the duration of vaccine protection in persons aged ≥ 60 years is uncertain, ACIP maintained its current recommendation that herpes zoster vaccine be routinely recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1115CZBA]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Herpes zoster, or shingles, is a neurocutaneous disease that occurs through reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (the virus that causes chicken pox). A quarter of the population is at risk of developing herpes zoster during their lifetime, and two thirds of people with the disease are aged 50 years or older. The morbidity from herpes zoster increases with age. A systematic review reported higher case fatality rates for those aged 65 or more (61 per 100 000) compared with those aged 45–65 (2 per 100 000). In most high income countries, a live attenuated, injectable vaccine is available for the prevention of herpes zoster in adults aged 50 and older. However, vaccine efficacy decreases in those aged 70 and more, and vaccine use is contraindicated in those with immunosuppression. Recently, a new adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine against herpes zoster has been approved in Canada, the United States, Europe, and Japan.

A Cochrane review compared the live attenuated vaccine with the new adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine but excluded trials with participants aged less than 60 years as well trials with immunosuppressed people. As a result, one of the largest randomised controlled trials with 22 000 participants aged 50–59 years was excluded. The review also excluded observational studies, which are important for the examination of vaccine safety. Furthermore, since no head-to-head trials have compared the live attenuated vaccine with the new adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine, an analysis that indirectly compares the herpes zoster vaccines through the common comparator placebo is required.

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis we compared the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine with the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine, placebo, or no vaccine in those aged 50 years and older.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115PgcDV]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus prevention in adults with HIV — recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV): Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) is the only available vaccine for prevention of shingles in the United States, and attenuated zoster vaccine live (ZVL, Zostavax) is no longer available for use in the United States. RZV is recommended in adults with HIV aged ≥ 18 years, regardless of CD4 count, as RZV 0.5 mL IM injection — 2-dose series at 0 and then at 2 to 6 months (AIII). RZV should not be given during an acute episode of herpes zoster (AIII). Following initiation of ART, some experts would delay RZV vaccination until patients are suppressed virologically on ART (CIII) or until CD4 count recovery (CIII) to maximize immunologic response to the vaccine.

### Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults [^111UBfjk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster or, as it is commonly called, 'shingles' is a neurocutaneous disease characterised by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus that causes chickenpox, which is latent in the dorsal spinal ganglia when immunity to VZV declines. It is an extremely painful condition which can often last for many weeks or months, impairing the patient's quality of life. The natural aging process is associated with a reduction of cellular immunity which predisposes to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of VZV activates specific T cell production, therefore avoiding viral reactivation. A herpes zoster vaccine with an active virus has been approved for clinical use among older adults by the Food and Drug Administration and has been tested in large populations.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources for relevant studies: CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7, MEDLINE (1948 to July week 1, 2012), EMBASE (2010 to July 2012), LILACS (1982 to July 2012) and CINAHL (1981 to July 2012). We also reviewed reference lists of identified trials and reviews for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine with placebo or no vaccine, to prevent herpes zoster in older adults (mean age > 60 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and analysed data using a data extraction form. They also carried out an assessment of risk of bias.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs with a total of 52,269 participants. Three studies were classified at low risk of bias. The main outcomes on effectiveness and safety were extracted from one clinical trial with a low risk of bias. Four studies compared zoster vaccine versus placebo; one study compared high-potency zoster vaccine versus low-potency zoster vaccine; one study compared refrigerated zoster vaccine versus frozen zoster vaccine; one study compared live zoster vaccine versus inactivated zoster vaccine and one study compared zoster vaccine versus pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (pneumo 23). Confirmed cases of herpes zoster were less frequent in patients who received the vaccine than in those who received a placebo: risk ratio (RR) 0.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56), with a risk difference (RD) of 2%, and number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 50. Analyses according to age groups indicated a greater benefit in participants aged 60 to 69 years, RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.45) and in participants aged 70 years and over, RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.75). Vaccine-related systemic adverse effects were more frequent in the vaccinated group (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.57, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 100). The pooled data risk ratio for adverse effects for participants with one or more inoculation site adverse effect was RR 4.51 (95% CI 2.35 to 8.68), and the NNTH was 2.8 (95% CI 2.3 to 3.4). Side effects were more frequent in younger (60 to 69 years) than in older (70 years and over) participants.

Authors' Conclusions

Herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster disease. Although vaccine benefits are larger in the younger age group (60 to 69 years), this is also the age group with more adverse events. In general, zoster vaccine is well tolerated; it produces few systemic adverse events and injection site adverse effects of mild to moderate intensity.

### Herpes zoster in patients receiving JAK inhibitors for ulcerative colitis: mechanism, epidemiology, management, and prevention [^116c4uuv]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

A nonlive vaccine for HZ, Shingrix (herpes zoster subunit vaccine), has recently been approved in the United States and Canada, after promising phase III trial results from ~39,000 people across 18 countries. Efficacy against HZ was > 90% for the general population, sustained over the duration of the trial (4 years), and seemed to be independent of age (97.2%and 91.3%efficacy observed for patients ≥ 50 and ≥ 70 years of age, respectively). Phase III trials in other patient populations, including those with renal transplant (NCT02058589) and solid tumors (NCT01798056), have been recently completed; results are yet to be published. Use of a nonlive vaccine would enable a more accessible vaccination against HZ, as this could be administered to a range of patient populations receiving different treatment types and does not pose the risk of contracting HZ from the vaccine. Results from a revaccination study of patients ≥ 50 years of age have recently been presented at the US CDC Advisory ACIP meeting. Patients who received LZV at least 5 years before the HZ subunit vaccine had similar responses to those patients without prior LZV exposure. These data demonstrated that the incidence of HZ was reduced after vaccination with the HZ subunit vaccine, as was the overall incidence of PHN. A potential limitation of this newly developed vaccine is that safety in patients with autoimmune diseases is currently unknown, including the risk of HZ reactivation. Moving forward, these data suggest that patients of any age with IBD could be safely vaccinated against HZ; further research is required to confirm this.

Introduction

On October 20, 2017, Zoster Vaccine Recombinant, Adjuvanted (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline, [GSK] Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), a 2-dose, subunit vaccine containing recombinant glycoprotein E in combination with a novel adjuvant (AS01 B), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of herpes zoster in adults aged ≥ 50 years. The vaccine consists of 2 doses (0.5 mL each), administered intramuscularly, 2–6 months apart. On October 25, 2017, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) for use in immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years.

Herpes zoster is a localized, usually painful, cutaneous eruption resulting from reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV). Herpes zoster is common: approximately one million cases occur each year in the United States. The incidence increases with age, from five cases per 1,000 population in adults aged 50–59 years to 11 cases per 1,000 population in persons aged ≥ 80 years. Postherpetic neuralgia, commonly defined as persistent pain for at least 90 days following the resolution of the herpes zoster rash, is the most common complication and occurs in 10%–13% of herpes zoster cases in persons aged > 50 years. Among persons with herpes zoster, the risk for developing postherpetic neuralgia also increases with age.

Whitehouse Station, New Jersey), a 1-dose live attenuated strain of VZV, is licensed for the prevention of herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years and is recommended by the ACIP for use in immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 60 years. Since licensure, vaccine coverage has increased each year, and by 2016, 33% of adults aged ≥ 60 years reported receipt of the vaccine (CDC, provisional unpublished data). ACIP considered use of RZV, as well as existing recommendations, to develop vaccination policy which would be safe and reduce disease burden. This report serves as a supplement to the 2008 Prevention of Herpes Zoster Recommendations of ACIP for the use of ZVL in adults aged ≥ 60 years and subsequent updates; it outlines recent ACIP recommendations as well as guidance for use of RZV and ZVL in adults.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115m6Wm4]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Withdrawal due to adverse events — six randomised controlled trials including 35 678 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were included in the network meta-analysis of withdrawal due to adverse events, and none of the comparisons were statistically significant (table 4 and table 5). This was consistent in the dose effect analysis (see appendix S23) and in all additional analyses (see appendix S21).

Potential immune mediated diseases

Only two randomised controlled trials including 29 311 immunocompetent patients were included in the meta-analysis on potential immune mediated diseases (table 4 and table 5); there was no statistical difference between the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine and placebo. No additional analyses were possible for this outcome.

Death

Seven randomised controlled trials including 102 718 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were included in the network meta-analysis for observed death during the study period, and none of the comparisons were statistically significant (table 4 and table 5). This was consistent in the dose effect analysis (see appendix S23) and in all additional analyses (see appendix S22).

Rank heat plot

The rank heat plot suggests that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine is the most effective vaccine against herpes zoster, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, and post-herpetic neuralgia, with fewer serious adverse events and deaths than using the live attenuated vaccine or placebo. The live attenuated vaccine is safer for injection site and systemic adverse events, with fewer withdrawals due to adverse events compared with the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine (fig 5).

Rank heat plot, summarising treatment hierarchy across all outcomes. Each circle represents an outcome and has been sectioned into the three interventions, adjuvant, recombinant subunit herpes zoster vaccine, live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine, and placebo. The performance of a particular treatment for each of the outcomes is interpreted based on three colours (worst to best): red (0%), yellow (50%), and green (100%)
