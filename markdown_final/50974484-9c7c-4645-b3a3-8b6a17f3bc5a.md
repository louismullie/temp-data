## Question

Titanium Dioxide and cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether titanium dioxide (TiO2) causes cancer and how to interpret the mixed evidence across routes of exposure and study types. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exposure context because inhalation, ingestion, and dermal routes have different biokinetics and risk profiles. Then, I should verify what authoritative bodies like IARC, NIOSH, and EFSA have concluded and why. Next, I will examine mechanistic data, animal carcinogenicity, and epidemiology for each route. After that, I need to check for confounding and bias in occupational studies, especially the healthy worker survivor effect. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-based conclusion and outline uncertainties and research needs, making sure I don't overgeneralize across exposure routes or particle sizes.

> Let me first confirm the exposure contexts because the answer depends on how people encounter TiO2. In occupational settings, workers may inhale fine or ultrafine TiO2 dust, whereas consumers may ingest food-grade TiO2 (E171) or apply TiO2-containing sunscreens to skin. Particle size, surface area, and physicochemical form differ across these scenarios, which alters toxicology and risk, so I need to keep these distinctions explicit to avoid conflating routes and sizes [^116bVYwk] [^116jqYv2] [^111PMUfH].

> I will now examine authoritative classifications to anchor the risk framing. IARC classifies TiO2 as Group 2B, "possibly carcinogenic to humans", based largely on sufficient animal evidence and inadequate human evidence, with emphasis on inhalation of ultrafine particles; NIOSH considers ultrafine TiO2 a potential occupational carcinogen and recommends a REL of 0.3 mg/m³ (10-hour TWA), while EFSA concluded in 2021 that food-grade TiO2 could not be ruled out as genotoxic and supported its removal from foods; wait, let me verify the NIOSH REL because I initially thought it was 2.4 mg/m³ — hold on, that 2.4 mg/m³ value applies to fine TiO2, whereas the 0.3 mg/m³ REL applies to ultrafine TiO2, so I should correct that to avoid confusion [^115ABvzS] [^116bVYwk] [^115ccqsv].

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility for inhalation hazards. Ultrafine TiO2 can persist in the lungs with long retention half-lives, provoke chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity, and in some studies disrupt endothelial barriers, all of which are biologically coherent with carcinogenic potential. I need to ensure I'm not overstating causality here — these are hazard signals that support plausibility but do not by themselves prove human carcinogenicity at typical exposures [^111Mvpn7] [^114qNPv2] [^114THWTp].

> Now, animal carcinogenicity data for inhalation: rats exposed chronically to high concentrations of ultrafine TiO2 developed lung tumors, and when dose is normalized to particle surface area, tumor responses for fine and ultrafine TiO2 align on a continuum, supporting surface area as a key dose metric. But wait, I should double-check the relevance — rat lung responses include species-specific phenomena like particle overload and keratin cysts, so human extrapolation requires caution even though the directionality of hazard is consistent [^1174wYBr] [^116bVYwk] [^114FBP8P].

> Turning to human epidemiology for inhalation, several large occupational cohorts show no clear excess lung cancer overall, but I need to check for healthy worker survivor effect (HWSE) and other biases. Indeed, reanalyses using g-methods to address HWSE in pooled European cohorts suggest a positive exposure–response for lung cancer mortality when cumulative exposure is considered, indicating that conventional analyses may obscure risk, so I should not dismiss a potential occupational hazard solely based on null SMRs in crude analyses [^1124upWR] [^1137EWP4] [^115ZqJyu].

> For ingestion, let me consider the evidence base carefully. EFSA's 2021 opinion flagged unresolved genotoxicity concerns for food-grade TiO2 and led to its removal from the EU food additive list. However, recent high-quality studies mapping human–mouse dosimetry show that food-grade TiO2 accumulates selectively in Peyer's patch immune cells with minimal systemic distribution and, importantly, does not by itself initiate intestinal inflammation in wild-type hosts, implying that any carcinogenic risk via ingestion would likely require co-factors or susceptible host states. Hold on, I should verify that these newer data do not negate EFSA's concern — they refine it by clarifying target cells and context dependence rather than overturning the genotoxic uncertainty [^115ccqsv] [^111PMUfH] [^111ysM1o].

> Regarding dermal exposure, I need to ensure I'm not conflating bulk and nano forms. Multiple dermatology and allergy sources indicate that TiO2 in sunscreens has minimal percutaneous penetration and a very low propensity to cause contact or photoallergic dermatitis, and regulatory labeling supports its use to reduce UV-induced skin cancer risk? But wait, what if nanoparticles behave differently — data to date do not show meaningful systemic absorption from intact skin, though ongoing research is prudent as formulations evolve [^116jqYv2] [^117MwbGT] [^116X8oLM].

> But wait, what if co-exposures confound occupational findings. In TiO2 manufacturing and downstream uses, workers may also encounter strong inorganic acid mists, crystalline silica, and other recognized carcinogens; I should confirm that some of these are Group 1 or 2A and could contribute to lung cancer risk, complicating attribution to TiO2 alone, which reinforces the need for careful exposure assessment and control banding in mixed exposures [^113Y37iZ] [^116QfeA2] [^111KRQhA].

> I should double-check the dose–response perspective for inhalation because risk depends on exposure intensity and duration. NIOSH's quantitative risk assessment used animal tumor data and human lung dosimetry to derive separate RELs for fine and ultrafine TiO2, reflecting a surface-area–based hazard continuum; this supports the plausibility of a no-observed-risk region at low exposure and a potential risk at higher cumulative exposures, which aligns with the epidemiologic signal seen after addressing HWSE [^116bVYwk] [^1174wYBr] [^1179Zm11].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit about certainty. For occupational inhalation of ultrafine TiO2, there is credible evidence of carcinogenic hazard from animal studies, biologic plausibility, and suggestive human evidence after accounting for HWSE, so a precautionary approach with exposure controls is warranted. For ingestion, current human relevance is limited, with EFSA's genotoxic concern remaining unresolved, but recent data indicate selective gut immune cell accumulation without spontaneous inflammation, implying that any cancer risk is likely low and conditional on co-factors. For dermal exposure, available data indicate negligible absorption and no carcinogenic signal, supporting continued safe use in sunscreens for skin cancer prevention when used as directed [^1137EWP4] [^115ccqsv] [^116jqYv2].

> Finally, I need to translate this into practical guidance while acknowledging uncertainties. In workplaces with TiO2 dust, prioritize engineering controls, maintain exposures below NIOSH RELs (0.3 mg/m³ for ultrafine; 2.4 mg/m³ for fine), and apply hazard surveillance where nanoparticles are present. For consumers, avoid unnecessary ingestion of TiO2 where feasible given EFSA's uncertainty, but recognize that typical dietary exposure may carry low risk absent susceptible host or high cumulative intake. For sun protection, continue using TiO2-based mineral sunscreens given their favorable safety profile and proven benefit in reducing UV-related skin cancers, applying adequate quantities and reapplication practices [^116bVYwk] [^11156SQL] [^111DEHAU].

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is **classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)** by IARC based on sufficient animal evidence but limited human data [^115ABvzS]. Occupational inhalation of fine/ultrafine TiO2 is linked to lung cancer in rats [^1174wYBr]; human evidence remains mixed, with some cohorts showing no excess risk [^1124upWR] and others suggesting possible associations at high exposures [^117JZcHF] [^1137EWP4]. Regulatory agencies advise **precautionary exposure limits** (NIOSH REL: 0.3 mg/m³ for ultrafine; 2.4 mg/m³ for fine) [^1179Zm11] and control measures in workplaces [^116bVYwk]. TiO2 in foods and cosmetics is generally considered safe at approved levels, though ongoing research and recent EFSA restrictions reflect residual uncertainty, especially for nanoparticles [^115ccqsv] [^116jqYv2].

## Epidemiological evidence

### Occupational exposure and lung cancer

- **Human evidence**: Epidemiological studies of TiO2 workers show mixed results; some report no excess lung cancer [^1124upWR] [^115ZqJyu], while others suggest possible associations at high exposures [^117JZcHF] [^1137EWP4].

- **Meta-analysis**: A 2018 meta-analysis of 24,312 workers found no clear association with lung cancer (SMR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91–1.32) [^1124upWR].

- **French cohort**: A 2020 reanalysis suggested a positive relationship at high exposures (> 2.4 mg/m³), but with wide CIs and limited power [^117JZcHF].

- **European reanalysis**: A 2022 g-formula analysis addressing healthy worker survivor effect found a positive exposure–response for lung cancer mortality [^1137EWP4].

---

### Non-occupational exposure

Limited epidemiological data exist for dietary or cosmetic TiO2; **current evidence does not show a clear cancer risk** in the general population, though research is ongoing [^notfound].

---

## Animal studies

- **Rat studies**: Chronic inhalation of fine/ultrafine TiO2 caused lung tumors, with ultrafine showing greater potency [^1174wYBr].

- **Mechanism**: Tumors correlate with persistent inflammation, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity; surface area appears critical to hazard [^1174wYBr] [^114qNPv2].

- **Species specificity**: Rat lung responses (e.g. particle overload, keratin cysts) may not fully translate to humans, but mechanistic plausibility remains [^114FBP8P].

---

## Mechanistic evidence

- **Inflammation and oxidative stress**: TiO2 exposure induces chronic inflammation and ROS, which can damage DNA and promote carcinogenesis [^114qNPv2].

- **Genotoxicity**: TiO2 can cause DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations in vitro and in vivo, though some effects may be secondary to inflammation [^114qNPv2].

- **Surface area**: Hazard scales with particle surface area, explaining greater potency of ultrafine particles [^1174wYBr].

---

## Regulatory and expert opinions

- **IARC classification**: Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic) based on sufficient animal evidence and limited human evidence [^115ABvzS].

- **NIOSH recommendations**: RELs of 0.3 mg/m³ (ultrafine) and 2.4 mg/m³ (fine), with emphasis on surface area and exposure controls [^1179Zm11] [^116bVYwk].

- **EFSA stance**: In 2021, EFSA concluded genotoxicity could not be excluded for food-grade TiO2, leading to EU withdrawal as a food additive [^115ccqsv].

## Exposure routes and risk assessment

| **Exposure route** | **Evidence of carcinogenicity** | **Risk assessment** |
|-|-|-|
| Occupational inhalation | - Strong animal evidence <br/> - Mixed human evidence | - Possible carcinogen <br/> - Precautionary limits advised [^1179Zm11] [^114qNPv2] |
| Dietary ingestion | - Limited evidence <br/> - Ongoing research | - No clear risk identified <br/> - Precautionary restrictions in EU [^115ccqsv] |
| Dermal exposure (cosmetics) | - Minimal penetration <br/> - No carcinogenicity observed | - Considered safe at approved levels [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

TiO2 is **possibly carcinogenic to humans** (IARC Group 2B), with the strongest evidence for occupational inhalation hazards; animal data show lung tumors, while human data are mixed but compatible with a risk at high exposures [^115ABvzS] [^1137EWP4]. Precautionary workplace controls and exposure limits are advised; non-occupational risks appear low but remain under study, especially for nanoparticles [^1179Zm11] [^111PMUfH].

Lung cancer risk factors — tobacco exposure and other carcinogens: The primary risk factor for lung cancer is smoking tobacco and it accounts for most lung cancer-related deaths. Approximately 350 people die every day from lung cancer in the United States; most of these deaths (81%) are caused by cigarette smoking. The risk for lung cancer increases with the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day and with the number of years spent smoking (ie, pack-years of smoking history). Individuals who do not smoke but are exposed to tobacco smoke from those who smoke (second-hand smoke) have an increased relative risk (RR = 1.24) of developing lung cancer; other studies have reported a modest risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05). Cigarette smoke contains many carcinogenic chemicals (eg, nitrosamines, benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide). Other possible risk factors include disease history (eg, COPD), cancer history, family history of lung cancer, and exposure to other carcinogens. The International Agency for Research on Cancer lists agents known to cause lung cancer including arsenic, asbestos, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, coal smoke, diesel fumes, nickel, silica, soot, and uranium.

### Lung cancer mortality in the French cohort of titanium dioxide workers: some aetiological insights [^117JZcHF]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is widely used in construction, food, cosmetic and medical industry. The current evidence on TiO 2 carcinogenicity in humans is considered inadequate. As French participants of the European cohort of TiO 2 workers exhibited an increase in mortality from lung cancer, we aimed at investigating whether TiO 2 exposure, co-exposures or smoking can explain this increase.

Methods

We reanalysed the data of 833 French male workers (follow-up period 1968–1997) and used multiple imputation to complete their smoking status. We considered respirable TiO 2 dust as primary exposure of interest, estimated as continuous cumulative (mg/m 3 -year) and annual average (mg/m 3) concentrations and binary and 4-class categorical variables, with cut-off values of 0.3 and 2.4mg/m 3 (the German and American occupational exposure limits, respectively). For each exposure metric, we estimated HRs and associated 95%CIs, using Cox regression models adjusted for calendar period, exposure duration and smoking.

Results

The fully adjusted model yielded a HR = 3.7 (95% CI = 0.79 to 17.95) for TiO 2 -exposed workers vs unexposed and a HR = 27.33 (95% CI = 4.35 to 171.84) for those exposed to > 2.4mg/m 3 as annual average concentration. Employment duration was negatively related with lung cancer mortality, therefore cumulative exposure had a small effect on mortality (HR = 1.03 (95% CI = 0.99 to 1.08) per mg/m 3 -year).

Conclusion

This study suggests a positive relationship between TiO 2 exposure and lung cancer mortality in TiO 2 workers, whatever the exposure variable used, despite a limited statistical power in some models. The results question the current evidence on TiO 2 carcinogenicity in humans but need to be confirmed in other cohorts, using different statistical approaches.

### Strong inorganic acid mists and respiratory tract cancers: a meta-analysis [^113Y37iZ]. Occupational Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The reference lists in the IARC Monograph on carcinogenicity of SIAMs were supplemented with searches of English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German languages peer-reviewed publications with no limit to year of publication on three databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), SCOPUS and EMBASE (Ovid) up to 10 April 2023. The studies identified reported results on incidence or mortality from cancers of the lung and upper respiratory tract cancers (nasal cavity and sinuses, pharynx) and occupational exposure to SIAMs. As most reports relating to pharyngeal cancer also include the oral cavity, these were included in the analysis. We excluded laryngeal cancer because an association with SIAM exposure has been established. The search strategy was designed using MeSH terms (neoplasms OR carcinoma OR cancer OR malignant [Title/Abstract]) AND (acid mist OR nitric acid OR hydrochloric acid OR sulphuric acid [Title/Abstract]).

We included cohort studies, including nested case–control analyses and case–control studies of workers employed in industries and occupations in which SIAMs represent a major source of exposure and the exposure assessment approach was defined. Manufacturing of phosphate fertilizers, batteries, steel pickling, cellophane, titanium dioxide, petroleum refinery, electrochemical drilling, uranium ore processing, and isopropyl alcohol, surface-active agents, ammonium sulfate, methyl methacrylate, hydrofluoric acid and aluminium sulphate are examples. Community-based case–control studies were included if they reported results on occupational exposure to SIAMs accessed via job-exposure matrices or expert evaluation of questionnaires or other records. We excluded studies of workers mainly exposed to other respiratory carcinogens, including mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including diesel exhaust, asbestos, crystalline silica and heavy metals. Studies involving animals, biomarkers in blood and tissue samples, intervention studies, studies restricted to laryngeal cancer and environmental studies were excluded. Duplicate and irrelevant references were eliminated. Moreover, the reference lists of each study were reviewed for possible additional relevant studies. If a report included pooled data from multiple studies, we excluded the primary studies to avoid double counting. The most informative report was included if multiple reports were based on the same population. A study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (Registration No. CRD42023415107), and the meta-analysis was performed and reported according to the PRISMA statement.

### Talc inhalation in rats and humans: a review and appraisal of available evidence [^1177h8Bj]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current information on the health effects and toxicology of talc suggests that this may lead to a specific target organ toxicity arising from repeated exposure (STOT-RE) classification.

Objective

To provide an assessment of the currently available inhalation toxicity data on talc and to put these data in the perspective of other poorly soluble low-toxicity particles.

Methods

A database of 177 articles was gathered from different sources.

Results

Relevant animal data sets were subjected to a quality review, and epidemiological studies on talc and lung effects published since 2016 were reviewed.

Conclusions

Of nine original inhalation studies reviewed, only one study using rats and mice met the criteria that are needed to include for a reliable evaluation for STOT-RE. Together with the pulmonary effects observed in exposed talc miners, a STOT-RE 1 classification is warranted.

### Nanotechnology and health [^115NdVv5]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Recommendations for further research and action — Based on epidemiologic evidence for particulates and animal toxicology, it is "certainly plausible that exposures to nanoparticles in sufficient concentration in occupational settings could result in pulmonary inflammation and its consequences", and "adverse cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is also of concern". ACOEM supports "appropriate screening in vitro testing and animal toxicology research" allowing occupational extrapolation and dose–response risk assessment, supports research on exposure assessment methods, and notes that robust controls may limit detectable health effects; if exposures or symptoms occur, ACOEM "supports the conduct of appropriate targeted medical surveillance".

### Immunocompetent cell targeting by food-additive titanium dioxide [^1149fugJ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Establishing correlative human-mouse dosimetry

Rodent models provide pragmatic access to healthy pristine tissue (i.e. rapidly flash frozen at necropsy) from fully controlled experiments (i.e. population-matched with availability of fgTiO 2 -negative tissues) in a way that human surgical specimens do not. Nonetheless, it is critical that a murine feeding model appropriately reports on the human situation. Next, therefore, we exploited the window of insight provided by precision image analysis to consider how the cellular dosimetry of fgTiO 2 in the SED cells of the murine model reflected SED-cell exposure in humans. To do this, the snap-frozen Peyer's patch tissue sections, taken from six randomly-drawn human samples, were compared with six murine samples taken from the fgTiO 2 -fed group. Visually, in both species, there was marked inter-individual variability in fgTiO 2 concentration in the SED (Fig. 3a–l). To quantify this, we analysed the thresholded reflectance signal in the tissue sections in four ways, namely: thresholded reflectance per unit tissue area (i.e. fgTiO 2 abundance; Fig. 3m), thresholded reflectance per cell (i.e. fgTiO 2 load per cell; Fig. 3n), the number of reflectant foci per cell (i.e. cellular count of fgTiO 2 -loaded vesicles; Fig. 3o), and finally the amount of reflectance signal per foci (i.e. fgTiO 2 load per vesicle; Fig. 3p). The strategy is schematically explained in Supplementary Fig. 3; cell segmentation accuracy assessments are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2; background reflectance comparisons in mice and humans are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 and examples of the raw reflectance signal, resulting circle-marker placements and fgTiO 2 -loaded vesicle segmentations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. By all metrics, the data from the two groups showed remarkable overlap and under statistical comparison none of the sets of measured fgTiO 2 distributions were found to be entirely unique to either species (presented, Supplementary Fig. 6). Notably when Peyer's patch loading of fgTiO 2 from mice on lower-dose-fgTiO 2 diets was analysed, the cellular accumulation of particles in the SED was several orders of magnitude lower compared to the human situation (Supplementary Fig. 7). The above findings therefore establish the apparent ability of the murine model to provide human-relevant data — quantitatively as well as qualitatively — in terms of fgTiO 2 cell targeting and dosimetry in the biologically-active SED region of the Peyer's patch.

### Role of UV light in photodamage, skin aging, and skin cancer: importance of photoprotection [^111DEHAU]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Solar, and particularly UV, radiation causes molecular and cellular damage with resultant histopathologic and clinical degenerative changes, leading in turn to photosensitivity, photo-aging, and skin cancer. While our bodies have some natural UV defenses, additional protection from the sun is essential, including sun avoidance, physical protection, and sunscreen use. Sun avoidance includes limiting exposure during peak UV times (10am-4pm), avoiding UV-reflective surfaces such as sand, snow and water, and eliminating photosensitizing drugs. Physical protection includes wearing photoprotective clothing such as a broad-brimmed hat and long sleeves and use of UV-blocking films on windows. Sunscreen containing avobenzone, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide or encamsule should be used daily and frequently reapplied. To guard against the UVB spectrum, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are particularly recommended. Sunscreen is generally under-applied at only 25% of the recommended dose, seriously compromising photoprotection. Dosage guidelines recommend using more than half a teaspoon each on head and neck area and each arm, and more than a teaspoon each on anterior torso, posterior torso, and each leg (approximately 2 mg/cm(2)).

### Exposure assessment among US workers employed in semiconductor wafer fabrication [^111iE6fy]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To classify 100,081 semiconductor workers employed during 1983–2002, and some as early as 1968, regarding potential for chemical exposures in cleanrooms during silicon wafer fabrication.

Methods

This study involved site visits to 10 cities with fabrication facilities, evaluation of 12,300 personal air samples for > 60 chemicals, and examination of > 37,000 departments and > 8600 job codes to develop exposure groupings.

Results

Each worker was classified into one of five exposure groups on the basis of job-department combinations: 1) fabrication process equipment operators or process equipment service technicians working in cleanrooms (n = 28,583); 2) professionals such as supervisors working in fabrication areas (n = 8642); 3) professionals and office workers in nonfabrication areas (n = 53,512); 4) back-end workers (n = 5256); or 5) other nonfabrication workers (n = 4088). More than 98% of the personal air samples were below current occupational exposure limits.

Conclusions

Although specific chemical exposures at the level of the individual could not be quantified, semiconductor workers were classified into broad exposure groups for assessment of cancer mortality in an epidemiologic study.

### Irreversible accumulated SERS behavior of the molecule-linked silver and silver-doped titanium dioxide hybrid system [^1167aFkU]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been intensive studied since it was first observed by a roughened silver electrode decorated by pyridine. Due to its high sensitivity and selectivity on the designated analyte adsorbed on the noble metal and/or semiconductor substrates, SERS has been used as a powerful and useful tool for fingerprint tracing of biological and chemical molecules, such as tumor markers, extracellular metabolites, and pesticide residues, even explosives. And it is widely accepted that the electromagnetic enhancement (EE) and the chemical enhancement (CE) are two main mechanisms to contribute the SERS. In generally, EE is considered to be the dominated factor for SERS and is derived from the localized surface plasmon resonance in noble metal nanostructure. As for CE, a clear picture is still in debate, and one of the popular explanations is attributed to the charge transfer (CT) between the substrate and adsorbate –. Empirical evidence shows that SERS produced by CT is usually weak, comparing with that of EE. However, in terms of CE, the high SERS enhanced factor (EF) has been measured recently for the molecule adsorbed on the metal–oxide semiconductor substrates fabricated through various defect engineering –. It has been suggested that the SERS enhancement is owing to the CT increased by Herzberg–Teller coupling, which provides a profound understanding on the defect-assisted CE. Moreover, the additional studies have been carried out to investigate the SERS enhancement from the hybrid system composed of noble metal nanostructure and metal–oxide semiconductor. Guo et al. fabricated of Au–Cu 2 O/rGO nanocomposites as efficient SERS substrate which origin from the synergistic effect of CE and EE. Liu et al. prepared flower-shaped Au–ZnO hybrid nanoparticles with strong charge-transfer-induced SERS property and used as biocompatible and recyclable SERS-active substrate. Zhao's group reported SERS response of adsorbed molecules on TiO 2 nanoparticles and proposed the enhanced Raman scattering can be attributed to the plasmon resonance absorption of Ag and the CT of TiO 2 -to-molecule. Further, a recent development made by Parkin' group focused on a photo-induced SERS enhancement in two steps: UV pre-irradiating of Au/TiO 2 substrate to create oxygen vacancy (V O) defects for facilizing of CT between the molecule and substrate to induce an intense SERS signal upon Raman laser illumination. The above studies have provided a profound understanding of CE based on the defect-assisted CT, however, as for the SERS of the hybrid system composed of noble metal and metal–oxide semiconductor under irradiation of near-infrared (NIR) light, the dynamic processes of the V O defects and the adsorbed molecule have not been analyzed in detail, preventing of reveal the more mechanism behind SERS.

### Association of 13 occupational carcinogens in patients with cancer, individually and collectively, 1990–2017 [^111KRQhA]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The cancer burden attributable to exposure to silica was second to that from asbestos. There was an increase in both the number of cases and age-standardized rates from 2007 to 2017. Silica is widely found in nature, and silica-containing materials are often used, making it among the most prevalent OC exposures. Workers might be exposed to silica in various production activities, including mining and quarrying, potteries or ceramics, foundries, and various tasks in construction and manufacturing. Epidemiologic studies on the association between silica exposure and lung cancer are mainly industry based, including mines, quarries, and granite production sites. A quantitative study on the association between silica exposure and lung cancer mortality, which recruited a cohort of 58 677 German uranium miners from 1946 to 2003, confirmed an association between silica exposure and lung cancer, particularly for high exposures (exposure limit > 10 mg/m 3). A Chinese cohort studyreported that long-term exposure to low levels of silica (exposure limit ≤ 0.05, ≤ 0.10, or ≤ 0.35 mg/m 3) was associated with an increased risk of total and cause-specific mortality (lung cancer: hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.14). Therefore, in practice, the need to control the level of silica in the air and use self-protection devices should be emphasized.

Exposure to asbestos and silica mainly increased the burden of tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer; other risk-outcome pairs were also analyzed. For example, the association between asbestos exposure and malignant mesothelioma, particularly malignant pleural mesothelioma, has been reported. However, owing to the long time that it takes for malignant mesothelioma to develop (30–40 years), we would not see a possible reduction in this health burden at this time and expect a decrease in the number of new cases in the near future, at least in high-income countries. Attributable OCs for leukemia included benzene and formaldehyde. Occupational benzene exposure could occur in many industries, such as petroleum, chemical production, and manufacturing, and even in shoe-making, painting, printing, and rubber manufacturing. Formaldehyde is an important economic chemical, and more than 2 million workers in the US have access to formaldehyde at work. Increasing numbers of people are exposed to formaldehyde because it is a component of tobacco smoke and can be released from household products, such as furniture, particleboard, and carpets.

### Mortality among titanium dioxide workers at three duPont plants [^113DxD6A]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the mortality among workers employed at three titanium dioxide plants in the United States.

Methods

We expanded and updated a cohort employed at titanium dioxide plants. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated combined and stratified by plant for workers employed at least 6 months between 1935 and 2005.

Results

No indications of excess mortality from any cause were found. All causes SMR increased with length of plant operation as did most cause-specific SMRs. With lung, the target organ of interest, no increases in malignant or nonmalignant respiratory disease were observed.

Conclusions

The mortality rates are comparable with the general US population. Increasing SMRs with length of plant operation is indicative of waning healthy worker effect with time since first employment. The results are comparable with other titanium dioxide cohort studies.

In this work, we address whether similar, selective cell loading occurs elsewhere (i.e. away from the safe house base-of-patch pigment cells) and what cells are targeted, at what frequency and with what impact. The approach uses quantitative image analysis of light and electron microanalytical data, correlative mouse-human cell dosimetry and broad-target interrogation of fgTiO 2 ' s capability to augment a primary cellular danger signal in vivo.

### Preparation of tiHnanodots by liquid-phase exfoliation for enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy [^115qH86Q]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Titanium hydride (TiH 1.924) has been explored for applications in hydrogen storage, and is frequently used as a foaming agent in the production of metallic foams (e.g. Zn, Al foams), as well as a raw material for producing highly purified titanium and titanium alloys. Considering the unique valence status of Ti (containing Ti 0, Ti 2+, Ti 3+, and Ti 4+) in TiH 1.924, we hypothesize that it might be easily activated by external stimuli (e.g. light, ultrasound, and microwave) for applications in photo-catalysis and sono-catalysis. However, nano-structured TiH 1.924 has not yet been synthesized to our best knowledge.

Liquid-phase exfoliation usually by sonicating bulk materials in appropriate solvents is a simple top-down route to produce various types of nanomaterials. In this work, we successfully exfoliate TiH 1.924 powder into ultrasmall nanodots via the liquid-phase exfoliation technology, and find that the surface energy plays an important role in the formation of the ultrasmall TiH 1.924 nanodots. In addition, this liquid-phase exfoliation is an effective method to synthesize various types of metal hydride nanomaterials (e.g. TiH 1.924, ZrH 2, CaH 2, and HfH 1.983). Taking TiH 1.924 nanodots for example, they have highly effective US-triggered ROS generation capability, which is superior to the sono-sensitizing effect of titanium dioxide (TiO 2), the classical inorganic sono-sensitizer, likely owing to the reduced bandgap in TiH 1.924. Moreover, these black TiH 1.924 nanodots with strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption can also use as an excellent photothermal agent. Taking the advantage of mild photothermal effect to enhance intra-tumor blood flow and improve oxygen supply, a remarkably synergistic photothermal-sonodynamic therapeutic outcome has been achieved with TiH 1.924 nanodots (Fig. 1). In a mouse tumor model, the complete tumor eradication without recurrence is achieved after intravenous injection of TiH 1.924 nanodots and exposure of tumors to light and ultrasound, sequentially. Importantly, these TiH 1.924 nanodots with ultra-small sizes show efficient body excretion and no appreciable toxicity to the treated animals. This work highlights the potential of metal hydride nanomaterials as physical stimuli-triggered nanoagents for cancer treatment.

### Association of 13 occupational carcinogens in patients with cancer, individually and collectively, 1990–2017 [^111MDfwy]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Occupational exposure to carcinogens has been shown to pose a serious disease burden at the global, regional, and national levels. Based on epidemiologic studies and clinical observations, working environment appears to have important effects on the occurrence of human malignant tumors; however, to date, no systematic articles have been published that specifically investigated cancer burden due to occupational exposure in an individual and collective manner.

Objective

To estimate the degree of exposure and evaluate the cancer burden attributable to occupational carcinogens (OCs) individually and collectively by sex, age, year, and location.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study including data on 195 countries from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from June 24, 2020, to July 20, 2020.

Exposures

Thirteen OCs (ie, arsenic, asbestos, benzene, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, diesel engine exhaust, formaldehyde, nickel, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, silica, sulfuric acid, and trichloroethylene).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The degree and change patterns of exposure as well as the attributable cancer burden, including deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), by sex, age, year, and location for 13 OCs. The calculation of the population-attributable fraction was based on past exposure in the population and relative risks.

Results

Based on the GBD 2017 study, 13 OCs attributable to 7 cancer types were included. Most summary exposure values for the 13 OCs, particularly those of diesel engine exhaust (35.6% increase; 95% uncertainty interval [UI], 32.4%-38.5%) and trichloroethylene (30.3% increase; 95% UI, 27.3%-33.5%), increased from 1990 to 2017. Only exposure to asbestos decreased by 13.8% (95% UI, -26.7% to 2.2%). In 2017, 319 000 (95% UI, 256 000–382 000) cancer deaths and 6.42 million (95% UI, 5.15 million to 7.76 million) DALYs were associated with OCs combined, accounting for 61.0% (95% UI, 59.6%-62.4%) of the total cancer deaths and 48.3% (46.3% to 50.2%) of the DALYs. Among the 13 OCs, the 3 leading risk factors for cancer burden were asbestos (71.8%), silica (15.4%), and diesel engine exhaust (5.6%). For most OCs, the attributed cancer outcome was tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer, which accounted for 89.0% of attributable cancer deaths. China (61 644 cancer deaths), the US (42 848), and Japan (20 748) accounted for the largest number of attributable cancer deaths in 2017; for DALYs, China (1.47 million), the US (0.71 million), and India (0.37 million) were the 3 leading countries.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this study suggest that although OC exposure levels have decreased, the overall cancer burden is continuously increasing.

Do birth control pills cause cancer?

Birth control pills do not seem to cause breast cancer. However, if you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use birth control pills because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

What if I want to become pregnant?

You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill.

What should I know about my period when taking Tri Femynor?

Your periods may be lighter and shorter than usual. Some women may miss a period. Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may happen while you are takingTri Femynor, especially during the first few months of use. This usually is not a serious problem. It is important to continue taking your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy.

### Immunocompetent cell targeting by food-additive titanium dioxide [^112veuoE]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Results

Titanium dioxide in human intestinal tissues

High-resolution reflectance confocal microscopy of human small intestinal tissue samples identified bright foci at the base of Peyer's patches (Fig. 1a) consistent with previous reports of pigment cells in this region. These cells are known to mostly accumulate ingested engineered aluminosilicates and fgTiO 2. Using Al and Ti as biomarkers for these particles, correlative analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirmed the presence and co-localisation of these elements (Fig. 1b; top row). Reflectant foci were found entirely attributable to Ti-rich particles, as areas with Al but no Ti signals were not reflectant, whereas all detectable Ti foci yielded reflectance (Fig. 1b; rows 2–5). Alongside further checks using mouse tissues known to contain fgTiO 2 or not (shown, Supplementary Fig. 1), the reflectance imaging approach was confirmed as a robust, high-throughput means to detect fgTiO 2 in tissue.

### Particulate debris from a titanium metal prosthesis induces genomic instability in primary human fibroblast cells [^116TPst9]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

From the cytogenetical analysis it can be observed that the frequency of aberrations is elevated compared to control, most of these are of the unstable type arising de novo. These values are lower compared to results obtained for radiation but they show a definite trend towards genomic instability. Like radiation, heavy metals induce stress responses and proteins such as metallothionein are upregulated. These protect cells from damage by these insults by inducing repair pathways and eliminating individual cells by apoptosis. The lower frequencies of persistent damage in metal-treated cells compared to radiation-treated cells may relate to metallothionein proteins that specifically deal with metal toxins. The cytogenetical analysis shows a phenomenon that is not seen postexposure to radiation, which is the persistent induction of tetraploidy. It has been postulated that such ploidy changes destabilise the karyotype leading to a tumorigenic karyotype. It is also known that tetraploidy may lead to immortalisation of cells ' in vitro ' and to transformation during the process of carcinogenesis. These observations lead us to speculate that although conditions ' in vitro ' are different to those ' in vivo ', particulate debris from metal prostheses might leave the patient susceptible to carcinogenic initiation. A two-fold increase in chromosomal translocations was observed in patients with metal on plastic total hip replacements undergoing revision arthroplasty compared with those at primary arthroplasty. Higher rates of chromosomal aberrations were observed in local bone-marrow cells adjacent to the prosthesis at revision surgery compared with bone marrow from the iliac crest from the same patient. These aberrations mainly consisted of chromatid breaks. In some cancer incidence studies, it has been observed that there were increased incidences of lymphomas and leukaemia in patients with prosthetic joint replacements, but there were decreased incidences of breast, colon and rectum cancer. These studies were followed up over a 10-year period postoperative procedure, which probably explains the significant increase in the short latency-type haematopoietic cancers. The latency period for particulate-induced solid tissue malignancy could take up to 20 years or more to manifest itself. Mechanical implantation or inhalation of metal dust may proceed to neoplastic transformation by a chemical route after corrosion or by aggregation of corrosion products around the implant or remote sites. Cytogenetic analysis also showed the induction of endoreduplication. This is where the cells undergo two DNA syntheses without cell division intervening and its occurrence may provide a mechanistic explanation for the induction of tetraploidy by titanium debris. High frequency of tetraploidy is associated with malignant melanoma and lymphoma. Results from this paper revealed significant increases in the induction of tetraploidy in the fibroblast cell after a brief exposure to 1 in 500 dilution of the titanium debris.

### Titanium: an unusual allergen with various presentations – A retrospective cohort study [^112yPEce]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

One hundred and twenty‐nine patients (51%) had no reaction at all. Among patients with a positive reaction, the mean number of reactions is 3.1. We assessed the rate of positive relevant reactions (PRR) to metals, whether among the EBS‐nickel sulfate 5.0% pet, potassium dichromate 0.5% pet, cobalt chloride 1.0% pet or among the metal series according to the clinical indication (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Positive relevant reactions to metals according to the clinical indication.

Titanium oxalate hydrate elicited positive reactions in 13 patients (5%). All reactions occurred with titanium oxalate, none with titanium nitride. Clinical characteristics of patients with Ti sensitization are demonstrated in Table 3. Affected individuals were predominantly adult Caucasian females, with 38% linked to jewellery exposure. Co‐sensitization with other metals — particularly nickel, cobalt, and vanadium — was present in 77% of these cases.

TABLE 3
Clinical characteristics of patients with titanium sensitisation.

Clinical presentations were primarily localised eczematous eruption in the contact site, mainly the fingers, hands or trunk. Interestingly, two patients developed a generalised rash following implant placement, one dental and one orthopaedic. One of those patients developed a generalised bullous eruption 1‐week post titanium‐based implant hip replacement. A +++ reaction to Ti oxalate was evoked on D4. Direct immunofluorescence conformed the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. MELISA test (Memory Lymphocyte Immunostimulation Assay) was performed as well, showing a weakly positive reaction to titanium dioxide, as well as to zirconium sulfate, lead nitrate, silica dioxide and fine ground silica.

### The safety of nanosized particles in titanium dioxide-and zinc oxide-based sunscreens [^116jqYv2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Given the increasing incidence and prevalence of skin cancer, dermatologists are more frequently recommending sunscreens to their patients. However, the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanosized particles in the majority of sunscreens has come under scrutiny from governments and the general public. We sought to characterize the use, safety, and regulatory state of nanosized particles in titanium dioxide and zinc oxide in sunscreens based on studies and position statements from 1980 to 2008. Although we found no evidence of significant penetration of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanosized particles beyond the stratum corneum, further studies must be done to simulate real-world conditions particularly in sunburned skin and under ultraviolet exposure.

### Focused actions to protect carbon nanotube workers [^111dgZn5]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

There is still uncertainty about the potential health hazards of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) particularly involving carcinogenicity. However, the evidence is growing that some types of CNTs and nanofibers may have carcinogenic properties. The critical question is that while the carcinogenic potential of CNTs is being further investigated, what steps should be taken to protect workers who face exposure to CNTs, current and future, if CNTs are ultimately found to be carcinogenic? This paper addresses five areas to help focus action to protect workers: (i) review of the current evidence on the carcinogenic potential of CNTs; (ii) role of physical and chemical properties related to cancer development; (iii) CNT doses associated with genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo; (iv) workplace exposures to CNT; and (v) specific risk management actions needed to protect workers.

### Early-onset colorectal cancer: initial clues and current views [^113cCBvn]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Over the past several decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC; in patients < 50 years old) has increased at an alarming rate. Although robust and scientifically rigorous epidemiological studies have sifted out environmental elements linked to EOCRC, our knowledge of the causes and mechanisms of this disease is far from complete. Here, we highlight potential risk factors and putative mechanisms that drive EOCRC and suggest likely areas for fruitful research. In addition, we identify inconsistencies in the evidence implicating a strong effect of increased adiposity and suggest that certain behaviours (such as diet and stress) might place nonobese and otherwise healthy people at risk of this disease. Key risk factors are reviewed, including the global westernization of diets (usually involving a high intake of red and processed meats, high-fructose corn syrup and unhealthy cooking methods), stress, antibiotics, synthetic food dyes, monosodium glutamate, titanium dioxide, and physical inactivity and/or sedentary behaviour. The gut microbiota is probably at the crossroads of these risk factors and EOCRC. The time course of the disease and the fact that relevant exposures probably occur in childhood raise important methodological issues that are also discussed.

### An updated investigation of cancer incidence and mortality at a Scottish semiconductor manufacturing facility with case-control and case-only studies of selected cancers [^112t9CBu]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

An earlier investigation raised concern that some cancer cases might be linked to work at a semiconductor manufacturing plant. The aim of this study was to describe an update of the cancer incidence and mortality of these workers and assess whether workplace exposures contributed to any increased risk of selected cancers.

Methods

Standardised mortality ratios and standardised incidence ratios were calculated for cancer site groups of a priori interest in a cohort previously flagged against the National Health Service Central Register, with follow-up extended to the 2007 for deaths and 2006 for cancer registrations. Cases of female breast cancer, lung and stomach cancer, and male brain cancer, and a random sample of control subjects individually age-matched to the breast cancer cases, were identified from within the cohort dataset and invited to participate via general practitioners. Exposures were estimated using a job exposure matrix developed from a historical hygiene assessment and assigned to job histories obtained from personal interview of subjects (or proxies).

Results

Though the findings were uncertain, there were no excesses of mortality or cancer incidence, either overall or for specific cancer sites, suggestive of a workplace effect. Logistic regression analyses comparing 20 cases of breast cancer with 83 matched controls showed no consistent evidence of any relationship with occupational exposures. Assessment of commonalities of workplace exposures among case sets for other cancer types was limited by the small numbers.

Conclusions

These results do not support earlier concerns about occupational cancer risks among this cohort.

### Current intelligence bulletin 63: occupational exposure to titanium dioxide… [^116bVYwk]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Current Intelligence Bulletin 63: Occupational Exposure to Titanium Dioxide April 2011 DHHS Publication Number 2011–160 The purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is to assure safe and healthful working conditions for every working person and to preserve our human resources. In this Act, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is charged with recommending occupational safety and health standards and describing exposures that are safe for various periods of employment, including the exposures at which no worker will suffer diminished health, functional capacity, or life expectancy as a result of his or her work experience. Current Intelligence Bulletins are issued by NIOSH to disseminate new scientific information about occupational hazards.

A CIB may draw attention to a formerly unrecognized hazard, report new data on a known hazard, or disseminate information about hazard control. CIBs are distributed to representatives of academia, industry, organized labor, public health agencies, and public interest groups as well as to federal agencies responsible for ensuring the safety and health of workers. Titanium dioxide, an insoluble white powder, is used extensively in many commercial products, including paint, cosmetics, plastics, paper, and food, as an anticaking or whitening agent. It is produced and used in the workplace in varying particle-size fractions, including fine and ultrafine sizes. The number of U. S. workers currently exposed to TiO 2 dust is unknown. This NIOSH CIB, based on our assessment of the current available scientific information about this widely used material, reviews the animal and human data relevant to assessing the carcinogenicity and other adverse health effects of TiO.

2, provides a quantitative risk assessment using dose-response information from the rat and human lung dosimetry modeling and recommended occupational exposure limits for fine and ultrafine TiO 2, and describes exposure monitoring techniques, exposure control strategies, and research needs. This report only addresses occupational exposures by inhalation, and conclusions derived here should not be inferred to pertain to nonoccupational exposures.

### A panel study for cardiopulmonary effects produced by occupational exposure to inhalable titanium dioxide [^114qnPeV]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) exposure level in the finished product workshop, and its short-term cardiopulmonary effects, based on exposure assessment.

Methods

Seven workers were recruited into the panel. Personal TiO(2) exposure information, cardiopulmonary function, and the particle size distribution data were collected during working days. Linear mixed effect model was used to examine the association between TiO(2) exposure and cardiopulmonary function changes.

Results

The weight percentage of TiO(2) particles more than 10 μm, 1 to 10 μm, and less than 1 μm in the total dust was 14.5%, 69.5%, and 16%, respectively. Linear mixed effect model analysis showed that 1 mg/m increase in daily personal TiO(2) exposure was associated with the decline in maximum voluntary ventilation, peak expiratory flow, maximum mid-expiratory flow, and 75% of maximum expiratory flow.

Conclusion

The study provided new evidence for health effects of occupational inhalable TiO(2) exposure, which suggests setting up new occupational exposure standards for fine TiO(2).

Sunscreens have traditionally been divided into chemical absorbers (UVB [290–320 nm], UVA II [321–340 nm], and UVA I [341–400 nm]) and physical blockers, and titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are the most common physical UV blockers used today and have not been reported to cause contact dermatitis or photo-allergy.

### The health effects of ultrafine particles [^111Mvpn7]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

PM 0.1 that enter alveoli can be retained in surfactant, thus sidestepping the mucociliary escalator clearance mechanisms. The retention half-life of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) particles of the identical crystalline structure, deposition burden, and conditions in animal lungs was reported to be 170 days for 250-nm particles and 500 days for 20-nm particles. The finer particles caused stronger and more persistent inflammation, with more type II cell proliferation and macrophage impairment and early interstitial fibrotic foci. The small particles also moved into the lung interstitium and periphery more than the larger ones. TiO 2, which is considered a safe additive to foods, toothpaste, lotions, and many other household products, appears to have many major toxic effects when its particles are in the PM 0.1 range.

### Ambient air pollution and urological cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological evidence [^115seGpz]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Air pollution is a complex and ubiquitous mixture of gases, liquids, and solid particles. Air pollutants vary in chemical composition, reaction characteristics, emission, environmental persistence, capacity to be transferred long or short distances, and health effects. Many countries have established monitoring networks that typically record levels of regulated pollutants, such as respirable particulate matter (PM 10), fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and ozone (O 3). Long-term exposure to air pollution could be associated with cancer risk. In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified particulate matter (PM) as a human carcinogen, specifically to lung cancer. PM with a diameter ≤ 10 μm, can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the circulation, delivering them to different organs. Components of PM, such as heavy metalsand polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), can also induce mutations and initiate or promote carcinogenic processes. Nitrogen oxide (NO x) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), markers of traffic and fossil fuel emissions, present potential carcinogenic properties that have not been clearly defined. The carcinogenic effects of ozone (O 3) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) are also unclear, with limited evidence –.

Despite the growing body of evidence suggesting the harmful impact of air pollution on a range of health conditions, including cancer, research examining the potential link between air pollution exposure and urologic cancer risk is sparse. As more epidemiological studies on this topic have been published in the past three years. it has become both critical and feasible to recapitulate the evidence. In this study, we thus conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies to determine potential associations of air pollution exposures with the risk of individual and overall urological cancer.

### Photoprotection for all: current gaps and opportunities [^114BSbU9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The effects of solar radiation on human skin differ based on the skin phototype, presence or absence of photodermatoses, biologic capacity to repair DNA damage, wavelength, intensity of sun exposure, geographic latitude, and other factors, underscoring the need for a more tailored approach to photoprotection. To date, the focus of photoprotection guidelines has been to prevent sunburn and DNA damage induced by UV radiation, both UVB and UVA; however, several recent studies have shown that visible light also generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that can contribute to skin damage and pigmentation on the skin, particularly in people with skin of color. Therefore, individuals with dark skin, while naturally better protected against UVB radiation by virtue of the high eumelanin content in melanocytes, may need additional protection from visible light-induced skin damage. The current options for photoprotection products need to expand, and potential strategies against visible light include the addition of iron oxide, titanium dioxide, and biologically relevant antioxidants to sunscreen formulations as well as supplementation with orally active antioxidants.

### A work group report on ultrafine particles (American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology): why ambient ultrafine and engineered nanoparticles should receive special attention for possible adverse health outcomes in human subjects [^115sFEJM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) — pulmonary toxicity is linked to physicochemical features, with titanium dioxide nanorods at lengths of 200 nm or greater and aspect ratios of 22 or greater inducing progressive proinflammatory responses and cytotoxicity, and a relatively low "critical" length/aspect ratio associated with small diameters (6–10 nm). The toxicity of ZnO was dependent on particle dissolution and shedding of toxic zinc ions. Intratracheal administration of agglomerated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) results in granuloma formation, whereas dispersed CNTs result in more diffuse fibrosis, and CNTs still accumulate in lung lymph nodes almost 1 year after aerosol exposure.

### Nanotechnology and health [^11156SQL]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Nanotechnology and health — exposure assessment notes that it is not yet clear what exposure metric best correlates with risk; measurements of mass concentration (μg/m3) are likely to be low despite high particle number concentrations, yet the recommended exposure limits that NIOSH has issued are mass-based. Tiered approaches exist, including NIOSH's Nanomaterial Field Research Team Exposure Assessment Technique (NEAT 2.0), which aims to assess time-weighted average (TWA) exposures by collecting personal-breathing-zone filter-based samples during a worker's activity over the entire workday. Some authors advocate a control banding approach, but physicians and environmental health and safety professionals should exercise caution when applying this instrument. For monitoring, NIOSH recommends that measurements be taken before production or processing to obtain background nanoparticle exposure data, provides further guidance in NIOSH Publication No. 2009–125, and currently recommends a program of hazard surveillance in workplaces in which nanoparticles are manufactured.

### Identifying and prioritizing hazardous chemicals in construction metal structure coating systems: a roadmap for data-driven disease prevention [^114h6W7o]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The most frequently used particulate materials in NEPCOAT products were crystalline silica and titanium dioxide. The highest concentration in the bulk was reported for zinc (dust or fume) up to 100% as it was predominantly contained in Part F of the primers; crystalline silica up to 92%, and limestone up to 75% (Table 1). Nanoscale crystalline silica, a small fraction of which is present in the respirable quartz, is of particular interest from a respiratory toxicology standpoint, considering its higher toxicity potency compared to microscopic quartz and the ability to translocate to extrapulmonary organs. This review could not identify with certainty the presence and concentration of nanoscale crystalline silica in coating products. Independent material characterization is needed to ascertain the size and distribution of crystalline silicas in coatings and paints.

Only three studies on exposures to nanomaterials in construction coatings were identified. Two focused on nano titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and one on zinc oxide (Supporting Information S1: Table S7). TiO 2 is a high‐volume nanoparticle that has been used widely in construction as white pigment and filler in paints, plastics, and coatings. Many industrial applications use TiO 2 nanopowders, mostly as anatase or anatase/rutile mixtures, with primary particle size diameters of around 20–30 nm. Inhalation of aerosol droplet containing nanoparticle additives and ingestion are the primary exposure routes, since skin penetration is negligible. In a 2011 intelligence bulletin #63, NIOSH recommended a REL of 2.4 mg/m 3 for fine TiO 2 and 0.3 mg/m 3 for ultrafine (including engineered nanoscale) TiO 2. West et al. reported task‐based exposure measurements during an airless spray application of the nano‐based paints in a chamber study that reproduced relevant indoor spray paint environments. The mean exposure levels for respirable TiO 2 were 0.7 mg/m 3, lower than NIOSH REL for fine TiO 2 but higher than the REL for ultrafine TiO 2. There are no field studies of TiO 2 exposures among painters.

### Environmental epigenetics in metal exposure [^111yPsR9]. Epigenetics (2011). Low credibility.

Although it is widely accepted that chronic exposure to arsenite, nickel, chromium and cadmium increases cancer incidence in individuals, the molecular mechanisms underlying their ability to transform cells remain largely unknown. Carcinogenic metals are typically weak mutagens, suggesting that genetic-based mechanisms may not be primarily responsible for metal-induced carcinogenesis. Growing evidence shows that environmental metal exposure involves changes in epigenetic marks, which may lead to a possible link between heritable changes in gene expression and disease susceptibility and development. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of metal exposure affecting epigenetic marks and discuss establishment of heritable gene expression in metal-induced carcinogenesis.

### IOC consensus statement on recommendations and regulations for sport events in the heat [^113k2xjo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Officials and athletes with low metabolic heat production should wear light-coloured, loose-fitting, sun-protective clothing.
Athletes with a higher metabolic heat production should wear clothing that does not impair direct sweat evaporation from the skin.

Sunscreen

Using sunscreen is one of the main preventive strategies to protect the skin from UVR. Sunscreen application recommendations are to apply ~2 mg per cm 2 of protection to exposed skin, indicating that adult athletes may need ~15–20 mL of sunscreen per application. It has been recommended that athletes use water-based sunscreen (ie, non-greasy) over oil-based sunscreen that may affect sweating. However, there are large differences in the sweating response to different water-based sunscreens. Sunscreen can work as a chemical sun filter or as a physical sunblock. Chemical sunscreen absorbs into the skin and then absorbs UV rays, converts the rays into heat before releasing from the body. The active ingredients in chemical sunscreens include avobenzone, octinoxate and oxybenzone. Physical sunblock sits on top of the skin and reflects the sun's rays. The minerals titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are the main active ingredients in physical blocks. When comparing an organic chemical sun filter (oxybenzone) and an inorganic physical sunblock (titanium dioxide), both water-based with an SPF 50, Aburto-Corona reported that the latter may impair sweating. While the study design was different from real-world utilisation, athletes should be encouraged to use sunscreen when necessary given the importance of sunscreen in preventing skin cancer. Future studies are needed to identify the specific ingredients in sunscreens that interfere with sweating and their interactions with the thermoregulatory response.

Recommendation

Based on the limited studies in athletes but the well-known health risk associated with UV exposure, athletes are advised to protect the exposed part of their body using sunscreen of SPF ≥ 25 using a water-based organic chemical sun filter.

### Nanoparticles: a closer look at their dermal effects [^113EZkfn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Nano-sized particles represent a unique class of materials with novel physiochemical properties due to increased surface area. Many sunscreens and cosmetics are now using nano-sized titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, which avoids the white, chalky appearance of the older preparations. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that nano-sized titanium dioxide is not a new ingredient, but a specific grade of the original product, recent studies suggest that nanomaterials products may not be equivalent to their respective bulk-form products, and the adverse effects of nanoparticles cannot be reliably predicted from the properties of the material in bulk form. Nanoparticles are incorporated into a variety of skin care products, and in the future may be useful as transdermal drug delivery devices. Thus, understanding potential epidermal and dermal penetration, as well as possible toxicity, is important to the field of dermatology. The authors present a review of the therapeutic applications and potential toxicity of nanoparticles relevant to the field of dermatology thus far.

### Cancer incidence among hardmetal production workers: the Swedish cohort [^112g5VtS]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified cobalt metal with tungsten as probably carcinogenic to humans (group 2A). The harmonized classification for cobalt within EU legislationdoes not address the carcinogenicity; however, on the basis of animal testing of cobalt, the industry self- classification states that cobalt may cause cancer by inhalation. Regarding metallic nickel, IARC classifies metallic nickel as possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B). Results of other country-specific cohort analysis and exposure assessment are presented in the same volume of this journal as a series of companion papers (Kennedy et al, submitted; McElvenny et al, submitted; Morfeldt et al, submitted; Mosshammer et al, submitted; Marsh et al, accepted for publication JOEM 2017).

The present study investigates how exposure to cobalt, nickel, and tungsten for three Swedish hardmetal plants operating from the 1930s and onwards affects morbidity, with a special reference to lung cancer.

### Systematic review of the mechanistic evidence for TiO2 NP lung… [^114qNPv2]. stacks.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Description: Background and Purpose: Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are a high production volume material widely used in the paints, cosmetic, food and photovoltaics industry. Their increasing industrial demand and use raises concerns of adverse human exposure and related health effects. Epidemiological and animal studies suggest that TiO2 elicits cancer development and consequently is classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. However, the mechanistic basis of TiO2 NP-mediated lung carcinogenicity is not clear. Here, we systematically reviewed literature to identify in vitro and in vivo mechanistic evidence of TiO2 NP lung carcinogenicity using the 10 key characteristics of carcinogens for identifying and classifying carcinogens. The quality and reliability of the studies was assessed by using the ToxRTool, which resulted in the assignment of modified Klimisch scores.

Studies receiving a Klimisch score 1 or 2 were eligible for data extraction which followed standardized forms and guidelines. Finally, a weight-of-evidence approach was used to evaluate the assays/endpoints investigated to study the respective KC in terms of their association with carcinogenic hazard. Of these, 186 articles were considered of good quality and provided moderate to high level of confidence for the biological endpoints examined. Our analysis showed limited availability of mechanistic data related to carcinogenesis, such as proliferation, epigenetic alterations and receptor-mediated effects. There was evidence for genotoxicity, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation following TiO2 NP exposure. However, the wide variety of TiO2 NP used in the studies, differing in their physicochemical characteristics, methods of formulation, exposure scenarios/test systems, and experimental protocols made it very challenging to compare the studies.

Conclusions: Future toxicology/ carcinogenicity research must include appropriate positive controls, endotoxin testing, statistical power analysis, and relevant biological endpoints, to improve the quality and reliability of the studies to be useful for the evaluation of TiO2 NP-induced lung carcinogenicity. There is clearly a need for more physiologically relevant, long-term studies using appropriate particle doses. The limited quality of currently available evidence constrains us from drawing a conclusion that pulmonary exposure to TiO2 NP induces lung cancer. Subjects: Keywords: ISSN: 1096–6080.

### Details… [^1174wYBr]. stacks.cdc.gov (2015). Low credibility.

This recommendation was based on the observation of lung tumors in a chronic inhalation study in rats at 250 mg/m3 of fine TiO2. Later, a 2-year inhalation study showed a statistically significant increase in lung cancer in rats exposed to ultrafine TiO2 at an average concentration of 10 mg/m3. This is supported by a pattern of TiO2 induced responses that include persistent pulmonary inflammation in rats and mice and cancer responses for PSLT particles related to surface area. Therefore, on the basis of the study by Heinrich et al.

and the pattern of pulmonary inflammatory responses, NIOSH has determined that exposure to ultrafine TiO2 should be considered a potential occupational carcinogen. The absence of lung tumor development for fine TiO2 was also reported by Muhle et al. in rats exposed at 5 mg/m3. However, the responses observed in animal studies exposed to ultrafine and fine TiO2 are consistent with a continuum of biological response to TiO2 that is based on particle surface area. In other words, all the rat tumor response data on inhalation of TiO2 fit on the same dose-response curve when dose is expressed as total particle surface area in the lungs. Although data are insufficient on the cancer hazard for fine TiO2, the tumor-response data are consistent with that observed for ultrafine TiO2 when converted to a particle surface area metric.

Thus to be cautious, NIOSH used all of the animal tumor response data when conducting dose-response modeling and determining separate RELs for ultrafine and fine TiO2. Heinrich et al. 1995]. Therefore, NIOSH concludes that the scientific evidence supports surface area as the critical metric for occupational inhalation exposure to TiO2. NIOSH also evaluated the potential for coatings to modify the toxicity of TiO2, as many industrial processes apply coatings to TiO2 particles.

### Immunocompetent cell targeting by food-additive titanium dioxide [^115ccqsv]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is a highly versatile nano- and micro- particulate mineral with widespread use in consumer products and manufacturing processes, including as a food and pharmaceutical additive. Although, for many years, there have been questions over a potential role of ingested TiO 2 in initiating or augmenting an inflammatory response in the intestine, the global industry, valued at > $17 billion per annum, is now facing a whole new bio-nano challenge. In May 2021, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) questioned the safety of food-grade TiO 2 (fgTiO 2; also termed E171) primarily citing unresolved genotoxicity concerns. Based on this, European Commission member states agreed to remove fgTiO 2 as an additive in foods. This represented a seemingly pragmatic decision balancing need for this additive (e.g. aesthetics) against hypothetical risk. However, the European Commission also requested that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) evaluate the impact of removal of fgTiO 2 from the list of authorised excipients that are permitted in medicinal products. In this case, fgTiO 2 is not merely about aesthetics: it delivers opacity and protects actives from UV light degradation whilst aiding moisture control and patient compliance. The EMA concluded that any foreseeable ban, impacting the ~91,000 medicinal products that contain this pigment in Europe, risks causing pharmaceutical shortages. Moreover, they estimated that a period of 7–12 years would likely be required for implementation of suitable alternatives. Meanwhile, consumer concerns over the safety of fgTiO 2 have been expressed beyond Europe. Notably, in 2022, a class action suit was filed against the multinational food company Mars Incorporated in the USA alleging that consumers of the hard-shell candy Skittles are at heightened risk of health effects stemming from genotoxicity.

### Lung cancer and air pollution: a 27 year follow up of 16 209 Norwegian men [^116LEfWg]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The well documented urban/rural difference in lung cancer incidence and the detection of known carcinogens in the atmosphere have produced the hypothesis that long term air pollution may have an effect on lung cancer. The association between incidence of lung cancer and long term air pollution exposure was investigated in a cohort of Oslo men followed from 1972/73 to 1998.

Methods

Data from a follow up study on cardiovascular risk factors among 16 209 40 to 49 year old Oslo men in 1972/73 were linked to data from the Norwegian cancer register, the Norwegian death register, and estimates of average yearly air pollution levels at the participants' home address in 1974 to 1998. Survival analyses, including Cox proportional hazards regression, were used to estimate associations between exposure and the incidence of lung cancer.

Results

During the follow up period, 418 men developed lung cancer. Controlling for age, smoking habits, and length of education, the adjusted risk ratio for developing lung cancer was 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.15) for a 10 micro g/m(3) increase in average home address nitrogen oxide (NO(x)) exposure between 1974 and 1978. Corresponding figures for a 10 micro g/m(3) increase in sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) were 1.01 (0.94 to 1.08).

Conclusions

Urban air pollution may increase the risk of developing lung cancer.

### Lung cancer mortality in the European cohort of titanium dioxide workers: a reanalysis of the exposure-response relationship [^1137EWP4]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Animal bioassays have demonstrated convincing evidence of the potential carcinogenicity to humans of titanium dioxide (TiO 2), but limitations in cohort studies have been identified, among which is the healthy worker survivor effect (HWSE). We aimed to address this bias in a pooled study of four cohorts of TiO 2 workers.

Methods

We reanalysed data on respirable TiO 2 dust exposure and lung cancer mortality among 7341 male workers employed in TiO 2 production in Finland, France, UK and Italy using the parametric g-formula, considering three hypothetical interventions: setting annual exposures at 2.4 (U.S. occupational exposure limit), 0.3 (German limit) and 0 mg/m 3 for 25 and 35 years.

Results

The HWSE was evidenced. Taking this into account, we observed a positive association between lagged cumulative exposure to TiO 2 and lung cancer mortality. The estimated number of lung cancer deaths at each age group decreased across increasingly stringent intervention levels. At age 70 years, the estimated number of lung cancer deaths expected in the cohort after 35-year exposure was 293 for exposure set at 2.4mg/m 3, 235 for exposure set at 0.3mg/m 3, and 211 for exposure set at 0mg/m 3.

Conclusion

This analysis shows that HWSE can hide an exposure-response relationship. It also shows that TiO 2 epidemiological data could demonstrate an exposure-effects relationship if analysed appropriately. More epidemiological studies and similar reanalyses of existing cohort studies are warranted to corroborate the human carcinogenicity of TiO 2. This human evidence, when combined with the animal evidence, strengthens the overall evidence of carcinogenicity of TiO 2.

### Particulate debris from a titanium metal prosthesis induces genomic instability in primary human fibroblast cells [^111Ps11g]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

It has been hypothesised bythat lethal mutations/delayed reproductive death represents a sort of 'cleansing mechanism' removing unrepaired damage in the genome. Evidence for this has been obtained bywho examined cells from genetically different mice, which were previously shown to have different susceptibilities to cytogenetic instability. This study revealed that in the susceptible mice there was a low level of both early and delayed cell death (necrosis and apoptosis) in exposed cultures following irradiation, but in the mice that were resistant to the induction of cytogenetic instability, there was a high initial and delayed level of cell death. This strongly suggests that the death end points of genomic instability are acting to remove damaged cells from the proliferative population. In this study low-dose exposure allows greater survival of cells to express damage, reflected by the low cloning efficiency in the progeny of these cells. Thus, the delayed reproductive death observed is a measure of damage induced by titanium debris. Failure to respond to this damage by death increases the probability that the unstable cell will survive and divide. These results are very similar to those ascertained by this group for chemical carcinogens and radiation.

### Consumption of ultra-processed foods and cancer risk: results from nutriNet-santéprospective cohort [^115ABvzS]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

A second hypothesis concerns the wide range of additives contained in ultra-processed foods. Although maximum authorised levels normally protect the consumers against adverse effects of each individual substance in a given food product, the effect on health of the cumulative intake across all ingested foods and potential cocktail/interaction effects remain largely unknown. More than 250 different additives are authorised for addition to food products in Europe and the US. For some of them, experimental studies in animal or cellular models have suggested carcinogenic properties that deserve further investigation in humans. One example is titanium dioxide (TiO 2), a common food additive that contains nanoscale particles and that is used as a whitening agent or in packaging in contact with food or drinks to provide a better texture and antimicrobial properties. Experimental studies, mainly conducted in rodent models, suggest that this additive could initiate or promote the development of pre-neoplastic lesions in the colon, as well as chronic intestinal inflammation. The World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer evaluated TiO 2 as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" (group 2B). The effects of intense artificial sweeteners such as aspartame on human metabolism and on the composition and functioning of gut microbiota are also controversial. Although previous experimental studies in animals confirmed the safety of aspartame, their relevance to human health outcomes has been questioned, particularly regarding potential long term carcinogenicity. Another concern is the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines in meats containing sodium nitrite when meat is charred or overcooked. These N-nitroso compounds may be involved in causing colorectal cancer.

Thirdly, food processing and particularly heat treatments produce neoformed contaminants (for example, acrylamide) in ultra-processed products such as fried potatoes, biscuits, bread, or coffee. A recent meta-analysis found a modest association between dietary acrylamide and risk of both kidney and endometrial cancer in non-smokers. In addition, the European Food Safety Agency judged that evidence from animal studies was sufficient to classify acrylamide as genotoxic.

Lastly, bisphenol A is another contaminant suspected of migrating from plastic packaging of ultra-processed foods. Its endocrine disruptor properties led the European Chemicals Agency to judge it as "a substance of very high concern". Increasing evidence suggests involvement in the development of several non-communicable diseases, including cancer linked to endocrinal disruptors.

### Photoprotection beyond ultraviolet radiation: a review of tinted sunscreens [^114XL68c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ultraviolet radiation and visible light both have biologic effects on the skin. Visible light can induce erythema in light-skinned individuals and pigmentation in dark-skinned individuals. Broad-spectrum sunscreens protect against ultraviolet radiation but do not adequately protect against visible light. For a sunscreen to protect against visible light, it must be visible on the skin. Inorganic filters (also known as mineral filters), namely, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, are used in the form of nanoparticles in sunscreens to minimize the chalky and white appearance on the skin; as such, they do not protect against visible light. Tinted sunscreens use different formulations and concentrations of iron oxides and pigmentary titanium dioxide to provide protection against visible light. Many shades of tinted sunscreens are available by combining different amounts of iron oxides and pigmentary titanium dioxide to cater to all skin phototypes. Therefore, tinted sunscreens are beneficial for patients with visible light-induced photodermatoses and those with hyperpigmentation disorders such as melasma and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

### Consumption of ultra-processed foods and cancer risk: results from nutriNet-santéprospective cohort [^116bhSt4]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cancer represents a major worldwide burden, with 14.1 million new cases diagnosed in 2012. According to the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research, about a third of the most common neoplasms could be avoided by changing lifestyle and dietary habits in developed countries. Therefore, reaching a balanced and diversified diet (along with avoidance of tobacco use and reduction in alcohol intake) should be considered one of the most important modifiable risk factors in the primary prevention of cancer.

At the same time, during the past decades, diets in many countries have shifted towards a dramatic increase in consumption of ultra-processed foods. After undergoing multiple physical, biological, and/or chemical processes, these food products are conceived to be microbiologically safe, convenient, highly palatable, and affordable. Several surveys (in Europe, the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Brazil) assessing individual food intake, household food expenses, or supermarket sales have suggested that ultra-processed food products contribute to between 25% and 50% of total daily energy intake.

This dietary trend may be concerning and deserves investigation. Several characteristics of ultra-processed foods may be involved in causing disease, particularly cancer. Firstly, ultra-processed foods often have a higher content of total fat, saturated fat, and added sugar and salt, along with a lower fibre and vitamin density. Beyond nutritional composition, neoformed contaminants, some of which have carcinogenic properties (such as acrylamide, heterocyclic amines, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), are present in heat treated processed food products as a result of the Maillard reaction. Secondly, the packaging of ultra-processed foods may contain some materials in contact with food for which carcinogenic and endocrine disruptor properties have been postulated, such as bisphenol A. Finally, ultra-processed foods contain authorised, but controversial, food additives such as sodium nitrite in processed meat or titanium dioxide (TiO 2, white food pigment), for which carcinogenicity has been suggested in animal or cellular models.

### Immunocompetent cell targeting by food-additive titanium dioxide [^111PMUfH]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Aside from specific cells of the small intestine, there are no known circumstances under which fgTiO 2 markedly accumulates in vivo. Systemic exposure to fgTiO 2 appears to be very low. Even allowing for lifetime accumulation in humans it appears that anticipated target organs (liver and spleen) contain levels of Ti and Ti-rich particulates that are just above the tissue-free background, and the origin of this slightly enhanced signal is unknown. Consistent with this, many animal feeding studies show almost no detectable systemic accumulation of fgTiO 2, and, overall, there are no convincing ex vivo imaging studies showing multiple, heavily-loaded cells. The exception, as noted above, is the small intestine, in both humans and rodent models, and specifically their large lymphoid follicles termed Peyer's patches. In absence of afferent lymphatics, the apical surfaces of these follicles possess a unique population of microfold (M) cells that avidly sample the lumen for bulky macromolecules including small micro- and large nano- particles (herein referred to as particles). This material is passed to underlying immune cells in the apical, subepithelial dome (SED) region of the follicle which contains recognised populations of monocyte-derived, lysozyme-expressing cells termed LysoMacs and LysoDCs that are specialised for the uptake of dead cells, particulate antigens and pathogenic bacteria, in addition to their role in anti-microbial defence. Overall, the major role of Peyer's patches is initiating processes for the generation of mucosal IgA and systemic IgG in response to intestinal antigen thereby orchestrating the sequence of events that leads to gut-derived humoral immunity. Over time, fgTiO 2 is known to accumulate in Peyer's patches, alongside other persistent particles, in basally located tissue-fixed macrophages termed pigment cells. These cells are of low immunological and metabolic activity and appear to act as lifetime graveyards for persistent particles, presumably limiting systemic absorption through local sequestration in the same way that tissue-fixed macrophages sequester particulate tattoo inks. So the paradox remains: whilst fgTiO 2 is under intense regulatory scrutiny, there is no known site of accumulation in active (e.g. immunocompetent) cells that could plausibly give cause for concern or that allows informed risk assessment.

### Patch test-relevant concentrations of metal salts cause localized cytotoxicity, including apoptosis, in skin ex vivo [^111YDJFm]. Contact Dermatitis (2021). Medium credibility.

Titanium dioxide (10% or 20%) is used to determine titanium hypersensitivity even though it is accepted that false‐negative test results frequently occur owing to its poor ability to penetrate the skin. This has led the search to identify more stable, solvent‐soluble, protein‐reactive titanium salts with a greater ability to penetrate the skin for patch testing. Of the four titanium salts tested in this study, titanium isopropoxide and titanium dioxide showed mild cytotoxicity and few apoptotic bodies, whereas titanium bis(ammonium lactato)dihydroxide and calcium titanate were highly cytotoxic, showing clear separation of the epidermis from the dermis at the basement membrane zone and numerous condensed apoptotic cell nuclei within the epidermis and dermis. It has been shown that titanium dioxide nanoparticles can induce oxidative stress signalling cascades that eventually result in cell death via apoptosis. It has also been shown that titanium dioxide nanoparticles can cause plasma membrane damage and decreased mitochondrial activities. Others have shown that although titanium nanoparticles can trigger apoptosis in human gastric epithelial cells, the MTS assay used in the study indicated an increase in metabolic activity after 24 hours. This finding is in line with our results, as we also observed a slight increase in metabolic activity with increasing signs of apoptosis after titanium salt exposure. Mitochondria contain several proapoptotic molecules that activate cytosolic proteins to execute apoptosis, block antiapoptotic proteins in the cytosol, and directly cleave nuclear DNA, and therefore it can be expected that at the very early onset of apoptosis their activity increases rather than decreases. Notably, mitochondrial activity remained high even when detrimental effects on tissue histology were observed.

### Identifying occupational carcinogens: an update from the IARC monographs [^112Q4ZyP]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Results and discussion

Counting occupational carcinogens

Among the 120 agents classified in IARC Group 1, 70 included mention of occupational exposures in the monographs (figure 1). Of these 70 Group 1 agents, 63 had sufficient evidence in humans (figure 1). The other seven had indications of occupational exposure but had been upgraded to Group 1 based on mechanistic evidence when the human evidence was less than 'sufficient'. These agents were therefore excluded from our count of occupational carcinogens: ethylene oxide, dyes metabolised to benzidine, neutron radiation, benzo(a)pyrene, 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran, 4,4′-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls.

Figure 1
Defining occupational carcinogens from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs (1971–2017).

Of the 63 Group 1 agents with 'sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity' in humans, 59 evaluations were based at least in part on studies of exposed workers (figure 1). The other four agents (aflatoxins, the asbestos-like fibres erionite and fluoroedenite and fission products including Strontium-90) were excluded since occurrence of occupational exposure was noted but no occupational epidemiology data were reported.

Among these 59 retained agents, 47 were individual substances, mixtures or types of radiation and 12 were occupations, industries or processes (figure 1). Although the IARC Monographs aim to identify and evaluate specific agents, some processes, industries and occupations have been classified in Group 1 with 'sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity' in humans (table 1). These evaluations were typically produced at a time when the available data provided a clear indication of increased cancer risk in an occupational group, but not enough information to identify a causal agent. While such broadly defined carcinogenic agents can lead to general industrial hygiene interventions, provide support to compensate exposed workers and stimulate research to identify specific causes, they have limited utility for informing specific prevention activities and may be affected by changes in processes, materials and exposure levels over time.

### War journalism: an occupational exposure [^11424Dsm]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

The patient also reported that several colleagues suffered from the Balkan syndrome, a complex chronic illness characterised by disorders mainly affecting the haematopoietic system and associated with exposure to DU, chemicals, desert dust, biological agents and vaccines. This syndrome has also been observed in soldiers deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo in the late 1990s. The latter were exposed to North Atlantic Treaty Organization antitank missiles and bombs containing DU that might be linked to the development of neoplasms. However, a review of studies performed in Gulf War and Balkan veterans did not give consistent evidence of excess risks of neoplasms possibly related to exposure to DUand more recent studies on veterans deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo did not show any increase in general mortality or in cancer. In the described case, the main carcinogens to which the workers had been exposed were silica and asbestos. Silica dust, or silicon dioxide, is commonly found in nature in crystalline form as quartz or cristobalite, as well as in amorphous form; both are contained in concrete. Crystalline silica is included in the International Agency for Research on Cancer Group 1 agents carcinogenic to humans, while amorphous silica is included in the Group 3, not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. Asbestos in all forms, including actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite, chrysotile, crocidolite and tremolite is included in Group 1 of human carcinogens, with a latency of induced MM that can be up to 50 years. The time elapsed from exposure in this patient was likely sufficient for the induction of neoplastic effects.

### Association of 13 occupational carcinogens in patients with cancer, individually and collectively, 1990–2017 [^1123sjhn]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. The main issues relevant to the carcinogen analysis include the exclusion of some carcinogen exposures associated with skin cancer, such as UV exposure from sunlight, and the limited epidemiologic evidence for some cancers. Furthermore, possible unrecognized OCs, mismatching the risk-outcome pairs, exposure to multiple occupational risk factors, and interactions between occupational and other risk factors were not explicitly considered. In addition, analyzing the outcomes of each OC separately may lead to an overestimation of attributable burden, and considering multiple exposures together and treating each exposure as the first to be removed may have led to underestimation.

Chemicals of concern and toxicity mechanisms

Among the wide array of substances used in PCPs, five chemical classes stand out as particularly concerning due to their well-documented links to both human health risks and environmental harm as itemised below:

EDCs such as phthalates, parabens, triclosan and phenols, commonly used as preservatives or fragrance components. These chemicals are biologically active at low doses, with evidence showing associations between EDC exposure and earlier onset of puberty, reduced fertility, adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased risk of hormone-related cancers.
PFASs are commonly used in waterproof cosmetics, menstruation products and some creams. PFASs have been linked to immune system suppression, thyroid dysfunction and cancer risk.
VOCs are released from fragranced sprays, aerosol deodorants and hair dyes.VOCs are readily inhaled and have been associated with respiratory irritation, headaches and, in some cases, long-term neurotoxicity or carcinogenicity. Inadequate ventilation and the use of multiple products can lead to elevated indoor air concentrations, especially in enclosed or frequently used spaces. In addition to affecting the direct consumer of the PCP, VOCs can also affect nearby individuals, especially when applied in enclosed spaces including beauty salonsor daycare centres. Pertinently, many VOCs react with other molecules in the ambient environment, leading to the formation of various by-products that may exacerbate the detrimental effects of VOCs.
Heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel are frequently detected in PCPs. Prolonged exposure to these metals through daily use of cosmetics and personal care items can pose significant health risks, including cancer, neurological damage, skin disorders and other chronic conditions. Multiple studies confirmed the presence of mercury in dangerously high concentrations in almost all skin-lightening products (SLPs) tested. Mercury in particular is hazardous as it could cause kidney and liver damage, neurological problems and childhood developmental issues, posing significant health risks to users and their offspring. The 'Eliminating Mercury Skin Lightening Products (SLPs)' project was developed by UNEP and WHO as a response to the global rise of this problem.
Engineered microparticles and nanoparticles such as microplastics, silver nanoparticles and titanium dioxide are increasingly incorporated into PCPs for their antimicrobial, exfoliating or UV-protective properties. However, their small size allows them to penetrate the skin or mucosal membranes, raising concerns about cellular toxicity, oxidative stress and environmental bioaccumulation.

### Nanotechnology and health [^1179Zm11]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Occupational exposure limits for engineered nanomaterials — For carbon nanotubes and nanofibers (CNT/NF), working lifetime exposures to 0.2 to 2 μg/m3 (8-hour time-weighted average [TWA]) were estimated to be associated with a 10% excess risk of early stage lung effects, and based upon this the recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1 μg/m3 of respirable elemental carbon as an 8-hour TWA concentration. For ultrafine titanium dioxide (TiO2), NIOSH established an REL of 0.3 mg/m3 as a 10-hour TWA, derived from chronic inhalation data in ultrafine (less than 100 nm) TiO2, with levels estimated to reduce risks of lung cancer to below 1 in 1000 over a working lifetime.

### Characterization and reclassification of titanium dioxide-related pulmonary lesions [^114FBP8P]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Using current diagnostic criteria, this work summarizes the microscopic review of 16 proliferative squamous lesions, previously diagnosed as cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, in the lungs of rats from a 2-year inhalation study with pigment-grade titanium dioxide particles.

Methods

In the aftermath of two international pathology workshops designed, in part, to establish histological criteria for classifying pulmonary keratin lesions, these lesions were evaluated by four pathologists using current diagnostic criteria.

Results

Unanimous agreement was reached as to the diagnosis of each of the lesions. Two of the lesions were diagnosed as squamous metaplasia and one as a poorly keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. The remaining 13 lesions were diagnosed as non-neoplastic pulmonary keratin cysts.

Conclusions

These keratin cysts are a species-specific lesion that is unique to the rat lung under conditions of particle overload exposure.

### Titanium: an unusual allergen with various presentations – A retrospective cohort study [^112ehHmP]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

First discovered in 1791, titanium (Ti) is a light yet relatively strong metal, showing a high strength/density ratio. When exposed to air, it forms a titanium dioxide TiO 2 1–2 nm thick coating within less than a millisecond. TiO 2 acts as a barrier between the metal and air, contributing to its corrosion‐resistant properties. However, mechanical damage to the TiO 2 film exposes the metal to oxidants and water, facilitates corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement, reducing the stress intensity threshold for crack propagation.

Titanium has several routes of exposure. TiO 2 is a white powder and is the most ubiquitous form in medicine. In the nanoscale form, it has a dual behaviour towards light, absorbing and scattering photons, commonly used as a physical ultraviolet and visible light absorber in sunscreens, as well as in cosmetics and makeup for its high opacity and brightness.

Titanium is considered biocompatible, wear resistant, non‐corrosive and integrates well in the bone tissue. It is commonly used in the medical field in the formation of dental and orthopaedic implants, cardiac pacemakers, cardiac stents and neuromodulatory devices. Additionally, titanium is used in the formation of 'Hypo‐allergic' jewellery, mainly rings and body piercings for patients with nickel allergy, along with aluminium, vanadium and gold.

From an occupational point of view, titanium is utilised to produce strong lightweight alloys in the aerospace, military and automotive industry as well as in desalination plants and in the agri‐food industry.

Ti allergy is considered extremely rare, primarily since its main form TiO 2 does not penetrate the skin, nor is it absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, like other transition metals, it does not form covalent protein modifications accessible to the immune system. Nonetheless, as clinical cases of suspected Ti allergy emerged, it has been demonstrated that Ti ions and Ti salts from corrosion products can activate macrophages and elicit an immune response.

Diagnosing Ti allergy remains a controversial issue. While patch testing was originally conducted with the inert form TiO 2, hardly eliciting any reactions, in recent years several Ti salts, including Ti oxalate hydrate, Ti lactate, Ti isopropoxide and Ti citrate, appear to be superior candidates for patch testing in suspected Ti allergy cases.

Given the expanding use of titanium and the evolving understanding of its allergenic potential, our study aims to characterise the exposure patterns and clinical characteristics of patients with titanium contact allergy.

### A cohort mortality study among titanium dioxide manufacturing workers in the United States [^116cWwct]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Although titanium dioxide (TiO2) is generally regarded as a nontoxic mild pulmonary irritant, some laboratory studies have reported lung adenomas in rats exposed to high levels of TiO2. Limited data on health effects among humans exist. A retrospective cohort mortality study was conducted among 4241 TiO2 workers who were employed for at least 6 months, on or after January 1, 1960, at four TiO2 plants in the United States. Exposure categories, defined by plant, job title, and calendar years in the job, were created to examine mortality patterns in those jobs where the potential for TiO2 exposure is greatest. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare the mortality pattern of the workers with the general background population. Relative risks were estimated and trend tests were conducted to examine risk of disease among different exposure level groups in internal analyses. Workers experienced a significantly low overall mortality (SMR = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.8–0.9). No significantly increased SMRs were found for any specific cause of death. Deaths from lung cancer were as expected, and SMRs for this cancer did not increase with increasing TiO2 levels. Workers in jobs with greatest TiO2 exposure had significantly fewer than expected total deaths (SMR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.6–0.9). Internal analyses revealed no significant trends or exposure-risk associations for total cancers, lung cancer, or other causes of death. Results from our study indicate that the exposures at these United States plants are not associated with increases in the risk of death from cancer or other diseases. Moreover, workers with likely higher levels of TiO2 exposure had similar mortality patterns to those with less exposure, as internal analyses among workers revealed no increase in mortality by level of TiO2 exposure.

Do birth control pills cause cancer?

It is not known if hormonal birth control pills cause breast cancer. Some studies, but not all, suggest that there could be a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer among current users with longer duration of use.

If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

What if I want to become pregnant?

You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill.

What should I know about my period when taking Introvale?

When you take Introvale, which has a 91-day extended dosing cycle, you should have 4 scheduled periods a year (bleeding when you are taking the 7 white pills). However, you will probably have more bleeding or spotting between your scheduled periods than if you were using a birth control pill with a 28-day dosing cycle. During the first Introvale 91-day treatment cycle, about 1 in 3 women may have 20 or more days of unplanned bleeding or spotting. This bleeding or spotting tends to decrease with time. Do not stop taking Introvale because of this bleeding or spotting. If the spotting continues for more than 7 days in a row or if the bleeding is heavy, call your healthcare provider.

What are the ingredients in Introvale?

Active ingredients: Each peach pill contains levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol.

Inactive ingredients:

Peach pills: lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, povidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, talc, iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red and iron oxide black.

White pills: lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, povidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, talc and titanium dioxide.

### Occupational exposure and mortality among workers at three titanium dioxide plants [^115ZqJyu]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A cohort of 3,607 workers employed in three DuPont titanium dioxide production facilities was followed from 1935 through 2006.

Methods

Combined and plant-specific cohort mortality was compared with the overall US population and other DuPont employees. The relationships between selected causes of death and annual cumulative exposures to titanium dioxide and chloride were investigated using Poisson regression methods to examine trends with increasing exposure.

Results

Among the 833 deaths, no causes of deaths were statistically significantly elevated either overall or plant-specific when compared to the US population. Compared to DuPont workers, statistically significantly elevated SMRs for all causes, all cancers, and lung cancers were found driven by the workers at the oldest plant. Comparing increasing exposure groups to the lowest group, disease risk did not increase with exposure.

Conclusions

There was no indication of a positive association between occupational exposure and death from all causes, all cancers, lung cancers, non-malignant respiratory disease, or all heart disease.

### Immunocompetent cell targeting by food-additive titanium dioxide [^111ysM1o]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A model for cogent risk assessment

Finally, we note that the particulate-accumulating population of apical SED cells is clearly (i) immunocompetent (i.e. non-quiescent) based upon their migration characteristics, expression of cell surface immunoregulatory PD-L1 and their previously-described qualities in terms of antimicrobial defence, and (ii) capable of becoming heavily loaded with fgTiO 2. Indeed, the exquisite particle selectivity for this tissue region means that the concentration gradient for area-corrected reflectance signal was ~14-fold higher than for the Peyer's patch overall and, therefore, ~1245 fold higher than that of villous mucosa (Supplementary Fig. 15). Given that the particulate-loaded phagocytic cells make up only a minority of the SED, then the per-cell concentration of fgTiO 2 is very high (Supplementary Movie 1).

We know of no other active particle-funnelling and specific cell-targeting strategy elsewhere in mammalian biology so it is very likely that SED LysoMacs and LysoDCs provide the only target to enable highly sensitive, single-cell risk assessment of fgTiO 2 and other persistent oral particulates in vivo. By exemplification, we addressed the question of whether fgTiO 2 could initiate or augment inflammatory signaling in the ileum / Peyer's patches of wild type mice: a long standing question in the field. The clear answer was no, at least in wild-type genotypes, despite some in vitro evidence to the contrary. To explain such differences it is worth noting that cell culture studies fail to replicate in vivo fidelity in many ways including rates of particle uptake, presence of functional lymphatics and vasculature, cellular cross-talk, compensatory mechanisms and cell migration prior to particle saturation (cell gorging). Whatever the reasons, after decades of uncertainty, other questions regarding the safety of persistent oral particles can now be precisely addressed using in vivo studies with human-relevant dosimetry and identified target cells. Indeed, understanding the consequences of LysoMac/LysoDC accumulation of persistent particles in terms of genotoxicity, adjuvanticity and any differential responses resultant from distinct host genotypes is now key to understanding human risk following oral exposure to nanoparticles and microparticles.

### Identifying novel causes of cancers to enhance cancer prevention: new strategies are needed [^115PRuQP]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Medium credibility.

Much concern has been raised about the possible carcinogenic effect of environmental factors occurring at low levels although in a ubiquitous fashion across populations. Examples include nutritional contaminants such as pesticides, low-level electromagnetic radiation, or water pollutants such as trihalomethanes or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Accurate measurements over the life course is challenging for such exposures. For example, air pollution was classified by the IARC Monographs program in 2013 as a group 1 carcinogen and has been estimated to account for approximately 1% of the overall cancer burden. There is, however, much uncertainty around this estimate. Similarly, radon is a recognized cause of lung cancer, in particular among never smokers, although evaluating the disease burden is challenging. Furthermore, approximately 50 substances at workplaces have been classified as carcinogenic to humans by the IARC Monographs Program, with many of these also occurring in the natural environment or through industrial waste disposal, but at much lower exposure levels. The cancer research community has been less successful at identifying important effects for such environmental carcinogens. This may be because such effects are modest and unlikely to be driving an important part of the cancer burden. It could also be because many environmental exposures are extremely difficult to measure. Furthermore, epidemiological studies are poor at studying ubiquitous effects that we are all exposed to. For example, if every adult in a population smoked 20 cigarettes a day, then the disease burden from this habit would be immense, but a standard epidemiological study would be unsuccessful in shining any light on this link. This illustrates the limits of epidemiology focused on individual exposures and the need for alternative complementary lines of evidence for carcinogen identification and assessment. Formal triangulation of evidence across different domains — all of which may yield biased findings, but where biases would be unrelated across the various approaches — is one approach that could assist causal inference.

3.4.2 Cancer

Cancer is a major disease endpoint of great concern in part because the profession of industrial painter was classified by IARC as a Group 1 human carcinogen; however, the exact carcinogens are poorly documented. In our review, we identified nine Part B chemicals in NEPCOAT products that have been classified as IARC Group I (known) or Group IIB (possible) human carcinogens by IARC (Table 3). Crystalline silica and ethanol, commonly used in coating and paint formulations, are classified as Group I carcinogen by IARC. The list of compounds in Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans, includes titanium dioxide, 4‐chlorobenzotrifluoride, carbon black, naphthalene, ethyl benzene, methyl isobutyl ketone, and cumene. The association between gastric cancer and occupational exposure to aromatic amines was examined in an analysis of 11 studies from the stomach cancer pooling project (StoP) reporting an increased rate of intestinal cancers with an OR 1.83 (95% CI 1.09–3.06). An epidemiological study demonstrated that workers exposed to respirable TiO 2 dust from six European countries had a higher incidence of lung cancer than the general population.

Table 3
Carcinogens identified in Part B of coating systems according to the IARC classification.

Carcinogenicity from solvent exposures is well documented. Occupational exposure to organic solvents used in paints has been associated with bladder tumors, multiple myeloma, and kidney and other urothelial tumors in spray painters. Evidence of carcinogenicity from MIK, which is based on increased renal tubule neoplasms, mononuclear cell leukemia, and liver neoplasms in animals, has been reported by the National Toxicology Program (NTP). In vivo and in vitro studies point to the ability of toluene to promote cancer and genotoxicity.

### Metabolomic profiling identifies plasma sphingosine 1-phosphate levels associated with welding exposures [^113SLrgP]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins metal materials by melting parts with high heat followed by fusion after cooling. Heating metals above their melting points generate potentially hazardous vapours and fine particle condensates, and the occupational hazards of welding includes such toxic fumes and gases as well as ultraviolet radiation, electromagnetic fields and coexposure to asbestos and harmful solvents. The type and extent of exposure relate to the process performed, material used, ventilation and enclosure of the space, and use of personal protective equipment. Welding puts approximately 11 million welders worldwide at risk and exposes around 110 million additional workers to welding-related toxins.

Welding exposure has many known adverse health effects. Welding fumes and ultraviolet radiation have been classified as group 1 carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancerand are associated with increased risks of ocular cancer, lung cancer and liver cancer. Welding fumes also cause occupational respiratory diseases. Rhinitis and laryngitis can develop from deposition of large particles in the upper respiratory tract and absorption of soluble gases, including sodium dioxide by mucus membranes of the upper respiratory tract; bronchitis can develop when particulates of ≤ 2.5 µm are deposited in bronchioles and parenchyma. Epidemiological studies have also shown associations between welding fumes and systemic inflammation, DNA damage biomarkers, heart rate variabilityand epigenetic effects.

There are exposure limits for specific materials used in welding but no Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) occupational exposure limit for generic welding fume exposure due to variation in welding materials and methods. There is also a knowledge gap with regard to the dose–response relationship of welding fumes on disease risk, and there is limited information about how welding fume exposure may affect the human metabolome.

Metabolomics is a powerful analytical approach to reveal physiological and pathological metabolic alterations. It can be used to identify disease biomarkers and pathophysiological mechanisms using biological samples. Metabolomics can be a rigorous tool to study the toxicology of welding fume exposure and the mechanism of disease development. However, to achieve rigour, biological variation from interpersonal and intrapersonal (eg, circadian rhythm) sources must be sufficiently controlled. This represents the major challenge affecting studies linking metabolic alterations to environmental exposures. In this study, we examine the metabolic profile associated with welding fume exposure controlled via comparison to a time-matched point on a day without exposure. Also, we assessed the profile of differentially expressed metabolites during exposure, as well as overnight profiles before and after the exposure.

### Exposure-associated DNA methylation among people exposed to multiple industrial pollutants [^112HMA2C]. Clinical Epigenetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this study, we applied a precision environmental health approach in a highly polluted industrial community and identified DNA methylation probes that could serve as surrogate markers for early effects of multiple-industrial-pollutant exposure, three SNPs that could potentially be used to identify vulnerable populations more susceptible to multiple-industrial-pollutant exposure, and gene-environment interactions that linked multiple-pollutant exposure with epigenetic changes and biological pathways related to adverse health outcomes such as increased oxidative stress and cancer. Our findings characterized the complexity of exposure and health impacts and can provide information for risk prediction models and the development of precision prevention and intervention strategies in this area.

### Exposure reconstruction and risk analysis for six semiconductor workers with lymphohematopoietic cancers [^114FSRuN]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether workplace exposures to recognized lymphohematopoietic carcinogens were possibly related to cancers in six semiconductor-manufacturing workers.

Methods

A job-exposure matrix was developed for chemical and physical process agents and anticipated by-products. Potential cumulative occupational exposures of the six cases were reconstructed. The role of workplace exposures in cancer was evaluated through quantitative risk assessment and by comparison with epidemiological literature.

Results

Two workers were potentially exposed to agents capable of causing their diagnosed cancers. Reconstructed exposures were similar to levels in outdoor environments and lower than exposures associated with increased risks in epidemiological studies. Cancer risks were estimated to be less than 1 in 10,000 persons.

Conclusions

The development of cancer among the six workers was unlikely to be explained by occupational exposures to recognized lymphohematopoietic carcinogens.

### Preventable exposures associated with human cancers [^111NiRCz]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2011). Low credibility.

Information on the causes of cancer at specific sites is important to cancer control planners, cancer researchers, cancer patients, and the general public. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monograph series, which has classified human carcinogens for more than 40 years, recently completed a review to provide up-to-date information on the cancer sites associated with more than 100 carcinogenic agents. Based on IARC's review, we listed the cancer sites associated with each agent and then rearranged this information to list the known and suspected causes of cancer at each site. We also summarized the rationale for classifications that were based on mechanistic data. This information, based on the forthcoming IARC Monographs Volume 100, offers insights into the current state-of-the-science of carcinogen identification. Use of mechanistic data to identify carcinogens is increasing, and epidemiological research is identifying additional carcinogens and cancer sites or confirming carcinogenic potential under conditions of lower exposure. Nevertheless, some common human cancers still have few (or no) identified causal agents.

### Signaling pathways required for macrophage scavenger receptor-mediated phagocytosis: analysis by scanning cytometry [^114EHXw7]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Lung infection is responsible for more disability-adjusted life years lost than any other disease and high levels of inhaled dusts have been linked in several epidemiological studies to increases in ear and airway infections, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer and mortality. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are a first line of defense against inhaled bacteria and environmental dusts. Therefore, understanding the mechanism by which AMs defend against inhaled insults is crucial. Since contact with inhaled particles often takes place before an antibody response has occurred or with particles for which specific antibodies are not readily made, the AM relies on innate receptors to recognize inhaled particles.

Scavenger receptors (SRs) are a key component of the innate immune system. In addition to their well-known role in low-density lipoprotein metabolism, SRs play a critical role in AM clearance of inhaled particles by binding and allowing the cells to internalize unopsonized microorganisms, apoptotic bodies and environmental dusts. General blockade of SRs using polyanionic inhibitors results in a dramatic reduction of AM uptake of residual oil fly ash, ambient air particles, diesel dust, iron oxide, titanium dioxide, silica, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Specific blockade and transfection of members of the SR family have shown these receptors to be capable of binding several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as isolated lipopolysaccharide and lipotechoic acid. In addition, mice deficient in SR-A or MARCO demonstrate reduced bacterial clearance, increased pulmonary inflammation and increased mortality following an intranasal challenge with Streptococcus Pneumoniae. Furthermore, MARCO can bind CpG DNA, whereas blockade of MARCO with a monoclonal antibody dramatically reduces AM uptake of titanium dioxide, iron oxide, silica and latex beads. SR-A and MARCO, therefore, are clearly critical components of pulmonary host defense. However, it is important to point out that AMs also express several other less well-characterized SRs including LOX-1, SR-PSOX and SRCL. These SRs are capable of binding bacteria and might also contribute to the AM response to inhaled insults.

### Cancer risks in aluminum reduction plant workers: a review [^116sNzGE]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

OTHER EXPOSURES

Both CTPVs and PAHs arise mainly from the electrodes, but potroom emissions also derive from the cryolite baths (which contain aluminum salts with fluorides), from the alumina (aluminum oxide and various elements), and from other operations during the smelting process. Reported exposures are varied: aluminum fluorides, fibrous sodium aluminum tetrafluoride particles, calcium fluoride, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and dioxide, chlorine gas, trace metals (eg, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, vanadium, mercury, and nickel), silica, and phenols. Respirable and thoracic particles measured in a Norwegian aluminum smelter showed a higher abundance of large particles (diameter of ≥ 500 nm) in the Söderberg potroom air compared with the prebake one. The largest proportion of particles found in both types of potrooms was aluminum oxide–cryolite mixtures (65% of particles in the prebake potroom and 45% in the Söderberg one). The proportion of all particles that were aluminum oxides, soot, and silicates in the Söderberg potroom was at least twice that of the prebake potroom. Brass and iron/titanium oxides were also found in small amounts. Beryllium levels (around a hundredth to a tenth of the threshold limit value of 2 μg/m 3) were also measured in aluminum smelters in Norwayand in the United States. The highest concentrations were in a prebake potroom where Jamaican alumina was used.

Two other exposures have been reported regularly, but rarely studied in relation to cancer in the aluminum industry: heat and static and alternating magnetic fields. Extreme heat is a well-known hazard in metal smelting and is not considered carcinogenic as such; however, it can cause dehydration, which prevents diluting and flushing of carcinogens, and could increase their retention and an imbalance of myoglobin in organs such as the bladder and colon; dehydration also predisposes to constipation and urinary tract infections, as well as cancers of the bladderand perhaps colon. Extremely low frequency static magnetic fields between 0.1 and 10 mT have also been reported in potrooms.

### Beneath the surface: the emerging role of ultra-processed foods in obesity-related cancer [^11287jGk]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC)-defined as colorectal cancer occurring before age 50-illustrates the potential impact of UPFs. Titanium dioxide (E171), a whitening additive used extensively in UPFs, has been FDA-approved since 1966 under the assumption that it remains under 1% of food weight. However, its use has markedly increased, with children under 10 experiencing greater exposure levels than adults in the U.S. and UK. Given that obesity and gut dysbiosis are known EOCRC risk factors, E171 might play a contributory role. Additionally, Fusobacterium nucleatum, linked to colorectal cancer, exemplifies how gut dysbiosis may promote colon carcinogenesis. Besides inflammation, other pathways, such as β-catenin signaling, may also play roles in this process. Gastric cancer, another malignancy that is not associated with obesity, but is strongly linked to Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) infection. Only recently, Ebrahimi et al. reported a correlation between increased UPF consumption and heightened H. pylori infection risk. Their study, involving 150 infected patients and 302 controls, called for additional large-scale research to substantiate these findings.

### Titanium dioxide nanomaterials cause endothelial cell leakiness by disrupting the homophilic interaction of VE-cadherin [^114THWTp]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

The use of nanomaterials has raised safety concerns, as their small size facilitates accumulation in and interaction with biological tissues. Here we show that exposure of endothelial cells to TiO₂ nanomaterials causes endothelial cell leakiness. This effect is caused by the physical interaction between TiO₂ nanomaterials and endothelial cells' adherens junction protein VE-cadherin. As a result, VE-cadherin is phosphorylated at intracellular residues (Y658 and Y731), and the interaction between VE-cadherin and p120 as well as β-catenin is lost. The resulting signalling cascade promotes actin remodelling, as well as internalization and degradation of VE-cadherin. We show that injections of TiO₂ nanomaterials cause leakiness of subcutaneous blood vessels in mice and, in a melanoma-lung metastasis mouse model, increase the number of pulmonary metastases. Our findings uncover a novel non-receptor-mediated mechanism by which nanomaterials trigger intracellular signalling cascades via specific interaction with VE-cadherin, resulting in nanomaterial-induced endothelial cell leakiness.

### Epidemiology of lung cancer: smoking, secondhand smoke, and genetics [^116QJEo7]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The link between smoking and development of lung cancer has been demonstrated, not only for smokers but also for those exposed to secondhand smoke. Despite the obvious carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoking, not all smokers develop lung cancer, and conversely some nonsmokers can develop lung cancer in the absence of other environmental risk factors. A multitude of genetic factors are beginning to be explored that interact with environmental exposure to alter the risk of developing this deadly disease. By more fully appreciating the complex interrelationship between genetics and other risks the development of lung cancer can be more completely understood.

### A review and meta-analysis of occupational titanium dioxide exposure and lung cancer mortality [^1124upWR]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

A review of studies of occupational titanium dioxide (TiO2) exposure was conducted, and results from the three industry-based cohort mortality studies were summarized using meta-analysis.

Methods

Summary standardized mortality ratios (SSMR) and summary Cox regression coefficients from exposure-response models were derived using random effects models.

Results

Results from studies of 24,312 TiO2 production workers were combined. SSMRs for lung cancer, all causes, all cancer, and non-malignant respiratory disease were 1.10 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91 to 1.32), 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81 to 0.89), 0.92 (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.03), and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.71 to 1.02), respectively. For lung cancer, the summary hazard ratio for a 1mg/m year increase in cumulative exposure was 0.999 (0.997 to 1.002).

Conclusions

Consistent with other published qualitative reviews, there is no clear evidence of an association between occupational exposure to TiO2 and lung cancer.

Silicosis and silica dust — associations with lung cancer: A meta-analysis "associated silicosis with a 2.4-fold increase in lung cancer mortality (95% CI, 1.6–3.7)" and, when adjusted for smoking, reported a "standardized mortality ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3–1.9". Among people without silicosis, another meta-analysis observed "relative risk, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.3", but with smoking adjustment "the overall results were null (relative risk, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8–1.3)". A dose-response meta-analysis "found that lung cancer risk increased with increased silica exposure", and "In 1997, the IARC classified crystalline silica as a human carcinogen".

### Spatial consistency of co-exposure to air and surface water pollution and cancer in China [^112ZrzUd]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Air and surface water are basics for human survival. The rapid urbanisation and industrialisation in the past century came at the price of environmental deterioration, which in turn, caused multiple hazards to population health. It is estimated that over 90% of the world population in 2021, especially those in developing countries, lived in places where the World Health Organisation (WHO) standard on fine particulate matter, with a diameter of ≤ 2.5 microns (PM 2.5), was not met. This is alarming because there is sufficient evidence to show that PM 2.5 has a causative association with lung cancer –. Other air pollutants are also gaining increased attention. For instance, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) has been linked to breast cancer, and the WHO introduced this pollutant to its monitoring database in 2022. Surface water is similar to air in some ways (for example, it is non-static, transboundary, and has multiple exposure routes,), and these pose challenges for research. While previous studies have investigated the impact of specific types of water pollution at a local level, there remains a limited understanding of the potential health effects of exposure to combined pollutants and their association with cancer incidence. The global number of cancer cases is expected to double in approximately half a century for multiple reasons, such as population aging. From a spatial perspective, studies have observed overlapping distribution patterns of various cancer types, indicating the presence of potential common environmental causes. However, the existing evidence regarding environmental carcinogenicity has been developed in a fragmented manner, lacking a comprehensive evaluation system for understanding the holistic relationship between the real-world environment and cancer.

Here, we hypothesised that air and surface water environments would be spatially connected and cancers of different types would tend to cluster in areas with poor environmental conditions. To address these hypotheses and facilitate future work, we established a spatial evaluation system that harmonises nationwide data on air, surface water, and cancer incidence in China. We also developed a graded scale of co-pollution that makes it possible to transform a complex network with multiple pollutants and multiple types of cancers to enable quantifiable evaluation of the relationships. Finally, we demonstrated the graphic consistency in air and surface water quality and cancer incidence. By reshaping cross-industry monitoring data into a minable data resource, we highlight a unique opportunity to accelerate the generation of knowledge to support the development of policies for cooperative environmental governance and disease prevention.

a – l Confocal reflectance microscopy showing the range of cellular loading in the subepithelial dome tissue region of (a – f), six randomly-drawn human and (g –l) six randomly-drawn mouse samples. After acquisition, the image-fields per specimen were manually laid out in order of lowest-to-highest fgTiO 2 SED accumulation to visually present the wide variation in fgTiO 2 cellular loading. Translucent red circle-markers were placed on thresholded reflectant foci to aid visualisation. m – p Quantitative analysis of the image-data shown in (a – l) (n = 6 mice / n = 6 humans). m Thresholded reflectance per unit tissue area (i.e. amount of fgTiO 2 per unit tissue area). n Thresholded reflectance per cell (i.e. fgTiO 2 dose per cell). o, Number of thresholded reflectant foci per cell (i.e. number of fgTiO 2 -loaded vesicles (TLV) per cell). p Thresholded reflectance signal per foci (i.e. fgTiO 2 dose per TLV). Statistical comparison of the distributions is presented in Supplementary Fig. 6 (two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum analysis). None of the sets of measured fgTiO 2 distributions were found to be entirely unique to either species. m – p By all of the quantitative measures established, feeding a murine diet supplemented with 0.0625% (w/w) fgTiO 2 for eighteen weeks provides significant overlap with measured, real-world human exposures. Scale bars: a – l = 50 μm with insets 10 μm; n = 20 μm; p = 5 μm.

### Immunocompetent cell targeting by food-additive titanium dioxide [^112Ft2pX]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this work, we have exploited the growing accessibility of machine learning methodsto enable precise analyses of complex images yielding in situ single-cell and single-vesicle data from tissue samples with full locational data retained. Particle selectivity of cellular targets in distinct tissue regions can thus be assessed. Access to quantitative single-cell and vesicle measurements provided an opportunity to compare and establish cell-dose equivalence between humans and mice. The findings move the field forward in four important areas of persistent particle exposure via the oral route, namely: (i) human relevance (ii) mechanism of absorption and intestinal distribution (iii) role in intestinal inflammation and (iv) provision of a model for cogent risk assessment.

Human relevance

The human small intestine is the only known site of cellular accumulation of dietary microparticles, as exemplified by fgTiO 2, (Fig. 1). We show here that all features of this can be qualitatively and quantitatively recapitulated in a murine model, but fully achieving this requires exposure to human-relevant microbial danger signals. Consistently, in this work, murine dosing with fgTiO 2 was undertaken in a manner that reflects real-life exposures (i.e. via the diet at relatively low levels for a long period of time). Our findings contrast with a prior study, which used bolus dosing via oral gavage or surgical intervention in fasted animals, where direct fgTiO 2 uptake via the epithelium was reported. Future work may wish to consider the necessity of natural ingestion and concomitant normal microbial exposures, versus non-physiological dosing in specific pathogen free environments, to recapitulate the human situation and address risk accurately for oral particle exposures.

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^117KDGSm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Photo-allergic contact dermatitis (CD) — patterns and testing — should prompt consultation with clinicians experienced in UV radiation and photo-patch testing; photo-allergic CD typically affects sun-exposed areas such as the face, the "V" of the anterior neck, the dorsal hands, and forearms, while typically sparing the upper eyelids, upper lip, and submental and postauricular areas. The more common cause of sunscreen sensitization is the chemical sunscreens, and titanium dioxide and zinc oxide have not been reported to cause ACD or photo-allergy; photo-patch testing requires duplicate application of allergen with occlusion and irradiation of one side to compare to the nonirradiated application.

Role in intestinal pathology

By extension of the above observations, our findings also imply that fgTiO 2 is not in itself perceived as a danger signal in the intestine of wild-type mice since a secondary (microbial) signal is still required for the acute migration. Moreover, using highly sensitive and selective protein analyses that captured a broad array of biomarkers of immuno-inflammatory signalling, we were unable to identify either direct or augmented perturbation of tissue homeostasis at the site of particle accumulation. Indeed, mammals have very likely evolved with oral exposure to other fine particles (e.g. geologically-derived and soot). Certainly, aluminosilicates, in abundance, and some forms of silica are reported in human Peyer's patches alongside titanium dioxide. Perhaps, therefore, effective compensatory mechanisms generally exist, which may include constitutive cell expression of immuno-inhibitory PD-L1 (Fig. 4v–z).

### Environmental factors associated with gastric carcinogenesis [^113SenTX]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Several modifiable environmental factors have been linked to gastric carcinogenesis but in many cases, evidence is either weak or fragmented. In this review, we interrogate the latest evidence implicating environmental factors in the development of gastric cancer.

Recent Findings

We are writing this review at a time when technological advancements are enabling scientists to effectively conduct large epidemiological studies with better tools for exposure estimations. We have highlighted risk factors that do not yet have enough evidence to be included as definite carcinogens in the International Agency for Research on Cancer monographs but have the potential for inclusion in the near future. Considered in our review are the links between gastric cancer and exposure to biomass smoke, particulate matter, occupational hazards and water contamination.

Summary

This review illustrates the need for vigilance as evidence linking gastric cancer to various environmental factors is mounting. Many of these factors are modifiable, allowing for preventive strategies that could further decrease the global burden of gastric cancer.

### Drospirenone (Slynd) [^113UUgpR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Do birth control pills cause cancer?

Hormonal contraceptives do not appear to cause breast cancer. However if you have breast cancer now, have had it in the past, or you have (or have had) another cancer that may be sensitive to hormones, do not use hormonal contraceptives.

Women who use hormonal contraceptives may have a higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners and exposure to the human papilloma virus (HPV).

What if I want to become pregnant?

You may stop taking SLYND whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking SLYND.

What should I know about my period when taking SLYND?

Some females may miss a period. Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may happen while you are taking SLYND, especially during the first few months of use. If the irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting continues or happens again after you have had regular menstrual cycles call your healthcare provider. It is important to continue taking your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy.

What if I miss my scheduled period when using SLYND?

Some females miss periods on hormonal birth control, even when they are not pregnant. However, if you go 2 or more months in a row without a period, or you miss your period after a month where you did not use all of your SLYND correctly, call you healthcare provider because you may be pregnant. Also call your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. Stop taking SLYND if you are pregnant.

What are the ingredients in SLYND?

### Immunocompetent cell targeting by food-additive titanium dioxide [^1158cNPn]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Whilst regulators in other continents / territories have not followed EFSA's 2021 decision, there is widespread agreement that the available data addressing the uptake, biological fate and effects of fgTiO 2 are insufficient –. In fact, direct toxicity of fgTiO 2 in cell culture experiments has not been consistently demonstrated, especially when conditions are carefully controlled to avoid artefactual in vitro cell gorging. In contrast, it is recognised in vitro that fgTiO 2 can modestly augment cellular responses to primary danger signals (e.g. microbe-associated molecular patterns) although cell loading of the particles needs to be relatively high. Similarly, Kirkland et al. identified any potential genotoxic activity of various titanium dioxide polymorphs as secondary to cell stress which, certainly for fgTiO 2, requires marked cell loading.

### Particulate debris from a titanium metal prosthesis induces genomic instability in primary human fibroblast cells [^112sqDZz]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

It has been well established that some metals, which are used in metal implants, have carcinogenic potential to humans when exposure occurs in their ionic form and via other routes. It has yet to be established whether metals used in metal prosthesis in particulate form have themselves the capability to cause malignant transformation of cells. This paper provides direct evidence that titanium obtained from a metal prosthesis can induce characteristics that are associated with genomic instability in the progeny of treated primary human cells. The genomic instability demonstrated in this study is marked by a reduced clonogenic survival in the progeny of treated cells 10 population doublings postexposure and a persistent level of cytogenetic abnormalities.

The clonogenic analysis demonstrates lethal mutations/delayed reproductive death in the progeny of cells treated with titanium debris. This expression of damage is similar to earlier observations that a wide range of chemicals could reduce the reproductive integrity of progeny cells for many generations following the initial acute exposure. It was observed from the clonogenic analysis that the titanium debris dilutions, which produced no apparent cytotoxicity to the initially exposed cells, allowed the survival of populations of cells, which are more prone to exhibit reproductive failure during subsequent cell divisions. For example at 1: 10 000 dilution factor of titanium debris, almost 70% of the cells survive to express the genomic instability phenotype compared with less than 30% after treatment with 1: 100 dilution. At the 1: 10 000 dilution factor the progeny shows over 50% reduction in survival compared to the initial acute toxicity, whereas 1: 100 dilution only shows less than 10% reduction compared to initial acute toxicity. Cells appear quite normal initially and show no evidence of increased cytogenetic abnormalities or reproductive failure. However for several generations of division postexposure, they begin to show high levels of nonclonal cytogenetic aberrations and reproductive failure. Consequently, low-dose exposure may have important consequences. This has been observed for all agents tested so far which show inducible genomic instability. The mechanism of induction and transmission of these effects is unknown but persistent oxidative stress has been documented in murine haemopoietic cells. The perpetuation of the observed insidious damage expressed in an ' in vivo ' situation may be prompted by the induction of reactive oxygen species. Metal prosthesis may elicit an inflammatory response whereby macrophages accumulate at the site of injury. During phagocytosis the macrophages generate highly reactive oxygen metabolites. This increase in production of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals as well as released lysomal hydrolyses by activated macrophages may augment cellular damage. These oxidative species may also oxidise titanium peroxy compounds that eventually degrade into titanium dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. Further decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and titanium oxide creates the highly detrimental hydroxyl radical and superoxide.

### Oral antibiotic use and early-onset colorectal cancer: findings from a case-control study using a national clinical database [^113JQWKy]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In our study, we observed more participants with CRC had rectal cancer in the younger rather than the older cohort. A study investigating USA early-onset CRC trends suggest rectal cancer incidence in the young is increasing more rapidly than colon cancer; by 2030, they predict incidence of colon and rectal cancer will increase by 90% and 124% among patients aged 20–34 years. A possible association may exist between sexually transmitted infections and early-onset rectal cancer; Chlamydia infections have malignant potential and secondary rectal infection is common. A review of clinical and molecular features of early-onset CRC suggests distal colon and rectal cancer are predominantly features of early-onset CRC, whereas proximal cancers tend to feature in later-onset disease. Despite this, it is likely that sporadic early and later-onset CRC are otherwise indistinguishable in terms of genomics and biology. The embryological origins of the proximal colon (midgut) and distal colon and rectum (hindgut) are different, as are biological features of cancers arising in these areas; proximal have more microsatellite instability, and distal more chromosomal instability. Together with differences in the luminal contents and microbiome, it is biologically plausible that antibiotic consumption could influence the development of colonic and rectal cancer differentially by location.

There are multiple elements likely to be driving the increase in early-onset CRC including dietary factors — such as increased consumption of red and processed meat, monosodium glutamate, titanium dioxide and high-fructose corn syrup; obesity; stress; reduced exercise; and antibiotic consumption. There is a scarcity of studies investigating early-life exposures and adult-onset cancers, although the aforementioned factors at interplay are known to have adverse effects on the microbiome. In addition, lifestyle changes occurring since the 1950s correlate with the increased rates of CRC, especially among the young. Evidence of possible carcinogenic effects of antibiotics are limited, yet some antibiotics commonly up-regulate cyclooxygenase-2 — a mechanism proven to promote development of CRC. Furthermore, it is the antibiotic-induced microbiome changes which disrupt immunostimulatory bacteria and give rise to pathogenic colonisation which is likely to be carcinogenic, rather than the actual medications themselves.
