## Question

patient with blood pressure 204/98 and body aches work up

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a patient who presents with blood pressure of 204/98 mmHg and nonspecific body aches. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and whether this is hypertensive emergency versus severe hypertension without acute target organ damage. Then, I should verify the reliability of the blood pressure measurement and the role of pain or anxiety. Next, I will examine for acute target organ injury with a focused history, exam, and selective testing. After that, I need to decide on disposition and whether to initiate oral therapy in the ED. Finally, I will plan outpatient confirmation of hypertension, secondary workup, and follow-up, and I will double-check special scenarios like suspected primary aldosteronism before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical category, because I need to ensure I am not missing a hypertensive emergency. A blood pressure of 204/98 mmHg meets criteria for severe hypertension, but the presence of nonspecific body aches alone does not establish acute target organ damage; hypertensive emergency requires evidence of acute injury to brain, heart, kidneys, or vasculature, so I should not jump to IV therapy based on symptoms alone without corroborating findings [^113mrAbU] [^116KMAPg].

> Wait, let me verify the reliability of the blood pressure reading before labeling this as severe hypertension. I should repeat the measurement after 5 minutes of seated rest, use appropriate cuff size, and confirm with a second reading because ED measurements are variable and can be influenced by pain, anxiety, and improper technique. Two properly spaced measurements are generally sufficient for screening in the ED, and short observation often shows a spontaneous decline without medication [^112XwvTL] [^1154D592] [^113YZ9HF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "body aches" implying end-organ injury. I need to check for red flags that would convert this to hypertensive emergency. I will now examine for neurologic deficits, altered mental status, severe headache, visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, oliguria, or focal weakness, and I should review vitals, fundi, lungs, heart, abdomen, and extremities for signs of encephalopathy, papilledema, pulmonary edema, ischemia, or edema, because these findings would mandate urgent IV therapy and ICU-level monitoring rather than outpatient management [^113mrAbU] [^111YEGHW] [^116KMAPg].

> Let me consider the role of pain and anxiety in elevating blood pressure, since nonspecific body aches could be contributory. Pain and distress commonly raise BP in the ED, and unless there is evidence of acute organ injury, rapid BP lowering is not indicated; instead, I should treat pain, provide reassurance, and re-measure, recognizing that ED BP can still be informative for undiagnosed hypertension on follow-up, though confirmation should occur outside the acute setting when possible [^113YZ9HF] [^112Qbwyn].

> Next, I should review what testing is appropriate in the ED for severe hypertension without suspected organ injury. Routine labs such as CBC, urinalysis, ECG, and chest radiograph are not required in asymptomatic patients, but I should obtain a basic metabolic panel to screen for kidney injury in selected patients, especially if follow-up is uncertain, because new or worsening renal dysfunction can change disposition; if the patient is entirely asymptomatic and reliable for follow-up, no ED testing may be necessary beyond repeat BP confirmation [^115oxif7] [^111vnjzT] [^1133Yf5p].

> I should double-check the disposition decision. If there is no evidence of acute target organ injury, hospitalization is not indicated; discharge with close follow-up is appropriate, and I should arrange follow-up within 1–2 weeks for BP confirmation and risk stratification, while ensuring the patient understands warning symptoms and has a clear return plan; this aligns with ED policies and contemporary guidance that discourage routine ED intervention in asymptomatic severe hypertension [^113QfQpx] [^1167KEwW] [^113mrAbU].

> Now, regarding acute pharmacologic therapy, I need to ensure I do not over-treat. Rapid IV lowering is contraindicated without hypertensive emergency, and even oral intensification in the ED is generally unnecessary unless the patient has poor follow-up or high-risk features; if I do initiate therapy, it should be gradual with oral agents and not aimed at normalizing BP in the ED, given risks of hypoperfusion and lack of outcome benefit from aggressive acute lowering in asymptomatic patients [^115p1R2n] [^113rVSSo] [^112hkdVW].

> Let me think about confirming the diagnosis of hypertension after the acute episode resolves. I should arrange out-of-office BP monitoring with home BP or ambulatory BP monitoring when feasible, because diagnosis requires multiple properly measured readings over time; if out-of-office monitoring is not available, repeating office BP in 1–4 weeks is reasonable, and I should document persistence before labeling hypertension and starting chronic therapy [^117VXvtQ] [^11737FXY] [^111McRkr].

> Next, I should review the initial outpatient workup once hypertension is confirmed. I need to obtain a 12-lead ECG to screen for LVH or ischemia, and basic labs including BMP, urinalysis, and glucose or A1c to assess for kidney injury, proteinuria, and diabetes. I should also consider lipid testing for cardiovascular risk assessment, while tailoring additional tests to clinical suspicion for secondary causes rather than ordering broad panels indiscriminately [^113pLW7Y] [^1134nmk5] [^117VXvtQ].

> But wait, what if features suggest secondary hypertension? I should confirm whether any are present before assuming essential hypertension. Clues include onset before age 30, resistant hypertension, disproportionate target organ damage, unprovoked hypokalemia, adrenal incidentaloma, or suggestive symptoms; in such cases, I should consider screening for primary aldosteronism, renovascular disease, pheochromocytoma, or other secondary etiologies and refer to appropriate specialists when suspicion is high, ideally before starting agents that confound testing when clinically safe [^112MzYeT] [^114RBgUE] [^115pQeUo].

> Hold on, I should verify medication choices and timing if I suspect primary aldosteronism. If screening is warranted and the patient is asymptomatic and stable, it is reasonable to delay starting RAAS-modifying agents until after obtaining samples to avoid false negatives; conversely, if the patient is symptomatic or there is hypertensive emergency, I should not withhold necessary therapy and instead interpret results in the context of ongoing treatment, coordinating with endocrinology or nephrology for confirmatory testing and targeted management [^1174eenH] [^1141eRKK] [^1117P5Am].

> I will now examine follow-up cadence and BP targets to ensure safe, evidence-based control. For newly diagnosed or uncontrolled hypertension, reassessment every 2–4 weeks with medication titration is reasonable until at goal, with a general target of less than 130/80 mmHg for most adults and less than 130/80 mmHg for those with diabetes or CKD, while individualizing for frailty, comorbidities, and tolerability. Shared decision-making and adherence support are essential to sustained control [^116VRena].

> Let me reconsider the initial concern about "body aches" one more time to avoid anchoring bias. In the absence of focal neurologic deficits, chest pain, dyspnea, visual changes, or altered mentation, nonspecific musculoskeletal pain does not constitute acute target organ injury, and therefore this presentation remains severe hypertension without hypertensive emergency; my plan to avoid rapid BP lowering, confirm measurements, perform selective testing, and arrange timely follow-up is consistent with current ED policies and hypertension guidelines [^113QfQpx] [^113mrAbU] [^116KMAPg].

For a patient with BP 204/98 mmHg and body aches, **first confirm BP with repeat measurements** [^112XwvTL] and assess for acute target organ injury (neurologic deficits, chest pain, dyspnea, vision changes, renal dysfunction) [^113mrAbU]. If no injury is present, **do not initiate acute BP lowering** [^113QfQpx]; instead, address pain/anxiety, arrange close outpatient follow-up within 1 week [^1167KEwW], and start or adjust oral antihypertensives as needed [^113QfQpx]. If injury is suspected, **admit for IV therapy and monitoring** [^111YEGHW]. Routine ED labs/ECG are not required without symptoms [^111vnjzT]; obtain BMP, urinalysis, and ECG only if results will change management or if follow-up is uncertain [^115oxif7].

---

## Initial assessment and confirmation of blood pressure

- **Repeat BP measurements**: Confirm with 2–3 readings after 5 minutes of rest [^112XwvTL]; ED measurements can be variable [^112XwvTL].

- **Proper technique**: Use appropriate cuff size and calibrated equipment [^notfound].

- **Document trends**: Note any decline with observation or analgesia/anxiolysis [^1154D592].

---

## Evaluation for acute target organ injury (TOD)

Assess for acute TOD — the key determinant of urgency — using a **focused history and exam** to screen for neurologic deficits, chest pain, dyspnea, vision changes, and renal dysfunction [^113mrAbU]. Routine ED testing (serum creatinine, urinalysis, ECG) is not required unless results will change management or follow-up is uncertain [^111vnjzT] [^115oxif7]. If acute TOD is suspected, **admit for IV therapy and monitoring** [^111YEGHW].

---

## Management of asymptomatic severe hypertension (no acute TOD)

- **No acute BP lowering**: Rapid reduction can cause harm; avoid IV agents [^113mrAbU] [^115p1R2n].

- **Address pain/anxiety**: Treat contributing factors and reassess BP [^1167KEwW].

- **Oral therapy**: Start or adjust oral antihypertensives if appropriate; avoid rapid-acting agents [^1138gF2X].

- **Disposition**: Discharge with close follow-up within 1 week [^1167KEwW]; provide education and a home BP log [^1167KEwW].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is indicated when **acute TOD** is present (neurologic deficits, chest pain, dyspnea, vision changes, or renal dysfunction) [^111YEGHW]. Admission is also appropriate when reliable follow-up is unlikely or adherence is doubtful, and when severe comorbidities (e.g. heart failure, CKD) complicate management [^1167KEwW].

---

## Recommended diagnostic tests

| **Test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Basic metabolic panel (BMP) | - Suspected renal dysfunction <br/> - Poor follow-up [^111vnjzT] |
| Urinalysis | - Suspected renal involvement <br/> - Poor follow-up [^notfound] |
| 12-lead ECG | - Suspected cardiac involvement <br/> - Poor follow-up [^notfound] |
| Chest X-ray | Only if respiratory symptoms or cardiac involvement suspected [^notfound] |
| Troponin | Only if chest pain or cardiac ischemia suspected [^111q6zeP] |

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Emphasize **medication adherence**, lifestyle changes (DASH, weight loss, exercise, alcohol moderation), and home BP monitoring [^117VXvtQ]. Arrange follow-up within 1 week to confirm diagnosis and adjust therapy [^1167KEwW], and provide clear return precautions for red-flag symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea, neurologic changes, vision loss) [^115np7EY].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm BP**: Repeat measurements with proper technique [^112XwvTL].

- **Assess for TOD**: Focused history and exam [^113mrAbU].

- **No acute lowering**: Avoid rapid BP reduction without TOD [^115p1R2n].

- **Oral therapy**: Start or adjust as indicated [^116dgfKc].

- **Disposition**: Discharge with close follow-up unless TOD or poor follow-up [^1167KEwW].

- **Education**: Emphasize adherence, lifestyle, and home BP monitoring [^116VRena].

---

For a patient with BP 204/98 mmHg and body aches, **confirm BP, exclude acute TOD, avoid rapid BP lowering, treat pain/anxiety, start oral therapy if needed, and arrange close follow-up**; hospitalize only if TOD is present or follow-up is unreliable.

Patients with severely increased blood pressure often present to the emergency department. Emergency physicians evaluate and treat hypertension in various contexts, ranging from the compliant patient with well-controlled blood pressure to the asymptomatic patient with increased blood pressure to the critically ill patient with increased blood pressure and acute target-organ deterioration. Despite extensive study and national guidelines for the assessment and treatment of chronically increased blood pressure, there is no clear consensus on the acute management of patients with severely increased blood pressure. In this article, we examine the broad spectrum of disease, from the asymptomatic to critically ill patient, and the dilemma it creates for the emergency physician in deciding how and when in the process to intervene.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — randomized clonidine dosing — showed no short-term benefit from aggressive loading and highlighted risks of rapid reduction. In 74 asymptomatic patients with diastolic blood pressure 116 to 139 mm Hg, repeated clonidine dosing required a diastolic decrease by 20 mm Hg or to 105 mm Hg before discharge, yet there was no clinically important difference in blood pressure response or clinical outcome between study groups during 7 days; case reports describe poor outcomes precipitated by rapidly lowering elevated pressures in asymptomatic patients, many associated with nifedipine.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — screening for end-organ damage — has limited evidence supporting common tests. A negative urine dip stick for both protein and hematuria in 143 ED patients with hypertension ruled out acute elevation in creatinine with sensitivity 100% and 95% confidence interval [CI] 83% to 100%; in a 1978 review of 116 patients who had routine chest radiographs and ECGs, only 2 of the 116 led to therapeutic or diagnostic interventions and none influenced hypertensive management, leading to the conclusion that routine chest radiographs and ECGs could not be defended in the workup of hypertension.

Secondary hypertension — prevalence, when to screen, and initial work-up are outlined as follows: The prevalence of secondary hypertension is reported to be 5–15% of people with hypertension. Screening all hypertensive patients is not feasible or cost-effective; screening should be considered after confirming elevated BP with ABPM in patients whose features should raise suspicion, including younger patients (< 40 years) with grade 2 hypertension or onset in childhood, acute worsening hypertension in previously documented chronically stable normotension, resistant hypertension, severe (grade 3) hypertension or a hypertension emergency, presence of extensive hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), clinical or biochemical features suggestive of endocrine causes of hypertension or chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical features of obstructive sleep apnoea, or symptoms/family history of phaeochromocytoma. Most screening can be undertaken with blood and urine tests, abdominal ultrasound, and echocardiography, and referral to a specialist centre is recommended to confirm a suspected diagnosis and for clinical management.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: core curriculum 2024 [^117BqjS3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite confirmed adherence to 3 first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with 4 or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement as well as excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension. Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate for and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential. New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^111PpqVN]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is frequently treated as essential hypertension. However, secondary causes of hypertension should be considered, because distinct treatments are used for different causes of hypertension. Primary aldosteronism is considered a candidate for the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Despite the effects of many antihypertensive agents on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ongoing efforts to manage hypertension should not be discontinued solely for the purposes of screening. If a patient presents with new or untreated hypertension, screening should be considered before starting antihypertensive agents that could affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

### Current diagnosis and management of hypertensive emergency [^113hBaaB]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24–48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.

Asymptomatic hypertension in adult emergency department (ED) patients — patient management recommendations are stated as follows: "Level A recommendations. None specified". Under "Level B recommendations". the policy states: "Initiating treatment for asymptomatic hypertension in the ED is not necessary when patients have follow-up", "Rapidly lowering blood pressure in asymptomatic patients in the ED is unnecessary and may be harmful in some patients", and "When ED treatment for asymptomatic hypertension is initiated, blood pressure management should attempt to gradually lower blood pressure and should not be expected to be normalized during the initial ED visit". "Level C recommendations. None specified". The page also notes that "one third of patients with diastolic blood pressures greater than 95 mm Hg on initial ED visit have been found to normalize before arranged follow-up", and that "the emergency physician may provide the greatest benefit to the patient by identifying the patient at risk with an elevated blood pressure and advising them to arrange prompt and definitive follow-up with their primary physician".

Emergency department (ED) blood pressure measurement count — "According to JNC 7, at least 2 measurements of blood pressure should be obtained in the office setting after the patient has been sitting quietly in a chair for at least 5 minutes". Although "such controlled conditions are difficult to reproduce in an ED", "evidence from several studies suggests that 2 separate blood pressure measurements in the ED setting are adequate for screening patients with elevated blood pressure readings". In a protocol, "Of the 203 patients enrolled, 71 patients had an elevated initial blood pressure measurement" and "Although the protocol involved 3 separate blood pressure measurements, post hoc analysis revealed that 68 of 71 hypertensive patients would have been detected if only 2 blood pressure measurements were obtained". Interobserver variability was shown when "Edmonds et al12 prospectively followed 140 ED patients who had vital signs measured by 2 independent observers", finding "a mean difference between observers of 1.3 mm Hg and an expected range of agreement of 24.2 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure", and overall, "in the ED, 2 blood pressure measurements are adequate for screening purposes".

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the Evaluation and management of Patients with syncope: executive Summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^116pTeU9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic syndromes — diagnostic definitions and thresholds are described as follows: Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome with frequent, recurrent, or persistent lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue upon standing; symptoms can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension (OH), or syncope, and individuals have ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture. Orthostatic tachycardia is a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position, or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age. OH is a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture. Initial (immediate) OH is a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope. Classic OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of assuming upright posture. Delayed OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or ≥ 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop; the fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111EyfB8]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies — acute management and follow-up — are guided by identifying affected target organs and any precipitating cause, defining the recommended timescale and magnitude of blood pressure (BP) lowering, and selecting the type of BP-lowering treatment; in a hypertensive emergency, intravenous (i.v.) treatment with a drug with a short half-life is ideal with facilities for continuous haemodynamic monitoring. Rapid uncontrolled BP lowering is not recommended as this can lead to complications. Intravenous drug administration is recommended for most hypertension emergencies, but oral therapy with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers is sometimes very effective in malignant hypertension; low initial doses should be used and treatment should take place in hospital. For prognosis and follow-up, we recommend frequent, at least monthly, visits in a specialized setting until the optimal target BP is achieved and long-term specialist follow-up thereafter.

Hypertension is the most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, but many are underdiagnosed and lack treatment control.
Hypertension in the Emergency Department is commonly observed, but mostly used for short term evaluation.
The utility of blood pressure measured at the Emergency Department as a screening tool for undiagnosed hypertension is uncertain.

What this study adds

In patients without hypertension a blood pressure ≥ 160/100 mmHg at an ED visit can reveal undiagnosed hypertension in one third of the patients.
Blood pressure measured at the emergency department might be used as a screening tool for hypertension.

### Evaluation and management of hypertensive emergency [^116KMAPg]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly when acute organ injury is present. Careful and effective strategies to reduce blood pressure and diminish the effects of pressure-mediated injury are essential. While the selection of specific antihypertensive medications varies little across different forms of hypertensive emergencies, the intensity of blood pressure reduction to the target pressure differs substantially. Treatment hinges on balancing the positive effects of lowering blood pressure with the potential for negative effects of organ hypoperfusion in patients with altered autoregulatory mechanisms. When patients do not have acute organ injury in addition to severe hypertension, they benefit from a conservative, outpatient approach to blood pressure management. In all cases, long term control of blood pressure is paramount to prevent recurrent hypertensive emergencies and improve overall prognosis. This review discusses the current evidence and guidelines on the evaluation and management of hypertensive emergency.

### Hypertensive emergencies: diagnosis and management [^111KBgwn]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension is preventive medicine. This principle applies in the emergency room as well as the clinic. However, there are crucial contrasts between these two care settings related to specific goals of management for real emergencies and nonemergency conditions. In the emergency room, rapid triage is necessary to separate those who can safely be sent home for future clinic assessment from those who require immediate interventions including short stays in 24-hour observation units or hospitalization for more serious problems. This review focuses on decisions related to hypertension management in the emergency room and over brief periods of observation and treatment. Strategy is supported by evidence-based considerations whenever possible. Where outcome studies are not available, we rely on the rationale derived from relevant clinical research.

Broader Coverage of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Aspects by Guidelines and Protocols Proposed for the Primary Clinical Conditions

The natural diagnosis sequence in patients with hypertensive emergencies is usually from the typical manifestations of the primary clinical diagnosis and not from the detection of high BP. The management of BP is one among several steps of care in such conditions, and frequently the intervention over BP is secondary or even not considered in guidelines for the primary diagnoses.

Summary

What is known about this topic
Management of hypertensive crisis varies across presentations and is based on available resources and local expertise.
Heterogeneous terminologies used in the literature to categorize hypertensive crisis states pose challenges to the exact assessment of epidemiology and evidence synthesis.
High-quality evidence is either missing or where available does not conclusively favour specific management strategies.

What does this study add
This paper critically reviews the available evidence base including various guidelines available for the management of hypertensive crises.
We propose to categorize hypertensive crisis into acute severe hypertension, malignant/ accelerated hypertension, and hypertensive emergencies based on pathophysiology.
We provide a practical framework for the diagnosis and management of hypertensive crisis based on the available evidence and expert opinion, which can be adapted to specific clinical settings.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^114Rbi1q]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension evaluation — "Is secondary cause suspected?" branch directs that if the answer is "Yes", the next steps are "Evaluate, as indicated; consider referral" followed by "Initiate treatment (go to Module B)", whereas if "No", proceed directly to "Initiate treatment (go to Module B)". Additionally, if the answer is "No" to Box 9, the pathway states to "Screen blood pressure periodically; address other CV risk factors (including healthy diet and physical activity); in patients with known or suspected target organ damage, consider possibility of masked HTN (consider HBPM or ABPM)", emphasizing ongoing screening and consideration of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).

### Association of elevated blood pressure in the emergency department with chronically elevated blood pressure [^113YZ9HF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects more than one‐third of adults in the United States, and hypertension‐related emergency department (ED) visits are increasing. 1, 2 Although the spectrum of acuity for hypertension‐related ED visits ranges widely, true hypertensive emergencies, such as acute heart failure in which acute BP reduction (< 24 hours) is warranted, are rare. 3, 4 For the much more common ED visits with asymptomatic elevated BP, rapid BP reduction can cause significant harm by impairing cerebral blood flow and has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 The American College of Emergency Physicians' policy recommendation on asymptomatic elevated BP in the ED reflects current lack of evidence to guide evaluation and treatment; based on expert opinion or panel consensus (level C evidence), it states that although all patients with asymptomatic elevated BP should be referred for follow‐up, routine ED testing and treatment are not needed but can be considered for those with poor follow‐up. 10

The risk of elevated BP after an ED visit and thresholds for classifying BP in the ED were not addressed by the American College of Emergency Physicians policy recommendation. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines revising the threshold for hypertension to 130/80 mm Hg among high‐risk patients adds urgency to addressing this evidence gap, as many ED patients are likely to meet these new criteria for hypertension and also have insufficient access to other sources of care. 11

There are several long‐standing barriers to using BP measured in the ED as part of diagnosing and treating hypertension. One barrier is uncertainty regarding the validity of BP measured in the ED. Despite some evidence to the contrary, BP measured in the ED is often disregarded because of concerns about measurement accuracy or because BP elevations attributed to pain, anxiety, or illness are presumed to be temporary and clinically unimportant. 12, 13 Questions about whether the ED can or should serve as a location of care to manage chronic diseases, such as hypertension, contribute to variation in how elevated BP in the ED is evaluated and treated. 14, 15, 16 Such variations in practice patterns due to lack of evidence are likely to result in worse health outcomes overall. 17

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^112KL5zU]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is the revision of a 2006 policy on the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure in the emergency department.1 A writing subcommittee reviewed the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians answer the following critical questions: (1) In emergency department patients with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure, does screening for target organ injury reduce rates of adverse outcomes? (2) In patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure, does emergency department medical intervention reduce rates of adverse outcomes? A literature search was performed, the evidence was graded, and recommendations were given based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature.

Emergency department scope and population — Asymptomatic elevated blood pressure: This guideline is intended for physicians working in EDs and applies to patients aged 18 years or older who present to the ED with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure without signs and symptoms of acute target organ injury. It excludes patients with signs or symptoms of acute hypertensive emergencies (eg, acute stroke, cardiac ischemia, pulmonary edema, encephalopathy, and congestive heart failure), as well as pregnant patients, those with end-stage renal insufficiency, emergent conditions likely to cause elevated blood pressure more directly related to acute target organ injury (eg, trauma, other pain syndromes), and acute presentations of serious medical conditions associated with hypertension such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — VA Cooperative Trial outcomes — found fewer long-term adverse events with drug therapy but no early events and no demonstrated ED benefit without end-organ damage. Placebo had 27 (39%) of 70 adverse events versus 2 (3%) of 73 with antihypertensive drugs within 20 months (absolute risk reduction 36%; number needed to treat = 3), yet there were no adverse events in either group within the first 3 months, and without acute end-organ damage, ED pharmacologic intervention did not yield better outcomes than referral for repeat measurements, screening, and treatment.

### Hypertensive emergencies in the emergency department [^114vP3Tr]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects approximately one-third of Americans. An additional 30% are unaware that they harbor the disease. Significantly increased blood pressure constitutes a hypertensive emergency that could lead to end-organ damage. When organs such as the brain, heart, or kidney are affected, an intervention that will lower the blood pressure in several hours is indicated. Several pharmacologic options are available for treatment, with intravenous antihypertensive therapy being the cornerstone, but there is no standard of care. Careful consideration of each patient's specific complaint, history, and physical examination guides the emergency physician through the treatment algorithm.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^1141eRKK]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, if suspicion for primary aldosteronism is high enough to warrant screening, ongoing management of hypertension should not be discontinued solely for maximizing screening accuracy. Instead, the provider should conduct primary aldosteronism screening and interpret the results in the context of the patient's current medications. Conversely, it may be reasonable to withhold treatment or consider the use of antihypertensive medications with minimal RAAS interaction for a short period in those with new asymptomatic and uncomplicated hypertension.

In instances of hypertensive urgency, when symptoms related to hypertensive emergency are absent, screening for primary aldosteronism can occur. In cases of hypertensive emergency, medications such as verapamil and hydralazine may be useful before obtaining the needed laboratory samples. These practices would improve the integrity of primary aldosteronism screening, thereby guiding patients toward targeted treatment selection and improved health outcomes.

Diagnostic evaluation — history components: Appropriate diagnostic evaluation is a critical component in assessing a patient with suspected hypertension (HTN) and focuses on determining possible causes and/or comorbidities. Evaluation should include patient history, family history, physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and imaging, and the first step in the evaluation of the child or adolescent with elevated blood pressure (BP) is to obtain a history that includes perinatal, past medical, nutritional, activity, and psychosocial domains.

VA/DoD hypertension Module A — screening and diagnosis directs that if the patient is currently being treated for HTN, go to Module B, Box 16; otherwise obtain office blood pressure, then return after acute episode resolved (typically within 4 weeks), and assess the need for and implement lifestyle modification, then follow up for adherence (e.g., diet, exercise, weight loss, alcohol moderation). To confirm diagnosis, measure blood pressure after 1–4 weeks; if confirmed, obtain history and physical and assess for target organ damage and comorbid conditions and consider baseline testing (e.g., basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, EKG, A1c, other tests), as appropriate. If a secondary cause is suspected, evaluate as indicated; consider referral; otherwise initiate treatment (go to Module B). If diagnosis is not confirmed, screen blood pressure periodically; address other CV risk factors and, in patients with known or suspected target organ damage, consider possibility of masked HTN (consider HBPM or ABPM).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, more specifically with respect to initial investigations, ACEP 2013 guidelines recommend to do not obtain routine screening for acute target organ injury (such as serum creatinine, urinalysis, ECG) in the emergency department in patients presenting with asymptomatic markedly elevated BP (HTN stage 2, ≥ 160/100 mmHg). Consider obtaining serum creatinine measurement to identify kidney injury affecting disposition (hospital admission) in selected patients, such as with poor follow-up.

RECOMMENDATIONS

(1) If primary aldosteronism screening is warranted, and the patient remains asymptomatic and without complications of hypertension, consider withholding a new antihypertensive regimen until blood samples can be obtained.
(2) For patients who are symptomatic (e.g. hypertensive emergency) or exhibit complications of hypertension, do not discontinue ongoing efforts to manage hypertension. Instead, interpret primary aldosterone screening results in the context of medication effects.
(3) Patients should be referred to endocrinology or hypertension specialists like nephrology or cardiology. However, which specialty should preferentially manage primary aldosteronism might differ based on the institution and available resources.

### Are the classical symptoms of hypertension in children still sensitive enough? [^114N7Lje]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The available literature is scarce on the initial symptoms of arterial hypertension in children. Our study aimed to analyze the initial clinical profile of patients referred to the hospital with suspected hypertension and those diagnosed with hypertension for the first time during a hospitalization for other reasons. This study was a retrospective analysis of medical records in 471 patients. More than half of the patients showed no symptoms. The most common symptom reported was a headache-28% (132) of patients. The diagnosis of elevated blood pressure or hypertension was more frequent in asymptomatic patients (P = 0.001). Headaches were seen more often in healthy patients than in patients with hypertension. Newly diagnosed hypertension is mainly diagnosed in asymptomatic children. Moreover, the symptoms previously described in the literature as the most common did not prove to be predictive of hypertension in our study.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^113m5o7P]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Definition — Asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure: JNC 7 classified stage 2 hypertension as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg, although many clinical studies use thresholds of systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg. This policy considers markedly elevated blood pressure to be consistent with the JNC 7 definition of stage 2 hypertension, and the term asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure is used where asymptomatic hypertension had previously been used in the published literature.

If acute target organ damage is absent, management of severe hypertension includes "Evaluate INP vs OPT treatment depending on indication(s) other than BP alone", "Avoid parenteral BP lowering therapy or intensified oral therapy in the acute setting", and for outpatients "No need to refer to ED. Reinstitute and intensify or modify medical therapy in the OPT setting" with "Close follow-up in the OPT setting in 4 weeks".

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^11614pRQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The recognition of high BP in patients in emergency settings requires the diagnosis of the causes of the elevation. The diversity of clinical conditions that lead to the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency does not have a common denominator to justify a similar BP‐lowering strategy for all. The clinical conditions are usually self‐evident and should be managed according to their specific guidelines, which include several aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Treating elevated BP rather than the primary clinical condition can be harmful. The diagnosis of hypertensive emergency provided good services to doctors and patients, but given the contemporary reality, it should have a well‐deserved retirement.

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^1138gF2X]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater), physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage (severe asymptomatic hypertension). Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment (within 24 hours). However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

Exclude other causes of OH/nOH

If blood pressure and heart rate changes indicate OH/nOH, a complete history and physical examination, as well as electrocardiogram and laboratory testing, should be focused on ruling out non-neurogenic causes of OH, including cardiogenic, vascular, or iatrogenic etiologies. Table 2 lists recommended tests to conduct when evaluating a patient for OH/nOH. Cardiac disorders (e.g. pacemakers, dysrhythmias, ablation, etc.) can preclude heart rate augmentation; therefore, a cardiac history, an electrocardiogram, and medication review (as noted above) should consistently be performed. Due to variability among patients, including age, disease status, and current medication usage, the lack of heart rate increase on standing may not always be an accurate indicator of nOH in patients with OH; therefore, clinical scenario and specific presentation need to be considered.

Definitions and measurement framework emphasize JNC 7 categories and scope. The definitions of hypertension used in this report are those developed by JNC 7 and include normal, prehypertension, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension, and acute hypertensive emergencies are not addressed by this policy. Classification is based on the average of 2 or more properly measured, seated blood pressure readings on each of 2 or more office visits. JNC 7 defined prehypertension as systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg, and patients with prehypertension are at increased risk for progression to hypertension; those in the 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic range are at twice the risk to develop hypertension as those with lower values. The table applies to adults aged 18 years or older.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^111q6zeP]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

While specific symptoms such as acute dyspnea associated with hypertensive heart failure or chest pain concerning for an acute aortic syndrome may prompt immediate treatment before a full diagnostic evaluation, symptoms alone do not define hypertensive emergencies, and ongoing IV antihypertensive treatment should depend on additional diagnostic tests that confirm acute organ injury. For the large majority of ED patients, presenting clinical features are too nonspecific to prompt immediate IV antihypertensive therapy without confirmatory testing. Table 1 describes common symptoms that emergency medicine clinicians encounter when considering new or worsening end-organ injury in the setting of markedly elevated BP. For time-sensitive conditions such as acute ischemic stroke, rapid BP lowering may be indicated when BP exceeds 185/110 mm Hg and thrombolytic or endovascular treatment is planned. Most acute ischemic stroke patients, however, are not candidates for thrombolytic or endovascular therapy, and BP lowering should be avoided. The ischemic penumbra lacks autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and is dependent on systemic perfusion pressure such that acute lowering may worsen ischemia.

Table 1.
Historical and physical findings associated with hypertensive emergencies

Specific tests are indicated for all patients with suspected hypertensive emergency including a basic metabolic profile, complete blood count, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. Further workup of patients with markedly elevated BP should be symptom-based and aligned with each associated condition's differential diagnosis. Figure 1 demonstrates a general approach to patients with markedly elevated BP. In a patient with altered mental status and BP > 220/120 mm Hg, the evaluation includes brain imaging by computed tomography to assess for intracerebral hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. If neither hemorrhage on computed tomography nor alternative reasons for altered mental status are present, magnetic resonance imaging may be warranted. Likewise, biomarkers of cardiac injury (troponin) and stress (natriuretic peptides) should be obtained for patients with concurrent shortness of breath or chest pain, with the addition of computed tomography angiography of the thorax and abdomen when an acute aortic syndrome is suspected.

### Severe hypertension in the emergency department patient [^1162r8jh]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Severely elevated blood pressure is a common clinical problem en-countered in the Emergency Department. It is often difficult for physicians to differentiate between patients who need emergent blood pressure reduction, requiring the use of intravenous agents and in-tensive monitoring, and those for whom careful, slow reduction in BP is more appropriate. The optimal assessment and management of these patients is reviewed here, with an emphasis on clinical strategies that will most efficiently identify those at greatest risk.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

The 2022 Blood Pressure Targets in Adults With Hypertension: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the AAFP, was developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians and approved by the Board of Directors in July 2022. The guideline was then published in the American Family Physician. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America. To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.

### Clinical policy: a critical issue in the outpatient management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure: approved by the ACEP board of directors January 22, 2025 [^116dgfKc]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy — this document addresses asymptomatic elevated blood pressure in adult emergency department (ED) patients and poses the critical question: "In adult emergency department patients being discharged with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure, is initiation of outpatient antihypertensive medications from the emergency department safe and effective?" Background epidemiology and definitions include: "Approximately half of adults in the United States (119.9 million) are affected by hypertension, but only 25% (27.0 million) of these individuals effectively control their blood pressure" and "Hypertension, defined as blood pressure more than 130/80 mmHg". ED burden is described as "There are just over 6 million emergency department (ED) visits annually in the United States for a primary chief complaint of hypertension, and of those patients, about 64% receive a primary diagnosis of hypertension". Prior guidance notes that an American Heart Association statement "supports the avoidance of intensifying hypertension medications in the ED, with a preference toward restarting home medication(s) and arranging close follow-up", and that the 2013 ACEP policy "did not recommend routine ED medical interventions for asymptomatic elevated blood pressure unless the patient had poor follow-up or the patient was part of a select high-risk patient population". The current policy "updates the 2013 clinical policy" to provide guidance "to determine if initiation of antihypertensive medications at and/or prior to discharge from the ED is safe and effective" and "does not revisit the 2013 question related to screening of patients for target organ injury nor evaluate the need for the lowering of acute asymptomatic elevated blood pressure within the ED". Methods specify that "Searches of PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were performed by a second librarian", that "All searches were limited to human studies published in English", and that "Using Covidence (Covidence, Melbourne, Australia), 2 subcommittee members independently reviewed the identified abstracts to assess for possible inclusion".

### Clinical review: the management of hypertensive crises [^115W5WYC]. Critical Care (2003). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an extremely common clinical problem, affecting approximately 50 million people in the USA and approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. Approximately 1% of these patients will develop acute elevations in blood pressure at some point in their lifetime. A number of terms have been applied to severe hypertension, including hypertensive crises, emergencies, and urgencies. By definition, acute elevations in blood pressure that are associated with end-organ damage are called hypertensive crises. Immediate reduction in blood pressure is required only in patients with acute end-organ damage. This article reviews current concepts, and common misconceptions and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated blood pressure.

Furthermore, existing guidelines provide few recommendations as to the management of those with markedly elevated BP absent a hypertensive emergency, leading to questions on who warrants diagnostic testing to look for end-organ injury, how much acute pain or anxiety may contribute to BP in the ED, when initiation or titration of antihypertensive medications is indicated, or how to manage patients with no reliable outpatient follow-up. Emergency clinicians continue to use outdated and incorrect diagnoses such as "hypertension urgency", a term that implies the need for "something" to be done in the ED setting, despite lack of sound basis in the literature, including current international guidelines.

VA/DoD hypertension guideline — Module A: screening and diagnosis — directs that an "Adult in healthcare system" who is currently being treated for HTN proceeds to "Go to Module B, Box 16", while others should "Obtain office blood pressure (see Sidebar 1)". When measured properly, the initial decision is "is SBP ≥ 120 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg?" If "Yes", assess "Does patient have an acute injury or illness?"; if yes, "Return after acute episode resolved (typically within 4 weeks)" and then "Obtain office blood pressure (see Sidebar 1)"; if no, "Assess the need for and implement lifestyle modification, then follow up for adherence (e.g., diet, exercise, weight loss, alcohol moderation)". If the answer is "No" to "is SBP ≥ 120 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg?", the pathway is "Screen blood pressure periodically; address other CV risk factors (including healthy diet and physical activity); in patients with known or suspected target organ damage (see Sidebar 3), consider possibility of masked HTN (consider HBPM or ABPM)". From the lifestyle branch, the next decision is "Is SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg"; if yes, "Confirm diagnosis of HTN by measuring blood pressure after 1–4 weeks (see Sidebar 2); is diagnosis confirmed?" If confirmed, proceed to "Obtain history and physical and assess for target organ damage and comorbid conditions (see Sidebar 3); consider baseline testing (e.g., basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, EKG, A1c, other tests), as appropriate"; if not confirmed, follow the periodic screening and masked HTN consideration pathway.

### Hypertensive crises: challenges and management [^113agq9e]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects > 65 million people in the United States and is one of the leading causes of death. One to two percent of patients with hypertension have acute elevations of BP that require urgent medical treatment. Depending on the degree of BP elevation and presence of end-organ damage, severe hypertension can be defined as either a hypertensive emergency or a hypertensive urgency. A hypertensive emergency is associated with acute end-organ damage and requires immediate treatment with a titratable short-acting IV antihypertensive agent. Severe hypertension without acute end-organ damage is referred to as a hypertensive urgency and is usually treated with oral antihypertensive agents. This article reviews definitions, current concepts, common misconceptions, and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated BP as well as special clinical situations in which BP must be controlled.

Stage 1 hypertension (HTN) management in children and adolescents: If the BP reading is at the stage 1 HTN level and the patient is asymptomatic, provide lifestyle counseling and recheck the BP in 1 to 2 weeks by auscultation. If the BP reading is still at the stage 1 level, upper and lower extremity BP should be checked (right arm, left arm, and 1 leg), and BP should be rechecked in 3 months by auscultation; nutrition and/or weight management referral should be considered as appropriate. If BP continues to be at the stage 1 HTN level after 3 visits, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should be ordered (if available), diagnostic evaluation should be conducted, treatment should be initiated, and subspecialty referral should be considered.

Screening for features suggesting secondary hypertension — algorithm: Begin with the question "Does the patient have any of the following conditions associated with secondary HTN?" and assess for drug-resistant/induced HTN, abrupt onset of HTN, onset of HTN at < 30 y, exacerbation of previously controlled HTN, disproportionate target organ damage (TOD) for degree of HTN, accelerated/malignant HTN, onset of diastolic HTN in older adults (age ≥ 65 y), unprovoked or excessive hypokalemia, insomnia or daytime sleepiness, concomitant adrenal nodule, history of early-onset stroke, or family history of primary aldosteronism. If no, screening is not indicated. If yes, screen for primary aldosteronism and other secondary forms of HTN; if the result is a positive screening test then refer to a clinician with specific secondary HTN expertise, and if not, enhance medication therapy. For clarity, HTN indicates hypertension and TOD means target organ damage.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^116oaZQ8]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypertension is frequently treated as essential hypertension. However, secondary causes of hypertension should be considered, because distinct treatments are used for different causes of hypertension. Primary aldosteronism is considered a candidate for the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Despite the effects of many antihypertensive agents on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, ongoing efforts to manage hypertension should not be discontinued solely for the purposes of screening. If a patient presents with new or untreated hypertension, screening should be considered before starting antihypertensive agents that could affect the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

Hypertension — physical examination and clinical investigations emphasize that physical examination provides important indications of potential causes of secondary hypertension, signs of comorbidities, and hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD). Office blood pressure (BP) and heart rate should be measured, and measurements of office BP on more than one occasion are usually required to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension unless HBPM or ABPM is used. Details for a comprehensive clinical examination are outlined in Table 13, and suggested routine clinical investigations are outlined in Table 14.

Uncomplicated acute severe hypertension

NICE guidelines recommend referring patients with BP ≥ 180/120 mmHg to ED for a same-day assessment, when patients have features suggestive of acute EOD or suspicion of phaeochromocytoma, whilst recommending a repeat BP measurement reading within a week for all patients with severe HTN without EOD (acute and chronic). Similarly, both the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of HTN (ESH) guidelines state no indication for referral to the ED, nor for an immediate reduction in BP in hospital, in uncomplicated severe HTN.

During the treatment of HTN-naïve patients, it is important to ensure that confounding factors like pain, anxiety and distress are identified and addressed while assessing for acute EOD. Ambulatory BP monitoring, and/or home BP monitoring may be appropriate for some patients to investigate the persistence of elevated BP whereas in practice, close ambulatory/inpatient observation, and starting oral therapy are undertaken for many patients, particularly in a subgroup of patients such as those who do not have access to follow-up, access to home BP monitoring, pregnancy, or associated co-morbidities that may contribute to subsequent deterioration. If there is a strong suspicion of underlying nonadherence, biochemical testing, and/or directly observed therapy may be appropriate.

In patients with severe HTN without life-threatening EOD, BP should be reduced over days to weeks, rather than hours, and managed with oral therapy rather than IV (Fig. 1 a, b, Tables 2 and 3).

Acute severe hypertension encompasses a spectrum of severe blood pressure elevations that can progress to end organ damage if left unmanaged. Understanding the presentations of various acute hypertensive scenarios can help guide interventional radiologists in recognizing clinical symptoms, signs, and selecting effective management strategies. The timely administration of antihypertensive agents is critical to prevent the detrimental effects associated with hypertensive emergencies. The preferred approach to achieve optimal blood pressure control and the desired target blood pressure range may vary based on the hypertensive scenario and patient-specific factors.

Conclusion

Acute HTN management is heterogenous across various presentations, based on available resources and local expertise. High-quality evidence is either missing or where available does not necessarily conclusively favour specific rates of reduction in BP or specific medications. In conclusion, based on available evidence and where lacking consensus statements were made in consultation with the BIHS. The proposed set of recommendations for the management of acute hypertensive states aim to offer an evidence-based and consistent approach to the delivery of high-quality patient care.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — guideline statements — emphasize limited need for emergency therapy without target organ damage but provide mixed direction on immediate treatment. JNC VI stated, "Elevated blood pressure alone, in the absence of symptoms or new or progressive target organ damage, rarely requires emergency therapy". JNC 7 recommendations state that "marked elevations of blood pressure without target organ damage "usually do not require hospitalization, but should receive immediate combination oral antihypertensive therapy". This statement appears to be consensus in origin because no supportive references were cited, and the authors noted, "We could find no evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes or decreased mortality or morbidity with acute management of elevated blood pressure in the ED".

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^1137xiH3]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adulthood. High blood pressure (HBP) and repeated measures of HBP, hypertension (HTN), begin in youth. Knowledge of how best to diagnose, manage, and treat systemic HTN in children and adolescents is important for primary and subspecialty care providers.

Objectives

To provide a technical summary of the methodology used to generate the 2017 "Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents", an update to the 2004 "Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents".

Data Sources

Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Excerpta Medica Database references published between January 2003 and July 2015 followed by an additional search between August 2015 and July 2016.

Study Selection

English-language observational studies and randomized trials.

Methods

Key action statements (KASs) and additional recommendations regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HBP in youth were the product of a detailed systematic review of the literature. A content outline establishing the breadth and depth was followed by the generation of 4 patient, intervention, comparison, outcome, time questions. Key questions addressed: (1) diagnosis of systemic HTN, (2) recommended work-up of systemic HTN, (3) optimal blood pressure (BP) goals, and (4) impact of high BP on indirect markers of cardiovascular disease in youth. Once selected, references were subjected to a 2-person review of the abstract and title followed by a separate 2-person full-text review. Full citation information, population data, findings, benefits and harms of the findings, as well as other key reference information were archived. Selected primary references were then used for KAS generation. Level of evidence (LOE) scoring was assigned for each reference and then in aggregate. Appropriate language was used to generate each KAS based on the LOE and the balance of benefit versus harm of the findings. Topics that could not be researched via the stated approach were (1) definition of HTN in youth, and (2) definition of left ventricular hypertrophy. KASs related to these stated topics were generated via expert opinion.

Results

Nearly 15000 references were identified during an initial literature search. After a deduplication process, 14382 references were available for title and abstract review, and 1379 underwent full text review. One hundred twenty-four experimental and observational studies published between 2003 and 2016 were selected as primary references for KAS generation, followed by an additional 269 primary references selected between August 2015 and July 2016. The LOE for the majority of references was C. In total, 30 KASs and 27 additional recommendations were generated; 12 were related to the diagnosis of HTN, 13 were related to management and additional diagnostic testing, 3 to treatment goals, and 2 to treatment options. Finally, special additions to the clinical practice guideline included creation of new BP tables based on BP values obtained solely from children with normal weight, creation of a simplified table to enhance screening and recognition of abnormal BP, and a revision of the criteria for diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy.

Conclusions

An extensive and detailed systematic approach was used to generate evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and treatment of youth with systemic HTN.

### International consensus on initial screening and follow-up of asymptomatic SDHx mutation carriers [^114Ldy2o]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Screening methods

Initial screening should include an assessment of symptoms (Box 1), a clinical examination and blood pressure evaluation. As recommended by current blood pressure guidelines, blood pressure evaluation should rely on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring with a diagnostic blood pressure threshold for the diagnosis of hypertension of either 130/80 mmHg for patients younger than 65 years or 135/85 mmHg for patients older than 65 years, following international guidelines.

Biochemical measurements of urinary or plasma levels of metanephrine and normetanephrine should be carried out to detect catecholamine production. Their superiority over catecholamines and vanillylmandelic acid measurements has long been established, and they are currently recommended for the diagnosis of PPGL. Plasma or urinary free metanephrines analyses seem to be the best diagnostic test, with an even higher sensitivity and specificity than analyses of deconjugated urinary metanephrines. Although urinary measurement of metanephrines is less convenient, it might confer an advantage in childhood because this method avoids venepuncture. In 2019, age-specific paediatric reference intervals for plasma free metanephrine and normetanephrine were published.

Recommendation 5: Tumour screening in asymptomatic SDHA, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD-pi mutation carriers should include clinical examination: blood pressure measurement (ideally, out-of-office blood pressure measurement during adulthood) and a symptoms and signs questionnaire (Box 1) (Grade A).
Recommendation 6: Biochemical testing for tumour screening in asymptomatic SDHA, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD-pi mutation carriers should include measurements of either plasma or urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine (Grade A). During childhood, the choice between plasma or urinary tests should be left to the clinician and local laboratory availability and expertise (Grade A). During adulthood, measurements of plasma free metanephrine and normetanephrine should be preferred over urinary measurements (Grade A).
Recommendation 7: Biochemical testing should not include either vanillylmandelic acid or catecholamines in addition to metanephrine and normetanephrine (Grade A).

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. Prefer combining a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic. Avoid initiating combination treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.
