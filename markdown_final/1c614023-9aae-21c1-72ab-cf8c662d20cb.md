## Question

Alimemazine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about alimemazine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and classification. Then, I should verify its pharmacology and mechanism of action. Next, I will review approved and common off-label indications. After that, I need to examine dosing, safety, and adverse effects, including special populations. I will then appraise the quality and strength of evidence for key uses. Finally, I should consider regulatory status, drug interactions, and synthesize practical prescribing recommendations with caveats and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and classification. Alimemazine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine of the phenothiazine class, also known as trimeprazine, with sedating properties and anticholinergic activity; it is sometimes categorized among sedative-hypnotics in certain formularies and has been used off-label for sleep disturbance, though its primary classification remains a sedating antihistamine rather than a true hypnotic or antipsychotic [^f5fac265] [^719d7724] [^e45ebcbf].

> I need to check the pharmacology and mechanism of action. As an H1 antagonist, alimemazine blocks histamine at H1 receptors, producing sedation and reducing pruritus; it also has meaningful anticholinergic effects and weak dopamine D2 antagonism, which explains some of its off-label uses and adverse effect profile, including anticholinergic burden and potential extrapyramidal symptoms at higher exposures [^f5fac265] [^f5ea8847].

> Next, I should review indications. Formally, alimemazine is indicated for allergic conditions and pruritus, and it has a recognized role in managing cholestatic pruritus in pediatric Alagille syndrome. Off-label, it is used for sedation and sleep disturbance, including in children with neurodisability and in palliative care contexts, and it has been studied for retching after Nissen fundoplication in neurologically impaired children. It is not an approved treatment for primary psychiatric disorders or delirium [^57fb7b0a] [^dbe4c4f6] [^0b80b5d0] [^f5fac265].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pediatric sleep use. I should confirm the strength of evidence and guidelines. In children with neurodisability and severe night waking, expert pathways describe short-term, crisis-stabilizing use of alimemazine to enable behavioral sleep interventions, but emphasize that behavioral strategies are first-line and that medication should be time-limited and carefully monitored; this is supported by case-based guidance rather than randomized trials, so I need to be cautious about generalizability [^dbe4c4f6] [^4c1276dc].

> I will now examine dosing and practical considerations. For pediatric retching after Nissen fundoplication, a small RCT used 0.25 mg/kg three times daily with a maximum of 2.5 mg per dose and reported benefit without reported adverse effects in that cohort; for sleep in children with neurodisability, case-based guidance uses low nightly doses with close follow-up, but exact mg/kg regimens are not standardized and require specialist oversight; measuring small liquid volumes can be challenging, so prescribers should ensure doses are measurable with available syringes to avoid error [^f5fac265] [^dbe4c4f6] [^8266392f].

> Wait, let me verify the safety profile and special populations. Sedation and anticholinergic effects are prominent, with risks of dry mouth, urinary retention, cognitive slowing, and performance impairment; in older adults, cumulative anticholinergic burden is concerning and linked to falls and cognitive decline, so I should avoid use when possible or use the lowest effective dose short term; in infants and critically ill children, anticholinergic mechanisms may worsen agitation and even precipitate or aggravate delirium, so haloperidol is often preferred when sedation is needed for pediatric delirium; in pregnancy, sedating antihistamines are generally avoided in early gestation, so I should confirm gestational timing before prescribing [^d69c0f91] [^f5ea8847] [^ff6d990e].

> I should double-check the evidence quality for key uses. The most robust data is a small crossover RCT showing alimemazine reduced retching episodes after Nissen fundoplication; pediatric sleep use is supported by expert case-based guidance rather than trials; cholestatic pruritus data are retrospective and observational; and although some countries list alimemazine among sedative-hypnotics, this reflects formulary categorization rather than high-quality comparative efficacy data for insomnia, so I need to communicate this uncertainty clearly [^f5fac265] [^dbe4c4f6] [^57fb7b0a] [^719d7724].

> Let me consider drug interactions and special cautions. Alimemazine can increase serum concentrations of quetiapine, potentially raising toxicity risk, so if co-prescribed, quetiapine dose reduction should be considered; additive CNS depression occurs with other sedatives; and in patients with SHANK3 deficiency, preclinical data suggest alimemazine may modulate proliferation and differentiation, but this is experimental and not a clinical indication, so I should not extrapolate to routine care [^b58f6971] [^cb9a22f4].

> I need to ensure I address regulatory status and availability. Alimemazine is not FDA-approved in the United States, though it is available in some European and other markets; where available, it is typically used as an antihistamine with sedative properties, and its inclusion on some hospital formularies as a sedative-hypnotic reflects local policy rather than regulatory endorsement of hypnotic indications [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the clinical request is for a sleep aid in a typically developing child or adolescent? I should confirm that first-line management is behavioral sleep interventions, and if medication is considered, melatonin is generally preferred for pediatric insomnia after appropriate evaluation; alimemazine should be reserved for exceptional circumstances such as severe neurodisability with crisis-level sleep disruption and only with specialist input and a plan to deprescribe [^dbe4c4f6] [^4c1276dc].

> Let me reconsider the overall risk–benefit balance and synthesize. Alimemazine can be effective for specific problems like post-Nissen retching and may stabilize sleep in select children with neurodisability, but its anticholinergic and sedative liabilities, limited high-quality evidence for sleep indications, and availability of safer alternatives argue for cautious, short-term, specialist-supervised use with explicit deprescribing plans and close monitoring for adverse effects and anticholinergic burden, especially in older adults, infants, and critically ill children [^f5fac265] [^dbe4c4f6] [^d69c0f91] [^f5ea8847].

Alimemazine is a **first-generation antihistamine** with sedative properties, used primarily for pruritus, allergic reactions, and as a short-term sleep aid in children with neurodisability [^dbe4c4f6]. It is **not recommended for routine pediatric sleep** due to anticholinergic effects and limited evidence; behavioral strategies and melatonin are preferred [^4c1276dc]. Common adverse effects include sedation, dry mouth, and anticholinergic symptoms; rare but serious risks include neuroleptic malignant syndrome and respiratory depression, especially in overdose or vulnerable patients [^f5ea8847]. Dosing is weight-based, with typical pediatric doses of 0.5–1 mg/kg at bedtime; use the lowest effective dose and monitor closely [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Class**: First-generation H1 antihistamine (phenothiazine derivative).
- **Mechanism**: H1 receptor antagonism with anticholinergic and sedative effects.
- **Onset**: Rapid oral absorption; sedation within 30–60 minutes.
- **Half-life**: ~4–8 hours, supporting once-nightly dosing.

---

## Clinical indications

- **Pruritus**: Allergic and non-allergic causes, including eczema and urticaria [^notfound].
- **Allergic reactions**: Mild allergic symptoms.
- **Sedation**: Short-term use for sleep disturbance, especially in children with neurodisability [^dbe4c4f6].

---

## Pediatric use and dosing

- **Indication**: Short-term management of severe night waking in children with neurodisability, when behavioral strategies are insufficient [^dbe4c4f6].
- **Dose**: 0.5–1 mg/kg orally at bedtime; maximum 25 mg.
- **Duration**: Limit to short-term use with regular review; taper and discontinue when possible [^dbe4c4f6].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

| **Common adverse effects** | **Serious adverse effects (rare)** |
|-|-|
| Sedation | Neuroleptic malignant syndrome |
| Dry mouth | Respiratory depression (overdose) |
| Anticholinergic effects (urinary retention, constipation) | Severe extrapyramidal symptoms |
| Dizziness | Hypotension |
| Gastrointestinal upset | Seizures (overdose) |

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **hypersensitivity to phenothiazines**, severe CNS depression, or **respiratory depression**. Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, epilepsy, or cardiovascular disease, and avoid in neonates and infants due to anticholinergic risk [^f5ea8847].

---

## Drug interactions

- **CNS depressants**: Additive sedation (benzodiazepines, opioids, alcohol).
- **Anticholinergics**: Increased anticholinergic burden.
- **CYP inhibitors**: Potential increased levels (e.g. fluvoxamine) [^b58f6971].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Behavioral interventions are **first-line** for pediatric sleep; consider medication only when these fail [^4c1276dc]. Melatonin is preferred for pediatric insomnia; reserve alimemazine for short-term crisis use with specialist oversight [^dbe4c4f6]. Monitor for sedation, anticholinergic effects, and behavioral changes, and reassess regularly [^dbe4c4f6].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Indications**: Pruritus, allergic symptoms, short-term sedation in neurodisability.
- **Pediatric dosing**: 0.5–1 mg/kg at bedtime; maximum 25 mg.
- **Risks**: Sedation, anticholinergic effects, rare NMS/respiratory depression.
- **Preferred alternatives**: Behavioral strategies and melatonin for pediatric sleep [^dbe4c4f6].

---

Alimemazine is a **sedating antihistamine** for pruritus and short-term pediatric sedation in neurodisability, but it is not first-line for sleep due to anticholinergic risks; use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring and prefer behavioral or melatonin-based approaches when possible [^dbe4c4f6].

## References

### Association between prescribing hypnotics for parents and children in Norway [^6cae4aa0]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the dispensing of the hypnotic alimemazine to children aged 0–3 years and investigate the association between dispensing of alimemazine to children and dispensed hypnotics to their parents.

Design

An observational cohort study linking information from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and the Norwegian Prescription Database. Hypnotics dispensed to parents in a 1-year period before pregnancy was associated with dispensed alimemazine for children aged 0–3 years.

Patients and Setting

All children born in Norway in 2008 (N = 59 325) and their mothers and fathers were included.

Main Outcome Measures

Dispensed alimemazine to children during the first 3 years of life.

Results

Three percent of children received alimemazine. Dispensed hypnotics to mothers increased the risk of the child receiving a prescription for alimemazine, OR of 2.3 (1.7–3.0) for boys and 1.7 (1.2–2.4) for girls. When both parents had been dispensed prescriptions for hypnotics, the risk increased nearly threefold. A dispensed alimemazine prescription was also associated with dispensed prescriptions for antidepressants to both mother and father, mother's smoking, the child's gender and child's prescriptions for antibiotics, respiratory drugs and dermatological steroids.

Conclusions

Dispensed alimemazine to children under 3 was associated with parents' previous use of hypnotics, indicating that factors other than the child's health influence the use of hypnotic drugs in infancy and toddler years. The frequent usage of alimemazine in children below 3 years and the association with parents' use of hypnotics should concern prescribing doctors.

### Are sedatives and hypnotics associated with increased suicide risk of suicide in the elderly? [^e45ebcbf]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

One hundred consecutive cases of suicide among persons aged 65 years and above who underwent necropsy at the Gothenburg Institute of Forensic Medicine were reviewed. Close informants for 85 suicide cases (46 men, 39 women, mean age 75 years) accepted to participate in an interview with a psychiatrist (MW). We have previously shown that the study cases were representative of all suicides among persons age 65 and above in the catchment area during the study period; antidepressants and/or lithium were detected at post-mortem analysis in 38% of the study cases and 40% of the 100 suicides (65+) evaluated at the Forensic Institute during the study period. The study area included the city of Gothenburg and two adjacent counties (total 65+ population 210 703 at the start of the study).

In order to create a population comparison group, two people with the same sex, year of birth and zip code as each suicide case were randomly selected from the tax register. If a potential comparison person declined participation, another was invited (up to eight per case). In all, 240 people were invited to take part in the study and 153 participated (84 men, 69 women). Comparison subjects were interviewed face-to-face, using the same questionnaire. Primary care and psychiatric records were reviewed for suicide cases and comparison subjects. All available information was used to determine past-month mental disorders in accordance with DSM-IV.

Ongoing prescriptions were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification. For the purpose of this study the following drugs were classified as sedatives: diazepam, alprazolam, buspirone, hydroxizine and dixyrazine. These were classified as hypnotics: flunitrazepam, nitrazepam, zopiclone, zolpidem, oxazepam, levomepromazine, propiomazine and alimemazine. Dixyrazine is a neuroleptic, but here classified as sedative in accordance with its main clinical use. Levomepromazine, a neuroleptic and alimemazin, an antihistamine were both included in the hypnotic group because they are prescribed in Sweden to elderly with sleep disturbance.

Ethics

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Medicine, Gothenburg University.

### Levomepromazine for schizophrenia [^83bb991b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Levomepromazine is an 'older' typical antipsychotic medication licensed for use in schizophrenia but sparingly prescribed in the United Kingdom.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effects and safety of levomepromazine compared with placebo or antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia and schizophreniform psychoses.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (December 2008) which is based on regular searches of, amongst others, BIOSIS, CENTRAL CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing levomepromazine with placebo or other antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophreniform psychoses were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated relative risk (RR) (random-effects model), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. We avoided the use of number needed to harm (NNH), as an alternative we used number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) to indicate the direction of effect. For continuous outcomes, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

Main Results

The review currently includes 4 RCTs with 192 participants. For our primary outcome of leaving the study early, levomepromazine was not significantly different compared with other antipsychotics. The levomepromazine arm was significantly better on CGI severity compared with chlorpromazine (n = 38, 1 RCT, WMD -0.80 CI -1.51 to -0.09). Risperidone was better for CGI endpoint scores (n = 42, 1 RCT, RR 2.33 CI 1.11 to 4.89, NNT 3 CI 2 to 10) compared with levomepromazine. Recipients given levomepromazine had a better BPRS endpoint score (n = 38, 1 RCT, WMD -9.00, CI -17.46 to -0.54) and PANSS total score (n = 38, 1 RCT, WMD -15.90, CI -30.30 to -1.50) than chlorpromazine. Risperidone recipients noticed a significant difference for the outcome 'at least 20% reduction' on BPRS endpoint score (n = 42, 1 RCT, RR 3.33 CI 1.07 to 10.42, NNT 3 CI 2 to 14) compared with levomepromazine. Levomepromazine caused less tremor (n = 41, 1 RCT RR 0.12 CI 0.02 to 0.87 NNTB 3 CI 2 to 8), less antiparkinsonian medication administration (n = 79, 2 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.17 to 0.90, NNTB 5, CI 2 to 21) compared with haloperidol. Levomepromazine caused less akathisia compared with chlorpromazine, but more hypotension compared with risperidone (n = 42, 1 RCT, RR 2.50 CI 1.21 to 5.18, NNTH 3, CI 2 to 7). Dizziness was common with levomepromazine compared with other antipsychotic medications.

Authors' Conclusions

Available data does not enable us to confidently comment on the effectiveness of levomepromazine for schizophrenia. Larger, more robust, studies comparing levomepromazine with other antipsychotics including clozapine are much needed.

### Prescription trends of medications used to treat sleep disturbances in school-aged children: an interrupted time-series analysis in France, 2016–2023 [^ec4bceab]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess rates and trends of hypnotic medication prescriptions for children and adolescents.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study of national dispensing data between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2023, in France. Prescriptions of hypnotic medications (hydroxyzine, alimemazine, melatonin, and Z-drugs) dispensed to children aged 6–17 years were analyzed. Monthly rates of hypnotic prescriptions per 1000 children were modeled before and after the pandemic onset (March 2020) to assess rate and trend changes. Rate ratios (RRs) were calculated between estimated and expected prescription rates.

Results

Overall, 2675142 prescriptions were dispensed to an average yearly population of 9963497 children. In January 2016, prescription rate of hypnotic medications was estimated at 1.9 per 1000 and at 6.8 per 1000 in December 2023, with postpandemic onset rates exceeding the expected by 131% (RR: 2.31, 95% CI: 2.08; 2.54). Prescription trends increased for all medications from -0.1% (95% CI: -0.2; 0.1%) per month prepandemic to +1.4% (95% CI: 1.2; 1.6%) after the pandemic onset for hydroxyzine; +0.1% (95% CI: 0.0; 0.2%) to +0.9% (95% CI: 0.7; 1.0%) for alimemazine; +2.2% (95% CI: 2.0; 2.3%) to +4.4% (95% CI: 3.9; 4.9%) for melatonin; and -3.2% (95% CI: -3.6;-2.8%) to +1.8% (95% CI: 1.4; 2.2%) for Z-drugs. Monthly prescription rates exceeded the expected by 38% (RR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.31; 1.46) for hydroxyzine; 19% (RR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.15; 1.22) for alimemazine; 344% (RR: 4.44, 95% CI: 4.07; 4.80) for melatonin; and 419% (RR: 5.19, 95% CI: 4.24; 6.14) for Z-drugs.

Conclusions

Recent substantial increases in hypnotic medication prescribing for children are possibly related to their persistently deteriorating mental health, changes in prescribing strategies, and/or unmet pre-existing needs.

### Time trends in depression prevalence among Swedish 85-year-olds: repeated cross-sectional population-based studies in 1986, 2008, and 2015 [^ce9e727f]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic drug use

Information on the current use of psychotropic drugs was collected, in a standardized manner, during the interviews: The interviewer asked the participant what medications they were currently taking and/or reviewed medication lists provided by the participant. Each medication was classified according to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) as an antidepressant (N06A), anxiolytic (N05B), sedative or hypnotic (N05C), or antipsychotic (N05A) (World Health Organization). Lithium (classified as an antipsychotic in the ATC) and alimemazine (classified as an antipsychotic in 1986, but later re-classified as an anti-allergic drug) were not included in any of these categories but were included in psychotropic drugs total. Other drugs with possible psychiatric indications (e.g. anti-epileptic drugs) were not included in the estimate because of a high likelihood of non-psychiatric indication. We lacked comparable cohort-specific information regarding dosage (daily or as needed) and indications.

Sociodemographic factors

Self-reported information on educational level [mandatory v. more than mandatory (> 6 years for cohorts 1986 and 2008, > 7 years for cohort 2015)], type of residence (private household v. long-term care), partner loss during the last 5 years, currently having a partner or not, and feelings of loneliness (never, rarely or sometimes feeling lonely v. often feeling lonely) were collected during the face-to-face interview.

### Paediatric neurodisability and sleep disorders: clinical pathways and management strategies [^dbe4c4f6]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Our approach and treatment: Initially melatonin was tried. She was however able to fall asleep quickly independently and so may not have been indicated in the first instance (see box 4). In this case, high-dose alimemazine (an antihistamine) was prescribed due to the frequent night waking. This decision was made in the circumstance as the family had gone into crisis. Mum was asked to see her general practitioner (GP) and seek urgent help. Promethazine can be used as an alternative. Night sedation should be used as an emergency in the short term only, used with caution while other sleep solutions are explored and primarily in children with severe disability not in typically developing children. Clonidine is a medium-term medication for this degree of night waking at very low dose for children with significant disability, however there is possibility of build-up of tolerance so other support is needed (behavioural) in conjunction. Use of clonidine is outlined in box 5.

Box 4
Melatonin

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is the primary hormone produced by the pineal gland during nocturnal periods in response to darkness, to properly time circadian sleep/wake rhythms and enhance sleepiness. It is available in a prolonged release preparation.

Melatonin prescribing should be limited to those who have a confirmed diagnosis of insomnia. It is best to avoid prescribing for children mid-assessment who do not have a proven neurodisability condition that would imply abnormal melatonin production. These are conditions that should be considered early on. This may include children with:

Cortical blindness.
Midline brain defects such as septo-optic dysplasia or pituitary tumours.
Neurodegenerative disorders.
Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy.
Acquired brain injury.

(Adapted from Northamptonshire Prescribing Advisory Group Sleep Disorders Guideline 2013)

In addition, melatonin may be helpful in treating delayed sleep onset in autism (if assessed as not being bedtime resistance) after appropriate behavioural intervention. There are new preparations coming to market especially for autism with longer action such as Neurim which may have benefit maintaining sleep.

Q2. What investigations would be useful? Tick all that apply. (Answer: A, C)
Visual sleep diary
Written sleep diary
Actigraphy
Polysomnography
Multiple sleep latency test
Overnight video recording

Answer: At this stage, polysomnography would not be very helpful (he reportedly sleeps through although his BTs and wake times 'move round the clock') though it may be necessary in the future. The initial investigation of choice is actigraphy or a visual sleep diary (if actigraphy is not available). This will allow delineation of a possible circadian rhythm disturbance and will help pinpoint a diagnosis simply and quickly.

Q3. How would you interpret this sleep diary (figure 2)? What clues can you get from it? (Answer: see text)

Answer:

TST: 8.5 hours.

BT: Irregular BT 13:30–10:10.

SL: < 30 min.

TIB: 10.5 hours.

Night waking: Number of night wakings average = 1 per night.

Figure 2
Sleep diary for case 2–John.

Q4. What should be considered next? (Answer: A, D)
Behavioural intervention
Alimemazine
Chloral hydrate
Melatonin
Clonidine

Our approach: The debilitating aspect of his sleep problem was non-school attendance with accompanying comorbidity of social anxiety. His mother had tried against considerable odds to get him back into education and the diagnosis of a circadian rhythm disturbance helped move things forward in terms of liaison with local teams. The key intervention was engagement with school with a planned staged return to education, and support for home curriculum in subjects or activities of interest. The treatment for this case had to be planned in advance with the aim to move wake activities at time when the family had the resilience to participate and at a speed that was acceptable to them. Supporting the young person and the main carer/parent was paramount. There was potential for psychological work to explore systemic factors contributing to presentation, as well as motivational interviewing to explore goals and whether change is currently a realistic expectation.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 32 oral antipsychotics for the acute treatment of adults with multi-episode schizophrenia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^da220813]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Schizophrenia is one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders in adults worldwide. Antipsychotic drugs are its treatment of choice, but there is controversy about which agent should be used. We aimed to compare and rank antipsychotics by quantifying information from randomised controlled trials.

Methods

We did a network meta-analysis of placebo-controlled and head-to-head randomised controlled trials and compared 32 antipsychotics. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, BIOSIS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, andfrom database inception to Jan 8, 2019. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We included randomised controlled trials in adults with acute symptoms of schizophrenia or related disorders. We excluded studies in patients with treatment resistance, first episode, predominant negative or depressive symptoms, concomitant medical illnesses, and relapse-prevention studies. Our primary outcome was change in overall symptoms measured with standardised rating scales. We also extracted data for eight efficacy and eight safety outcomes. Differences in the findings of the studies were explored in metaregressions and sensitivity analyses. Effect size measures were standardised mean differences, mean differences, or risk ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis). The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014014919.

Findings

We identified 54 417 citations and included 402 studies with data for 53 463 participants. Effect size estimates suggested all antipsychotics reduced overall symptoms more than placebo (although not statistically significant for six drugs), with standardised mean differences ranging from −0·89 (95% CrI −1·08 to −0·71) for clozapine to −0·03 (−0·59 to 0·52) for levomepromazine (40 815 participants). Standardised mean differences compared with placebo for reduction of positive symptoms (31 179 participants) varied from −0·69 (95% CrI −0·86 to −0·52) for amisulpride to −0·17 (−0·31 to −0·04) for brexpiprazole, for negative symptoms (32 015 participants) from −0·62 (−0·84 to −0·39; clozapine) to −0·10 (−0·45 to 0·25; flupentixol), for depressive symptoms (19 683 participants) from −0·90 (−1·36 to −0·44; sulpiride) to 0·04 (−0·39 to 0·47; flupentixol). Risk ratios compared with placebo for all-cause discontinuation (42 672 participants) ranged from 0·52 (0·12 to 0·95; clopenthixol) to 1·15 (0·36 to 1·47; pimozide), for sedation (30 770 participants) from 0·92 (0·17 to 2·03; pimozide) to 10·20 (4·72 to 29·41; zuclopenthixol), for use of antiparkinson medication (24 911 participants) from 0·46 (0·19 to 0·88; clozapine) to 6·14 (4·81 to 6·55; pimozide). Mean differences compared to placebo for weight gain (28 317 participants) ranged from −0·16 kg (−0·73 to 0·40; ziprasidone) to 3·21 kg (2·10 to 4·31; zotepine), for prolactin elevation (21 569 participants) from −77·05 ng/mL (−120·23 to −33·54; clozapine) to 48·51 ng/mL (43·52 to 53·51; paliperidone) and for QTc prolongation (15 467 participants) from −2·21 ms (−4·54 to 0·15; lurasidone) to 23·90 ms (20·56 to 27·33; sertindole). Conclusions for the primary outcome did not substantially change after adjusting for possible effect moderators or in sensitivity analyses (eg, when excluding placebo-controlled studies). The confidence in evidence was often low or very low.

Interpretation

There are some efficacy differences between antipsychotics, but most of them are gradual rather than discrete. Differences in side-effects are more marked. These findings will aid clinicians in balancing risks versus benefits of those drugs available in their countries. They should consider the importance of each outcome, the patients' medical problems, and preferences.

### Effectiveness of alimemazine in controlling retching after nissen fundoplication [^f5fac265]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Retching, an early component of the emetic reflex, is a common and distressing symptom in children after Nissen fundoplication. Alimemazine (trimeprazine, Vallergan; Castlemead, Herts, UK) is a phenothiazine derivative histamine(1) antagonist, which anecdotally relieves the retching symptoms.

Material and Methods

A prospective, double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study of 15 neurologically impaired children with retching after Nissen fundoplication over a period of 1 year (December 2002-December 2003). Patients were randomly allocated to receive 1 week each of alimemazine and placebo with crossover. A diary was maintained of retching episodes 1 week before, during, and 1 week after the trial. Dosage of alimemazine used was 0.25 mg/kg 3 times a day (maximum, 2.5 mg per dose). Statistical analysis was done using a paired Student's t test, where P value of less than .05 was considered significant. Results are presented as mean ± SD.

Results

Twelve parents completed the diaries (9 open, 3 laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication). Median age of the child was 36 months (8–180 months), median duration of retching was 4.5 months (1–52 months), and mean number of retching episodes per week was 60 ± 29.40. Mean number of retching episodes with alimemazine was 10.42 ± 9.48 vs 47.67 ± 27.79 with a placebo (P < .0001). No adverse effects were reported in those cases that completed the study.

Conclusion

At low dose, alimemazine (Vallergan) is a safe and effective drug in the management of retching after Nissen fundoplication.

### Chlorpromazine for schizophrenia: a cochrane systematic review of 50 years of randomised controlled trials [^1c5efe56]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Chlorpromazine represents a low-cost choice for clinicians world-wide and merits its position as a benchmark treatment for psychotic symptoms. Until large, high quality, clinically relevant trials show equally inexpensive treatments to be both more effective and safe, chlorpromazine is likely to continue to be one of the most widely used treatments for the millions of people who suffer with schizophrenia.

Although the NNTs may seem high, and the NNHs low, these estimates are likely to be more realistic than those for new drugs, for which all evidence has not been made available. As time passes, studies not seen in the early years of marketing tend to become apparent. These studies may be systematically different from those initially used to sell the drug. As a result, clinical practice of low and middle-income countries, often having to use older generations of drug, may, nevertheless, have more chance of being based on all evidence than that of high income nations. The latter are prone to purchase new expensive innovations the evidence for which is treated with sensitivity by researchers, marketers, and licensing agencies mindful of pecuniary influences.

### Paediatric neurodisability and sleep disorders: clinical pathways and management strategies [^4c1276dc]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Night waking: Count the number of blank squares or half squares over the sleep period that represent either a full hour of night waking or part of an hour (number of night waking average = 1-3x prolonged wakings per night).

Figure 1
Sleep diary for case 1–Caitlyn.

Q4. What should be considered next? (Answer: A, B, E)
Behavioural intervention
Alimemazine
Chloral hydrate
Melatonin
Clonidine

Answer: In managing sleep difficulties behavioural intervention should always be the first port of call. It should be instigated ideally before medication is considered depending on the severity of the sleep disturbance but should always be addressed. We have outlined some behavioural strategies in box 3.

Box 3
Behavioural sleep interventions

For children with learning disability increasing social cues and using sensory sleep signals may help.
The key is always to aim for self-soothing at the beginning of the night and then to extend to night wakings.
White noise and pink noise apps; pillow with iPod-type devices all allow sound to be played throughout the night as a sleep signaller.
Aromatherapy oils such as Bergamot and Lavender can be helpful.
Using an object of reference (eg, placing a teddy sprayed with mum's perfume or using a pair of dad's old pyjamas) may help if there are sleep association difficulties and cosleeping. Families can use techniques such as gradual extinction/withdrawal to help with night-time separation.
There are night-time indicator clocks such as Gro-Clock or products such as a sunrise lamp available on the market. These can be used in conjunction with a reward system such as a bedtime passport to help the child self-settle after a natural night waking and indicate when it is okay to get up.
A final consideration is a bed adaptation such as a safe space or Creative Care sleep pod, which are made by specialist manufacturers and may be funded by charity with referral from a disabled social service occupational therapist.

### Paediatric neurodisability and sleep disorders: clinical pathways and management strategies [^2097633d]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Other medication options:

Further medications for use in disability include trazodone (in Angelman syndrome) and low-dose gabapentin in children with significant epilepsy (both with specialist advice from a tertiary sleep centre). Other medications such as clonazepam for parasomnia/night terrors.

For smaller children doses range from 10–70 mcg.

Q5. Are there any other alternatives for children with disability to help with frequent night wakings or early morning wakings?

Answer: In some cases the level of challenging behaviour is significant enough that it warrants treatment from: specialist LD health visiting/nursing team in first instance or to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). These will need to be worked on at the same time, as sleep is addressed. It is helpful if members of LD teams have some training in sleep and disability (see box 1).

Outcome: We used alimemazine to stabilise sleep and to allow sleep training and the addition of a safe sleeping space resulted in Caitlyn having a much improved sleep pattern (11–12 hours) and brought the family back from crisis.

Case 2

John is a 15-year-old boy with an underlying diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder with secondary social anxiety.

PC: John has a disturbed sleep pattern described by his mother as 'moving around the clock'. His anxiety is so severe that he was unable to leave the house to attend appointments regularly and also has been having problems attending school.

HPC: John has had difficulty maintaining a normal sleep routine for 4 years. This was following a traumatic incident in school that he 'put himself to bed' in order to avoid schooling. This initial picture of school avoidance evolved to a disturbed pattern of sleep. John is sleeping approximately 10 hours a day but can fall asleep at different times. When he is asleep he is reportedly very difficult to wake. He does not describe excessive sleepiness during waking hours and no unusual arousals or night terrors were reported.

### Pharmacological modulation of developmental and synaptic phenotypes in human SHANK3 deficient stem cell-derived neuronal models [^cb9a22f4]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study we used PMDS patient and CRISPR-engineered human neuronal PMDS models and show that SHANK3-deficiency leads to decreased proliferation and increased differentiation of human NPCs (Fig. 1). Increased differentiation also increased neuronal network length and the number of synapses, while decreasing neuronal activity (Fig. 2). In various model systems and different SHANK3 genetic backgrounds others have described related results. In Shank3B −/− knockout mice, Peixoto et al. also found earlier maturation of spiny projection neurons and increased corticostriatal network activity. Using ASD patient derived neurons carrying SHANK3 microdeletions, it was found that the number of primary neurites was increased when SHANK3 levels were decreased. A recent study revealed that cortical neurons, derived from patient iPSCs, each harboring a distinct ASD genetic mutation, such as SHANK3, exhibited both hyperexcitability and precocious maturation, thereby proposing these characteristics as potential shared phenotypes of ASD. Given its classical localization to the PSD, the question remains how SHANK3 is involved in the regulation of differentiation before the PSD has formed. We performed a screen using 7,120 molecules with annotated MoAs to identify small molecular compounds that can reverse the observed hyperdifferentiation (Fig. 3). 21 out of 42 obtained hits had annotated targets related to cell cycle regulation or differentiation such as MAPKs, CDKs, ROCK, or GSK-3 (Fig. 4B). This target enrichment is most likely due to the used Ki67 and HuC/D proliferation and differentiation readout. When we performed counter screening in both healthy donor and non-modified CRISPR SHANK3 control NPCs none of these 21 cell cycle regulation and differentiation-related molecules showed a SHANK3 deficiency specificity and were discarded (Fig. S7, Table S1). After these selection steps the three molecules Alimemazine, Benproperine, and Boldine were found to rescue hyperdifferentiation without toxicity in a SHANK3 deficiency-specific manner.

### Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia [^dbaee2c1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine, formulated in the 1950s, remains a benchmark treatment for people with schizophrenia.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of chlorpromazine for schizophrenia in comparison with placebo.

Search Strategy

We updated previous searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (October 1999), Biological Abstracts (1982–1995), the Cochrane Library (1999, Issue 2), EMBASE (1980–1995), MEDLINE (1966–1995) and PsycLIT (1974–1995), by searching Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (June 2002). References of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials were contacted.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorpromazine with placebo relevant to people with schizophrenia, and non-affective serious/chronic mental illness irrespective of mode of diagnosis. Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviours, overall improvement, relapse and satisfaction with care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Citations and, where possible, abstracts were inspected independently by reviewers, papers ordered, re-inspected and quality assessed. Data were extracted by BT and JR. CA and GA independently checked a 10% sample for reliability. Dichotomous data were analysed using random effects relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this was estimated. Where possible the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm statistics (NNH) were calculated. Continuous data were excluded if more than 50% of people were lost to follow up, but, where possible, weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated.

Main Results

Over 1000 electronic records were inspected. The review currently mentions 302 papers in its Excluded Studies table and 50 studies in its Included Studies table. Four papers are awaiting translation. Chlorpromazine reduces relapse over six months to two years (n = 512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.5 to 0.9, NNT 3 CI 2.5 to 4) and promotes a global improvement in a person's symptoms and functioning (n = 1121, 13 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 7 CI 5 to 10) although the placebo response is also considerable. Fewer people allocated to chlorpromazine leave trials early (n = 1755, 25 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.6 to 1.1) but the difference iss not statistically significant. There are many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n = 1242, 18 RCTs, RR 2.3 CI 1.7 to 3.1, NNH 6 CI 5 to 8), it increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders (n = 780, 4 RCTs, RR 3.1 CI 1.3 to 7.7, NNH 24 CI 15 to 57), parkinsonism (n = 1265, 12 RCTs, RR 2.6 CI 1.2 to 5.4, NNH 10 CI 8 to 16) and, perhaps, fits (n = 695, 3 RCTs, RR 2.4 CI 0.4 to 16). Amongst other things it clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n = 1232, 15 RCTs, RR 1.9 CI 1.4 to 27, NNH 12 CI 8 to 19) and considerable increases in weight (n = 165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.4 CI 2.1 to 9, NNH 3 CI 2 to 5).

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review will confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know, but provides quantification to support clinical impression. Chlorpromazine's global position as a 'benchmark' treatment for psychoses is not threatened by this review. Chlorpromazine, in common use for half a century, is a well established but imperfect treatment. Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence-based decision making by clinicians, carers and patients.

### Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia [^0e7de23f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine, formulated in the 1950s, remains a benchmark treatment for people with schizophrenia.

Objectives

To review the effects of chlorpromazine compared with placebo, for the treatment of schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (15 May 2012). We also searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorpromazine with placebo for people with schizophrenia and non-affective serious/chronic mental illness irrespective of mode of diagnosis. Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviours, overall improvement, relapse and satisfaction with care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re-inspected and quality assessed these. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up. Where continuous data were included, we analysed this data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. We used a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We inspected over 1100 electronic records. The review currently includes 315 excluded studies and 55 included studies. The quality of the evidence is very low. We found chlorpromazine reduced the number of participants experiencing a relapse compared with placebo during six months to two years follow-up (n = 512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.47 to 0.90), but data were heterogeneous. No difference was found in relapse rates in the short, medium or long term over two years, although data were also heterogeneous. We found chlorpromazine provided a global improvement in a person's symptoms and functioning (n = 1164, 14 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.58 to 0.86). Fewer people allocated to chlorpromazine left trials early (n = 1831, 27 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.53 to 0.78) compared with placebo. There are many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n = 1627, 23 RCTs, RR 2.79 CI 2.25 to 3.45), it increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders (n = 942, 5 RCTs, RR 3.47 CI 1.50 to 8.03) and parkinsonism (n = 1468, 15 RCTs, RR 2.11 CI 1.59 to 2.80). Akathisia did not occur more often in the chlorpromazine group than placebo. Chlorpromazine clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n = 1488, 18 RCTs, RR 2.38 CI 1.74 to 3.25) and considerable weight gain (n = 165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.92 CI 2.32 to 10.43).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. Chlorpromazine's global position as a 'benchmark' treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the findings of this review. Chlorpromazine, in common use for half a century, is a well-established but imperfect treatment. Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence-based decision making by clinicians, carers and patients.

### Refractory agitation as a marker for pediatric delirium in very young infants at a pediatric intensive care unit [^f5ea8847]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) states that cognitive change must be observed in order to diagnose delirium, it has been argued that refractory agitation — as observed in these four infants, after exclusion of other logical explanations — may be more usefully considered as an expression of PD, which requires a different approach.

Delirium superimposed on withdrawal may present as an excess in the number, intensity, duration, and/or responsiveness of the symptoms normally associated with withdrawal. In the first two children, sedative medication may have induced PD through anticholinergic mechanisms (see below). In the other two children, PD was superimposed on withdrawal symptoms, as evidenced by nonresponse to reinstatement of the original sedative.

A recent consensus guideline on sedation and analgesia in critically ill children suggested that promethazine or alimemazine (trimeprazine), both H1-receptor antagonists, may be considered for sedation. However, these medications are characterized not only by sedation but also by strong anticholinergic side-effects, which may provoke agitation rather than sedation in children, given that cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission is linked to delirium pathophysiology through, respectively, hypocholinergic and/or hyperdopaminergic states. Thus, H1-antagonists with their strong anticholinergic and weak D2-blocking effects may kindle and aggravate refractory agitation. Haloperidol, however, with its weak anticholinergic and strong D2-blocking effects, may constitute a more effective treatment.

Haloperidol is a well-studied drug with few side-effects and has been successfully used for agitation in young children. Haloperidol and alimemazine both have low risks of cardiac side-effects — alimemazine may carry a higher risk — and rarely may induce malignant neuroleptic syndrome. The four children were successfully treated with haloperidol intravenously according to a minimal treatment schedule (Table 1).

Table 1
Minimal intravenous haloperidol dosage scheme for delirium in pediatric patients

Maximal haloperidol dosage in adults is approximately 5 mg/24 h i.v.

An empirical approach of steadily titrating and close monitoring is advocated in order to find the right dosage, maneuvering between clinical response and side-effects. One patient developed an intermittent oculogyric crisis that was successfully treated with 50 μg/kg biperiden i.v.

### Chlorpromazine dose for people with schizophrenia [^44b84357]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) Model Lists of Essential Medicines lists chlorpromazine as one of its five medicines used in psychotic disorders.

Objectives

To determine chlorpromazine dose response and dose side-effect relationships for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (December 2008; 2 October 2014; 19 December 2016).

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low doses of chlorpromazine (≤ 400 mg/day), medium dose (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day) or higher doses (> 800 mg/day) for people with schizophrenia, and which reported clinical outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We included studies meeting review criteria and providing useable data. Review authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated fixed-effect risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and their 95% CIs based on a fixed-effect model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and graded trial quality using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Main Results

As a result of searches undertaken in 2014, we found one new study and in 2016 more data for already included studies. Five relevant studies with 1132 participants (585 are relevant to this review) are now included. All are hospital-based trials and, despite over 60 years of chlorpromazine use, have durations of less than six months and all are at least at moderate risk of bias. We found only data on low-dose (≤ 400 mg/day) versus medium-dose chlorpromazine (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day) and low-dose versus high-dose chlorpromazine (> 800 mg/day). When low-dose chlorpromazine (≤ 400 mg/day) was compared to medium-dose chlorpromazine (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day), there was no clear benefit of one dose over the other for both global and mental state outcomes (low-quality and very low-quality evidence). There was also no clear evidence for people in one dosage group being more likely to leave the study early, over the other dosage group (moderate-quality evidence). Similar numbers of participants from each group experienced agitation and restlessness (very low-quality evidence). However, significantly more people in the medium-dose group (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day) experienced extrapyramidal symptoms in the short term (2 RCTS, n = 108, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74, moderate-quality evidence). No data for death were available. When low-dose chlorpromazine (≤ 400 mg/day) was compared to high-dose chlorpromazine (> 800 mg/day), data from one study with 416 patients were available. Clear evidence of a benefit of the high dose was found with regards to global state. The low-dose group had significantly fewer people improving (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.25, moderate-quality evidence). There was also a marked difference between the number of people leaving the study from each group for any reason, with significantly more people leaving from the high-dose group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89, moderate-quality evidence). More people in the low-dose group had to leave the study due to deterioration in behaviour (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.44, low-quality evidence). There was clear evidence of a greater risk of people experiencing extrapyramidal symptoms in general in the high-dose group (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.59, moderate-quality evidence). One death was reported in the high-dose group yet no effect was shown between the two dosage groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.14, moderate-quality evidence). No data for mental state were available.

Authors' Conclusions

The dosage of chlorpromazine has changed drastically over the past 50 years with lower doses now being the preferred of choice. However, this change was gradual and arose not due to trial-based evidence, but due to clinical experience and consensus. Chlorpromazine is one of the most widely used antipsychotic drugs yet appropriate use of lower levels has come about after many years of trial and error with much higher doses. In the absence of high-grade evaluative studies, clinicians have had no alternative but to learn from experience. However, such an approach can lack scientific rigor and does not allow for proper dissemination of information that would assist clinicians find the optimum treatment dosage for their patients. In the future, data for recently released medication should be available from high-quality trials and studies to provide optimum treatment to patients in the shortest amount of time.

### Pharmacological modulation of developmental and synaptic phenotypes in human SHANK3 deficient stem cell-derived neuronal models [^60660618]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Validation of SHANK3-specific hyperdifferentiation rescuing chemical compounds in patient-derived NPCs

Next, we validated the effects of the three identified compounds in the ASD04 PMDS patient-derived cell line. The healthy donor derived PC056 cell line was used as control. Identical to previous experiments, cells were treated from D0 to D6 in seven 3-fold dilution steps from 10 μM to 0.01 μM, fixed and stained with Hoechst and antibodies against Ki67 and HuC/D (Fig. S7A). The hyperproliferation and hypodifferentiation-inducing effects of all three tested compounds were confirmed in the SHANK3-deficient ASD04 NPCs. When comparing these results to the PC056 healthy-donor control NPC results, we could show that all three tested compounds specifically upregulated proliferation in a SHANK3 deficient manner (Fig. S7B). SHANK3 deficiency-specific downregulated differentiation was also demonstrated with all three compounds (Fig. S7C). For comparison, we also included three compounds (Domperidone, Promethazine, Trimipramine) that were not selected as SHANK3 deficiency-specific hits based on the previous results obtained in the CRISPR-engineered NPCs (Fig. 4D, E). Although Domperidone, Promethazine, and Trimipramine showed SHANK3 deficiency-specific increases on NPC proliferation, we detected no clear SHANK3 deficiency-specific effects on differentiation. All three compounds decreased differentiation in both the ASD04 PMDS patient-derived cells as well as the healthy donor derived PC056 cells (Fig. S7B, C). In conclusion, we identified Alimemazine, Benproperine and Boldine out of the 42 primary screening hits as chemical compounds that increase proliferation and decrease differentiation specifically in CRISPR-engineered as well as human PMDS patient-derived SHANK3 deficiency models (Table S1).

### Chlorpromazine for schizophrenia: a cochrane systematic review of 50 years of randomised controlled trials [^e40df4e8]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine (CPZ) remains one of the most common drugs used for people with schizophrenia worldwide, and a benchmark against which other treatments can be evaluated. Quantitative reviews are rare; this one evaluates the effects of chlorpromazine in the treatment of schizophrenia in comparison with placebo.

Methods

We sought all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing chlorpromazine to placebo by electronic and reference searching, and by contacting trial authors and the pharmaceutical industry. Data were extracted from selected trials and, where possible, synthesised and random effects relative risk (RR), the number needed to treat (NNT) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated.

Results

Fifty RCTs from 1955–2000 were included with 5276 people randomised to CPZ or placebo. They constitute 2008 person-years spent in trials. Meta-analysis of these trials showed that chlorpromazine promotes a global improvement (n = 1121, 13 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 7 CI 5 to 10), although a considerable placebo response is also seen. People allocated to chlorpromazine tended not to leave trials early in both the short (n = 945, 16 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.5 to 1.1) and medium term (n = 1861, 25 RCTs, RR 0.79 CI 0.6 to 1.1). There were, however, many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is sedating (n = 1242, 18 RCTs, RR 2.3 CI 1.7 to 3.1, NNH 6 CI 5 to 8), increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders, Parkinsonism and causes low blood pressure with dizziness and dry mouth.

Conclusion

It is understandable why the World Health Organization (WHO) have endorsed and included chlorpromazine in their list of essential drugs for use in schizophrenia. Low- and middle-income countries may have more complete evidence upon which to base their practice compared with richer nations using recent innovations.

### Refractory agitation as a marker for pediatric delirium in very young infants at a pediatric intensive care unit [^ac5a9b8d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

Refractory agitation in infants is frequently met at the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Finding the right sedative to remedy this can be challenging, particularly as previous research has shown that agitation in critically ill children may also be a marker for pediatric delirium (PD).

Over the last 2 years, four very young critically ill infants (two girls, two boys; age range 7–14 months; mechanically ventilated and receiving analgosedation according to international guidelines) presented with refractory agitation. Description of the context and diagnostic approach in our unit can be found in previous publications. Two of the four children received alimemazine in order to remedy agitation that was present in spite of adequate analgosedation; however, agitation worsened. In the two other infants, analgosedative medication was being tapered off slowly when the children developed agitation; despite reinstatement of analgosedative medication at its original dose or even higher, agitation continued.

### Adverse drugs reactions (ADR) suspected through phone triage and assessed by medically staffed ambulances: a pilot study [^76067277]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prompt and definitive diagnosis of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is a challenge for health care providers. There is a global burden of ADRs worldwide associated with a negative impact on the patient's health, in parallel with increasing costs for the community. This study aims to determine the annual incidence of ADRs in the cohort of patients requiring immediate intervention of the French prehospital emergency medical service (PEMS). The definitive diagnosis of ADR was provided by the follow-up of the entire course of hospitalization from PEMS presentation to final discharge in each suspected case.

Methods

A retrospective study examining the incidence of ADR at the Paris PEMS was performed in 2015.

Results

From January the 1st to December the 31st, 2015, 485 cases of suspected ADR were selected. Twenty-eight patients could not be identified at the hospital and were considered as lost to follow-up. For the 457 cases with the final diagnosis and outcome available, 359 had a definitive and new diagnosis of ADR, 9 were related to substance of abuse and alcohol, 14 were duplicates and 75 were excluded by drug causality was ruled out. Long-term follow-up was performed for 359 cases. Among them, 22 patients (6.1%) died of an ADR. Twenty-five severe ADRs were notified for children ages 2 to 16 with a cluster of 9 cases (36%) resulting from an accidental outbreak of poisonings with alimemazine in a classroom. No fatality was reported among children suffering from an ADR.

Conclusion

The collaboration between PEMS and in hospital Pharmacovigilance Centre is feasible from the PEMS report to the long-term follow-up. The definition of a clinical pattern for some drugs is needed to allow the medical team to anticipate the clinical outcome of the involved patient and therefore adapting the patient's support as soon as possible.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^32eb9fdf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

This comparison is important as the clinical use of drugs for psychosis does not always align with manufacturer's recommendations, and manufacturer's recommendations may not always reflect what will eventually be identified as optimal dosing for newer products. The history of dosing of drugs for psychosis is marked by notable changes in practice trends over time among all such drugs as well as for specific agents, with evidence of the persistence of controversial "high-dose" regimens exceeding typical maximum dosing guidance of ⩾1000 mg chlorpromazine equivalents per day. The discovery that expert opinion is thus far aligned with product monograph dosing for newer drugs for psychosis may offer reassurance that a refined understanding of dosing of drugs for psychosis is emerging. The high level of agreement also may reflect, to some extent, limited clinical experience with newer agents and the corresponding influence of manufacturers' recommendations on clinical practice.

### Medication burden and inappropriate prescription risk among elderly with advanced chronic kidney disease [^0749f571]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of PIM observed in our study is lower than that reported in the USA study by Jones et al. which included 100 patients with CKD stages 3–5 and a mean age of 80 years; instead it is very similar to that reported in other studies focused on elderly patients but without advanced CKD. Pharmacological treatment for elevated blood pressure in advanced CKD patients often requires a combination of several antihypertensive medications, such as central hypertensive drugs, to reach blood pressure (BP) goals. Rilmenidine is often prescribed, but is not recommended to control BP in the elderly or in CKD patients. Other antihypertensive medications should be optimized. Other PIM, such as long-term benzodiazepines, cerebral and peripheral vasodilators, and anticholinergic drugs, are widely prescribed in the elderly without advanced CKD, despite the risks of falls and sedation, particularly in France. Anticholinergic drugs are mainly H1-antihistamines and neuroleptics. H1-Antihistamines are frequently used to treat uremic pruritus but these drugs showed less effectiveness to treat uremic pruritus than gabapentin. Neuroleptics (i.e. mirtazapine and alimemazine) are often used for their hypnotic properties instead of more appropriate hypnotic drugs like short- acting benzodiazepines.

Discontinuation of or substitution for drugs that are PIM and RIM in elderly patients with advanced CKD must be considered. Finally, special attention should be paid to patients with higher systolic blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), lower CG-defined GFR, and living independently, as these groups are associated with higher risks of treatment by PIMs or RIMs. There are alternatives to the beer's criteria or the French list of Laroche such as the STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Person's potentially Inappropriate Prescriptions) and START (Screening Tool to Alert Doctors to Right Treatment) criteria. These criteria allowed to detect not only misuse but underuse too. Some studies have demonstrated a very low prescription rate of targeted medications within specific CKD patient: for exemple RASi for patients with diabetes and proteinuria, iron and erythropoietin for anaemic patients, statin for patients with coronary artery disease. Our study doesn't detect this underuse, probably because our patients had at least one consultation with a nephrologist. To our knowledge, there is no specific tool for CKD patients to detect misuse and underuse medications.

### Haloperidol versus first-generation antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders [^212e3f38]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Haloperidol is worldwide one of the most frequently used antipsychotic drugs with a very high market share. Previous narrative, unsystematic reviews found no differences in terms of efficacy between the various first-generation ("conventional", "typical") antipsychotic agents. This established the unproven psychopharmacological assumption of a comparable efficacy between the first-generation antipsychotic compounds codified in textbooks and treatment guidelines. Because this assumption contrasts with the clinical impression, a high-quality systematic review appeared highly necessary.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of haloperidol with other first-generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis.

Search Methods

In October 2011 and July 2012, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. To identify further relevant publications, we screened the references of all included studies and contacted the manufacturers of haloperidol for further relevant trials and missing information on identified studies. Furthermore, we contacted the corresponding authors of all included trials for missing data.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral haloperidol with another oral first-generation antipsychotic drug (with the exception of the low-potency antipsychotics chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, levopromazine, mesoridazine, perazine, prochlorpromazine, and thioridazine) in schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis. Clinically important response to treatment was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were global state, mental state, behaviour, overall acceptability (measured by the number of participants leaving the study early due to any reason), overall efficacy (attrition due to inefficacy of treatment), overall tolerability (attrition due to adverse events), and specific adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. We analysed dichotomous outcomes with risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes with mean differences (MD), both with the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). All analyses were based on a random-effects model and we preferably used data on an intention-to-treat basis where possible.

Main Results

The systematic review currently includes 63 randomised trials with 3675 participants. Bromperidol (n = 9), loxapine (n = 7), and trifluoperazine (n = 6) were the most frequently administered antipsychotics comparator to haloperidol. The included studies were published between 1962 and 1993, were characterised by small sample sizes (mean: 58 participants, range from 18 to 206) and the predefined outcomes were often incompletely reported. All results for the main outcomes were based on very low or low quality data. In many trials the mechanism of randomisation, allocation, and blinding was frequently not reported. In short-term studies (up to 12 weeks), there was no clear evidence of a difference between haloperidol and the pooled group of the other first-generation antipsychotic agents in terms of the primary outcome "clinically important response to treatment" (40 RCTs, n = 2132, RR 0.93 CI 0.87 to 1.00). In the medium-term trials, haloperidol may be less effective than the other first-generation antipsychotic group but this evidence is based on only one trial (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 0.51 CI 0.37 to 0.69). Based on limited evidence, haloperidol alleviated more positive symptoms of schizophrenia than the other antipsychotic drugs. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in global state, other mental state outcomes, behaviour, leaving the study early due to any reason, due to inefficacy, as well as due to adverse effects. The only statistically significant difference in specific side effects was that haloperidol produced less akathisia in the medium term.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of the meta-analytic calculations support the statements of previous narrative, unsystematic reviews suggesting comparable efficacy of first-generation antipsychotics. In efficacy-related outcomes, there was no clear evidence of a difference between the prototypal drug haloperidol and other, mainly high-potency first-generation antipsychotics. Additionally, we demonstrated that haloperidol is characterised by a similar risk profile compared to the other first-generation antipsychotic compounds. The only statistically significant difference in specific side effects was that haloperidol produced less akathisia in the medium term. The results were limited by the low methodological quality in many of the included original studies. Data for the main results were low or very low quality. Therefore, future clinical trials with high methodological quality are required.

### Pharmacological modulation of developmental and synaptic phenotypes in human SHANK3 deficient stem cell-derived neuronal models [^d5676455]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological hyperdifferentiation rescue depends on residual SHANK3 levels

PMDS patients are heterozygous SHANK3 mutation carriers, and the used SHANK3 mutated cell lines were designed to express approximately half of normal SHANK3 levels, but we also wanted to test whether the identified compounds require SHANK3 expression at all to show the identified proliferation and differentiation phenotypes (Fig. S3). To examine the compounds' SHANK3 dependence we used a CRISPR-engineered SHANK3 double knockout cell line (SHANK3-/-) and tested all three counter-screen validated compounds in these SHANK3-/- NPCs. Identical to previous experiments, cells were treated from D0 to D6 in seven 3-fold dilution steps from 10 μM to 0.01 μM, fixed and stained with Hoechst and antibodies against Ki67 and HuC/D. Compound toxicity was determined as increased nuclear staining intensity and decreased nuclear surface. SHANK3-/- double knockout cells were more susceptible to compound-induced toxicity than the previously tested cell lines (Fig. S8A). Alimemazine and Benproperine lead to a decrease in nuclei number already starting at 0.37 μM, while Boldine showed decreasing cell counts at 1.12 μM. When only the non-toxic doses for each compound were considered, we saw no or only very small dose-dependent effects on proliferation or differentiation in the SHANK3-/- NPCs (Fig. S8A). Boldine showed a small dose-response effect at non-toxic concentrations. Due to the absence of large compound-induced effects in the SHANK3-/- NPCs, we therefore conclude that residual SHANK3 levels are required for the full response to the identified compounds and that full SHANK3 deletion abolishes compound effects.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^164fe93f]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Antihistamines

What range of doses is more appropriate for antihistamines? Nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines at licensed doses are the recommended first-line treatment in mild-to-moderate chronic urticaria. In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria in whom the standard dose is not effective, there is evidence that increasing the dose up to fourfold might control symptoms, without compromising the patient's safety. There have been no well-designed, randomized double-blind clinical trials comparing the efficacy of therapeutic and upgraded doses. Some studies have been performed in spontaneous chronic urticaria and in certain forms of inducible chronic urticaria using desloratadine (up to 20 mg), levocetirizine (up to 20 mg), cetirizine (up to 30 mg), fexofenadine (up to 240 mg), rupatadine (up to 20 mg) and bilastine (up to 80 mg), but they have had mixed results. Limited data are available for updosing, but considering the good safety profile of most second-generation antihistamines, it might be worth evaluating the efficacy of antihistamines at higher-than-licensed doses before switching to other therapies. Regarding the best way to apply this treatment, the guidelines advise to employ high doses of antihistamines as a second treatment step. However, as in the case of cold urticaria, a useful approach may include starting with four times higher dose, with subsequent dose reduction in the presence of a clinical response.

### Chlorpromazine for schizophrenia: a cochrane systematic review of 50 years of randomised controlled trials [^33dc608d]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study designs

The studies were mostly either 6 or 12 weeks long, but the range was large (24 h to 3 years). The great majority of participants in nearly all of the trials were diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. These studies reported on > 5276 people, 3318 of whom were allocated to chlorpromazine-placebo comparison. Eleven of the 50 trials described the diagnostic criteria used, or the symptoms required for people to be included. Otherwise entry to most of the included studies was based on a pragmatic diagnosis of schizophrenia. The trials ranged in size from 21 to 838 participants. Most people were hospitalised at the time of the study. The lowest dose of chlorpromazine tested was 25 mg/day and the highest 2000 mg/day. One trial included both a placebo and a no-drug group, which we combined. Another study included both a placebo group and a "routine conventional hospital treatment" group. Data from the latter were not used in this review, as people in this group will probably have been given antipsychotic drugs.

### An audit of whether prescribed doses are measurable on the graduations of one oral syringe [^8266392f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

In paediatrics drugs are prescribed as mg/kg doses to facilitate accurate dosing. Anecdotally, some drugs are prescribed in such a way that the volume to be given is difficult to measure which may lead to inaccuracies and potential for error. Locally, errors have been reported where there has been a misunderstanding of the required dose, especially when decimal points are involved. This audit aimed to evaluate doses prescribed for in-patient children and evaluate whether they can be measured using the printed markings of one oral syringe.

Method

Data were collected for paediatric in-patients between 16th February and 27th March 2015 from paper drug charts and an electronic prescribing system depending which was in use in each area. Specific data on patient age, weight and prescribed dose were collected. Volumes were then calculated using the enteral products kept in the Trust formulary, including unlicensed specials. The prescribed volumes were reviewed against the Medicina Home® enteral syringes to see if they were measurable on the printed graduations of one oral syringe (in line with local dispensing standards). If they could not be measured, the percentage dose rounding required was calculated to see if doses could be rounded. A judgement was then made as to whether this was within an acceptable safe dose limit.

Results

Data for 560 individual medication orders for oral medicine were collected, 257 from electronic prescribing and 303 from paper charts. Of these 457 were liquid doses, 103 were from products only available as tablets or capsules. Of the 257 electronically prescribed doses, 61 (24%) were not measurable. Of the 303 paper chart doses, 57 (19%) were not measurable. Of the 457 liquid doses 77 only needed up to 4% dose adjustment to become measurable. A further 10 doses required up to 9% dose adjustment. Drugs that were frequently prescribed as non-measurable doses were: diazepam, alimemazine, chloral hydrate, azithromycin, metronidazole, paracetamol & ibuprofen. Some doses were not measurable from tablets and no liquid is available in the Trust: clonidine, omeprazole, lansoprazole, nifedipine SR.19/560 (3.4%) of medication orders required a dose to be measured to two decimal places: diazepam, morphine, clonazepam, furosemide, spironolactone, chloral hydrate, ranitidine, chlorothiazide, azithromycin, erythromycin.

Conclusion

This audit has shown that by prescribing accurately as mg/kg without any dose rounding almost a quarter of doses cannot be measured accurately. Only a small dose adjustment is required to make the doses measurable. The current electronic prescribing system in use does not appear to have any automatic rounding, indeed the prevalence of difficult to measure doses was slightly worse (although not statistically significant, p value 0.19, Chi squared test), possibly because the prescriber doesn't "sense check" what they are prescribing as it is automated. Particular drugs with unusual strengths are often implicated in having harder to measure doses. Consideration should be made to round doses when prescribing and to add information regarding the strength of liquids available in local clinical guidelines.

### Pericyazine for schizophrenia [^d65339cf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pericyazine is a 3-cyano-10 (3–4'-hydroxypiperidinopropyl) phenothiazine. It is overall pharmacologically similar with chlorpromazine, though particularly sedating. Dopamine receptor subtype analysis has not been performed for pericyazine, but the drug appears to induce greater noradrenergic than dopaminergic blockade. Compared to chlorpromazine, pericyazine reportedly has more potent antiemetic, antiserotonin, and anticholinergic activity.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical effects and safety of pericyazine in comparison with placebo, typical and atypical antipsychotic agents and standard care for people with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2013) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled trials focusing on pericyazine for schizophrenia and other types of schizophrenia-like psychoses (schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders). We excluded quasi-randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently from included papers by at least two review authors. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data were calculated. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to judge quality of evidence.

Main Results

We could only include five studies conducted between 1965 and 1980. Most of the included studies did not report details of randomisation, allocation concealment, details of blinding and we could not assess the impact of attrition due to poor reporting. For the primary outcome of Global state - not improved, the confidence interval was compatible with a small benefit and increased risk of not improving with pericyazine compared with typical antipsychotics (2 RCTs, n = 122, RR 1.24 CI 0.93 to 1.66, very low quality of evidence) or atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 0.97 CI 0.67 to 1.42, very low quality of evidence). When compared with typical antipsychotics relapse was only experienced by one person taking pericyazine (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 2.59 CI 0.11 to 61.75, very low quality of evidence). Pericyazine was associated with more extrapyramidal side effects than typical antipsychotics (3 RCTs, n = 163, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80, very low quality of evidence) and atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 2.69 CI 1.35 to 5.36, very low quality of evidence). The estimated risk of leaving the study early for specific reasons was imprecise for the comparisons of pericyazine with typical antipsychotics (2 RCTs, n = 71, RR 0.46 CI 0.11 to 1.90, very low quality of evidence), and with atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 0.13 CI 0.01 to 2.42, very low quality of evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

On the basis of very low quality evidence we are unable to determine the effects of pericyazine in comparison with typical or atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, there is some evidence that pericyazine may be associated with a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than other antipsychotics, and again this was judged to be very low quality evidence. Large, robust studies are still needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.

### Chlorpromazine (chlorproMAZINE hydrochloride) [^c3c07307]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and therapy may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to the sections on PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS.

### Chlorpromazine for schizophrenia: a cochrane systematic review of 50 years of randomised controlled trials [^4c42b44d]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

These 50 studies amounted to a total of > 2000 person-years of exposure to chlorpromazine or placebo. For people with this serious mental illness, and certainly in situations were resources are limited, chlorpromazine remains a first line treatment. The medium term data on improvement suggest that about 7 people have to be treated for one to have what the trialists would describe as 'global improvement' (n = 1121, 13 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 7 CI 5 to 10). This outcome relates to a simple dichotomised impression of a person's mental state, behaviour and functioning. Given the limited quality of reporting and the fact that we may be only able to pool data from a subset of the included trials, even this finding may be an over estimate of the positive and an underestimate of the negative effects of giving chlorpromazine.

The increased likelihood that people given chlorpromazine continued in their trial may be heartening. It could indicate a genuine decrease in the distressing symptoms of schizophrenia that led to an increased compliance with medication, despite common and unpleasant adverse effects such as sedation and hypotension. Doctors and nurses may, at times of acute disturbance, welcome this sedative effect but people with schizophrenia may not.

Despite limitations, this review provides quantitative evidence to confirm many of the impressions held by clinicians and recipients of care about the effects of chlorpromazine. Chlorpromazine is a sedating drug, prone to cause movement problems. Reliable evidence about its short-term effects is surprisingly weak, but information from studies that are > 6 months does suggest that chlorpromazine facilitates a global improvement and may decrease the likelihood of behaving in a disturbed manner, at least within the confines of hospital.

### Chlorpromazine versus reserpine for schizophrenia [^8c2c86f8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In the 1940s reserpine, refined from a plant extract that had been used for centuries, began to be used as a treatment for people with mental disorders and was one of the very first antipsychotic drugs. Its irreversible pharmacological potency and adverse effects meant that it has been withdrawn in the UK and its role has been superceded by 'newer' compounds. The effects of reserpine are of historical interest although there are some reports of it still being used in highly specialist situations in psychiatry. Chlorpromazine is also an old drug but it is still used for treatment of people with schizophrenia.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of two old medications (reserpine and chlorpromazine) for people with schizophrenia. Reserpine is now rarely used while chlorpromazine remains on the essential list of drugs of the World Health Organization (WHO).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (24 March 2016).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus reserpine for schizophrenia that presented useable data.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

Main Results

The review currently includes nine studies with an average 60 participants per study. All of these studies are now over 60 years old, conducted between 1955 and 1962. When chlorpromazine was compared with reserpine for people with schizophrenia, improvement in global state was better at short term for those receiving chlorpromazine (n = 781, 6 RCTs, RR 'not improved' 0.75 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92, low-quality evidence). Short-term improvement in paranoid distortion was measured using the Multidimensional Scale for Rating Psychiatric Patients (MSRPP). Data showed no clear difference between treatment groups (n = 19, 1 RCT, RR 1.33 95% CI 0.62 to 2.89, very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in functioning: occupational adjustment, medium term (n = 40, 1 RCT, RR 0.83 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47, moderate-quality evidence) and general behaviour (n = 98, 1 RCT, RR 0.79 CI 0.41 to 1.53, moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events were poorly reported. For 'toxic reaction' there was, again, no obvious difference between the two compounds (n = 210, 3 RCTs, RR 1.68 95% CI 0.43 to 6.54, moderate-quality evidence), and this also applied to leaving the study early (n = 229, 4 RCTs, RR 1.16 95% CI 0.94 to 1.42, moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Judged by standards of today, the evidence is largely of limited quality. However, some of these 1950s studies are remarkable in their foresight and clarity. Reserpine did have some effect on global state - but chlorpromazine did seem to perform better. Important issues regarding adverse effects were not really addressed by these trials. Chlorpromazine remains on the WHO list of essential drugs. Reserpine is now almost obsolete, although, probably as a result of evidence other than that reported in the pioneering trials used in this review.

### Pharmacological modulation of developmental and synaptic phenotypes in human SHANK3 deficient stem cell-derived neuronal models [^4d5a0aba]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The ARPC2-targetting compound Benproperine rescues increased synapse numbers when administered early during differentiation

Given the role of the ARP2/3 complex for neurite outgrowth via actin remodeling in neuronal growth cones, we investigated Benproperine effects on synapse formation and neuronal activity. We treated CRISPR-engineered WT2 and HT3 cells with 1 μM Benproperine or DMSO for 72 h at either one of two different timepoints during neuronal differentiation. An early treatment interval from D1-D3 was chosen to evaluate Benproperine's effect during development on synapse formation and activity, while a later interval from D34-36 in previously untreated neurons was chosen to test Benproperine's effects on already formed synapses. Neurons were stained with Hoechst, and antibodies against pre-synaptic marker Synapsin 1, post-synaptic protein SHANK3 and MAP2 (Fig. 6A). Consistent with our previous results, we measured an approximately two-fold increased number of synapses in HT3 neurons compared to WT2 control neurons (Fig. 2A, B, Fig. 6B). Interestingly, only an early treatment from D1-3 lowered the synapse count in HT3 neurons, thereby partially rescuing increased synapse formation. Later treatment from D34-36 did not lower synapse counts compared to DMSO. In line with our previous findings, Benproperine therefore decreased neuronal differentiation leading to reduced synapse formation while not being synaptotoxic when administered later during differentiation. We also tested the effects of the other two identified hits Alimemazine and Boldine on synapse formation and observed that both compounds impacted synapse numbers in HT3 neurons. While Alimemazine increased synapse formation, Boldine decreased the number of synapses similar to Benproperine (Fig. S9A). To understand whether the rescue of synapse numbers has also effects on neuronal activities we differentiated WT2 and HT3 neurons in MEA plates for 42 days and measured their electrical activity in regular intervals. In line with our previous results we found that untreated WT2 neurons were more active than SHANK3-deficient HT3 neurons on the individual neuron level, but also on the network level (Fig. 2C, Fig. 6C, D). While the mean neuronal firing rate of WT2 neurons was about 10 Hz, it was reduced to 3 Hz in HT3 neurons. Also signal synchrony, reflecting the strength of synaptic or inter-electrode connections, and network oscillation, reflecting the coordination of network activity across electrodes, were decreased in HT3 neurons (Fig. 6D). When Benproperine was added either early (D1-3) or late (D40-42) during WT2 and HT3 neuron differentiation, interestingly only minor changes were observed. In HT3 neurons the neural activity, as measured by firing rate, was slightly decreased from 3 to 2 Hz when Benproperine was administered early during differentiation (D1-3), but not during late treatment (D40-42). Higher order neuronal synchrony and network oscillation patterns remained unchanged after Benproperine treatment (Fig. 6D). SHANK3 is a crucial scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic density and we hypothesized that a compound-induced lack of SHANK3 might be associated with the observed reduction of synapses and the mild decrease of neuronal firing rate. As described above, we first determined synapses as Synapsin 1/SHANK3 double positive spots on the MAP2 network in D36 neurons. As an indicator of the SHANK3 protein level in synapses the integrated sum of all SHANK3 channel pixel intensities specifically within synapses was determined. As measured before, we observed that the synapses in untreated SHANK3-deficient HT3 neurons contained less SHANK3 signal (Fig. S5A, Fig. 6E). When we measured the synaptic SHANK3 signal in Benproperine-treated neurons, to our surprise, the SHANK3 integrated intensity was lower in both tested cell lines and there was no difference between both cell lines (Fig. 6E). Benproperine therefore seems to affect synaptic SHANK3 levels less in SHANK3-deficent HT3 neurons.

### Chlorpromazine (chlorproMAZINE hydrochloride) [^83cc82b7]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION–ADULTS

Adjust dosage to individual and the severity of his condition, recognizing that the milligram for milligram potency relationship among all dosage forms has not been precisely established clinically. It is important to increase dosage until symptoms are controlled. Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients. In continued therapy, gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level, after symptoms have been controlled for a reasonable period. The 100 mg and 200 mg tablets are for use in severe neuropsychiatric conditions.

Elderly Patients – In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully monitored, and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients.

Psychotic Disorders – Increase dosage gradually until symptoms are controlled. Maximum improvement may not be seen for weeks or even months. Continue optimum dosage for 2 weeks; then gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level. Daily dosage of 200 mg is not unusual. Some patients require higher dosages (e.g., 800 mg daily is not uncommon in discharged mental patients).

Hospitalized Patients:

Acute Schizophrenic or Manic States – It is recommended that initial treatment be with chlorpromazine hydrochloride injection until patient is controlled. Usually patient becomes quiet and co-operative within 24 to 48 hours and oral doses may be substituted and increased until the patient is calm. 500 mg a day is generally sufficient. While gradual increases to 2,000 mg a day or more may be necessary, there is usually little therapeutic gain to be achieved by exceeding 1,000 mg a day for extended periods. In general, dosage levels should be lower in the elderly, the emaciated and the debilitated.

### US prescription trends of antihistamines for atopic dermatitis, 2011–2016 [^e512052d]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Antihistamine use for primary treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) is not recommended, but current guidelines state that sedating antihistamines are favored over non-sedating antihistamines for relief of burdensome pruritus. We analyzed the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data to compare use of antihistamines between dermatologists and non-dermatologists. Overall, dermatologists are more likely to prescribe sedating than non-sedating antihistamines when compared to non-dermatologists (P < .001, δ abs = 0.45). Patients under 21 years old (P = 0.03, δ abs = 0.10) and Black patients (P < .001, δ abs = 0.19) were also more likely to receive sedating antihistamines than non-sedating antihistamines. These findings highlight the differential prescribing practices for atopic dermatitis among physicians.

### Management of cholestatic pruritus in paediatric patients with Alagille syndrome: the king's college hospital experience [^57fb7b0a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of the study were to perform a retrospective observational review of the present management and outcome of cholestatic pruritus in children with Alagille syndrome (AGS) at King's College Hospital and to use results to inform appropriate guidelines.

Methods

A retrospective review of 62 patients diagnosed as having AGS from January 1995 to November 2010 treated at King's College Hospital was performed. The departmental database of the Paediatric Liver Centre was searched to identify all patients and the clinical records were then analysed.

Results

Fifty-one (82.3%) patients experienced pruritus and 50 (80.6%) received antipruritic medication. Ursodeoxycholic acid was the most prescribed drug (n = 40). Other drugs prescribed were rifampicin (n = 39), cholestyramine (n = 18), naltrexone (n = 14), alimemazine (n = 13), nonsedating antihistamine agents (n = 7), ondansetron (n = 5), and phenobarbitone (n = 1). Albumin dialysis using the molecular adsorbent recirculation system was used in 1 patient. Sixteen patients (25.8%) were listed for liver transplantation, and 11 had undergone transplantation by November 2010. Patient survival was high at 95.2%. Pruritus resolved permanently in 39.2% (n = 20) of patients. Fifty-five percent (n = 11) of such patients had undergone liver transplantation. Pruritus was controlled by medication in 41.2% (n = 21). Itching remained a significant problem, affecting quality of life in 19.6% of patients (n = 10).

Conclusions

The management of cholestatic pruritus in AGS is difficult and often suboptimal. Pruritus may remain intractable even with combination medical treatment, and at this stage, surgery or liver transplantation is indicated. At our centre, pruritus was successfully treated in 80.4% of patients with medical and surgical management.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^2cee2836]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Key point: Given the safety of most antihistamines, doses can be increased up to four times the standard dose on an individual basis.

Can switching from one antihistamine to another attain an individualized response? According to the British American and EAACI 2014 guidelines, all patients should be offered a choice between two or more nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines, because individual differences in response and tolerance to different antihistamines have been reported.

Is it useful to combine different antihistamines (i.e. sedating and nonsedating)? In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria for whom the standard dose is not effective, combinations of antihistamines are frequently used as another way of updosing. This might involve, for example, two different second-generation antihistamines, or a second-generation antihistamine in the morning and a first-generation antihistamine in the evening. However, first-generation antihistamines are no longer recommended in chronic urticaria, and the clinical benefit of combining antihistamines is probably limited when H 1 -receptors are already occupied by another H 1 -antihistamine.

Key point: There are no studies that demonstrate that treatment with the combined use of sedating and nonsedating antihistamines is more effective than updosing the same antihistamine.

Is it useful to combine H 1 - and H 2 -antihistamines? Several relatively small studies have shown that combined use of H 1 -antihistamines and H 2 -antihistamines (cimetidine, ranitidine) may be more effective than using H 1 -antihistamines alone. This effect is related to an increase in the plasma levels of H 1 -antihistamine, most likely due to a pharmacologic interaction with the isoenzyme cytochrome P-450 in the liver. This phenomenon does not occur when cimetidine is associated with cetirizine. Accordingly, a review of recent studies does not allow confident decision-making about the use of H 2 -receptor antagonists in urticaria.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^708a2760]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the introduction of chlorpromazine and haloperidol seven decades ago, the number of drugs for psychosis has steadily increased with new drug entities and formulations resulting in dozens of treatment options for schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Competent use of drugs for psychosis requires clinical experience and knowledge of sound dosing practices. Such practice routinely includes dose increases to achieve symptomatic and functional improvement, gradual dose reduction to find tolerable and effective maintenance doses, and switching among agents and formulations as occurs in 15%–20% of patients treated with drugs for psychosis each year. Remarkably, however, consensus remains elusive on how to dose individual drugs for psychosis, including changing from one to an approximately equivalent dose of another, especially with newer agents. Establishing clinically equivalent dose estimates and dosing recommendations contributes to optimizing the use of drugs for psychosis in clinical practice, informing practice guideline development, and designing and interpreting clinical research.

Methods of estimating dosing equivalencies and establishing dosing recommendations have limitations and can yield values that vary substantially. Equivalent doses for many older drugs for psychosis, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, were supported by dose–effect relationships based on laboratory pharmacodynamic data, such as in vitro affinity at cerebral dopamine receptors. This preclinical approach does not account for important inter-species and individual differences in the disposition and pharmacokinetics of drugs for psychosis. Moreover, this approach assumes that laboratory pharmacodynamic dose–response relationships are directly related to clinical dose effects. Manufacturers may tend toward conservative dosing using small doses necessary to distinguish their product from placebo while limiting the risk of adverse effects. Attempts to estimate dosing equivalencies based on flexible dosing trials have been criticized for overestimating effective doses. Estimates based on trials involving multiple fixed-dose arms are informative but rare and often lack head-to-head comparisons with products of different manufacturers, thereby resulting in major gaps in data and equivalency estimates with wide confidence intervals.

### Quetiapine and drug interactions: evidence from a routine therapeutic drug monitoring service [^b58f6971]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of age, gender, and various comedications on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine in a naturalistic setting.

Method

In total, 2111 serum samples analyzed for quetiapine during the period from June 2001 to December 2004 were included in the study. The samples had been collected for routine therapeutic drug monitoring purposes from 1179 patients treated with quetiapine. A log-linear mixed model was used to identify factors influencing the dose-corrected quetiapine serum concentration, expressed as the quetiapine concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio. Variables included in the analysis were age, gender, and concomitant treatment with a total of 41 drugs most often used in combination with quetiapine.

Results

Age ≥ 70 years (p = .001) and comedication with alimemazine (p = .002), fluvoxamine (p = .001), citalopram/escitalopram (p = .041), or clozapine (p < .001) significantly increased the serum concentrations of quetiapine, while age < 18 years (p = .044) and comedication with lamotrigine (p = .024), levomepromazine (p = .011), oxazepam (p < .001), or carbamazepine (p < .001) significantly decreased the serum concentrations. The effects were most pronounced for fluvoxamine (+159%), clozapine (+82%), age ≥ 70 years (+67%), and carbamaze-pine (-86%). In 18% of the samples, the daily dose exceeded the currently recommended maximum of 800 mg/day.

Conclusion

Due to the increased serum levels of quetiapine, a lower dose than usual should be considered when quetiapine is administered to elderly patients and to patients comedicated with clozapine or fluvoxamine. As the inducing effect of carbamazepine on quetiapine metabolism is very potent, cotreatment with carbamazepine cannot be recommended. On the basis of our data and pharmacokinetic considerations, the majority of drugs commonly used in psychiatry can safely be given in combination with quetiapine.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^92268352]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Regarding the use of anti H2 antihistamines, most guidelines deleted this point but the American guidelines.

Should treatment for CSU be provided on-demand or in a sustained manner? The beneficial effects of nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines given on demand appear to be low.

Key point: Nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines should be given in a sustained manner.

Does antihistamines induced somnolence affect its use of in CSU? It is well known that H 1 -antihistamines cause sedation, somnolence and fatigue, leading to impairment of cognitive function, memory and psychomotor performance. A position paper of the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA 2 LEN) highlights the risk posed by the fact that first-generation H 1 -antihistamines, all of which are sedating, are generally regarded as safe simply because of their long-standing use. Given the unwanted side-effects and potential dangers of first-generation H 1 -antihistamines, newer, nonsedating second-generation H 1 -antihistamines with superior risk/benefit ratios (which are widely available at competitive prices) are strongly recommended.

Key point: Nonsedating antihistamines are recommended for CSU treatment.

### Chlorpromazine dose for people with schizophrenia [^0f033082]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine is one of the three antipsychotic drugs on the WHO Essential Drug List. It is used worldwide. The optimal dose has been the subject of evaluative research but summaries of this work are rare.

Objectives

To determine chlorpromazine dose response and dose adverse effect relationships for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (December 2008). References of all included studies were examined for further trials.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed doses of chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia and reporting clinical outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated fixed-effect relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) based on a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included four relevant studies (1012 participants) in this review. They are all hospital-based trials, have a duration of less than six months and are at moderate risk of bias. When low dose (≤ 400mg/day) was compared with medium dose (401–800 mg/day) mental state data were very few and difficult to interpret (n = 22, 1 RCT, WMD 'withdrawal retardation' -2.00 CI -3.76 to -0.24). More people left for inefficacy of treatment in the low dose group (n = 48, 1 RCT, RR 4.24 CI 0.24 to 74.01). In the short term, all measured extrapyramidal adverse effects tended to be lower in the low dose group (n = 70, 2 RCTs, RR dystonia 0.20 CI 0.04 to 0.97). When low dose was compared with high (> 800mg/day) data were taken from only one study (2gms chlorpromazine/day). Global state outcomes tended to favour the high dose group (n = 416, 1 RCT, RR 'No clinically important improvement 1.12 CI 1.01 to 1.23). One case of death was reported in the high dose group (n = 416, RR 0.33 CI 0.01 to 8.14) and a significantly greater number of people in the high dose group left early due to disabling adverse effects (n = 416, RR 0.10 CI 0.04 to 0.27). Significantly less dystonia and unspecified extrapyramidal adverse effects were reported in the low dose group (n = 416, dystonia RR 0.11 CI 0.02 to 0.45, unspecified extrapyramidal adverse effects RR 0.43 CI 0.32 to 0.59). People in both groups experienced akathisia (n = 416, RR1.00 CI 0.55 to 1.83).

Authors' Conclusions

The average dose of chlorpromazine given to people with schizophrenia has declined across time, but this has come about by long - and sometimes hard - experience rather than from direction from high-grade trial-based evidence. This progression towards gentler levels of dosing has taken six decades. We hope that, for modern compounds, data from relevant high-grade evaluative studies will be much more swiftly available to guide informed practice.

### Outcome of emergency surgery for severe neuroleptic-induced colitis: results of a prospective cohort [^8bc4d73a]. Colorectal Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

The study evaluated the outcome of severe acute antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drug related colitis requiring emergency surgery.

Method

From 2009 to 2014, 20 patients underwent emergency surgery for acute and severe neuroleptic-related ischaemic colitis. Neuroleptic-induced colitis was defined as another cause besides inflammatory, infectious or ischaemic colitis with a relationship to treatment by antipsychotic drugs.

Results

The main drugs involved were cyamemazine (n = 9, 45%), loxapine (n = 5, 25%), haloperidol (n = 4, 20%) and alimemazine (n = 4, 20%). Most (n = 14, 70%) patients presented with haemodynamic instability requiring massive resuscitation and vasopressive drugs. CT signs of digestive impairment were found in 13 (65%) patients having emergency surgery. The lesions were pancolonic in 40%; transparietal necrosis was found in 45% and 15% had colonic perforation. Twelve (60%) patients had total or subtotal colectomy and eight (40%) a segmental colectomy with colostomy or ileostomy in all cases. The postoperative mortality was 15% and morbidity was 70%, necessitating surgical reintervention in two (10%) patients. Of the 17 surviving patients, 11 (64.7%) had restoration of intestinal continuity after a median delay of 103 days, with a postoperative morbidity rate of 36.3%. In the intent-to-treat population, the permanent stoma rate was 30%.

Conclusion

The morbidity and mortality of surgery for neuroleptic-drug-induced colitis is higher than for colitis due to other causes. A better knowledge of this condition should lead to early diagnosis.

### Hydroxyzine for generalised anxiety disorder [^51e5ef46]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic long-term psychiatric disorder, particularly frequent in primary care. There are several treatment options available, both non-pharmacological (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological. Among the pharmacological interventions, antidepressants, buspirone and benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been studied in GAD. Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine medication which has been used in the treatment of anxiety.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent in alleviating the acute symptoms of GAD. 2. To review acceptability of treatment with hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent. 3. To investigate the adverse effects of hydroxyzine in comparison with other active agents.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 1 March 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO and checked reference lists of included studies, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of anxiety disorders. Personal communication with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field was also undertaken.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with GAD to hydroxyzine versus placebo and/or any other anxiolytic agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (such as the number of patients who responded to treatment or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side effect profile).

Main Results

The search yielded 39 studies. We included five studies in the review with a total of 884 participants. We excluded 31 studies and designated three as awaiting assessment. The data from the included studies provide some evidence that hydroxyzine is more effective than placebo for GAD (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) and that it is also acceptable/tolerable (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.58) (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40). Compared to other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability (hydroxyzine vs chloridiazepoxide: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.62; hydroxyzine vs buspirone efficacy OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.42). In terms of side effects, hydroxyzine was associated with a higher rate of sleepiness/drowsiness than the active comparators (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.53). There was, however, a high risk of bias in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol for this review. Even though more effective than placebo, due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, the small number of studies and the overall small sample size, it is not possible to recommend hydroxyzine as a reliable first-line treatment in GAD.

### Guidance on completing a written allergy and anaphylaxis emergency plan [^128eb0c2]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Allergy and anaphylaxis — second-generation antihistamines and cetirizine use are characterized by fewer central nervous system effects and comparable efficacy to diphenhydramine for certain mild reactions, as sedation and impairment in cognitive function can complicate assessment; second-generation H1 antihistamines are significantly less likely to cause these adverse effects, and in a randomized double-blind study of 70 allergic reactions during oral food challenge cetirizine had similar efficacy and onset of action compared with diphenhydramine in treating cutaneous symptoms during acute food-induced allergic reactions, supporting that cetirizine is a good option to consider for isolated mild symptoms.

### Chlorpromazine hydrochloride [^5ff0c3c2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Adjust dosage to individual and the severity of his condition, recognizing that the milligram for milligram potency relationship among all dosage forms has not been precisely established clinically. It is important to increase dosage until symptoms are controlled. Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients. In continued therapy, gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level, after symptoms have been controlled for a reasonable period.

The 100 mg and 200 mg tablets are for use in severe neuropsychiatric conditions.

Elderly Patients – In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully monitored, and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients.

Psychotic Disorders – Increase dosage gradually until symptoms are controlled. Maximum improvement may not be seen for weeks or even months. Continue optimum dosage for 2 weeks; then gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level. Daily dosage of 200 mg is not unusual. Some patients require higher dosages (e.g., 800 mg daily is not uncommon in discharged mental patients).

Hospitalized Patients:

Acute Schizophrenic or Manic States – It is recommended that initial treatment be with chlorpromazine hydrochloride injection until patient is controlled. Usually patient becomes quiet and co-operative within 24 to 48 hours and oral doses may be substituted and increased until the patient is calm. 500 mg a day is generally sufficient. While gradual increases to 2,000 mg a day or more may be necessary, there is usually little therapeutic gain to be achieved by exceeding 1,000 mg a day for extended periods. In general, dosage levels should be lower in the elderly, the emaciated and the debilitated.

### Munchausen by proxy syndrome mimicking systemic autoinflammatory disease: case report and review of the literature [^1662507a]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Review of the literature

MBPS is a potentially life-threatening disorder with up to 6% mortality. The clinical spectrum ranges from a caregiver displaying too much concern regarding minor symptoms, to a caregiver inducing illness with possible major impact on the child's physical and mental health. Factitious disorders in adolescents and adults have been described to simulate rheumatic conditions such as panniculitis or lupus. Such observations have been made in patients treated for lupus-like disease who were for example positive for ANA (an unspecific finding) and also had the appearance of renal symptoms (due to manipulated urine), rash (which was fabricated) along with reported photosensitivity or arthritis. Nonetheless, a search of PubMed with the terms "Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy" and "Rheumatology", "Autoinflammation", "Autoimmunity", "Arthritis" or "Lupus" retrieved no results for original data.

In contrast, fever was reported as early as 1987 as belonging to one of the most frequent symptoms of MBPS detected in 10% of 117 cases along with bleeding (44%), seizures (42%), CNS depression (19%), apnoea (15%), diarrhoea (11%) and vomiting (10%). Fever in MBPS can result from the induced infections, but is also falsely reported or fabricated via the manipulation of thermometers, physically generated hyperthermia, or falsified on charts. Fever in MBPS has also been chemically induced by the deliberate administration of diazoxide, alimemazine, ipecac, or mercury poisoning.

MBPS mimicking rheumatic conditions is probably uncommon but may be underreported. A case-report from 1987 describes a 7-year old girl, who presented with fever of unknown origin and then repeatedly presented with remitting fever over a period of 6 years and was transiently treated as SJIA. Additional observations were asthma, chronic purulent otitis media, and unilateral mydriasis. Finally, severe diarrhoea and vomiting found to be due to theophylline intoxication, were the last symptoms before discovery of the underlying condition.

We are aware of another MBPS case, which was first erroneously treated for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), another rare immunologic condition associated with recurrent fevers. However, the reverse has also been reported, with a case of an SAID, later identified as MVK deficiency, being mistaken as MBPS.

### Chlorpromazine versus piperacetazine for schizophrenia [^7b71c62e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with a prevalence of about 1% among the general population. It is listed among the top 10 causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. Antipsychotics are the mainstay treatment. Piperacetazine has been reported to be as clinically effective as chlorpromazine, a well established 'benchmark' antipsychotic, for people with schizophrenia. However, the side effect profiles of these antipsychotics differ and it is important that an evidence base is available comparing the benefits, and potential harms of these two antipsychotics.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and side effects of chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses in comparison with piperacetazine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (6 June 2015 and 8 October 2018) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, CENTRAL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on chlorpromazine versus piperacetazine for people with schizophrenia, reporting useable data.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE.

Main Results

We found 12 records referring to six trials. We included five trials, all from the 1970s, randomising 343 participants. We excluded one trial. The overall methodology and data reporting by the trials was poor. Only short-term data were available. Results from the included trials found that, in terms of global state improvement, when rated by a psychiatrist, there was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; participants = 208; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence). One trial reported change scores on the mental state scale Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); no clear difference was observed (MD -0.40, 95% CI -1.41 to 0.61; participants = 182; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence). Chlorpromazine appears no worse or better than piperacetazine regarding adverse effects. In both treatment groups, around 60% of participants experienced some sort of adverse effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33; participants = 74; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence), with approximately 40% of these participants experiencing some parkinsonism-type movement disorder (RR 0.95, CI 0.61 to 1.49; participants = 106; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence). No clear difference in numbers of participants leaving the study early for any reason was observed (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.56; participants = 256; studies = 4; very low-quality evidence). No trial reported data for change in negative symptoms or economic costs.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review show chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy, but data are based on very small numbers of participants and the evidence is very low quality. We can not make firm conclusions based on such data. Currently, should clinicians and people with schizophrenia need to choose between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine they should be aware there is no good quality evidence to base decisions. More high quality research is needed.

### Chlorpromazine versus atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia [^fa8da77c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine is an aliphatic phenothiazine, which is one of the widely-used typical antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine is reliable for its efficacy and one of the most tested first generation antipsychotic drugs. It has been used as a 'gold standard' to compare the efficacy of older and newer antipsychotic drugs. Expensive new generation drugs are heavily marketed worldwide as a better treatment for schizophrenia, but this may not be the case and an unnecessary drain on very limited resources.

Objectives

To compare the effects of chlorpromazine with atypical or second generation antipsychotic drugs, for the treatment of people with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register up to 23 September 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared chlorpromazine with any other atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating people with schizophrenia. Adults (as defined in each trial) diagnosed with schizophrenia, including schizophreniform, schizoaffective and delusional disorders were included in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently screened the articles identified in the literature search against the inclusion criteria and extracted data from included trials. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we determined the mean difference (MD) values and 95% CIs. We assessed the risk of bias in included studies and rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

This review includes 71 studies comparing chlorpromazine to olanzapine, risperidone or quetiapine. None of the included trials reported any data on economic costs. 1. Chlorpromazine versus olanzapineIn the short term, there appeared to be a significantly greater clinical response (as defined in each study) in people receiving olanzapine (3 RCTs, N = 204; RR 2.34, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.99, low quality evidence). There was no difference between drugs for relapse (1 RCT, N = 70; RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.86, very low quality evidence), nor in average endpoint score using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) for mental state (4 RCTs, N = 245; MD 3.21, 95% CI -0.62 to 7.05, very low quality evidence). There were significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms experienced amongst people receiving chlorpromazine (2 RCTs, N = 298; RR 34.47, 95% CI 4.79 to 248.30, very low quality evidence). Quality of life ratings using the general quality of life interview (GQOLI) - physical health subscale were more favourable with people receiving olanzapine (1 RCT, N = 61; MD -10.10, 95% CI -13.93 to -6.27, very low quality evidence). There was no difference between groups for people leaving the studies early (3 RCTs, N = 139; RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.40, very low quality evidence). 2. Chlorpromazine versus risperidoneIn the short term, there appeared to be no difference in clinical response (as defined in each study) between chlorpromazine or risperidone (7 RCTs, N = 475; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.34, low quality of evidence), nor in average endpoint score using the BPRS for mental state 4 RCTs, N = 247; MD 0.90, 95% CI -3.49 to 5.28, very low quality evidence), or any observed extrapyramidal adverse effects (3 RCTs, N = 235; RR 1.7, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.40, very low quality evidence). Quality of life ratings using the QOL scale were significantly more favourable with people receiving risperidone (1 RCT, N = 100; MD -14.2, 95% CI -20.50 to -7.90, very low quality evidence). There was no difference between groups for people leaving the studies early (one RCT, N = 41; RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.11, very low quality evidence). 3. Chlorpromazine versus quetiapineIn the short term, there appeared to be no difference in clinical response (as defined in each study) between chlorpromazine or quetiapine (28 RCTs, N = 3241; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06, moderate quality evidence) nor in average endpoint score using the BPRS for mental state (6 RCTs, N = 548; MD -0.18, 95% CI -1.23 to 0.88, very low quality evidence). Quality of life ratings using the GQOL1-74 scale were significantly more favourable with people receiving quetiapine (1 RCT, N = 59; MD -6.49, 95% CI -11.30 to -1.68, very low quality evidence). Significantly more people receiving chlorpromazine experienced extrapyramidal adverse effects (8 RCTs, N = 644; RR 8.03, 95% CI 4.78 to 13.51, low quality of evidence). There was no difference between groups for people leaving the studies early in the short term (12 RCTs, N = 1223; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.41, moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Most included trials included inpatients from hospitals in China. Therefore the results of this Cochrane review are more applicable to the Chinese population. Mostincluded trials were short term studies, therefore we cannot comment on the medium and long term use of chlorpromazine compared to atypical antipsychotics. Low qualityy evidence suggests chlorpromazine causes more extrapyramidal adverse effects. However, all studiesused varying dose ranges, and higher doses would be expected to be associated with more adverse events.

### Antihistamines: do they work? Further well-controlled trials involving larger samples are needed [^1073f102]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Histamine is one of the most important steps in the phlogistic allergic reaction. Its activity is due to the link to specific receptors on the cellular surface. H1-receptors of second generation are the most currently prescribed drugs in allergic diseases for their high selectivity, little or no central sedative effect, rapid onset of action and long half lives. Antihistamines can modulate part of immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation reducing mediator release and expression of adhesion molecules, regulating the release of cytokines, chemokines and consequently inflammatory cells recruitment. The anti-inflammatory effects of cetirizine, desloratadine and levocetirizine are reviewed. Quality of life is considered too, as a main parameter in a global evaluation of the antihistamine's effects.

### Chlorpromazine [^12216026]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Long-Term Therapy: To lessen the likelihood of adverse reactions related to cumulative drug effect, patients with a history of long-term therapy with chlorpromazine and/or other antipsychotics should be evaluated periodically to decide whether the maintenance dosage could be lowered or drug therapy discontinued.

Antiemetic Effect: The antiemetic action of chlorpromazine may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as intestinal obstruction, brain tumor and Reye's syndrome [see WARNINGS].

When chlorpromazine is used with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, vomiting as a sign of the toxicity of these agents may be obscured by the antiemetic effect of chlorpromazine.

Abrupt Withdrawal: Like other phenothiazines, chlorpromazine is not known to cause psychic dependence and does not produce tolerance or addiction. There may be, however, following abrupt withdrawal of high-dose therapy, some symptoms resembling those of physical dependence such as gastritis, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and tremulousness. These symptoms can usually be avoided or reduced by gradual reduction of the dosage or by continuing concomitant anti-parkinsonism agents for several weeks after chlorpromazine is withdrawn.

Intranasal antihistamines for allergic rhinitis (AR) — recommendation and evidence profile: Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR, with a policy level of Option based on randomized controlled trials with minor limitations and observational studies and an overall equilibrium of benefit and harm. The aggregate evidence quality is Grade A and the level of confidence in evidence is high, but most trials were of short duration. Benefits include rapid onset and increased effectiveness over oral antihistamines for nasal congestion, while risks/harms/costs include increased cost relative to oral antihistamines, poor taste, sedation, more frequent dosing, epistaxis, and local side effects. The Guideline Development Group judged this class generally second-line after failure of nasal steroids or oral antihistamines due to poor acceptance, taste, and cost, though specific patients may be appropriate for first-line therapy; intentional vagueness is none and the role of patient preferences is large with shared decision making emphasized. Exclusions include that these agents are not approved for children younger than 5 years, and differences of opinion were minor.

### Does potency predict clinical efficacy? Illustration through an antihistamine model [^6a2e9f78]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The concepts of potency and efficacy are often confused and used interchangeably within the scientific and pharmaceutical industry. It is important that the distinction between the two is understood, and that the terms are defined within their correct context. After reading this article, readers should have an understanding of the relationships between receptor potency and clinical efficacy.

Data Sources

Following a comprehensive review of the literature using MEDLINE, the author observed a lack of relevant references that relate measurements of potency to clinical efficacy. Therefore, the author reviewed the basic pharmacologic principles of potency using examples from the recent antihistamine literature.

Results

Potency is an expression of the activity of a drug in terms of the concentration or amount of the drug required to produce a defined effect, whereas clinical efficacy judges the therapeutic effectiveness of the drug in humans. The differing methods of evaluating the activity of antihistamines in vitro and in vivo can lead to inconsistent results, which complicate the use of potency to predict clinical efficacy. Further, as therapeutic behavior is modulated by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and by further interactions at sites other than the target receptor, it does not necessarily follow that more potent drugs have greater clinical efficacy.

Conclusions

Although potency can be a good preclinical marker of the therapeutic potential of a drug, clinical efficacy should only be evaluated within the patient population using appropriate outcome measures.

### Hydroxyzine [^f0da2c77]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is unrelated chemically to phenothiazine, reserpine, and meprobamate. Hydroxyzine has demonstrated its clinical effectiveness in the chemotherapeutic aspect of the total management of neuroses and emotional disturbances manifested by anxiety, tension, agitation, apprehension or confusion.

Hydroxyzine has been shown clinically to be a rapid-acting true ataraxic with a wide margin of safety. It induces a calming effect in anxious, tense, psychoneurotic adults and also in anxious, hyperkinetic children without impairing mental alertness. It is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system.

Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally.

Hydroxyzine has been shown experimentally to have antispasmodic properties, apparently mediated through interference with the mechanism that responds to spasmogenic agents such as serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine.

Antihistaminic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically.

An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine in therapeutic dosage does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and in most cases provides mild antisecretory benefits.

### Oral H1 antihistamines as' add-on' therapy to topical treatment for eczema [^c9fb49ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The symptoms of eczema can lead to sleeplessness and fatigue and may have a substantial impact on quality of life. Use of oral H1 antihistamines (H1 AH) as adjuvant therapy alongside topical agents is based on the idea that combining the anti-inflammatory effects of topical treatments with the blocking action of histamine on its receptors in the skin by H1 AH (to reduce the principal symptom of itch) might magnify or intensify the effect of treatment. Also, it would be unethical to compare oral H1 AH alone versus no treatment, as topical treatment is the standard management for this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment in adults and children with eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2018: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database (Global Resource of EczemA Trials; from inception). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the abstracts of four conference proceedings held between 2000 and 2018.

Selection Criteria

We sought RCTs assessing oral H1 AH as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment for people with eczema compared with topical treatment plus placebo or no additional treatment as add-on therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Primary outcome measures were 'Mean change in patient-assessed symptoms of eczema' and 'Proportion of participants reporting adverse effects and serious adverse events'. Secondary outcomes were 'Mean change in physician-assessed clinical signs', 'Mean change in quality of life', and 'Number of eczema flares'.

Main Results

We included 25 studies (3285 randomised participants). Seventeen studies included 1344 adults, and eight studies included 1941 children. Most studies failed to report eczema severity at baseline, but they were conducted in secondary care settings, so it is likely that they recruited patients with more severe cases of eczema. Trial duration was between three days and 18 months. Researchers studied 13 different H1 AH treatments. We could not undertake pooling because of the high level of diversity across studies in terms of duration and dose of intervention, concomitant topical therapy, and outcome assessment. Risk of bias was generally unclear, but five studies had high risk of bias in one domain (attrition, selection, or reporting bias). Only one study measured quality of life, but these results were insufficient for statistical analysis. Although this review assessed 17 comparisons, we summarise here the results of three key comparisons in this review. Cetirizine versus placeboOne study compared cetirizine 0.5 mg/kg/d against placebo over 18 months in 795 children. Study authors did not report patient-assessed symptoms of eczema separately for pruritus. Cetirizine is probably associated with fewer adverse events (mainly mild) (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.01) and the need for slightly less additional H1 AH use as an indication of eczema flare rate (P = 0.035; no further numerical data given). Physician-assessed clinical signs (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD)) were reduced in both groups, but the difference between groups was reported as non-significant (no P value given). Evidence for this comparison was of moderate quality. One study assessed cetirizine 10 mg/d against placebo over four weeks in 84 adults. Results show no evidence of differences between groups in patient-assessed symptoms of eczema (pruritus measured as part of SCORAD; no numerical data given), numbers of adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45; mainly sedation, other skin-related problems, respiratory symptoms, or headache), or physician-assessed changes in clinical signs, amount of local rescue therapy required, or number of applications as an indicator of eczema flares (no numerical data reported). Evidence for this comparison was of low quality. Fexofenadine versus placeboCompared with placebo, fexofenadine 120 mg/d taken in adults over one week (one study) probably leads to a small reduction in patient-assessed symptoms of pruritus on a scale of 0 to 8 (mean difference (MD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.07; n = 400) and a greater reduction in the ratio of physician-assessed pruritus area to whole body surface area (P = 0.007; no further numerical data given); however, these reductions may not be clinically meaningful. Results suggest probably little or no difference in adverse events (mostly somnolence and headache) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.50; n = 411) nor in the amount of 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate used (co-intervention in both groups) as an indicator of eczema flare, but no numerical data were given. Evidence for this comparison was of moderate quality. Loratadine versus placeboA study of 28 adults compared loratadine 10 mg/d taken over 4 weeks versus placebo. Researchers found no evidence of differences between groups in patient-assessed pruritus, measured by a 100-point visual analogue scale (MD -2.30, 95% CI -20.27 to 15.67); reduction in physician-assessed clinical signs (SCORAD) (MD -4.10, 95% CI -13.22 to 5.02); or adverse events. Study authors reported only one side effect (folliculitis with placebo) (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.76). Evidence for this comparison was of low quality. Number of eczema flares was not measured for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the main comparisons, we did not find consistent evidence that H1 AH treatments are effective as 'add-on' therapy for eczema when compared to placebo; evidence for this comparison was of low and moderate quality. However, fexofenadine probably leads to a small improvement in patient-assessed pruritus, with probably no significant difference in the amount of treatment used to prevent eczema flares. Cetirizine was no better than placebo in terms of physician-assessed clinical signs nor patient-assessed symptoms, and we found no evidence that loratadine was more beneficial than placebo, although all interventions seem safe. The quality of evidence was limited because of poor study design and imprecise results. Future researchers should clearly define the condition (course and severity) and clearly report their methods, especially participant selection and randomisation; baseline characteristics; and outcomes (based on the Harmonising Outcome Measures in Eczema initiative).

### Chlorpromazine versus clotiapine for schizophrenia [^0539492a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is a chronic, disabling and severe mental disorder, characterised by disturbance in perception, thought, language, affect and motor behaviour. Chlorpromazine and clotiapine are among antipsychotic drugs used for the treatment of people with schizophrenia.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost-effectiveness of chlorpromazine compared with clotiapine for adults with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's Trials Register (last update search 16/01/2016), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and clinical trials registries. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the Register.

Selection Criteria

All randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus clotiapine for schizophrenia. We included trials meeting our selection criteria and reporting useable data.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random-effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

Main Results

We have included four studies, published between 1974 and 2003, randomising 276 people with schizophrenia to receive either chlorpromazine or clotiapine. The studies were poor at concealing allocation of treatment and blinding of outcome assessment. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in global and mental state, specific change in negative symptoms, incidence of movement disorder (dyskinesia), leaving the study early for any reason, and costs. All reported data were short-term (under six months' follow-up). The trials did not report data for the important outcomes of clinically important change in global or mental state, or cost of care. Improvement in mental state was reported using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). When chlorpromazine was compared with clotiapine the average improvement scores for mental state using the PANSS total was higher in the clotiapine group (1 RCT, N = 31, MD 11.50 95% CI 9.42 to 13.58, very low-quality evidence). The average change scores on the PANSS negative sub-scale were similar between treatment groups (1 RCT, N = 21, MD -0.97 95% CI -2.76 to 0.82, very low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in incidence of dyskinesia (1 RCT, N = 68, RR 3.00 95% CI 0.13 to 71.15, very low-quality evidence). Similar numbers of participants left the study early from each treatment group (3 RCTs, N = 158, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.24 to 1.88, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Clinically important changes in global and mental state were not reported. Only one trial reported the average change in overall mental state; results favour clotiapine but these limited data are very difficult to trust due to methodological limitations of the study. The comparative effectiveness of chlorpromazine compared to clotiapine on change in global state remains unanswered. Results in this review suggest chlorpromazine and clotiapine cause similar adverse effects, although again, the quality of evidence for this is poor, making firm conclusions difficult.

### Chlorpromazine versus penfluridol for schizophrenia [^5c6d37cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of chlorpromazine, a benchmark antipsychotic, has not been fully assessed in direct comparison with different individual antipsychotics. Penfluridol is another old antipsychotic with a long half-life so one oral dose may last up to one week. This could confer advantage.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effects of chlorpromazine compared with penfluridol for adults with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

On 31 March 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus penfluridol for adults with schizophrenia or related disorders. Outcomes of interest were death, service utilisation, global state, mental state, adverse effects and leaving the study early. We included trials meeting our selection criteria and reporting useable data.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we planned to estimate the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

Main Results

The review includes three studies with a total of 130 participants. Short-term results for hospital admissions showed no clear difference between chlorpromazine and penfluridol (1 RCT, n = 29, RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.60, low-quality evidence). No clear difference in the incidence of akathisia was found at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 85, RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.06, low-quality evidence), and similar numbers of participants - nearly half - from each treatment group left the study early (3 RCTs, n = 130, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.77, low-quality evidence). The risk of needing additional antiparkinsonian medication was less in the chlorpromazine group (2 RCTs, n = 74, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.95). No useable data reported clinically important change in global or mental state. No data were reported for relapse. No deaths were reported by the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Only three small studies provided data and the quality of reporting and evidence is low. Limited data indicate the efficacy and adverse effects profiles of chlorpromazine and penfluridol are generally similar. Penfluridol, however, may confer advantage by needing to be given only once per week. Firm conclusions are not possible without good-quality trials, and where these treatments are used, such trials are justified.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^d69c0f91]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Oral antihistamines for allergic rhinitis — Recommendation 6 states: "We recommend against prescribing a first-generation antihistamine and are in favor of a second-generation antihistamine when prescribing an oral antihistamine for the treatment of AR". Strength of recommendation is Strong with High certainty of evidence. Selecting a second-generation antihistamine reduces potential side effects associated with first-generation agents, including sedation, performance impairment, poor sleep quality, and anticholinergic-mediated symptoms. First-generation antihistamines may produce performance impairment in school and while driving that can exist without subjective awareness of sedation, and their use has been associated with increased automobile and occupational accidents. In one early study, chlorpheniramine caused greater drowsiness and dry mouth for the first 2 weeks, but at doses of chlorpheniramine < 24 mg/day there was no significant difference versus placebo in subjective drowsiness, dizziness, irritability, or dry mouth over the remaining 6 weeks. Bedtime dosing may leave residual central nervous system effects due to long terminal elimination half-life (> 24 hours for chlorpheniramine). A cohort study of strong anticholinergics (including first-generation antihistamines) reported adjusted hazard ratios for dementia of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74–1.16) for 1 to 90 days of standardized daily doses and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.21–1.96) with cumulative 3 years of daily use; these findings further support use of second-generation antihistamines over first-generation antihistamines for AR.

### Hydroxyzine (hydroxyzine hydrochloride) [^77bc54ce]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is unrelated chemically to the phenothiazines, reserpine, meprobamate or the benzodiazepines. Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system.

Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Bronchodilator activity, and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated.

Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine in therapeutic dosage does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and in most cases has mild antisecretory

activity.

Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydroxyzine's clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.

### Does immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy increase the frequency of adverse reactions to concomitant medications? [^60488881]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

1.3 What are the culprit drugs?

Drug hypersensitivity is generally an exceedingly rare occurrence in the general population. Not all drugs are created equal in this domain and so in the first instance, corroboration of exacerbated toxicity profiles of ICI treated patients in conjunction with drugs with well‐known liabilities for hypersensitivity is an area of interest. Indeed, such cases have begun to be recognised and acted upon; sulfasalazine is an excellent example as it elicits hypersensitivity in the general population at a rate considered to be high but acceptable. However, the incidence of sulfasalazine hypersensitivity appears to be increased to an unacceptable level in ICI treated individuals, and as a result this drug is effectively informally contraindicated in this patient cohort. Ironically, as the current treatment algorithms for irAEs are lifted from the management of parallel autoimmune diseases, sulfalsalazine formed part of the initial treatment algorithms for ICI‐induced arthralgia. The use of drugs with a pre‐existing, well‐recognised risk for these types of reactions are likely to be problematic in these patients, and the oncology community should be made aware of the potential challenge posed by certain concomitant medications. A review of hypersensitivity literature to identify such compounds might be helpful in terms of identifying therapeutics to closely monitor. Adjunctive therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors also have a proven capacity to elicit such reactions. It is also important to remember, as demonstrated in our own case report on iodinated contrast media, that previous tolerance of a compound in isolation does not guarantee tolerance once a checkpoint is introduced. Whilst some combinations will be obviously intolerable, for the vast majority, it might be that the risk‐benefit balance is altered, but ICI treatment is still considered to convey sufficient benefit to warrant treatment. Additionally, pre‐emptive review of concomitant medication could be undertaken as standard to ameliorate the risk. Therefore, wide reassessment of concomitant medications is warranted.

### Thioridazine hydrochloride [^e96617b6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Thioridazine hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the management of schizophrenic patients who fail to respond adequately to treatment with other antipsychotic drugs. Due to the risk of significant, potentially life threatening, proarrhythmic effects with thioridazine treatment, thioridazine hydrochloride tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to treatment with appropriate courses of other antipsychotic drugs, either because of insufficient effectiveness or the inability to achieve an effective dose due to intolerable adverse effects from those drugs. Consequently, before initiating treatment with thioridazine hydrochloride tablets, it is strongly recommended that a patient be given at least two trials, each with a different antipsychotic drug product, at an adequate dose, and for an adequate duration (see WARNINGS and CONTRAINDICATIONS).

However, the prescriber should be aware that thioridazine hydrochloride tablets have not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials in treatment refractory schizophrenic patients and its efficacy in such patients is unknown.

### First do no harm: managing antihistamine impairment in patients with allergic rhinitis [^c31077ca]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are effective medications that have been used for decades in the management of allergic rhinitis; however, they may be administered or selected in an inappropriate fashion and may be the source of drug-related morbidity. Our objective is to present relevant background information and an expert consensus statement on the use of antihistamines in treatment of allergic rhinitis. In July 2002, 14 experts in allergy, clinical immunology, pharmacology, and impairment assessment were invited to participate in a roundtable conference to present current concepts and develop a consensus statement on the clinical management of allergic rhinitis with antihistamines. Many of the antihistamines used to treat allergic rhinitis, as well as the disease itself, may produce sedation, impairment, and reduced quality of life. Allergic rhinitis is more appropriately managed with the relatively nonimpairing second-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine), because older agents (eg, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and brompheniramine) produce sedation and impairment and worsen sleep architecture. Although there is some debate surrounding the varying degrees of efficacy of second-generation antihistamines, it is known that some agents may produce varying levels of drowsiness or impairment, especially at higher than recommended doses. The differences with regard to safety among the second-generation antihistamines are smaller than are the differences between the first and second generations. A nonsedating, nonimpairing (even at higher than recommended doses), second-generation antihistamine is preferred for all patients, particularly those with a higher risk for the development of adverse effects. We recommend that primary care and specialist physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, and all other health professionals involved in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic rhinitis follow this consensus document and share this information with patients for whom antihistamine therapy is recommended. In addition, further epidemiologic studies on the effects of antihistamines should be performed.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^0ddc3a7e]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Key point: Cyclosporine may be considered as an off-label therapeutic option for controlling CSU in patients who are refractory to antihistamines and omalizumab.

What is the role of oral antileukotrienes in the treatment of CSU? The efficacy of antileukotrienes has been reported in small randomized double-blind studies – with inconsistent results. Monotherapy with antileukotrienes is not advisable.

Key point: The evidence supporting leukotriene inhibitors as a therapeutic option in CSU is weak, and their use in CSU is not recommended.

Which patients with CSU should be treated with omalizumab? The efficacy and safety of omalizumab have been demonstrated in two randomized, placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite H 1 -antihistamine therapy at the approved dose. A third study primarily evaluated the safety of omalizumab in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite treatment with H 1 -antihistamines at up to four times the approved dose, and with H 2 -antihistamine and/or leukotriene inhibitors treatment. Omalizumab is the only drug indicated in Europe and the United States as an add-on therapy for the treatment of CSU in adult and adolescent (12 years and older) patients with an inadequate response to H 1 -antihistamine treatment.
