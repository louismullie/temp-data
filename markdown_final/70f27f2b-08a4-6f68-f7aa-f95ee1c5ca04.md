## Question

ddx for neutropenia and lymphocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of concurrent neutropenia and lymphocytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormal counts and characterizing the lymphocytes on smear. Then, I should categorize etiologies by mechanism, starting with clonal lymphoproliferative disorders, followed by autoimmune and viral causes, then drug-induced and congenital or acquired marrow failure, and finally rare entities. Next, I will outline a staged diagnostic workup, including when to use flow cytometry, molecular testing, and bone marrow biopsy. Finally, I will integrate management principles and highlight red flags that mandate urgent action, making sure I verify each step against guidelines and key reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its severity, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with neutropenia and lymphocytosis before building a differential. Neutropenia is typically defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1.5 × 10⁹/L in adults, with severity stratifications of mild 1.0–1.5, moderate 0.5–1.0, and severe less than 0.5 × 10⁹/L, while lymphocytosis is generally an absolute lymphocyte count above 4.0 × 10⁹/L in adults, though thresholds vary by lab and age, so I should double-check the reference range and the patient's baseline CBC history before proceeding [^41e7d6ef] [^2580cc30].

> Wait, let me verify the morphology on the peripheral smear, because distinguishing reactive from clonal lymphocytes changes the entire pathway. Reactive lymphocytes are pleomorphic with varying sizes and shapes, whereas a monomorphic population of medium-sized cells with azurophilic granules suggests large granular lymphocytes and a clonal process; I should also look for blasts, dysplasia, or atypical forms that would pivot me toward leukemia or marrow failure syndromes, and I need to ensure the automated differential is accurate by reviewing a manual differential when counts are abnormal or the instrument flags a suspicious population [^2580cc30] [^63420681].

> I will now examine clonal lymphoproliferative disorders, starting with T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia, because it is a classic cause of lymphocytosis with neutropenia. T-LGLL presents with persistent clonal CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytosis, often exceeding 2,000/µL, and neutropenia occurs in roughly 70–80% of cases; rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases are common, and somatic STAT3 mutations are present in about 30–40% of cases, which helps anchor the diagnosis when combined with flow cytometry and TCR clonality studies [^a1513a47] [^5857f656].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also consider chronic lymphocytic leukemia, even though CLL more often shows lymphocytosis with normal or mildly reduced neutrophils. In some patients, CLL-related immune dysregulation or marrow infiltration can cause neutropenia, so I need to check for a monomorphic B-cell population with characteristic immunophenotype and consider FISH for prognostication if CLL is suspected, keeping in mind that CLL is primarily a disease of older adults and may be indolent [^notfound].

> Next, I should review hairy cell leukemia, because it can produce neutropenia with lymphocytosis, albeit the lymphocytes are atypical with hairy projections and the disease often causes pancytopenia and splenomegaly. If suspected, I should confirm with flow cytometry and consider bone marrow biopsy, and I need to remember that treatment is indicated for symptomatic disease or significant cytopenias, including ANC less than 1,000/µL [^1a14a5c5].

> Let me consider autoimmune and immune-mediated etiologies next, because they frequently explain neutropenia with a relative or absolute lymphocytosis. Felty syndrome, defined by rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly, and neutropenia, shares pathobiology with T-LGLL and may even represent a clinical spectrum; I should confirm RA history, examine for splenomegaly, and assess for clonal T-cell expansions that blur the boundary with T-LGLL [^46090287] [^c0a231ec].

> I should confirm whether systemic lupus erythematosus is in the picture, since SLE commonly causes leukopenia with lymphopenia, but selective neutropenia with lymphocytosis can occur via autoantibodies and immune complex–mediated destruction; importantly, the 2025 ACR guideline advises against treating isolated asymptomatic neutropenia or lymphopenia with immunosuppression in the absence of other lupus activity, reserving G-CSF for severe neutropenia with infection, so I need to correlate with global disease activity before escalating therapy [^0ed5ff67] [^99899df0].

> But wait, what if the lymphocytosis is reactive rather than clonal. Viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and HIV can drive reactive lymphocytosis and, in some cases, immune-mediated neutropenia; I should check serologies and, when appropriate, PCR, and I must remember that EBV can mimic cholecystitis and produce atypical lymphocytosis, so I should keep a broad infectious differential when the clinical picture is atypical [^e9e5f085] [^e8be4861].

> I need to check for drug-induced neutropenia, because medications are a leading cause of acquired neutropenia and can coexist with reactive lymphocytosis. Classic culprits include antithyroid agents, sulfonamides, sulfasalazine, clozapine, and chemotherapeutics; immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause severe immune-related neutropenia that requires corticosteroids and G-CSF, and late-onset neutropenia after rituximab or obinutuzumab is well described, so I should meticulously review exposures and timing relative to cytopenia onset [^bffb3f32] [^6379b77c] [^882ef799] [^77e4e522].

> Let me think about congenital and acquired marrow failure syndromes, because persistent unexplained cytopenias warrant evaluation for bone marrow failure. Severe congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, Shwachman-Diamond, GATA2 deficiency, and myelodysplastic syndromes can all present with neutropenia; lymphocytosis may be relative or due to clonal lymphoproliferation in some cases, and I should consider genetic testing and bone marrow examination when cytopenias are severe, persistent, or accompanied by dysplasia or extramedullary features [^cf9965e8] [^f7b41f52] [^bf1babca].

> Hold on, I should verify whether inborn errors of immunity are plausible, especially in children or young adults with recurrent infections and unusual cytopenias. IEI can present with neutropenia, lymphopenia, or combined cytopenias, and early recognition of SPUR cytopenias prompts targeted genetic testing; in some IEI, neutropenia reflects impaired myelopoiesis or autoimmunity, and hematology input is essential to coordinate molecular diagnostics and management [^3ba4fe2a] [^f92a5992].

> Next, I should review a staged diagnostic workup, starting with a careful history, medication review, infection risks, autoimmune symptoms, and family history, followed by a focused exam for lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and signs of infection or autoimmunity. I should repeat the CBC with manual differential to confirm counts and morphology, obtain a peripheral smear, and add HIV, hepatitis B/C, EBV, and CMV testing when clinically indicated, escalating to flow cytometry if a clonal lymphocytosis is suspected or if lymphocytes exceed 5,000/µL with atypical morphology [^2580cc30] [^63420681].

> I should double-check when to pursue molecular testing and bone marrow evaluation. Persistent unexplained neutropenia, cytopenias with dysplasia, suspicion of MDS, or features of marrow infiltration should prompt bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetics, and TCR gene rearrangement studies can help distinguish clonal T-LGLL from reactive expansions; STAT3 mutation testing supports T-LGLL and may inform prognosis and treatment response, while next-generation sequencing panels can uncover congenital neutropenia or IEI when suspected [^a1513a47] [^5857f656] [^556849b0].

> Let me reconsider the immediate management priorities, because I need to ensure patient safety before definitive diagnosis. Severe neutropenia with fever is an emergency requiring prompt broad-spectrum antibiotics and risk-stratified care pathways; in contrast, isolated mild to moderate neutropenia without fever in a stable patient can be observed with close follow-up, and drug-induced cases should trigger withdrawal of the offending agent with serial counts to document recovery [^e388563c] [^0e507514] [^bffb3f32].

> I should confirm therapy-specific nuances for clonal and autoimmune etiologies. T-LGLL with symptomatic neutropenia often responds to low-dose immunosuppression such as methotrexate or cyclosporine, with G-CSF reserved for severe infection risk; Felty syndrome management mirrors RA care with immunosuppression and G-CSF as needed; and for SLE-associated neutropenia, I must avoid treating numbers alone in the absence of disease activity, using G-CSF cautiously due to flare risk [^a1513a47] [^46090287] [^0ed5ff67].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have highlighted red flags that mandate urgent hematology referral and expedited workup: severe neutropenia with fever, pancytopenia, blasts on smear, dysplasia, extramedullary disease, or cytopenias in children with syndromic features should trigger inpatient evaluation, bone marrow examination, and consideration of genetic testing, because delays in diagnosing marrow failure or clonal disease can have significant consequences [^f7b41f52] [^bf1babca] [^0e507514].

Neutropenia with lymphocytosis reflects **compensatory lymphocyte expansion** when neutrophils are low, or a **clonal lymphoproliferative disorder** when lymphocytes are abnormally increased. The most common causes are **viral infections** (EBV, CMV, HIV, COVID-19) [^e9e5f085] [^e8be4861] [^ac7546a3], **autoimmune diseases** (SLE, Felty syndrome, T-LGLL) [^0ed5ff67] [^46090287] [^a1513a47], and **hematologic malignancies** (CLL, hairy cell leukemia, large granular lymphocyte leukemia) [^1a14a5c5] [^a1513a47]. Less common causes include **drug-induced neutropenia** (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, antithyroids, sulfonamides) [^bffb3f32] [^6379b77c] [^882ef799] and **congenital or acquired marrow failure syndromes** (severe congenital neutropenia, GATA2 deficiency, MDS) [^cf9965e8] [^f7b41f52] [^bf1babca]. Evaluation should include CBC with differential, peripheral smear, viral serologies, autoimmune screening, and flow cytometry; bone marrow biopsy is indicated for unexplained cytopenias, dysplasia, or suspicion of malignancy [^2580cc30] [^63420681] [^eb941dab].

---

## Infectious etiologies

Viral infections are the **most common cause** of neutropenia with lymphocytosis, typically via bone marrow suppression of neutrophils and reactive lymphocyte expansion [^notfound].

- **Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)**: Infectious mononucleosis presents with neutropenia, lymphocytosis, and atypical lymphocytes; may cause autoimmune neutropenia [^e9e5f085] [^e8be4861].
- **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)**: Can cause neutropenia and lymphocytosis, including in congenital infection [^921e3ab2].
- **Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)**: Chronic HIV infection causes lymphocytosis (CD8+ expansion) and neutropenia via immune-mediated destruction and marrow suppression [^notfound].
- **COVID-19**: Neutropenia and lymphocytosis can occur, often with lymphopenia in severe disease; delayed neutropenia has been reported [^755d443a] [^a299ac28].

---

## Autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders

Autoimmune diseases can cause **neutropenia** through antibody-mediated destruction or marrow suppression, with **lymphocytosis** from chronic immune activation [^notfound].

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Neutropenia and lymphopenia are common; lymphocytosis can occur in active disease or with immune dysregulation [^0ed5ff67] [^99899df0].
- **Felty syndrome**: RA with splenomegaly and neutropenia; clonal T-LGL expansions are common, explaining lymphocytosis [^46090287] [^c0a231ec].
- **T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL)**: Clonal CD8+ T-cell expansion with neutropenia and autoimmune features; indolent course [^a1513a47] [^5857f656].
- **Autoimmune neutropenia**: Primary or secondary; often in children, resolving spontaneously or with immunotherapy [^c684050a] [^3f55fb08].

---

## Hematologic malignancies

Clonal lymphoid disorders can present with **lymphocytosis** and **neutropenia** due to marrow infiltration, immune-mediated destruction, or splenic sequestration [^2580cc30].

- **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)**: Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis with neutropenia from marrow infiltration or autoimmunity [^notfound].
- **Hairy cell leukemia**: Indolent B-cell leukemia with neutropenia, splenomegaly, and lymphocytosis [^1a14a5c5].
- **Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL)**: Clonal T-cell or NK-cell proliferation with neutropenia and lymphocytosis [^a1513a47] [^5857f656].

---

## Drug-induced neutropenia

Many drugs cause **neutropenia** via marrow suppression or immune destruction; lymphocytosis may be relative or reactive [^bffb3f32].

- **Chemotherapy**: Cytotoxic agents frequently cause neutropenia; lymphocytosis may reflect relative increase or immune reconstitution [^notfound].
- **Immunotherapy**: Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause severe immune-mediated neutropenia; lymphocytosis may reflect immune activation [^6379b77c] [^3c839d0a].
- **Antithyroid drugs**: Methimazole and propylthiouracil can cause agranulocytosis; lymphocytosis may be reactive [^bffb3f32].
- **Sulfonamides**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and sulfasalazine can cause neutropenia [^bffb3f32].

---

## Congenital and acquired marrow failure syndromes

Bone marrow failure syndromes cause **neutropenia** from impaired myelopoiesis; lymphocytosis may be compensatory or clonal [^f7b41f52].

- **Severe congenital neutropenia**: ELANE, HAX1, or G6PC3 mutations; high risk of infections and leukemic transformation [^cf9965e8].
- **GATA2 deficiency**: Multilineage cytopenias, lymphocytosis, and increased risk of MDS/AML [^dc8743dc].
- **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: Dysplastic neutropenia with clonal lymphocytosis in some cases [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential to distinguish reactive from clonal causes [^2580cc30].

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | CBC with differential, peripheral smear | Confirm neutropenia/lymphocytosis; assess morphology |
| 2 | Viral serologies (EBV, CMV, HIV, COVID-19) | Identify infectious causes |
| 3 | Autoimmune screening (ANA, RF, anti-neutrophil antibodies) | Detect autoimmune neutropenia |
| 4 | Flow cytometry | Identify clonal lymphoproliferative disorders |
| 5 | Bone marrow biopsy | Evaluate marrow infiltration, dysplasia, or failure |
| 6 | Genetic testing (e.g. ELANE, GATA2) | Diagnose congenital neutropenia syndromes |

---

Neutropenia with lymphocytosis has a broad differential spanning infections, autoimmunity, malignancy, drugs, and marrow failure; a **focused history, exam, and tiered laboratory evaluation** — including smear, viral testing, autoimmune screening, flow cytometry, and marrow as indicated — are key to identifying the cause and guiding therapy [^2580cc30] [^63420681].

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^63420681]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Why is my patient neutropenic? [^41e7d6ef]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is a common reason for hematology consultations in the inpatient and outpatient settings and is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL. Neutropenia varies in severity, with more profound neutropenia being associated with higher rates of infections and infection-related deaths. The causes for neutropenia are diverse and include congenital and acquired conditions (ie, autoimmune, drugs, infection, and malignancy). This article outlines the most common causes of neutropenia and discusses differential diagnoses, treatment modalities, and the mechanisms by which neutropenia occurs.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^2580cc30]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Incidental neutropenia: an emergency medicine focused approach [^0e507514]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 cells/microL and may be discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic, afebrile patient.

Objective

This narrative review provides an approach to the afebrile emergency department patient with incidental neutropenia.

Discussion

Neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL, with mild neutropenia defined as an ANC ≥ 1000 to < 1500 cells/microL, moderate ≥ 500 to < 1000 cells/microL, severe < 500 cells/microL, and agranulocytosis < 200 cells/microL. Incidental or isolated neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL discovered on laboratory testing unrelated to the patient's chief complaint (e.g., chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, etc.) and not associated with fever or infectious signs and symptoms. There are a variety of etiologies, with inherited forms, dose-dependent drug-induced neutropenia, and infections the most common causes. Testing includes complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear. Management is based on the patient's hemodynamic status, presence of fever, severity of neutropenia, and the peripheral smear. Patients who are critically ill, febrile, have severe neutropenia, or have a concerning peripheral smear (schistocytes, atypical lymphocytes) should undergo hematology consultation. Those with critical illness or fever with neutropenia should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients who are afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and non-toxic appearing with mild or moderate neutropenia can likely be discharged for repeat testing in one to two weeks.

Conclusion

Understanding the approach to incidental neutropenia can improve patient care. Critically ill or febrile patients should be admitted, but select patients may be discharged.

### Autoimmune and other acquired neutropenias [^649f3b88]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

This educational review addresses the diagnostic evaluation of patients for autoimmune and other forms of acquired neutropenia, including the futility of deconstructing the overlap of chronic "autoimmune", "benign", and "idiopathic" categories. Isolated neutropenias caused by infection, drugs, and immunologic disorders are also addressed. Discussion of management options emphasizes a conservative approach, with largely supportive care for these mostly benign and self-limited disorders.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^6379b77c]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Neutropenia during ICI therapy — workup and treatment — diagnostic workup for patients with possible ICI-related neutropenia should include CBC with differential and blood smear evaluation; for patients being treated with chemo-immunotherapy who develop neutropenia, it is important to differentiate between immune-related neutropenia and chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression; for patients with immune-related neutropenia, treatment should follow hematological standard of care and typically includes steroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg oral or equivalent) with G-CSF.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^70d65387]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations of additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed, with the overall aim of aiding the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

### Diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making for the neutropenic patient [^0f86821a]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Determining the cause of a low neutrophil count in a pediatric or adult patient is essential for the hematologist's clinical decision-making. Fundamental to this diagnostic process is establishing the presence or lack of a mature neutrophil storage pool, as absence places the patient at higher risk for infection and the need for supportive care measures. Many diagnostic tests, eg, a peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy, remain important tools, but greater understanding of the diversity of neutropenic disorders has added new emphasis on evaluating for immune disorders and genetic testing. In this article, a structure is provided to assess patients based on the mechanism of neutropenia and to prioritize testing based on patient age and hypothesized pathophysiology. Common medical quandaries including fever management, need for growth factor support, risk of malignant transformation, and curative options in congenital neutropenia are reviewed to guide medical decision-making in neutropenic patients.

### Are clonal T-cell large granular lymphocytes to blame for unexplained haematological abnormalities? [^6cce4f9e]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Abnormalities diagnosed on routine blood work, such as mild neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and relative lymphocytosis, often have obscure aetiologies. A series of 30 patients were evaluated for various unexplained haematological abnormalities between 1997 and 2005, and found to have circulating monoclonal T-cell large granular lymphocytes (T-LGL). These patients fit the diagnosis of T-cell clonopathy of unknown significance (TCUS), which may represent a clinical spectrum of clonal T-LGL proliferation. Our patients were characterised by a complete absence of severe neutropenia (< 0.5 × 10⁹/l), absence of recurrent neutropenic infection (0%), negative rheumatoid serology (0%) and a low incidence of constitutional symptoms (20%). This overall asymptomatic clinical presentation appeared to be different from other previously reported series of TCUS or T-LGL leukaemia who typically had symptomatology and required treatment. Our series of 30 patients represented the benign end of the spectrum of clonal T-LGL proliferation, and might reflect diagnosis at earlier stages of the condition relative to other reported series. TCUS may be a heterogeneous and under-diagnosed condition. This study further broadens our understanding of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of indolent clonal T-cell proliferation, and raises our awareness of this condition. We suggest that TCUS should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained haematological problems.

### Congenital neutropenia and rare functional phagocyte disorders in children [^c3d2d0e9]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Both profound neutropenia and functional phagocyte disorders render patients susceptible to recurrent, unusual, and/or life-threatening infections. Many disorders also have nonhematologic manifestations and a substantial risk of leukemogenesis. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion and interrogation of the complete blood count with differential/bone marrow examination coupled with immunologic and genetic analyses. Treatment of the quantitative neutrophil disorders depends on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, whereas management of functional phagocyte disease is reliant on antimicrobials and/or targeted therapies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant remains the only curative option for most disorders but is not used on a routine basis.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 hairy cell leukemia initial treatment — Clinical judgment is required to decide when to initiate therapy because not all newly diagnosed patients require immediate treatment, and asymptomatic disease is best managed by close observation ("watch and wait") until indications develop. Indications for treatment initiation may include symptomatic disease with excessive fatigue, splenomegaly or hepatomegaly discomfort, unexplained weight loss (> 10% within prior 6 months), cytopenias defined as hemoglobin < 11 g/dL, platelets < 100,000/mcL, and/or absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mcL, as well as progressive lymphocytosis or lymphadenopathy.

### Expert perspective: hematologic malignancies and vasculitis [^ca5000d1]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Some laboratory abnormalities in patients with vasculitis significantly raise our suspicion for underlying hematologic malignancy and lead us to initiate hematology consultation or referral (Figure 2). Inflammatory diseases such as vasculitis often cause anemia, neutrophil‐dominant leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. In contrast, erythrocytosis, neutropenia, persistent monocytosis or lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and especially bicytopenia or pancytopenia are uncommon and merit further evaluation. Eosinophilia is commonly recognized by rheumatologists and has its own broad differential diagnosis, including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, IgG4‐related disease, and hematologic mimics (Table 1), as has previously been described. In the absence of lymphocytosis, elevated SPEP and SFLC are more likely to reveal monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) than plasma cell dyscrasia. Both these diagnoses increase in prevalence with age and can be followed annually in clinic in the absence of clinical features of hypercalcemia, bone pain, and renal dysfunction. However, together with elevated LDH and cryoglobulin levels and hypocomplementemia, especially of C4 or consistent clinical phenotype (Table 1), these may also support consideration of MGUS‐ or lymphoid malignancy–associated cryoglobulinemia or amyloidosis (Figure 2). In patients developing vasculitis or perivascular inflammation during treatment of solid tumors, especially with neutrophilia and possibly circulating blasts on CBC, we look for antecedent granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF) exposure.

### How we evaluate and treat neutropenia in adults [^29916fd9]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Isolated neutropenia is a common clinical problem seen by primary care physicians and hematologists. The evaluation of neutropenia is dictated by the acuity of the clinical presentation and the duration, age, and clinical status of the patient. In this review, we provide a practical approach to the evaluation of the adult patient with neutropenia, with the major focus on the evaluation of neutropenia in the outpatient setting.

### Delayed, transient and self-resolving neutropenia following COVID-19 pneumonia [^755d443a]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A novel coronaravirus, identified as SARS-CoV-2, spread throughout the world in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many discoveries and clinical manifestations. A young patient is presented with new, self-resolving neutropenia presenting weeks after a prolonged hospital stay for COVID-19 pneumonia. Workup included analysis for underlying infection, nutritional abnormalities, malignancy, medication and toxin exposure, all of which were negative. From 2020 to the present, few reports have described neutropenia associated with a recent COVID-19 infection. In particular, no reports have described a delayed presentation of neutropenia. The authors would like to propose that the significant inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 is likely what led to this patient's postviral neutropenia. Furthermore, in young healthy patients, bone marrow biopsy may be deferred and a watchful-waiting approach may be taken to assess for neutropenia resolution.

2025 ACR guideline for SLE — leukopenia recommends that For asymptomatic neutropenia and/or lymphopenia (absolute counts < 1,000/mcL for either) attributed to SLE, we conditionally recommend against initiating immunosuppressive treatment (glucocorticoids, conventional or biologic immunosuppressants) in the absence of other lupus disease activity; neutropenia attributed to SLE is treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) only if it is severe and associated with infection; G-CSF should be used with caution as lupus flares have been reported after treatment, and lymphopenia, which is more common than neutropenia, is usually associated with overall lupus disease activity and generally does not require specific treatment.

### Febrile neutropenia due to COVID-19 in an immunocompetent patient [^a299ac28]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

While lymphopenia has been a common finding in COVID-19 infection, particularly in severe cases, febrile neutropenia has been very rarely reported in immunocompetent patients with COVID-19. Herein, we report the case of a 76-year-old hypertensive and diabetic man who was hospitalised with severe COVID-19 infection and developed delayed-onset severe neutropenia with neutropenic fever, which responded to treatment with antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. This case highlights the importance of identifying a rare complication (febrile neutropenia on the fifth week) of COVID-19 infection in hospitalised patients by intensive monitoring and aggressive management for favourable outcomes.

### Could hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis be the core issue of severe COVID-19 cases? [^998934b2]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 resemble sHLH

The cardinal features of sHLH are high fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, cytopenia (e.g. anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia), coagulopathy, central nervous system disturbances, and rapidly progressing multi-organ failure. Respiratory symptoms, which commonly present as dyspnea and cough, or ARDS can also occur in patients with sHLH. This phenomenon mostly occurs in cases triggered by respiratory viruses, and the signs of infection may overlap with the symptoms of sHLH. Similarly, the majority of patients with COVID-19 present with high fever (observed in 44% of patients upon presentation, and subsequently, in 64.5–99% patients), cough (45–82%), dyspnea (6.5–63.5%), and myalgia or fatigue (11–70%). Some patients also show liver damage (transaminase activity), lymphocytopenia, and rapidly progressing multi-organ failure. Indeed, a number of the cardinal clinical features of these two conditions are shared, as summarized in Table 2.

### Understanding neutropenia secondary to intrinsic or iatrogenic immune dysregulation [^ec88539f]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

As a key member of the innate and adaptive immune response, neutrophils provide insights into the hematopoietic and inflammatory manifestations of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and the consequences of immunotherapy. The facile recognition of IEI presenting with neutropenia provides an avenue for hematologists to facilitate early diagnosis and expedite biologically rationale care. Moreover, enhancing the understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving neutropenia in IEI-decreased bone marrow reserves, diminished egress from the bone marrow, and decreased survival-offers an opportunity to further dissect the pathophysiology driving neutropenia secondary to iatrogenic immune dysregulation, eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.

### Drug-induced neutropenias: now and then… [^bffb3f32]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

In a recent article by van der Klauw et al, 1 it was observed that the highest risks for developing drug-induced agranulocytosis were found for thyroid inhibitors, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, sulfasalazine, chlomipramine hydrochloride, and dipyrone combined with analgesics. In a less sophisticated survey of all cases of drug-induced neutropenia that were reported into the computerized patient diagnosis register in Stockholm, Sweden, more than 20 years ago, my colleague and I2 found strikingly similar results. Although the panorama of drugs that are available in the marketplace has changed so much over the years, those causing neutropenia are still very similar and still on the market. It is of interest to note that although agranulocytosis caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim is seldom fatal, it is extremely costly for society.

### Epstein-Barr in a patient presenting with right upper quadrant pain: a case report from the emergency department [^e9e5f085]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and elevated cholestasis blood tests are usually associated with bacterial calculous cholecystitis. However, viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also manifest with a similar clinical picture and is an important differential diagnosis.

Case Report

This case report discusses a young woman presenting to the emergency department with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The initial assessment revealed a positive Murphy's sign, elevated white blood count, and a cholestatic pattern on liver function tests, leading one to suspect bacterial calculous cholecystitis and initiating antibiotic therapy. However, clinical examination also revealed tonsillar exudates and differential white blood cell count revealed monocytosis and lymphocytosis rather than a high neutrophil count. The patient tested positive for EBV. Furthermore, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed gallbladder wall edema with no gallstones, leading one to conclude that the clinical manifestation and laboratory results were due to an EBV infection. Antibiotic therapy was ceased and the patient did not require surgical intervention. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Calculous bacterial cholecystitis usually entails antibiotic therapy and cholecystectomy. It is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis of EBV, as it usually does not require either of these and resolves spontaneously.

### Discerning clinicopathological features of congenital neutropenia syndromes: an approach to diagnostically challenging differential diagnoses [^cf9965e8]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

The congenital neutropenia syndromes are rare haematological conditions defined by impaired myeloid precursor differentiation or function. Patients are prone to severe infections with high mortality rates in early life. While some patients benefit from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment, they may still face an increased risk of bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukaemia. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for improved outcomes; however, diagnosis depends on familiarity with a heterogeneous group of rare disorders that remain incompletely characterised. The clinical and pathological overlap between reactive conditions, primary and congenital neutropenias, bone marrow failure, and myelodysplastic syndromes further clouds diagnostic clarity. We review the diagnostically useful clinicopathological and morphological features of reactive causes of neutropenia and the most common primary neutropenia disorders: constitutional/benign ethnic neutropenia, chronic idiopathic neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, severe congenital neutropenia (due to mutations in ELANE, GFI1, HAX1, G6PC3, VPS45, JAGN1, CSF3R, SRP54, CLPB and WAS), GATA2 deficiency, Warts, hypogammaglobulinaemia, infections and myelokathexis syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome, the lysosomal storage disorders with neutropenia: Chediak-Higashi, Hermansky-Pudlak, and Griscelli syndromes, Cohen, and Barth syndromes. We also detail characteristic cytogenetic and molecular factors at diagnosis and in progression to myelodysplastic syndrome/leukaemia.

### An unusual case of reactive lymphocytosis mimicking acute leukemia [^f0606ccd]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute leukemia is based on a combination of clinical, hematological, morphological, cytogenetic, and immunophenotypic data. The authors report a case of reactive lymphocytosis with extremely elevated lymphocytic and lymphoblastic leukocytosis that mimicked acute lymphoblastic leukemia, not only morphologically, but also in immunophenotypic analysis. They could not determine any underlying disease marker other than infectious symptoms that were present for 20 days prior to presentation to their clinic. Although this case presented with extremely high lymphocytic leukocytosis, the patient had normal blood cell lineage, a moderate level of blastic cells in bone marrow, and normal physical findings. These findings convinced the authors to follow up the patient before beginning treatment.

### Fever in immunocompromised hosts [^2ff5c0f8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Fever is one of the most common reasons for the emergency department presentation of immunocompromised patients. Their differential diagnosis can be broad and includes rare or unexpected pathogens. Certain infectious causes of fever portend true emergencies; if they are not managed appropriately, rapid progression and death may ensue. This article reviews the diagnosis and management of fevers in patients immunocompromised by human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS, solid-organ and hematopoietic transplants, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, and tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors. Prompt recognition of the type of immunosuppression and delineation of possible causes of fever are critical for management of these complex patients.

### How I manage inpatient consultations for quantitative neutrophil abnormalities in adults [^aae46601]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Neutrophilia and neutropenia commonly lead to inpatient hematology consultation. Quantitative neutrophil abnormalities have a broad differential and include diagnoses that are important to recognize because they may be associated with increased mortality. Neutrophilia can reflect etiologies such as infection, medications, inflammation, splenectomy, and congenital disorders. Neutropenia can arise from infection, medications, autoimmune destruction, sequestration, nutritional deficiency, malignancy, and congenital neutropenia syndromes. In the evaluation of all abnormalities of neutrophil number, the timing of the change, and the patient's historical neutrophil count are crucial.

### Peripheral-blood cytopenia, an early indicator of inborn errors of immunity [^3ba4fe2a]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

A high index of suspicion is imperative for early identification of patients with IEI. Both infectious and non‐infectious manifestations must be considered. Peripheral‐blood cytopenia that is severe, persistent, unusual and/or recurrent (SPUR) should prompt further investigation for IEI in both children and adults. The cost‐effective and universally available FBC and leucocyte differential could facilitate earlier case identification, serving as an adjunct to more costly definitive investigation. Although inconclusive in some, the molecular diagnosis is a cornerstone of IEI diagnostics, establishing definitive classification.

Recommendations

The FBC with leucocyte differential and peripheral‐blood film is widely available and cheap. It should always form part of first‐line investigation in suspected IEI.
Severe, persistent, unusual and/or recurrent (SPUR) cytopenia in the absence of secondary immunodeficiency should prompt further definitive investigation for IEI in children and adults.
Prospective review of patients presenting with SPUR cytopenia(s) prompting investigation for possible IEI with application of flow cytometry and molecular diagnostics to confirm diagnosis would provide further insight.

### A pediatric patient with ascites, proteinuria, and thrombocytopenia: a rare presentation for a common illness [^e8be4861]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 7-year-old female patient presented to our pediatric emergency department with 5 days of fever, sore throat, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and 2 days of periorbital swelling. Her initial laboratory evaluation revealed a negative monospot test, neutropenia, atypical lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia in addition to transaminitis and proteinuria. An abdominal ultrasound obtained identified hepatosplenomegaly, moderate ascites, acalculous cholecystitis, and a distended appendix with periappendiceal fluid. She was admitted to gastroenterology for further management with antibiotics and surgery and hematology consults. Ultimately, Epstein-Barr virus polymerase chain reaction was positive. This case highlights an atypical presentation of Epstein-Barr virus and the collaborative approach to diagnosis.

### Possible association of 16p11.2 copy number variation with altered lymphocyte and neutrophil counts [^af61c1d4]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated leukocyte differential counts and disease, particularly lymphopenia and neutropenia, in 16p11.2 CNV carriers as some genes mapped to the rearranged region have known roles in leukocyte biology. Lymphopenia is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count < 1.5 × 10⁹/L in adults and < 2.0 × 10⁹/L in children. Neutropenia is defined by a decrease in the number of neutrophilic granulocytes circulating in the blood and may be mild (count between 1.0 and 1.5 × 10⁹/L), moderate (count between 0.5 and 1.0 × 10⁹/L), or severe (count < 0.5 × 10⁹/L). Among white British control individuals from UKB, 0.35% (1163/335789) have a neutrophil count < 1.5 × 10⁹ cells/L of blood and 1% (3221/335789) received a diagnosis of neutropenia, similar to the prevalence of 0.5% previously reported for adult white individuals. Congenital neutropenia, i.e. chronic neutropenia caused by a constitutional genetic defect, is a rare and genetically heterogeneous disease with a prevalence of ~1/100,000 people. Whereas mutations in 24 different genes were shown to be associated following a dominant, recessive, or X-linked inheritance pattern, more genes need to be identified as the genetic origin remains unknown in 30% of congenital neutropenia cases.

We present the cases of two patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) who both developed generalized adenopathy. Although both had recent histories that placed infection high on the differential of causes for the adenopathy, biopsies demonstrated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as the etiology. The risk of malignant transformation in SCN is known to be significantly elevated, and these cases illustrate the need for physicians of such patients to keep myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML high on the differential when patients manifest atypical symptoms.

### How I manage children with neutropenia [^6aa3f21f]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Neutropenia, usually defined as a blood neutrophil count < 1·5 × 10 9 /l, is a common medical problem for children and adults. There are many causes for neutropenia, and at each stage in life the clinical pattern of causes and consequences differs significantly. I recommend utilizing the age of the child and clinical observations for the preliminary diagnosis and primary management. In premature infants, neutropenia is quite common and contributes to the risk of sepsis with necrotizing enterocolitis. At birth and for the first few months of life, neutropenia is often attributable to isoimmune or alloimmune mechanisms and predisposes to the risk of severe bacterial infections. Thereafter when a child is discovered to have neutropenia, often associated with relatively minor symptoms, it is usually attributed to autoimmune disorder or viral infection. The congenital neutropenia syndromes are usually recognized when there are recurrent infections, the neutropenia is severe and there are congenital anomalies suggesting a genetic disorder. This review focuses on the key clinical finding and laboratory tests for diagnosis with commentaries on treatment, particularly the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to treat childhood neutropenia.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^c0a231ec]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

T-Cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) workup and comorbidities — initial evaluation and autoimmune associations: The initial workup for T-LGLL should include comprehensive medical history and physical examination, including careful evaluation of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver, in addition to evaluation of performance status and the presence of autoimmune disorders. Laboratory assessments should include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, serology studies for the detection of antibodies against HIV (type 1 and type 2) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV; type 1 and type 2), as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral DNA or RNA in patients with CD4+ T-LGLL. Autoimmune disorders and immune-mediated cytopenias can occur in patients with T-LGLL; rheumatoid arthritis, often with concomitant Felty syndrome (splenomegaly, neutropenia, and rheumatoid arthritis) is the most common autoimmune disorder associated with T-LGLL, with other less common diseases such as Sjogren syndrome or other autoimmune disorders also described.

### The constitutive activation of STAT3 gene and its mutations are at the crossroad between LGL leukemia and autoimmune disorders [^5857f656]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The disease is diagnosed in asymptomatic individuals in nearly 30% of cases during routine laboratory tests, with lymphocytosis representing the only hematological abnormality. Patients may run asymptomatic for many years; however, in 60% of cases therapy is needed during the course of disease, mostly for cytopenia-related manifestations. Only a minority of patients experience severe hematological diseases, such as fever, anemia and thrombocytopenia. In particular, severe neutropenia and anemia are found in about 20% and 10% of cases, respectively. Symptomatic patients show clinical complications closely linked to low neutrophils count and T-LGLL is frequently associated with a wide spectrum of accompanying diseases, in particular autoimmune disorders, most of them involving connective tissue. In Western patients a strong association has been detected with RA and some patients have been diagnosed as Felty syndrome which is distinguished by splenomegaly, neutropenia and RA. Furthermore, T-LGL clones have been reported in bone marrow failures, such as MDS, AA and PRCA, this latter association being more commonly seen in Asians. These comorbid conditions seemingly share a common immune mediated pathogenesis as well as clinical presentations, sometimes making the differential diagnosis challenging. Other less frequent immune mediated accompanying diseases include Sjogren syndrome and celiac disease.

Under certain circumstances, an exaggerated immunodominant oligo/monoclonal expansion in response to antigenic challenge can be so prominent as to be detectable above the polyclonal background, thus mimicking a true leukemia. As a consequence, the clone's persistence must be documented for 6 months to rule out reactive conditions. These ongoing lymphocyte expansions are referred as T-cell clone of uncertain significance (T-CUS) and represent a potential precursor of T-LGLL. More precisely, T-CUS defines T-cell clones exhibiting immunophenotypic and molecular patterns closely resembling those of T-LGLL. However the affected individuals lack other laboratory or clinical features supporting a diagnosis of T-cell malignancy, particularly cytopenias, bone marrow invasion and related symptoms.

### Somaticmutations in felty syndrome: an implication for a common pathogenesis with large granular lymphocyte leukemia [^46090287]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Felty syndrome (FS) is a disease defined by neutropenia, splenomegaly, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It affects less than 1% of RA patients. A classical FS patient has long-standing RA, unexplained neutropenia (causes such as antirheumatic drugs must be ruled out), and splenomegaly. Splenomegaly is not an absolute criterion for diagnosis. The disease has much in common with T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia, an indolent chronic hematological malignancy in which patients have persistent monoclonal LGL lymphocytosis > 0.5 × 10⁹/l, which in the majority of cases consists of CD8 + T cells. Concomitant autoimmune manifestations such as neutropenia (70–80% of cases), RA (11–36%), and splenomegaly (20–60%) are also observed.

Recent studies have unveiled the molecular pathogenesis of LGL leukemia; somatic STAT3 mutations in lymphocytes leading to constitutive STAT3 activation occur in 30–40% of LGL leukemia patients. – Similar mutations have also been discovered in the STAT5B gene in 2% of cases. STAT3 mutation status is closely linked to RA in LGL leukemia; patients with multiple STAT3 mutations have RA (43%) more frequently than patients without mutations (6%).

Due to the similarity of clinical and laboratory findings, the differential diagnosis of LGL leukemia with RA and FS may sometimes be difficult. Past studies have shown a resemblance in patient phenotypes, responses to treatment, high HLA-DR4 prevalence, and analogous findings in splenectomy samples. Furthermore, both diseases are treated with immunosuppressive agents. Some authors have suggested that these two diseases represent the same entity, but this hypothesis currently lacks molecular evidence. Herein, we utilized deep next-generation sequencing (NGS) of STAT3 and STAT5B genes and cytokine profiling in order to examine if these two diseases are part of the same disease continuum.

### Diagnostic criteria for autoimmune neutropenia [^3f55fb08]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmune neutropenia denotes that the number of circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils is below 1.5×10(9)/L. This encompasses a wide range of disorders from primary conditions to complications of systemic autoimmune diseases or hematological neoplasms. Antineutrophil autoantibodies are particularly difficult to detect, and their amount does not correlate with the degree of neutropenia. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is the first-line therapy, but should be restricted to patients with total absence of neutrophils and/or severe infections.

### T-cell large granular leukemia and related proliferations [^f8f6acae]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Session 9 of the 2005 Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology Workshop focused on large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemias and related disorders. T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemias, discussed herein, account for 2% to 3% of cases of small lymphocytic leukemia. T-LGL diseases cover a heterogeneous spectrum of disorders that include reactive conditions, typically associated with autoimmune disease, to outright leukemia. These disorders are found in older people, with an average age at initial examination of approximately 60 years and a median survival of more than 10 years in T-LGL leukemia. Systemic symptoms and neutropenia are common at initial examination. Lymphocytosis, composed of small mature lymphocytes with increased cytoplasm, is common. The spleen and bone marrow are involved in T-LGL leukemia, although morphologic findings may be subtle. The immunophenotype is typically that of CD3+/CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Some cases may be due to chronic immune stimulation, with subsequent clonal escape and proliferation of a neoplastic population of lymphocytes.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^0a8c9842]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pooled data across early studies validate a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count among patients with severe cases of COVID-19 compared with those with mild cases. Why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that this association could result from direct lymphocyte infection, destruction of lymphatic tissue, inflammation leading to lymphocyte apoptosis, or inhibition of lymphocytes by metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis. Lymphopenia as a marker of severity does not seem to be specific to COVID-19; it has been used to prognosticate other viral pneumonias such as influenza. Neutrophilia may be more specific to severe disease than leukocytosis, but neutrophil count was not uniformly reported across the studies included in our analysis.

Despite our findings regarding clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19, our study had several limitations. First, our literature search found an expected paucity of data surrounding this topic because published characterizations of patients with COVID-19 remain minimal. More COVID-19 data from other nations and patient populations will aid in the comparison and validation of our clinical findings. Second, we noted significant heterogeneity in both the leukocyte and lymphocyte analyses. This phenomenon probably resulted from the small sample size, limited and early data, and skewed representation of the patient population. Third, the definitions of severe cases were somewhat inconsistent across these studies, varying from acute hypoxic respiratory failure to requiring mechanical ventilation. This variability could further compound the heterogeneity found across these studies. Last, only a minority of the manuscripts reported the proportion of patients with lymphopenia, and variable cutoffs based on the articles' reference ranges made it difficult to ascertain a cutoff for severe disease.

With the rising cases of COVID-19 and limited resources, being able to prioritize patients with severe disease is crucial. Some therapeutic agents are being investigated; however, supplies are often low and procurement may be delayed. The sooner patients with severe disease can be identified, the sooner the process of obtaining therapy can be initiated.

### Differential diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in children: a five-year retrospective study at a pediatric referral hospital [^df331cef]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

According to the Visceral Leishmaniasis Control and Surveillance Manual of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, VL, in its illness phase, "is characterized by irregular fever, usually associated with progressive weight loss, cutaneous-mucosal pallor, and increased hepatosplenomegaly". In our study, fever, moderate to severe anemia, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly were important findings associated with VL. In the same manner, the Iranian study by Naeem et al. showed fever, pallor, weakness, loss of appetite, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly among the main clinical and laboratory findings of children with VL, thus confirming a similar evolution of the disease in different parts of the world.

Most patients with VL had splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. These clinical findings are frequent in pediatric patients with VL, given that it is a reticuloendothelial system disease, and they are important for establishing differential diagnosis. In the Brazilian study by Pedrosa and Rocha in 2004, the clinical manifestations most frequently found on admission were hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, fever, and pallor, similarly to the current study. The authors also highlighted a correlation between the liver and spleen size and the disease duration; patients with shorter disease duration (< 30 days) showed smaller viscera size than patients who were ill for a longer time (> 360 days), demonstrating the continuous aggression to the organism when initiation of treatment is delayed.

Following multivariate regression analysis, it was observed that only the variables of sex, spleen size, and leukopenia were statistically significant in differential diagnosis of VL. Studies addressing the differential diagnosis of patients with suspected VL are rare in the literature. A study conducted with this approach in Greece provided evidence that, in children with febrile neutropenia, severe thrombocytopenia would be a predictive factor for VL, which is different from the finding of our study, and that leukopenia would be useful to differentiate bacterial diseases from parasitic ones. This difference between studies may be associated with the fact that we found several patients with a final diagnosis of hematology-oncology diseases, such as acute lymphoid leukemia, which also occur with severe thrombocytopenia but not leukopenia. After external causes, neoplasms are the second leading cause of death for young people between 1 and 19 years of age in Brazil, and they should always be considered for differential diagnosis of children suspected of having VL.

### Case report: a fatal case of latent melioidosis activated by COVID-19 [^ac7546a3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Serial outpatient laboratory results within the 3 years before the patient's presentation showed a stable absolute lymphocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, and CD4+T cell count until his admission, when he had a notable decrease in all three, thereby making him prone to acute decompensation from latent melioidosis activation. The patient's newly compromised innate and cell-mediated immunity, as evidenced by these changes in the blood counts on the date of his admission, was likely a result of COVID-19, as evidenced by his exposure risk and published findings of the association of lymphopenia and neutropenia with COVID-19. He may have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus from contact with customers after stores in South Jersey reopened in June 2020, correlating with the onset of his respiratory and systemic symptoms, characteristic of COVID-19. On the date of his admission, the Atlantic COVID Tracking Project reported 180,265 positive cases in New Jersey, supporting his high risk of exposure during widespread community transmission. Early during the COVID-19 pandemic, reviews of laboratory abnormalities in hospitalized patients showed that lymphopenia was present on admission in 83.2% of 1,099 patients and that neutropenia was present in 27% of 734 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes lymphopenia and neutropenia remains unidentified. Proposed mechanisms for lymphopenia include infiltration and destruction of lymphocytes by SARS-CoV-2 as well as sequestration of lymphocytes at affected target organs. As it likely did in our patient, lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients has been shown to increase susceptibility to severe bacterial infections, ARDS, and overall mortality.

Background

Congenital cytomegalovirus (CCMV) accounts for high rates of infant morbidity and mortality. Neutropenia is a common finding in CCMV infection, of which the age of presentation overlaps with autoimmune neutropenia (AIN). AIN represents one of the most common forms of chronic neutropenia in childhood.

Methods

A literature search exploring biologic associations between CCMV and AIN was conducted: PubMed (MEDLINE), Ovid and Web of Science. We further describe 2 cases of concurrent CCMV and AIN. Both cases were confirmed with the indirect granulocyte immunofluorescence test and alternative etiologies for neutropenia excluded.

Results

Our 2 patients represent confirmed cases of AIN in infants with CCMV. One patient demonstrated neutropenia while undergoing treatment with Valganciclovir, while the other was never treated. With interruption of Valganciclovir in infant A, neutrophil counts (ANC) did not improve and upon resumption of treatment ANC remained static.

Conclusions

Further studies examining a possible biologic link between CCMV and AIN are advocated for. We encourage clinicians to actively consider AIN in the differential diagnosis of all infants with CCMV presenting with neutropenia.

### New monogenic disorders identify more pathways to neutropenia: from the clinic to next-generation sequencing [^8b476faa]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are the most common type of leukocyte in human circulating blood and constitute one of the chief mediators for innate immunity. Defined as a reduction from a normal distribution of values, neutropenia results from a number of congenital and acquired conditions. Neutropenia may be insignificant, temporary, or associated with a chronic condition with or without a vulnerability to life-threatening infections. As an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, neutropenia may be associated with transformation to myeloid malignancy. Recognition of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome may be delayed into adulthood. The list of monogenic neutropenia disorders is growing, heterogeneous, and bewildering. Furthermore, greater knowledge of immune-mediated and drug-related causes makes the diagnosis and management of neutropenia challenging. Recognition of syndromic presentations and especially the introduction of next-generation sequencing are improving the accuracy and expediency of diagnosis as well as their clinical management. Furthermore, identification of monogenic neutropenia disorders is shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of granulopoiesis and myeloid malignancies.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^a1513a47]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) — overview and definition characterizes LGLL as an indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of mature cytotoxic lymphocytes with an indolent and non-progressive clinical course and frequent autoimmune neutropenia. There is significant clinical and pathophysiologic overlap with autoimmune syndromes, including concurrent rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and persistent large granular lymphocytosis can also accompany other chronic autoimmune conditions. Diagnosis is generally based on a persistent (> 6 months) increase in the number of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) with typical morphologic features, assessed in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of the patients (> 2000/uL) with exclusion of other conditions; the degree of blood and bone marrow involvement does not necessarily correlate with disease severity or the grade of cytopenias. T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality studies may demonstrate an oligoclonal or monoclonal pattern that does not correlate with disease aggressiveness, and T-cell LGLLs frequently express CD2, CD3, CD8, CD57, and TCRαβ with cytotoxic markers TIA1, granzyme B, and granzyme M; in rare cases, LGLLs are CD4+ alpha-beta T cells or gamma-delta T cells (CD8+ or CD4-/CD8-). Characteristic genetic features include activating somatic STAT3 mutations affecting the SH2 domain in approximately 30% of LGLL cases with most mutations heterozygous, and STAT5B SH2 mutations have also been reported. Main differential diagnoses include HSTCL, aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL), EBV-positive T-cell and NK-cell lymphoproliferative diseases of childhood, and reactive gamma-delta T-cell proliferations.

Summary

Mild neutropenia is a common finding in SLE that requires no specific therapy. Whether or not this leads to immune suppression is not known. However, a small percentage of patients with SLE develop severe, even life-threatening, neutropenia, which may be caused by a variety of mechanisms, both T cell and B cell mediated. The patient with severe neutropenia with opportunistic infection or the risk of such infection can be successfully treated with G-CSF.

### Peripheral-blood cytopenia, an early indicator of inborn errors of immunity [^4045cd91]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this retrospective review of the early haematological findings of IEI in a developing‐world setting, cytopenia at presentation was found in 62% of cases. Association between presentation with peripheral‐blood cytopenia and a molecular diagnosis of an IEI (OR 2.26 CI 1.42–3.59) and shorter overall survival (OR 2.81, CI 1.288–4.158) was shown.

Cohort characteristics

Almost half were diagnosed within the first five years of life. Presentation with cytopenia was associated with a shorter delay in diagnosis. First‐world settings report earlier presentation within the first year of life whilst later presentation is seen in the developing‐world setting and reflected this cohort more closely. Patients with IUIS I presented earlier and had a shorter delay in diagnosis; all were cytopenic at presentation namely anaemia, leucopenia and lymphopenia, of which 27% were pancytopenic (Figures 2B, 4D and Table S4). Due to the more severe phenotype of IUIS I, classical presentation is typically within the first year of life with severe and/or recurrent bacterial infections as well as cytopenia (commonly lymphopenia, neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia). In European registries, B‐cell disorders are the most common type of immunodeficiency, accounting for approximately 50%–60% of all IEI with most presenting in adulthood, in part due to a less severe phenotype. Reflecting this, the majority (53%) were classified with a predominant antibody deficiency (IUIS III) where presentation with neutropenia showed significant association (Figures 2, 4). Interestingly, IUIS I and II are more common in populations with higher consanguinity. As presentation with cytopenia was associated IUIS I and II diagnoses, the predictive value in cohorts with higher consanguinity may be of greater value.

### Understanding the treatment options for neutropenia… [^98be29ff]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are essential for fighting infection. Neutropenia, or low levels of neutrophils, is a common disorder usually caused by chemotherapy, adverse drug reactions or autoimmune disorders. Severe neutropenia, or agranulocytosis, is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 500 per μL. Munshi and Montgomery used information obtained through a MEDLINE search for their review. Management and evaluation of neutropenia should depend on the severity of the neutropenia and on the presence of symptoms suggesting infection. Patients with severe neutropenia with fever or signs of infection and those with evidence of malignant disease should be hospitalized. The cause of neutropenia should be determined, potential sources of infection evaluated and antibiotic therapy started. The diagnostic evaluation includes history of prior infection, a review of prior blood counts and exploration for evidence of infection or rheumatologic conditions.

The types of neutropenia are listed in the accompanying table. Neutropenia is more likely to be acquired than congenital, with the most common cause being a drug reaction that causes direct marrow suppression or immune destruction of the neutrophil or myeloid precursors. Viral infection is another common cause of neutropenia, related to bone marrow suppression or peripheral destruction. Acute bacterial infections, notably salmonellosis, brucellosis, pertussis, tuberculosis and rickettsial infections, can cause neutropenia. Collagen vascular disease can feature neutropenia. Benign hematopoietic disease, including vitamin B 12 and folate deficiencies, can cause neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Malignant hematopoietic diseases such as leukemia and multiple myeloma may cause neutropenia by suppressing normal myelopoiesis. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication.

Treatment of neutropenia may be appropriate if the condition does not resolve spontaneously or after an intervention such as discontinuation of an offending drug. In neutropenia resulting from chemotherapy or radiation, cytokines such as granulocyte colony–stimulating factor can increase the neutrophil count although their use has not been shown to substantially decrease infection mortality. Therapy should be initiated in patients who are at increased risk of infection. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be effective in patients with bone marrow disease.

### Auto-immune lymphoproliferative disorder and other secondary immune thrombocytopenias in childhood [^37dbec19]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in childhood, typically presents as an acute self-limiting illness. However, secondary ITP is often a chronic disorder due to an underlying disease. Combined cytopenias in childhood, that is, secondary ITP occurring with auto-immune hemolytic anemia and/or auto-immune neutropenia, are often associated with disorders characterized by immune dysregulation. Such disorders include systemic lupus erythematosus, auto-immune lymphoproliferative syndrome, and common variable immune deficiency. Evans syndrome describes the combination of ITP, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and/or autoimmune neutropenia. However, it is now clear that some patients with Evans syndrome have an underlying immunodeficiency. This report focuses on combined auto-immune cytopenias and highlights the challenges in their diagnosis and management.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes [^bf1babca]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a group of underrecognized hematologic clonal malignancies with variable propensity for leukemic transformation that can present a diagnostic challenge because they lack hallmark symptoms. MDS can present with varying degrees of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and at presentation can range from indolent to life threatening. The clinician should have a heightened level of suspicion when treating elderly patients and those with prior exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, and environmental toxins in the presence of unexplained cytopenias. Chronic anemia should not be considered a natural consequence of aging. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with unexplained anemia may have findings compatible with MDS, suggesting that MDS should be considered higher in the differential diagnosis. Primary care physicians are encouraged to conduct comprehensive evaluations to exclude non-MDS-related causes for persistent cytopenias. Patients with pancytopenia, bicytopenia, or any persistent and unexplained isolated cytopenia (and particularly unexplained macrocytic anemia) should be referred to a specialist to establish a diagnosis.

### Inherited bone marrow failure in the pediatric patient [^f7b41f52]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

General principles of diagnosis and management

A diagnosis of an inherited BMF should be considered in a pediatric patient when ≥ 1 BMF-associated extrahematopoietic features are identified clinically or by investigations. It should also be considered during differential diagnosis in children presenting with isolated AA, MDS, or leukemia. The specific extrahematopoietic abnormalities help diagnose a recognized syndrome, but this diagnosis is not always possible based on clinical features alone.

Chromosomal breakage analysis of blood lymphocytes after exposure to DEB or MMC remains a useful diagnostic test for FA. However, it may give unclear results if there is somatic mosaicism, and biallelic variants in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene can also cause increased chromosomal breakage with MMC or DEB. All children presenting with AA and MDS ideally should be tested for FA. Furthermore, children who present with leukemia and suggestive congenital abnormalities or who have monosomy 7, an additional chromosome 3, or complex karyotypes should be tested for FA. Genetic testing for FA genes is possible but not always straightforward. Telomere length, particularly using flow fluorescence in situ hybridization, can be a useful initial screening test in the diagnosis of DC or DC-like disease. Patients with DC frequently, but not always, have chromosomes with very short telomeres. Genetic testing for DC genes can help substantiate the diagnosis. However, as in FA, this strategy is not straightforward, as many patients have certain variants that can be difficult to categorize, and the genetic basis will remain unknown even though approximately one-third of patients have been tested for currently known DC genes. In patients with global BMF, the other genes to consider are SDS genes and new entities, such as those, mentioned herein, including variants in TPO, ERCC6L2, MYSM1, MECOM, and SAMD9/SAMD9L. For patients presenting with isolated neutropenia, analysis of ELANE and HAX1 may help substantiate the underlying diagnosis. For those with isolated anemia, an initial focus on DBA and CDA genes is warranted.

### An infant with chronic severe neutropenia [^4dd9e6bf]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Neutropenia in infancy and childhood poses a diagnostic challenge as the aetiology ranges from acute life-threatening conditions to chronic benign diseases. Chronic benign neutropenia of infancy is a rare disorder occurring in 1:100,000. The neutrophil count continues to be low for a prolonged period until spontaneous resolution by the age of 3–4 years. Such infants are having higher incidences of minor infections requiring treatment with antibiotics and rare incidences of meningitis and sepsis. The authors describe an infant presenting with fever and cervical lymphadenitis, who was found to have isolated severe neutropenia and its persistence posing a diagnostic challenge. The prolonged course with minor infections and absence of serious underlying conditions finally confirmed chronic benign neutropenia of infancy.

### Late-onset and long-lasting neutropenias in the young: a new entity anticipating immune-dysregulation disorders [^bec2d077]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study identifies a new chronic form of immune neutropenia in the young with or without detectable indirect anti-neutrophil antibodies, characterized by mild/moderate neutropenia low risk of severe infection (14%), tendency to develop autoimmune phenomena over the course of the disease (cumulative incidence of 58.6% after 20years of disease duration), leukopenia, progressive reduction of absolute lymphocyte count and a T- and B-cell profile similar to autoimmune disorders like Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (increased HLADR+ and CD3+TCRγδ cells, reduced T regulatory cells, increased double-negative B and a tendency to reduced B memory cells). In a minority of patients, P/LP variants related to primary immuno-regulatory disorders were found. This new form may fit the group of "Likely acquired neutropenia", a provisional category included in the recent International Guidelines on Diagnosis and Management of Neutropenia of EHA and EUNET INNOCHRON ACTION 18233. The early recognition of this form of neutropenia would help clinicians to delineate better specific monitoring plans, genetic counseling, and potentially targeted therapies.

Clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation in febrile neutropenia with skin and soft tissue lesions — key diagnostic steps are specified. Signs and symptoms are often diminished or absent in neutropenia, and skin lesions, no matter how small or innocuous in appearance, should be carefully evaluated. Early involvement of an infectious diseases specialist, a surgeon, and a dermatologist may result in improved outcome. Initial clinical impressions should be supplemented with a systemic approach to enhance diagnosis and management. Blood cultures are critical, and at least 2 sets should be obtained. Radiographic imaging should be performed as clinically indicated and can help define extent of disease; chest/sinus imaging may identify silent pulmonary or sinus infection with dissemination. The most specific method is biopsy or aspiration of lesions for histological, cytological, and microbiological evaluation.

### Independent associations of lymphopenia and neutropenia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a longitudinal, multinational study [^99899df0]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leucopenia is commonly observed in patients with SLE, with a reported prevalence of leucopenia between 22 and 42%. The presence of leucopenia is incorporated in many versions of SLE classification criteria, but sub-setting of leucopenia in these is mostly in relation to lymphopenia. Less is known about neutropenia in SLE.

The pathogenesis of leucopenia in SLE is not well understood; however, different mechanisms have been proposed. Peripheral destruction from lymphotoxic or anti-neutrophil antibody effects, complement-mediated cell lysis and excessive neutrophil apoptosis, as well as marrow suppression, have been postulated. The attribution of leucopenia to SLE disease activity is relatively easy to recognize before treatment but can become challenging when patients have been treated with immunosuppressive therapy with potential myelosuppressive effects. There remain knowledge gaps regarding the prevalence and clinical associations of leucopenia in SLE. In this study, we sought to examine the associations of disease characteristics and medication use with lymphopenia and neutropenia in a multi-ethnic international longitudinal lupus cohort.

### Peripheral-blood cytopenia, an early indicator of inborn errors of immunity [^f92a5992]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Neutropenia is common in IEI, an absolute neutrophil count less than 1.5 × 10 9 /l in patients over one year old or chronic neutropenia (lasting > 3 months) a likely caveat. The haematologists' early involvement is important as the peripheral‐blood and bone‐marrow findings along with careful clinical examination can guide the often lengthy differential (Table 1). Non‐immune causes such as severe infection common across all IEI groups, particularly in deficiencies of phagocyte number or function or bone‐marrow infiltration, should also be considered (Figure 1C). The direct involvement of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) in neutrophil development is unclear, but is thought to contribute to neutrophil differentiation resulting in neutropenia, likely explaining why neutropenia was predictive of hypogammaglobulinaemia in this cohort. No clear association was seen with defects of phagocyte number or function to further divulge the association, likely attributable to the low numbe of cases in the cohort. One case however, with a confirmed ELANE mutation, did present with classical cyclic neutropenia.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is common in IEI and may be associated with other immune cytopenias such as Evans syndrome (ES) (Figure 1B, Table 1). In a child, ES should prompt investigation for a possible monogenic defect. In this cohort thrombocytopenia was predictive of combined immunodeficiency (CID) with associated syndromic features (IUIS IIa) which includes WAS/XLT, the classical thrombocytopenic IEI with abnormally small platelets.

Inborn errors of immunity carry an increased risk for developing malignancy. Haematological malignancy was seen in three cases, all with B‐cell lymphoma. The development of malignant neoplasm is complex and related to the inherent impaired immunity, tumour immune surveillance as well as viral infections such as EBV. The type of malignancy is closely associated to the underlying type of IEI, for example non‐Hodgkin lymphoma frequent in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and acute myeloid leukaemia in WHIM syndrome. Chronic infections, such as EBV, establish a persistent inflammatory stage creating tissue damage with subsequent malignant transformation. Immunologists need to diagnose the malignancy and haematologists/oncologists the underlying immunodeficiency early to optimise management and outcome.

### How to approach neutropenia [^de67e2d9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is defined as the reduction in the absolute number of neutrophils in the blood circulation. Acute neutropenia is a relatively frequent finding, whereas disorders of production of neutrophils are quite rare. Acute neutropenia is often well tolerated and normalizes rapidly. Neutropenia arising as a result of underlying hematologic disorders is far more significant. Such a patient may be at risk for infectious complications and will likely require a thorough investigation. Acute neutropenia evolves over a few days and occurs when neutrophil use is rapid and production is impaired. Chronic neutropenia may last for 3 months or longer and is a result of reduced production, increased destruction, or excessive splenic sequestration of neutrophils. Neutropenia may be classified by whether it arises secondarily to causes extrinsic to BM myeloid cells, which is common; as an acquired disorder of myeloid progenitor cells, which is less frequent; or as an intrinsic defect arising from impaired proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells in the BM, which is rare. Severe neutropenia with absolute neutrophil counts below 500/μL increases susceptibility to bacterial or fungal infections. Multiple disorders of severe congenital neutropenia have been found by the discovery of genetic defects affecting differentiation, adhesion, and apoptosis of neutrophil precursors. Elucidation of the multiple genetic defects have provided insight into the biology of the cell involving membrane structures, secretory vesicles, mitochondrial metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, transcriptional regulation, and cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as the risk for myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia.

### Peripheral-blood cytopenia, an early indicator of inborn errors of immunity [^ace0cf8a]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inborn errors of immunity are increasingly more common than previously thought and require early identification for life‐changing and/or lifesaving intervention. Understanding the non‐infectious manifestations of IEI is important, to improve awareness of the wide diagnostic spectrum and facilitate precision drug targets. Definitive diagnostic investigations serve little purpose if the disease is not entertained at the outset. Identifying abnormalities of laboratory parameters that already form part of routine diagnostics, are readily available and that may facilitate earlier case identification, are paramount. The widely available full blood count (FBC) and leucocyte differential (DIFF), forming part of first‐line investigation for suspected IEI, may facilitate earlier identification. This retrospective review of the South African Primary Immunodeficiency Registry (SAPIDR) aimed to assess the haematological indices at presentation; their association with IUIS 2019 classification for IEI; and mortality.

### Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis presenting with severe autoimmune neutropenia [^d07eb5cb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive, chronic liver disease characterized by unresolving hepatocellular inflammation of autoimmune origin. The clinical spectrum may vary from asymptomatic presentation, to non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, arthralgias, nausea and abdominal pain, to acute severe liver disease. AIH is characterized by the presence of interface hepatitis and portal plasma cell infiltration on histological examination, hypergammaglobulinemia, and positive autoantibodies. AIH is associated with other autoimmune diseases and its course is often accompanied by various non-specific hematological disorders. However, the coexistence of autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) is infrequent. We present a case of a female patient diagnosed with type 1 AIH and agranulocytosis on presentation. A diagnosis of AIN was established, based on the patient's sex, the underlying liver disease, the absence of alternative causes, the presence of atypical anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in patient's serum and the favorable and dose-dependent treatment of both pathologic entities with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil.

Therefore, prompt recognition of patients with neutropenic fever is imperative. Serious bacterial illness is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for neutropenic patients. Neutropenic fever should trigger the initiation of a rapid work-up and the administration of empiric systemic antibiotic therapy to attenuate or avoid the progression along the spectrum of sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock syndrome, and death.

### Lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy: benign or malignant? [^816e2466]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The increasing use of immunophenotypic and molecular analysis in the routine evaluation of patients with lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, or other hematologic disorders has led to the identification of unexpected small clonal lymphoid populations. These clones, sometimes with disease-specific markers, such as the t(14;18), are especially challenging for the clinician because of their unknown biologic potential and uncertain clinical behavior. Study of these early lymphoid lesions is providing important clues to the process of lymphomagenesis, and may provide the rationale for preemptive therapy in the future. More and more, the hematologist/oncologist is consulted regarding otherwise healthy individuals with lymphadenopathy and/or lymphocytosis, and pathology reports that confound the referring internist or surgeon. The report does not name a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder, but is not completely "normal". Does the patient have a benign or malignant condition? How should they be evaluated? Is treatment indicated? These patients prove challenging for the consulting hematologist as well as the referring physician. In this review, we will focus on some of these scenarios and attempt to provide guidance for their management.

### Isolated neutropenia as a rare but serious adverse event secondary to immune checkpoint inhibition [^3c839d0a]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

With rapid advances in the field of immuno-oncology and frequent use of newer ICI for multiple indications, we speculate that the potential for encountering unique irAEs secondary to ICI will rise. Our case adds to the growing body of evidence alluding to the unique immune adverse effect profiles of ICI. Evidence from our review establishes that ICI related neutropenia, although rare, tends to be severe, with a majority being grade-4. These immune-mediated neutropenias can lead to significant morbidity and mortality arising from infectious complications. Permanent ICI discontinuation needs to be strongly considered in almost all patients. Hence ICI related neutropenia as an irAE requires early identification with prompt interventions using immune suppression and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors to perhaps mitigate duration and thus prevent potentially fatal outcomes.

Workup should include history with special attention to nutritional status and exposures to lymphocyte depleting therapy, physical examination with special attention to spleen size, complete blood count with differential, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, chest X‑ray to evaluate for thymoma, and assessment for infections including bacterial, fungal, and viral causes (specifically CMV or HIV). Management states that no specific action is required for lymphopenia G1–G3 and ICPI therapy should be continued; for G4, continue ICPI therapy and initiate Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis and Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with CMV screening, perform HIV or hepatitis screening if not already done, and consider EBV testing if there is evidence of lymphadenopathy or hepatitis, fevers, and hemolysis concerning for lymphoproliferative disease.

### Common variable immune deficiency: case studies [^969f7f5e]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) is one of the most common congenital immune defects encountered in clinical practice. The condition occurs equally in males and females, and most commonly in the 20- to 40-year-old age group. The diagnosis is made by documenting reduced serum concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and usually IgM, together with loss of protective antibodies. The genetics of this syndrome are complex and are still being unraveled, but the hallmarks for most patients, as with other immune defects, include acute and chronic infections of the sinopulmonary tract. However, other noninfectious autoimmune or inflammatory conditions may also occur in CVID, and indeed these may be the first and only sign that a significant immune defect is present. These manifestations include episodes of immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or neutropenia, in addition to splenomegaly, generalized or worrisome lymphadenopathy, and malignancy, especially lymphoma. These issues commonly bring the patient to the attention of hematologists for both evaluation and treatment. This article discusses 3 cases in which patients with CVID had some of these presenting issues and what hematology input was required.

### Neonatal neutropenia… [^89d88f3b]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count that falls below 2. 0×109/L, is being identified more frequently in the newborn intensive care unit and significantly influences clinical decisions regarding therapy. We prospectively identified 119 episodes of neutropenia in 87 infants. Less than half of the episodes could be attributed to infections. The majority of noninfectious neutropenia episodes were related to specific perinatal events or were of unknown cause. Infants weighing less than 2500 g were more likely to have neutropenia than term infants and less likely to have neutropenia related to bacterial infections. Short-term survival and long-term survival were not different in infants with infectious diseases compared with those with noninfectious diseases. Mortality was highly correlated with the need for assisted ventilation or with an absolute neutrophil count of 0.5 × 10⁹/L.

We conclude that the cause of neutropenia and the clinical condition must be carefully evaluated before instituting aggressive therapy for infection. Baley JE, Stork EK, Warkentin PI, Shurin SB.

### Late-onset and long-lasting autoimmune neutropenia: an analysis from the Italian neutropenia registry [^c684050a]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary autoimmune neutropenia (pAN) is typified by onset in early infancy and a mild/moderate phenotype that resolves within 3 years of diagnosis. In contrast, secondary AN is classically an adult disease associated with malignancy, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, viral infection, or drugs. This study describes a cohort of 79 children from the Italian Registry who, although resembling pAN, did not fully match the criteria for pAN because neutropenia either appeared after age 5 years (LO-Np) or lasted longer than 3 years (LL-Np). These 2 categories compared with classical pAN showed a far inferior rate of resolution (P < .001), lower severity of neutropenia (P = 0.03), leukopenia (P < .001), lymphopenia (P < .001) with low B+ (P = 0.001), increased need of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (P = 0.04), and increased frequency of autoimmunity over the disease course (P < .001). A paired comparison between LO-Np and LL-Np suggested that LO-Np had a lower rate of resolution (P < .001) and lower white blood cell (P < .001) and lymphocyte (P < .001) values, higher occurrence of apthae (P = 0.008), and a stronger association with autoimmune diseases/markers (P = 0.001) than LL-Np, thus suggesting a more pronounced autoimmune signature for LO-Np. A next-generation sequencing panel applied in a small subgroup of LO-Np and LL-Np patients identified variants related to immune dysregulations. Overall, these findings indicate that there are important differences among pAN LL-Np and LO-Np. Forms rising after 3 years of age, with low tendency to resolution, require tight monitoring and extensive immune investigations aimed to early identify underlying immunologic disease.

### Peripheral-blood cytopenia, an early indicator of inborn errors of immunity [^06a94f81]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

parameters

In those with cytopenia at presentation (n = 161), 17% (n = 27/161) were pancytopenic, 40% (n = 64/161) anaemic, 8% (n = 13/161) thrombocytopenic, 19% (n = 30/161) neutropenic and 62% (n = 100/161) lymphopenic (Figure 2B). Lowest median haemoglobin was seen in IUIS V and IUIS I, median platelet count was lowest in IUIS II, median lymphocyte count lowest in IUIS I and median neutrophil count lowest in IUIS III (Figure 3, Table S3). IUIS I diagnosis was significantly associated with cytopenia at presentation (OR 12.43, CI 3.82–39.05) namely; severe cytopenia (OR 3.96, CI 1.08–14.88), persistent cytopenia (OR 12.27, CI 3.75–39.95), and unusual cytopenia (OR 8.89, CI 3.04–25.86), namely; anaemia (OR 4.15, CI 1.58–10.90), leucopenia (OR 15.69, CI 1.86–132.29] and lymphopenia (OR 12.16, CI 2.75–53.73), where 52% (11/21) were anaemic, 38% (8/21) leucopenic and 90% lymphopenic (19/21). Cytopenia was associated with IUIS II (OR 5.99, CI 2.80–12.76) seen in 94% (31/33) namely; severe, persistent and/or unusual cytopenia (OR 3.58, CI 1.08–11.97), 3 (1.44–6.24) and 2.71 (1.32–5.60) respectively], 21% (7/33) were thrombocytopenic at presentation with significant association (OR 14.39, CI 2.89–71.57). Neutropenia was seen in 14% with IUIS III showing significant association (OR 3.65, CI 1.44–9.25) [Figure 4, Table S4]. Pancytopenia at presentation was most significantly associated with IUIS I (OR 4.21, CI 1.48–11.99) and a molecular diagnosis (OR 2.81, CI 1.23–6.42). Anaemia was the most prominent cytopenia in IUIS VIb. Class VII did not show marked cytopenia, although lymphocyte count was lower in IUIS VIIa than VIIb (Table S3). The neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), with an optimal cut‐off of 1.8, was associated with IUIS I (OR 2.72 CI 1.01–7.28) and molecular diagnosis, cut‐off of 2.1 (OR 2.16, CI 1.19–3.92) with low positive predictive value but high negative predictive value (Table S5).

### Recalcitrant warts and lymphopenia in a young male [^dc8743dc]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the leading cause of death in patients affected with this disease?
A. Hematological malignancy
B. Severe bacterial and/or viral complications
C. Solid organ malignancy
D. Vascular thrombosis
E. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis

Answers:
A. Hematological malignancy – Correct. By age 40, more than 80% of the patients present with a hematologic malignancy. Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia are the leading causes of death in patients with GATA2 deficiency.
B. Severe bacterial and/or viral complications – Incorrect. Severe viral and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections are the most common presenting symptoms, affecting 60% of the patients at presentation. The complications from these infections are the second most common cause of death in the affected patients.
C. Solid organ malignancy – Incorrect. Solid organ malignancies, especially HPV-related, affects 20%-35% of the patients with GATA2 deficiency. Their high frequency is hypothesized to be due to delayed viral clearance and impaired immunosurveillance mechanisms. However, they result in lower mortality rates than the hematological malignancies and infectious complications.
D. Vascular thrombosis – Incorrect. GATA2 is highly expressed in endothelial cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets. Although thromboembolic phenomena are reported in up to 25% of the patients, they are not the leading cause of death.
E. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis – Incorrect. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis affects 18% of the patients. Their increased incidence is possibly due to an impaired GATA2-mediated surfactant metabolism and excretion by lung macrophages. However, it is not the leading cause of death in patients with GATA2 deficiency.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^ebf89379]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections in cancer patients with neutropenia — assessment recommendations emphasize episode classification, tissue diagnosis, risk stratification, and extent-of-infection workup. Determine whether the current presentation of fever and neutropenia is the patient's initial episode, persistent unexplained fever after 4–7 days, or a subsequent recurrent episode (strong, low). Aggressively determine the etiology by aspiration and/or biopsy of lesions and submit material for thorough cytological/histological assessments. Risk-stratify patients: high-risk are those with anticipated prolonged (> 7 days) and profound neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 100 cells/μL) or a Multinational Association for Supportive Care (MASCC) score of < 21; low-risk are those with anticipated brief (< 7 days) neutropenia and few comorbidities (strong, low) or a MASCC score of ≥ 21 (strong, moderate). Determine the extent of infection via thorough physical examination, blood cultures, chest radiograph, and additional imaging (including chest CT) as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms (strong, low).

### Combined autoimmune cytopenias presenting in childhood [^41e7563f]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pediatric patients with chronic and/or refractory autoimmune multi-lineage cytopenias present challenges in both diagnosis and management. Increasing availability of diagnostic testing has revealed an underlying immune dysfunction in patients previously diagnosed with Evans Syndrome. However, the data are sparse and the majority of patients are adults.

Procedure

We performed a retrospective chart review to document the natural history of 23 pediatric patients with autoimmune multi-lineage cytopenias followed at three tertiary care pediatric hematology clinics.

Results

Investigations revealed seven patients (30.4%) with an autoimmune lymphoproliferative-like syndrome and six patients (26.1%) with other primary immunodeficiencies. Only one (4.3%) patient was suspected to have systemic lupus erythematosus and six patients (26.1%) had other types of autoimmunity. Treatment consisted of immunosuppressive therapy, intravenous gammaglobulin, and splenectomy. Supportive care included granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and blood product transfusions. Two patients (8.7%) died. Complete remission was achieved in 3 patients (13.0%); of the remaining, 14 patients (60.9%) had chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura, 10 patients (43.5%) chronic autoimmune neutropenia, and 4 patients (17.4%) chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia with a median follow up of 5 years (2 months-12 years).

Conclusions

These data suggest that pediatric patients presenting with autoimmune multi-lineage cytopenias should undergo investigation for underlying immune dysregulation, including autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, other primary immunodeficiencies and autoimmune disorders. The development of an international registry for such patients is imperative to improve the understanding of their complex natural history.

### How I treat autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome [^f336a2a7]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) represents a failure of apoptotic mechanisms to maintain lymphocyte homeostasis, permitting accumulation of lymphoid mass and persistence of autoreactive cells that often manifest in childhood with chronic nonmalignant lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and recurring multilineage cytopenias. Cytopenias in these patients can be the result of splenic sequestration as well as autoimmune complications manifesting as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune neutropenia. More than 300 families with hereditary ALPS have now been described; nearly 500 patients from these families have been studied and followed worldwide over the last 20 years by our colleagues and ourselves. Some of these patients with FAS mutations affecting the intracellular portion of the FAS protein also have an increased risk of B-cell lymphoma. The best approaches to diagnosis, follow-up, and management of ALPS, its associated cytopenias, and other complications resulting from infiltrative lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity are presented.

### Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis presenting with severe autoimmune neutropenia [^dcd36593]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic relapsing liver disease characterized by hepatocellular inflammation caused by a combination of genetic failure of immune tolerance and environmental triggers. AIH is associated with the presence of interface hepatitis and portal plasma cell infiltration on histological examination, hypergammaglobulinemia and positive autoantibodies. A strong association of AIH with other autoimmune diseases has been reported. Concomitant hematological disorders, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia and moderate leucopenia, are well documented. Nevertheless, the coexistence of severe neutropenia is very rare. We present a patient with severe isolated agranulocytosis at the time of AIH diagnosis, with antineutrophil autoantibodies detected in the blood.

### The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with autoimmune neutropenia: a retrospective case series study [^c2eae308]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in children with autoimmune neutropenia may be a cause for concern. In this retrospective study, none of the 24 autoimmune neutropenia cases manifested severe coronavirus disease 2019. We found a significant improvement in neutrophils and a reduction in lymphocytes at post-infection follow-up compared with the median of previous values. We speculate that this paradoxical effect may be due to postinfection immunological phenomena.

### Pregabalin-induced urticarial rash and neutropenia in a renal transplant recipient: a case report [^37522ffb]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Renal transplant patients are at risk of neurological complications, occurring in around 6–21% of patients, with infections being the most common cause. Among the different neurological conditions, neuropathic pain has a prevalence of 1–2%.

The differential diagnosis of our patient when he first presented was wide, and included haematological malignancies, infectious diseases including Lyme disease, Epstein Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, syphilis, autoimmune disorders and a drug reaction secondary to azathioprine. Sepsis was an important initial differential diagnosis due to the patient's immunosuppression, however a lack of fever, normal physiological observations, a mildly raised C-reactive protein and negative cultures reduced the probability of this diagnosis.

Azathioprine has been known to cause arthralgia, bone marrow suppression, leukopenia, myalgia and rash. It is important to note that the azathioprine dose remained unchanged for years, hence azathioprine toxicity was not included in the differential diagnosis.

As all other causes of the patient's signs and symptoms were excluded, and both the neutropenia and the rash completely resolved after cessation of the pregabalin, this was deemed the causative factor of the clinical presentation. The blood film showed reactive lymphocytes, which can be due to a wide range of causes such as viral illnesses, endocrine pathologies such as Addison's disease, and drug reactions. The blood film also showed a left shift of neutrophils, which indicates immature neutrophils. Although the marrow picture in drug-induced neutropenia is variable, typically immature neutrophils are relatively abundant compared to mature marrow neutrophils, which is partly explained by an expansion of the immature myeloid compartment due to the higher demand for more circulating neutrophils. The above findings in conjunction with negative microbiology helped to support the diagnosis of pregabalin-induced drug reaction. The patient has since remained off pregabalin, and his follow up blood tests show all blood cells within the normal range. Due to his severe idiosyncratic reaction, we have been reluctant to begin any new medications, and currently his neuropathic symptoms are managed conservatively.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^80faa20b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly globally; as of March 29, 2020, ≈670,000 cases had been confirmed worldwide. COVID-19 is typically a pulmonary infection that can range from mild illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure; however, other symptoms such as myalgias and anorexia have been noted. Although many ongoing studies are investigating measurement of proinflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers as a way to prognosticate infection severity, we investigated use of 2 easily obtained predictors: lymphopenia and leukocytosis.
