## Question

What is the optimal medication and overall treatment for a gum infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the optimal medication and overall treatment for a gum infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying what "gum infection" means clinically, differentiating gingivitis, periodontitis, and acute periodontal abscess. Then, I should confirm the universal first-line management and when to add pharmacologic adjuncts. Next, I will stratify therapy by severity, host risk, and special populations, while carefully checking evidence quality. Finally, I will lay out a maintenance plan and synthesize a pragmatic regimen while verifying antibiotic stewardship and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I do not jump to conclusions about therapy before I know what I am treating. "Gum infection" spans reversible gingivitis, destructive periodontitis with loss of attachment and bone, and acute abscess requiring urgent drainage, all driven by a dysbiotic biofilm–host inflammatory interplay that waxes and wanes until the biofilm is mechanically disrupted [^114A7M8g]. Hold on, I should verify the pathogenetic anchor: biofilm-based disease implies that mechanical biofilm control is foundational and pharmacologic agents are adjunctive, not standalone, which aligns with biofilm principles in chronic infections [^116uz7L3].

> Next, I should review the non-negotiable foundation of care, because if I miss this step any downstream recommendations will be off. Mechanical debridement with scaling and root planing (SRP) is first-line, with patient-performed daily plaque control and professional debridement as required; antimicrobials are considered only as adjuncts if initial non-surgical therapy is insufficient or in higher-risk scenarios, and no antimicrobial has emerged as a universal gold standard in periodontitis treatment [^116oxj6x] [^112rudWy]. Let me double-check maintenance principles: supportive periodontal therapy with periodic re-evaluation and site-specific retreatment is standard after active therapy to reduce recurrence and maintain periodontal health [^112XHdCa].

> I will now stratify by severity, starting with mild gingivitis, but I need to ensure I do not over-medicalize a reversible condition. For plaque-induced gingivitis, intensive home care plus professional prophylaxis suffices, and if inflammation is pronounced or patient dexterity is limited, a short, time-limited course of chlorhexidine mouthrinse can be used, acknowledging common adverse effects such as staining and taste disturbance, so I should limit duration and counsel accordingly [^113xa6xk].

> For moderate periodontitis, I should confirm that SRP is the core intervention and then consider adjuncts judiciously. SRP can be delivered by quadrant over several visits or via full-mouth instrumentation within 24 hours; evidence shows similar clinical effects across strategies, so logistics and patient preference can guide the choice while I monitor probing depths and bleeding on probing to gauge response [^113KGfHV]. Wait, let me verify adjuncts: local antiseptics, brief chlorhexidine irrigation or gels, and possibly probiotics such as Lactobacillus reuteri may reduce inflammation and pathogenic load, though I must note the heterogeneity and limited certainty of probiotic data and avoid portraying them as definitive therapy [^113xa6xk] [^112rudWy].

> For severe or generalized Stage III/IV periodontitis, I need to think carefully about when systemic antibiotics add net benefit because stewardship matters. In selected severe cases, especially with generalized deep pockets, rapid progression, or specific pathogens, combining SRP with amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily plus metronidazole 250–400 mg three times daily for 14 days improves clinical attachment outcomes compared with SRP alone at one year, yet I should emphasize this is adjunctive to thorough debridement and patient-level risk control, and that no regimen is a one-size-fits-all gold standard [^116oxj6x] [^112rudWy]. Hold on, I should verify I am not implying indefinite antibiotics; suppressive antibiotic therapy is not a periodontitis strategy, and prolonged courses risk resistance without durable benefit in biofilm disease, reinforcing the importance of targeted, time-limited use only when indicated [^112rudWy].

> I should review host modulation options for refractory disease, but let me confirm the signal strength first. Sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline at 20 mg twice daily can reduce matrix metalloproteinase activity and modulate inflammation without antimicrobial pressure, and while it is the only antibiotic-class agent with validated host-modulating effects in periodontitis, I must select patients carefully and reassess response to avoid unnecessary exposure [^116oxj6x] [^112wijAy].

> Now, I need to consider systemic comorbidities that modify risk and outcomes because they can shift the threshold for adjunctive therapy and the intensity of maintenance. For type 2 diabetes, large randomized data did not show HbA1c improvement at 6 months after non-surgical therapy, whereas observational work suggests small improvements with greater treatment intensity, so I should position periodontal therapy primarily for oral health while coordinating tight glycemic control and smoking cessation to improve periodontal outcomes [^113RHnpR] [^113y63gK]. Regarding cardiovascular disease, periodontal therapy lowers inflammatory biomarkers and may associate with better clinical outcomes in some cohorts, but Cochrane reviews have not confirmed clear CVD prevention benefits, so I should avoid overpromising systemic gains while still addressing oral inflammation as part of comprehensive care [^116qVhJp] [^116NFi1f]. In COPD, small studies suggest improved periodontal indices and possibly fewer exacerbations after periodontal therapy, but evidence quality is low to moderate at best, so I should counsel patients that oral care is reasonable with uncertain respiratory benefits and ensure dental procedures use aspiration control and preprocedural rinses to minimize aerosol risks [^113sk9rp] [^112GbgdN].

> Pregnancy deserves special caution, and I realize I need to check my assumptions carefully. Initially, I was inclined to say "do not treat acutely during pregnancy" due to theoretical bacteremia and inflammation risks, but wait, let me verify against the data: randomized trials and reviews show that periodontal therapy during pregnancy does not reduce preterm birth, yet routine non-surgical periodontal care is generally considered safe when clinically indicated, with no demonstrated increase in adverse obstetric outcomes, while the optimal window to affect obstetric risk, if at all, is likely pre-conception when more intensive therapy is feasible [^116p53ae] [^1145qHFi] [^111WYe9g]. So, I should correct my earlier impulse and advise that indicated non-surgical periodontal care can proceed in pregnancy with standard precautions, while counseling that benefits are primarily oral and timing pre-conception may be preferable if the goal is to influence birth outcomes [^116p53ae] [^1145qHFi].

> Before finalizing the plan, I should not overlook acute abscess scenarios because they represent a different urgency. For a localized periodontal or periapical abscess, prompt drainage and source control are crucial, with antibiotics reserved for systemic spread, diffuse involvement, or immunocompromise, and dental extraction or endodontic therapy considered based on tooth prognosis and patient factors, consistent with dental primary care and disease-specific guidance in conditions like X-linked hypophosphatemia where abscess risk is elevated [^114RrXib] [^1159NmEu]. Let me double-check that I am not substituting antibiotics for drainage; definitive mechanical or endodontic management remains essential to resolve infection in biofilm and necrotic spaces [^114RrXib].

> Next, I should lay out the maintenance phase because failure here undermines any initial gains. Supportive periodontal therapy every 3 to 6 months with periodontal re-evaluation, site-specific subgingival debridement, and risk modification such as smoking cessation and glycemic control is standard, and adjunctive use of an antibacterial toothpaste like triclosan/copolymer can modestly improve gingival outcomes, acknowledging that mechanical plaque control remains central and that product choices should consider patient preference and regulatory guidance [^112XHdCa] [^117THAre]. I should double-check adherence and technique at each visit because lapses in home care often explain recurrence more than lack of initial response [^112XHdCa].

> Let me synthesize an "optimal" regimen for a typical adult with moderate periodontitis while keeping the evidence guardrails visible. I would deliver thorough SRP, either quadrant-based or full-mouth within 24 hours depending on logistics, reinforce meticulous daily plaque control, consider a short course of chlorhexidine rinse post-instrumentation, and optionally a time-limited probiotic such as Lactobacillus reuteri if the patient is motivated, then re-evaluate at about 8 to 12 weeks to decide on need for site-specific retreatment, with systemic antibiotics reserved for non-responding, rapidly progressive, or severe generalized disease after confirming adherence and debridement quality [^113KGfHV] [^113xa6xk] [^112rudWy]. For severe generalized Stage III/IV disease, I would couple intensive SRP and extraction of hopeless teeth with amoxicillin plus metronidazole for 14 days in appropriate candidates, followed by close maintenance, and consider sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline for host modulation in refractory cases while monitoring for benefit and tolerability [^116oxj6x] [^112wijAy].

> Finally, I need to ensure the caveats are explicit so recommendations remain proportional to evidence. Pharmacologic adjuncts provide incremental gains at best and the certainty of evidence ranges from low to moderate, there is no single antibiotic gold standard, and indiscriminate use risks resistance and adverse effects, so antibiotics must be adjunctive, time-limited, and reserved for defined indications after high-quality mechanical therapy and risk control have been verified [^112rudWy] [^116oxj6x]. Individualized care anchored in biofilm disruption, behavioral support, and structured maintenance remains the most reliable route to durable periodontal health, with any systemic benefits treated as possible but unproven bonuses rather than primary goals of care [^112XHdCa] [^116qVhJp].

The best treatment for gum infection is **scaling and root planing (SRP)** [^114A7M8g] to remove subgingival plaque and calculus, with **chlorhexidine 0.12% rinses** [^113xa6xk] as adjunctive antiseptic therapy [^113RHnpR]. Systemic antibiotics are reserved for severe or refractory cases [^112rudWy], with **amoxicillin plus metronidazole** as the preferred regimen; clindamycin is an alternative for penicillin allergy. Supportive **periodontal therapy** [^112XHdCa] and **strict oral hygiene** [^117THAre] are essential to prevent recurrence.

---

## Mechanical debridement: cornerstone of treatment

Mechanical removal of dental plaque and calculus is **the primary and most effective initial therapy** for gum infections [^114A7M8g]. Scaling and root planing (SRP) [^112wijAy] is the standard non-surgical procedure that removes supra- and subgingival bacterial deposits, reducing inflammation and halting disease progression. SRP **effectiveness** is evidenced by significant reductions in periodontal pathogens, inflammation, and pocket depth [^112wijAy], along with improvements in clinical attachment levels and overall periodontal health [^113KGfHV]. Full-mouth disinfection within 24 hours (**full-mouth scaling/disinfection**) [^113KGfHV] may offer additional benefits by reducing bacterial reservoirs and preventing re-infection.

---

## Adjunctive antiseptic therapy

Adjunctive **antiseptic mouth rinses** are recommended to enhance mechanical debridement by reducing bacterial load and inflammation [^117THAre]. Chlorhexidine gluconate **(0.12%)** is considered the gold standard antiseptic rinse [^117THAre] and effectively reduces bacterial biofilm and inflammation; however, long-term use may cause tooth discoloration, taste disturbances, and increased supragingival calculus formation [^113xa6xk]. Essential **oil mouth rinses** can also reduce bacterial load and inflammation but are generally less effective than chlorhexidine.

---

## Systemic antibiotic therapy

Systemic antibiotics are **not routinely recommended** for uncomplicated gum infections because of concerns about resistance and adverse effects [^112rudWy]. They may be indicated for severe or refractory disease, particularly when there is systemic involvement or aggressive periodontitis [^116oxj6x].

- **Amoxicillin plus metronidazole**: This combination is the preferred systemic antibiotic regimen for severe periodontitis, significantly improving clinical outcomes when used adjunctively with SRP [^112wijAy].

- **Clindamycin**: Recommended as an alternative for patients allergic to penicillin.

- **Doxycycline**: Low-dose doxycycline (20 mg twice daily) may be used as host modulation therapy to reduce inflammation and collagenase activity [^112wijAy].

---

## Supportive periodontal therapy (SPT)

Following initial treatment, **supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) is essential** for maintaining periodontal health and preventing recurrence [^112XHdCa]. SPT includes regular professional cleanings, periodontal evaluations, and patient education on oral hygiene practices [^114A7M8g].

---

## Patient education and preventive measures

Patient **education and adherence** to preventive measures are critical for successful long-term management of gum infections [^114A7M8g]. Oral **hygiene instruction** focuses on teaching proper brushing and flossing techniques to maintain optimal oral hygiene and prevent plaque accumulation [^117THAre]. Lifestyle **modifications**, including smoking cessation, dietary improvements, and management of systemic conditions (e.g. diabetes), are essential to reduce risk factors and improve treatment outcomes [^112wijAy] [^116NFi1f].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Recent research has explored novel therapeutic approaches, including host modulation therapy, laser therapy, and tissue engineering [^116mxkPT]. However, these therapies remain under investigation and are **not yet established as standard care** [^114A7M8g].

---

## Summary of recommended treatment protocol

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Recommended agents/procedures** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanical debridement | All cases | Scaling and root planing (SRP) |
| Adjunctive antiseptic therapy | Moderate to severe cases | Chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) |
| Systemic antibiotic therapy | Severe or refractory cases | Amoxicillin + metronidazole; clindamycin (alternative) |
| Supportive periodontal therapy | Maintenance phase | Regular professional cleanings, periodontal evaluations |
| Patient education | All cases | Oral hygiene instruction, lifestyle modifications |

---

The best medication and treatment for gum infection involve a combination of mechanical debridement, adjunctive antiseptic therapy [^113xa6xk], and systemic antibiotics in severe cases [^114A7M8g]. Supportive **periodontal therapy** [^112XHdCa] and **patient education** are essential for long-term success.

### Periodontal diseases [^114A7M8g]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2017). Low credibility.

Periodontal diseases comprise a wide range of inflammatory conditions that affect the supporting structures of the teeth (the gingiva, bone, and periodontal ligament). These conditions could lead to tooth loss and contribute to systemic inflammation. Chronic periodontitis predominantly affects adults, though aggressive periodontitis may occasionally occur in children. The initiation and propagation of periodontal disease occur through a dysbiosis of the commensal oral microbiota (dental plaque), which interacts with the host's immune defenses, leading to inflammation and disease. This pathophysiological state persists through periods of activity and quiescence until the affected tooth is extracted or the microbial biofilm is therapeutically removed, subsiding the inflammation.

The severity of periodontal disease depends on environmental and host risk factors, both modifiable (e.g. smoking) and non-modifiable (e.g. genetic susceptibility). Prevention is achieved with daily self-performed oral hygiene and professional removal of the microbial biofilm on a quarterly or bi-annual basis. New treatment modalities actively explored include antimicrobial therapy, host modulation therapy, laser therapy, and tissue engineering for tissue repair and regeneration.

### Adjunctive systemic antimicrobials for the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis [^112rudWy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Systemic antimicrobials can be used as an adjunct to mechanical debridement, such as scaling and root planing (SRP), as a non-surgical treatment approach to manage periodontitis. A range of antibiotics with different dosages and combinations are documented in the literature. The review follows the previous classification of periodontitis since all included studies used this classification.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic antimicrobials as an adjunct to SRP for the non-surgical treatment of patients with periodontitis.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases up to 9 March 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving individuals with clinically diagnosed untreated periodontitis. Trials compared SRP with systemic antibiotics versus SRP alone/placebo, or with other systemic antibiotics.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

- **Main results**: We included 45 trials conducted worldwide involving 2,664 adult participants. Fourteen studies were at low risk, eight at high risk, and the remaining 23 at unclear overall risk.

### Inborn errors of immunity-related immunological mechanisms and pharmacological therapy alternatives in periodontitis [^116oxj6x]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Mechanical removal of dental plaque and calculus is the first phase of initial therapy. If this non-surgical therapy is unsuccessful, an alternative treatment with antimicrobial agents is considered.

- **Recommendations and therapeutic approach for periodontitis**: Pharmacotherapy consists of systemic or local antibiotics and antiseptics applied according to the severity of the disease. Recent periodontal studies present pharmacological agents directed against bacteria or a host immune response, often chosen as an adjunct treatment option. However, none of these antimicrobials were established as a "gold standard" in periodontal treatment. Systemic antimicrobials are therapies used as an adjunct to mechanical debridement, such as scaling and root planing (SRP), a non-surgical treatment approach to manage periodontitis. This approach often eliminates the need for radical surgical resection of periodontal tissues.

In severe adult and juvenile periodontitis (Stage III or IV), amoxicillin plus metronidazole and amoxicillin-clavulanate are considered treatment alternatives. In a randomized clinical trial of patients with severe chronic periodontitis, the combination of metronidazole (250 mg or 400 mg orally three times daily) plus amoxicillin (500 mg orally three times daily) for 14 days was superior to scaling and root planing alone after 1 year of follow-up. An earlier trial involving 94 patients with advanced periodontitis demonstrated that metronidazole or doxycycline for 1–2 weeks, in conjunction with rigorous mechanical debridement, was effective.

### Mechanisms and therapeutic effectiveness of lactobacilli [^113xa6xk]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Periodontal diseases can be divided into gingivitis and periodontitis. While gingivitis is characterized by inflammation of the gingiva, periodontitis is a progressive destructive disease that involves tooth-supporting tissues such as the alveolar bone. Periodontitis is primarily characterized by the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which colonize the subgingival sites, escaping the host defense system and eventually causing tissue damage. Among antimicrobial and bacteriostatic agents, chlorhexidine is the gold standard for treating periodontitis due to its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. However, a number of side effects, such as brown teeth discoloration, salt taste perturbation, oral mucosal erosions, and enhanced supragingival calculus formation, have limited the long-term use of chlorhexidine.

Evidence has shown the effectiveness of lactobacilli in reducing gingival inflammation and the number of cariogenic periodontopathogenic bacteria. Further studies have shown that lactobacilli reduce the prevalence of moderate-to-severe gingival inflammation and improve the plaque index, which is clinically used to measure the state of oral hygiene. Additionally, lactobacilli decrease the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-1β. Saha and coworkers investigated the role of selected lactobacilli in the inhibition of Streptococcus mutans. L. reuteri strains NCIMB 701359, NCIMB 701089, NCIMB 702655, and NCIMB 702656 inhibited S. mutans to non-detectable levels (< 10 CFU).

### Supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) for maintaining the dentition in adults treated for periodontitis [^112XHdCa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Periodontitis is a bacterially induced, chronic inflammatory disease that destroys the connective tissues and bone that support teeth. Active periodontal treatment aims to reduce the inflammatory response, primarily through the eradication of bacterial deposits. Following completion of treatment and arrest of inflammation, supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) is employed to reduce the probability of re-infection and progression of the disease; to maintain teeth without pain, excessive mobility, or persistent infection in the long term; and to prevent related oral diseases.

According to the American Academy of Periodontology, SPT should include all components of a typical dental recall examination, and importantly should also include periodontal re-evaluation and risk assessment, supragingival and subgingival removal of bacterial plaque and calculus, and re-treatment of any sites showing recurrent or persistent disease. While the first four points might be expected to form part of the routine examination appointment for periodontally healthy patients, the inclusion of thorough periodontal evaluation, risk assessment, and subsequent treatment — normally including mechanical debridement of any plaque or calculus deposits — differentiates SPT from routine care. The success of SPT has been reported in a number of long-term, retrospective studies. This review aimed to assess the evidence available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Regarding medical management for oral candidiasis, specifically in relation to antifungal therapy, the IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend offering any of the following options for patients with mild oral candidiasis:

- **Clotrimazole troches**: 10 mg, administered 5 times daily for 7–14 days.
- **Miconazole mucoadhesive buccal tablet**: 50 mg tablet, applied to the mucosal surface over the canine fossa once daily for 7–14 days.

Regarding medical management for prosthetic joint infection, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy following debridement (PJI due to other organisms), the IDSA 2013 guidelines recommend considering indefinite chronic oral antimicrobial suppression after the initial treatment regimen. This decision should be based on factors such as in vitro sensitivities, allergies, and intolerances.

### Inborn errors of immunity-related immunological mechanisms and pharmacological therapy alternatives in periodontitis [^112wijAy]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Neutrophil homeostasis is crucial for periodontal health, and neutrophil diseases are common in periodontitis. Important risk factors, such as malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, smoking, systemic inherited and acquired immune-mediated diseases, infections, endocrinological diseases, and pharmacological agents, may accompany periodontitis.

Therapy begins with the elimination of any of these risk factors. The diagnosis and treatment of dietary deficiencies, as well as the addition of nutritional supplements, may aid in epithelial regeneration and immune system function. Evaluation of post-treatment effects shows that non-surgical, professional scaling and root planing (SRP) is the first therapeutic strategy for eradicating periodontal pathogens, followed by the prevention of plaque accumulation during the maintenance phase. Patient motivation and maintaining a healthy oral regimen are essential steps in preventing plaque buildup.

Pharmacotherapy is an additional treatment option chosen according to the severity of the disease. Based on literature data, local treatment with antimicrobial agents and SRP is the most reasonable pharmacological treatment option, especially in deep pockets. Among all the antibiotics mentioned, only low doses of doxycycline can modulate host pro-inflammatory agents administered during the response against periodontal pathogens.

Anti-IL-17 therapy is a therapeutic target candidate for LAD-I periodontitis, and IL-17-targeted therapies are safe in human clinical trials and currently in use in other inflammatory disease treatments.

### Local and systemic mechanisms linking periodontal disease and inflammatory comorbidities [^117MRAcY]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Periodontitis, a major inflammatory disease of the oral mucosa, is epidemiologically associated with other chronic inflammation-driven disorders, including cardio-metabolic, neurodegenerative, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Emerging evidence from interventional studies indicates that local treatment of periodontitis ameliorates surrogate markers of comorbid conditions. The potential causal link between periodontitis and its comorbidities is further strengthened by recent experimental animal studies establishing biologically plausible and clinically consistent mechanisms whereby periodontitis could initiate or aggravate a comorbid condition. This multi-faceted "mechanistic causality" aspect of the link between periodontitis and comorbidities is the focus of this review. Understanding how certain extra-oral pathologies are affected by disseminated periodontal pathogens and periodontitis-associated systemic inflammation, including the adaptation of bone marrow haematopoietic progenitors, may provide new therapeutic options to reduce the risk of periodontitis-associated comorbidities.

### Effect of periodontal therapy on COPD outcomes: a systematic review [^114FXvUu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Very low-to-moderate quality evidence suggests that periodontal treatment is associated with slower lung function decline, reduced frequency of exacerbations, and less use of healthcare resources in patients with COPD and chronic periodontitis. Based on these findings, we recommend that all COPD patients should be advised to undergo regular dental examination and follow-up. However, because of the limitations of the available evidence, large-scale clinical trials are warranted to further elucidate the effect of periodontal treatment on COPD outcomes.

### Is periodontal infection behind the failure of antibiotics to prevent coronary events [^114hQftq]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Use of antimicrobial agents to prevent coronary events is under debate. While some studies have shown a reduction in cardiovascular events, others have found their effect indistinguishable from that of a placebo. Besides Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae as a target pathogen, very few other microbes or infections have been targeted, despite established associations between cardiovascular disease and periodontitis.

In our recent pilot study, long-term clarithromycin treatment reduced cardiovascular events in subjects without periodontitis; however, in subjects with periodontitis, it failed to show any effect. As a background infection, periodontitis may overpower the beneficial effects of antibiotics. This paper presents the hypothesis that periodontitis is behind the failure of antibiotics to prevent coronary events.

- **Systemic effects of periodontal infection**: We discuss these effects and consider studies to test our hypothesis, offering a novel viewpoint for discussion on antibiotics in coronary-disease prevention.

### A randomized controlled trial of pre-conception treatment for periodontal disease to improve periodontal status during pregnancy and birth outcomes [^1134DgBf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). High credibility.

Periodontal disease is defined as an inflammatory condition of the soft tissues surrounding the teeth (i.e.g.ingivitis) and the destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth. As a persistent bacterial infection, periodontal disease leads to a chronic and systemic challenge with bacterial substances and host-derived inflammatory mediators that are capable of initiating and promoting systemic diseases. There is increasing evidence suggesting that periodontal disease is associated with systemic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, as well as adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes.

- **The relationship between periodontal disease and adverse birth outcomes**: Since Offenbacher et al. first reported an association between periodontal disease and preterm birth in 1996, substantial evidence has accumulated suggesting periodontal disease may be associated with an increased risk of various adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight, early pregnancy loss, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia. Inflammatory mediators induced by periodontal disease have downstream effects on biological pathways and tissues. Studies have shown increased levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), beta-glucuronidase (β-glucuronidase), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), metalloproteinase-8 (MMPT-8) and decreased levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) not only in the gingival tissues, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva, but also in the serum/plasma of patients affected.

### Periodontal infections cause changes in traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors: Results from a randomized controlled clinical trial [^111ffzkT]. American Heart Journal (2006). High credibility.

Chronic infections, such as periodontitis, are associated with increased risk of systemic diseases driven by persistent low-grade systemic inflammation and metabolic changes. The severity of periodontitis has also been associated with increased systolic blood pressure (BP); however, the issue remains poorly investigated. We aimed to estimate the effect of periodontal therapy on traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors in systemically healthy individuals who have periodontitis.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 40 otherwise healthy patients with severe chronic generalized periodontitis in a 6-month pilot intervention trial. Individuals were randomized either to a standard course of periodontal therapy (subgingival scaling and root planing) or an intensive one, including the adjunctive use of a locally delivered antimicrobial (IPT).

- **Results**: Compared to control, IPT produced significant reductions in a cluster of inflammatory markers at 1 month (P = 0.0406) and 2 months (P = 0.0060), together with an improvement in lipid markers at 2 months (P = 0.0320) and 6 months (P = 0.0432) after therapy. Intensive periodontal therapy led to greater reductions in IL-6 at 1 month (0.4 ± 0.2 ng/L difference, 95% CI 0.03–0.9, P = 0.0284) and 2 months (0.3 ± 0.2 ng/L difference, 95% CI 0.1–0.8, P = 0.0284), alongside decreases in C-reactive protein (0.4 ± 0.2 mg/L difference, 95% CI 0.01–0.8, P = 0.0438) and total cholesterol (0.3 ± 0.1 mmol/L difference, 95% CI 0.04–0.6, P = 0.0254). Moreover, a 7 ± 3-mm Hg decrease in systolic BP was observed at 2 months in the IPT group (95% CI 1–12, P = 0.021).

### Effect of periodontal therapy on COPD outcomes: A systematic review [^111q7waL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Kucukcoskun et al. conducted a prospective case–control study involving 40 patients with COPD, diagnosed according to the GOLD criteria. These patients had a history of at least one exacerbation during the previous year and moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis, based on the 1999 American Academy of Periodontology Workshop guidelines. COPD exacerbation was defined as a worsening in baseline respiratory symptoms lasting at least two days and requiring oral steroids and antibiotics (moderate exacerbation) or hospitalization (severe exacerbation).

Patients were allocated to either periodontal treatment (oral hygiene, full mouth scaling, and root planing with hand instruments and ultrasonic devices completed over three visits, n = 20) or no treatment (n = 20) according to their access to periodontal services. Exacerbations were self-reported by patients and confirmed by the investigator, while the number of exacerbations and hospitalizations during the last year before enrollment was also recorded. Periodontal procedures were performed by a dentist blind to the study design and COPD severity, and all patients were re-evaluated at six and twelve months.

With respect to periodontal parameters, compared to baseline, the treatment group exhibited significant improvements in BP, GI, PPD, and CAL at six months. At twelve months, this improvement remained significant only for CAL. Conversely, in the control group, most periodontal parameters showed significant deterioration at six months (GI, PPD, PI, and CAL) and twelve months (GI, PPD, and CAL). The frequency of exacerbations per patient-year was 1.95.

### Periodontal therapy for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with periodontitis [^116qVhJp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

There may be an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, the evidence so far has been uncertain about whether periodontal therapy can help prevent CVD in people diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. This is the second update of a review originally published in 2014 and first updated in 2017. Although there is a new multidimensional staging and grading system for periodontitis, we have retained the label 'chronic periodontitis' in this version of the review since available studies are based on the previous classification system.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the effects of periodontal therapy for primary or secondary prevention of CVD in people with chronic periodontitis.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, two trials registries, and the grey literature to September 2019. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication. We also searched the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the VIP database, and Sciencepaper Online to August 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared active periodontal therapy to no periodontal treatment or a different periodontal treatment. We included studies of participants with a diagnosis of chronic periodontitis, either with CVD (secondary prevention studies) or without CVD (primary prevention studies).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors carried out the study identification and selection.

### The effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on hemoglobin A1c levels in persons with type 2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis: a randomized clinical trial [^113RHnpR]. JAMA (2013). High credibility.

Chronic periodontitis, a destructive inflammatory disorder of the supporting structures of the teeth, is prevalent in patients with diabetes. Limited evidence suggests that periodontal therapy may improve glycemic control. This study aimed to determine if nonsurgical periodontal treatment reduces levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in persons with type 2 diabetes and moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis.

The Diabetes and Periodontal Therapy Trial (DPTT) was a 6-month, single-masked, multicenter, randomized clinical trial. Participants had type 2 diabetes, were taking stable doses of medications, had HbA1c levels between 7% and less than 9%, and untreated chronic periodontitis. A total of 514 participants were enrolled between November 2009 and March 2012 from diabetes and dental clinics and communities affiliated with five academic medical centers.

- **Interventions**: The treatment group (n = 257) received scaling and root planing plus chlorhexidine oral rinse at baseline and supportive periodontal therapy at 3 and 6 months. The control group (n = 257) received no treatment for 6 months.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the difference in change in HbA1c level from baseline between groups at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in probing pocket depths, clinical attachment loss, bleeding on probing, gingival index, fasting glucose level, and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA2) score.

Enrollment was stopped early because of futility. At 6 months, mean HbA1c levels in the periodontal therapy group increased by 0.17% (standard deviation, 1.0).

### Apical periodontitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A puppet master [^113WSxwc]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The focal infection theory suggests that periodontal pathobionts may play a causal role in initiating or worsening diseases. Periodontal disease is a prevalent inflammatory, multifactorial condition affecting the periodontal tissues. The primary factor for inflammation is mature dental plaque, which hosts pathogens within the microbial biofilm. Systemic and/or mucosal immune system disturbances, antibiotic treatments, immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies all elevate the risk of infections and inflammatory processes, such as apical periodontitis.

The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), remains unclear, though both autoimmune and immune-mediated phenomena are implicated. IBD is a global disease with a prevalence of 0.3% and an incidence rate of 280–320 per 100,000 individuals in North America. According to literature, there is a negative association between poor oral health and IBD risk, with this protective effect increasing alongside the severity of poor dental hygiene. Conversely, existing IBD appears to be linked with a heightened risk of periodontal disease and poorer oral health compared to other conditions. The precise nature of these associations is not fully understood, yet it is evident that all factors influence each other.

Further research is required to determine if there is a causal relationship between dental health and IBD. In patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, apical periodontitis must be carefully considered, and appropriate treatment for the condition is essential.

### Periodontal therapy for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic periodontitis [^116qNMWZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

There is an association between chronic periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it is not known whether periodontal therapy could prevent or manage CVD in patients with chronic periodontitis.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of periodontal therapy in preventing the occurrence of, and managing or preventing the recurrence of, CVD in patients with chronic periodontitis.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 31 August 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2017, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 31 August 2017), Embase Ovid (1980 to 31 August 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL EBSCO) (1937 to 31 August 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Open Grey were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. The Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (1978 to 27 August 2017), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1994 to 27 August 2017), the VIP database (1989 to 27 August 2017), and Sciencepaper Online (2003 to 27 August 2017) were also searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were considered eligible. Studies were selected if they included patients with a diagnosis of chronic periodontitis.

### The use of long-term antibiotics for suppression of bacterial infections [^113mYP8g]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Currently, a wide range of terminology is used, including "long-term suppressive therapy", "indefinite chronic suppression", and "indefinite oral antimicrobial suppression". We recommend "suppressive antibiotic therapy" as a standardized term that accurately and succinctly describes the practice of using long courses of antibiotics to indefinitely suppress bacterial infection, so that relevant data are not unintentionally excluded from systematic reviews. As antimicrobial resistance and the levels of comorbidity in the population increase worldwide, the number of patients prescribed suppressive antibiotic therapy (SAT) will likely increase. Therefore, it is important that both patients and clinicians have accurate information about the treatment strategy to promote safe patient-centered care.

### Effects of periodontal therapy on rate of preterm delivery: a randomized controlled trial [^116p53ae]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

To test the effects of maternal periodontal disease treatment on the incidence of preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation.

- **Methods**: The Maternal Oral Therapy to Reduce Obstetric Risk Study was a randomized, treatment-masked, controlled clinical trial involving pregnant women with periodontal disease who were receiving standard obstetric care. Participants were assigned to either a periodontal treatment arm, consisting of scaling and root planing early in the second trimester, or a delayed treatment arm that provided periodontal care after delivery. Pregnancy and maternal periodontal status were followed to delivery, and neonatal outcomes were monitored until discharge. The primary outcome (gestational age less than 37 weeks) and the secondary outcome (gestational age less than 35 weeks) were analyzed using a chi-square test of equality of two proportions.

- **Results**: The study randomized 1,806 patients at three performance sites and completed 1,760 evaluable patients. At baseline, there were no differences between the treatment and control arms for any of the periodontal or obstetric measures. The rate of preterm delivery for the treatment group was 13.1% and 11.5% for the control group (P = 0.316). There were no significant differences when comparing women in the treatment group with those in the control group regarding the adverse event rate or the major obstetric and neonatal outcomes.

- **Conclusion**: Periodontal therapy did not reduce the incidence of preterm delivery.

- **Level of evidence**: I.

### Effects of periodontitis on cancer outcomes in the era of immunotherapy [^1112ppPC]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2023). Low credibility.

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the structures supporting the teeth. It was historically described as a simple bacterial infection, but the understanding of this complex disease continues to improve. The pathogenic process behind periodontitis is now known to consist of a positive-feedback loop between the oral microbiome and the host inflammatory response directed against resident microorganisms.

The accumulation of a bacterial biofilm (bacterial plaque) on the surface of the teeth can elicit a local immune response from the host. Inflammation confined to the gingiva, referred to as gingivitis, can be addressed through effective oral hygiene. However, the accumulation of more extensive plaque deposits at the dentogingival niche results in the enrichment and maturation of the biofilm, sustained local inflammation, and irreversible loss of the supporting tissues (i.e. connective tissue fibers, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone), which is termed periodontitis (figure 1).

Initially, the biofilm consists mostly of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus spp, and Rothia spp), followed by Gram-positive bacilli (e.g. Actinomyces spp and Corynebacterium spp) and a small number of Gram-negative cocci. As the bacteria divide, an intricate three-dimensional network or extracellular matrix develops, providing a protective environment for the bacteria. This extracellular matrix allows Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria to thrive deep within the oral biofilm, protected from the oxygen-rich environment.

### Effects of periodontitis on cancer outcomes in the era of immunotherapy [^112zwsf3]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2023). Low credibility.

Several clinical questions regarding the potential effects of periodontitis on immune-related toxic effects and response to cancer immunotherapy remain and require further investigation. Standard mechanical treatment of periodontitis can restore the periodontium to a healthy condition. However, whether the local treatment of periodontal disease can also re-equilibrate host immune health (both locally and systemically) by shifting the oral and gut microbiome to baseline health conditions is yet to be established. Another as of yet unanswered question is whether targeting serum inflammatory markers, specific periodontal pathogens (e.g. P. gingivalis), and associated key virulence factors improves response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in patients with cancer. Based on the knowledge and literature, we provide a rationale for why patients with cancer should be evaluated and treated for periodontal disease before the initiation of immunotherapy. To maintain dental health, these patients should also be included in short-term follow-up periods for supportive periodontal therapy.

Because non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Alaska Native people generally have the poorest oral health compared with other U.S. racial and ethnic groups, we hypothesize that managing periodontitis could help to reduce cancer disparities by improving response rates and reducing ICB toxicity profiles in underrepresented minorities and individuals with a lower socioeconomic status. Due to the high costs of these novel drugs, immune checkpoint inhibitors are more often…

### Effect of periodontal treatment on glycemic control of diabetic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114BYrWi]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Periodontitis is a chronic multifactorial infectious disease affecting the supporting tissues of the teeth. It is estimated that between 10% and 15% of adults aged 21 to 50 and about 30% of individuals over 50 years old have severe periodontitis. Clinically, patients experience a gradual loss of tooth attachment in the alveolar bone, leading to periodontal pockets, receding gums, loose teeth, and eventually tooth exfoliation, which may result in changes in dietary diversity and potentially affect general health. The gums are often red, swollen, and bleed easily, with patients frequently suffering from bad breath.

Treatment for periodontitis includes the mechanical removal of supra- and subgingival bacterial plaque using scalers, curettes, or ultrasonic devices (scaling and root planing [SRP]), alongside intensive oral hygiene instructions for the patient. An optimal oral hygiene regimen is crucial to prevent the formation of new dental plaque deposits and reinfection of the subgingival tissues. The routine use of systemic or local antibiotics as an adjunctive therapy to SRP remains controversial in terms of clinical periodontal status improvement. Surgery is often necessary to reduce or eliminate deep residual periodontal lesions.

Diabetes and periodontal disease are two chronic conditions that have long been considered biologically linked. Numerous case reports, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies, and reviews document the adverse effects of diabetes on the onset, progression, and severity of periodontitis. The prevalence of periodontitis in diabetic individuals is a significant concern, with ongoing research exploring the impact of periodontal treatment on glycemic control.

### Effect of periodontal therapy on COPD outcomes: a systematic review [^1162o8ze]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Liu et al. conducted a cross-sectional study investigating the role of periodontal health on the frequency of COPD exacerbations. The diagnosis and definition of COPD exacerbation were based on GOLD criteria. Overall, 392 COPD patients were assessed for the presence and severity of periodontal disease and were interviewed about oral health habits, history of dental visits, and frequency of supragingival scaling procedures (≥ 1 time/year vs. < 1 time/year).

- **Independent predictors**: Poor periodontal health, identified as fewer remaining teeth (adjusted OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; p = 0.04) and < 1/day brushing frequency (adjusted OR 4.19, 95% CI 1.44–12.1; p = 0.008), were the independent predictors of "frequent" exacerbations. Although the frequency of supragingival treatment was considered, the number of patients who underwent frequent treatment was not included in any of the models.

Adding COPD severity and dyspnea scores into the model retained significance for the association with periodontal health.

### Effect of periodontal therapy on COPD outcomes: A systematic review [^112GbgdN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Several mechanisms have been proposed regarding the beneficial effects of periodontal treatment on COPD outcomes. First, periodontal therapy has been shown to reduce the concentration of various inflammatory biomarkers, potentially leading to less severe inflammatory response in patients with COPD. Second, the removal of dental plaque may lead to a reduction of oral mucosa colonization with pathogens commonly isolated in respiratory and dental specimens of patients with COPD, especially during exacerbations. On the other hand, some authors have reported a deterioration of respiratory symptoms due to bacterial contamination caused by aerosols produced during dental treatment with ultrasonic devices. Antimicrobial preprocedural mouth rinse, high-volume evacuation suction, and air polishing avoidance have been proposed as precautionary measures.

- **Clinical relevance**: The present systematic review underscores the need for collaboration between pulmonologists and dental practitioners in the field of COPD management. Poor oral health is one of the primary risk factors for COPD exacerbations and could stand on its own right as a potentially modifiable condition. On the other hand, the presence of periodontal disease should alert dental practitioners to the possibility of coexistent COPD and prompt them to refer the patient for further evaluation. Future clinical trials should aim to investigate whether COPD patients will benefit from routine oral/dental assessment and provide important insights on the pathophysiological link between periodontal disease and COPD.

### Obstetric outcomes after treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115Zrb4]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Poor reporting of the methodological characteristics of randomized trials has been previously described. Although substantial improvements in key aspects of trials' methods have been seen over the past years, the quality of reporting remains well below an acceptable level. The most important aspect related to the suboptimal methodological quality of randomized trials is the substantial threat to the validity of the results and conclusions obtained.

Reporting of methodological quality parameters is directly correlated with the provision of outcomes that favor the experimental arm. Previous reports have shown an inverse relation between the methodological quality score and the efficacy of preventive strategies, whereas the quality of reports of randomized trials seems to affect estimates of the efficacy of interventions reported in meta-analyses.

Thus, taking into account the fact that studies of low methodological quality, in which the estimate of quality is incorporated into the meta-analyses, can alter the interpretation of the benefit of the intervention, this meta-analysis has a major strength in that it separately considered the effect of treatment among high-quality and low-quality trials. This is in accordance with a large meta-epidemiological study, which clearly recommends that systematic reviewers should present meta-analyses restricted to trials at low risk of bias for each outcome, either as the primary analysis or in conjunction with less restrictive analyses. Furthermore, the adoption of Cochrane's risk of bias tool to assess the quality of the randomized trials included is essential.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^1159NmEu]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Conventional treatment improves dentin mineralization, reduces the number of dental abscesses, and decreases the frequency and severity of periodontitis. Reducing the size of the pulp chambers, as demonstrated by dental radiographs, is a useful sign of successful treatment. Continued supplementation through adulthood may be beneficial, as the number of dental abscesses and severity of periodontitis vary according to the percentage of adult life with treatment.

To prevent bacterial invasion of the dentin and pulp via enamel microcracks, we suggest sealing the occlusal surfaces of both deciduous and permanent teeth in children with XLH. This approach can be achieved with flowable resin composite placed in the pits and fissures of the occlusal surface and should be performed regularly as soon as the eruption of the tooth allows acceptable isolation of the occlusal surface.

Acute abscesses might require antibiotic treatment depending on the extent and severity of the infection. For deciduous teeth, the decision to extract or treat endodontically will depend on the extent of the infection, recurrence, and the expected timing of normal exfoliation of the permanent tooth. For permanent teeth, endodontic treatment or re-treatment of the tooth are the preferred options, although healing after endodontic treatment might not be as favorable as in healthy patients.

Prevention, treatment, and supportive care of periodontitis in adult patients should follow standard management, as in the general population. Treatment of periodontitis should aim to decrease gingival inflammation and maintain periodontal health.

### The link between chronic periodontitis and COPD: A common role for the neutrophil [^115b7Pjr]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

If the hypothesis of overspill of local inflammation into the systemic circulation leading to distant co-morbidity is correct, it is possible that effective treatment of one condition would have an appreciable effect on the other. So far, few trials have been conducted to test this hypothesis. It has already been mentioned that there is a positive relationship between oral health behaviors, such as tooth brushing time and supragingival scaling, and COPD exacerbation frequency. Recently, a prospective controlled group trial of periodontal treatment in patients with both diseases was undertaken. Forty patients with COPD from chest clinics, with concomitant moderate or severe chronic periodontitis, were selected. Half received initial periodontal therapy, whilst the others had no treatment.

Over the subsequent 12 months, the treatment group had a decline in their median exacerbation frequency from three to two, whilst the control group had an increase from two to three. Though this is an interesting result, the groups were not randomly selected and the sample size was small. Nevertheless, this early observation provides support for a distant effect of a local inflammatory process and is worthy of further investigation with more carefully designed and appropriately powered studies, particularly given the circumstantial evidence outlined above.

Regarding medical management for ecthyma and impetigo, IDSA 2014 guidelines specifically recommend oral antibiotic therapy. The guidelines suggest administering dicloxacillin PO 250 mg QID or cephalexin PO 250 mg QID for 7 days as first-line oral antibiotic therapy in most patients with ecthyma or impetigo, given that causative S. aureus isolates are usually methicillin-susceptible.

### Epigenetic regulation of inflammation in periodontitis: cellular mechanisms and therapeutic potential [^116mxkPT]. Clinical Epigenetics (2020). Low credibility.

Comprehensive in vivo studies analyzing long-term effects of HDACi or BET inhibitor treatment on host responses to the dysbiotic oral microflora, as well as other pathogens not related to the oral microbiota, are therefore necessary to determine the potential consequences of epigenetic therapies on oral health and to identify the optimal mode of drug administration. The available literature does not provide definitive indications on whether epigenetic changes should be targeted systemically or locally at the site of inflammation. This determination will ultimately depend on the relative contributions of dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms to the pathological activation of different cell types that drive chronic inflammation in periodontitis. These cell type-specific effects may be impossible to address in studies of patients with established disease and will require a well-designed animal model and longitudinal studies of individuals at risk of developing periodontitis. This approach will allow for understanding the complex relationships between systemic epigenetic changes in circulating immune cells and alterations that occur locally in resident cells of the periodontium at different stages of disease development and progression.

### Periodontal therapy for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with periodontitis [^113Z1TqR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

There may be an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, the evidence so far has been uncertain about whether periodontal therapy can help prevent CVD in people diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. This is the third update of a review originally published in 2014, and most recently updated in 2019. Although there is a new multidimensional staging and grading system for periodontitis, we have retained the label 'chronic periodontitis' in this version of the review since available studies are based on the previous classification system.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the effects of periodontal therapy for primary or secondary prevention of CVD in people with chronic periodontitis.

- **Search methods**: An information specialist searched five bibliographic databases up to 17 November 2021, and additional search methods were used to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. We also searched the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the VIP database, and Sciencepaper Online up to March 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared active periodontal therapy to no periodontal treatment or a different periodontal treatment. We included studies of participants with a diagnosis of chronic periodontitis, either with CVD (secondary prevention studies) or without CVD (primary prevention studies).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors carried out the study identification, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment independently and in parallel.

### A randomized controlled trial of intensive periodontal therapy on metabolic and inflammatory markers in patients with ESRD: Results of an exploratory study [^111FKdeg]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Periodontitis is a novel risk factor for inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the dialysis population, yet limited information exists about the impact of periodontal therapy in patients receiving dialysis.

- **Study design**: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess feasibility and gather preliminary data.

- **Setting & participants**: The study involved dialysis patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis.

- **Intervention**: Intensive treatment, consisting of scaling and root planing, extraction of hopeless teeth, and placement of local-delivery antibiotics, was performed at the baseline visit for treatment-group patients and after study completion for control-group patients.

- **Outcomes**: The outcomes measured included feasibility (screening, recruitment, enrollment, adverse events, and study withdrawal/completion), clinical periodontal parameters (probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, gingival index, and plaque index), and serum albumin and interleukin 6 levels at 3 and 6 months postintervention.

- **Results**: A total of 342 dialysis patients were approached for participation: 53 were randomly assigned, with 26 participants receiving immediate treatment and 27 assigned to a control arm for treatment after 6 months. Of these, 51 patients completed baseline appointments, 46 were available for 3-month follow-up, 45 for 6-month follow-up examinations, and 43 completed all visits. At 3 months, there was a statistically significant improvement for the treatment group compared to the control group in three periodontal parameters: mean probing depth (P = 0.008), extent of probing depth ≥ 4 mm (P = 0).

### Common dental infections in the primary care setting [^114RrXib]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Family physicians commonly encounter patients with dental infections, such as dental caries and periodontal disease. Dental caries is caused by bacteria that destroy the enamel and dentin; it can be detected by an oral examination that shows stained pits or fissures on the tooth surface. The use of fluoride is the most effective prevention measure for dental caries. Untreated caries may progress to pulpitis and, eventually, to necrosis of the pulp. In irreversible pulpitis, the tooth dies, and the patient may have a localized abscess that can spread to surrounding tissue.

Periodontal infections are caused by bacteria in the subgingival dental plaque. In gingivitis, the inflamed gums bleed easily with brushing or flossing; the condition can be controlled with good oral hygiene. Periodontitis is characterized by a loss of supportive bone structure caused by chronic gingivitis; it is also associated with some systemic diseases. Localized periodontitis is treated with mechanical debridement and good oral hygiene, whereas generalized periodontitis requires adjunct antibiotic therapy.

Pericoronitis results when food particles become trapped under the gum of an impacted tooth. This condition can be controlled by the removal of food debris and good oral hygiene. For patients in whom dental infections are disseminated and have invaded the deeper oral spaces, antibiotic treatment should be initiated at the time of referral.

### Effect of periodontal therapy on COPD outcomes: A systematic review [^113Kener]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Results of data synthesis

Quality of life

Two studies evaluated the effect of periodontal therapy on quality of life. Das et al. randomized 35 COPD patients (diagnosed according to the GOLD spirometric criteria) to receive either periodontal treatment (treatment group, n = 18) or no treatment (control group, n = 17). Interventions included full-mouth scaling and root planing with hand instruments as well as oral hygiene instructions, while the effect of periodontal therapy on quality of life was assessed with the SGRQ score. All patients were reassessed at 1-year post-treatment for significant changes in periodontal and oral parameters and in SGRQ scores.

With respect to the intervention group in this study, significant improvements were observed in the Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified (OHI-S), Gingival Index (GI), and CAL, but not in PPD, while no differences in any of the appraised parameters were noted in the control group. The SGRQ "activity" subscore significantly improved in the treatment group post-treatment (53.68 ± 16.37 vs. 38.20 ± 13.18; p = 0.005), but no differences in any of the SGRQ subscores were observed in the control group. At the end of the 1-year follow-up period, no differences were noted in the SGRQ subscores between the two groups, with the exception of the "activity" subscore, which was significantly better in the intervention group (38.20 ± 13.18 vs. 56.48 ± 18.31; p < 0.01).

### Antibiotics to prevent complications following tooth extractions [^117UB5P6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The most frequent indications for tooth extractions, generally performed by general dental practitioners, are dental caries and periodontal infections. Systemic antibiotics may be prescribed to patients undergoing extractions to prevent complications due to infection. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis on the prevention of infectious complications following tooth extractions.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (up to 16 April 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 16 April 2020), Embase Ovid (1980 to 16 April 2020), and LILACS (1982 to 16 April 2020). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing tooth extraction(s) for any indication.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently performed data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment for the included studies. We contacted trial authors for further details where these were unclear. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk differences.

### Periodontitis and systemic inflammation as independent and interacting risk factors for mortality: Evidence from a prospective cohort study [^116NFi1f]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

At the time of writing, there is no profound consensus on whether and how periodontal treatment may have beneficial effects on atherosclerosis, CVD events, and survival. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest some potential. Both local and systemic inflammatory responses following periodontal therapy have been well documented. In addition, periodontal therapy has been associated with a consistent long-term reduction in inflammation, as measured by CRP, IL-6, and fibrinogen, as well as significantly improved endothelial function up to 6 months post-treatment.

In contrast, in a randomized controlled trial of 90 patients with peripheral arterial disease and severe periodontitis, no reduction in vascular inflammation as determined by 18F-FDG-PET/CT was seen 3 months after periodontal therapy, with or without additional systemic antibiotics. However, in 3,631 hemodialysis patients, intensive periodontal therapy was associated with an HR of 0.78 for CVD hospital admission and 0.49 for all-cause mortality compared with untreated controls.

In addition, a population-based observational study of 247,696 Koreans reported a 14% lower risk of CVD events in individuals with regular dental visits for professional cleaning. Moreover, in a nationwide study in Taiwan, the incidence rate of acute myocardial infarction was 3.5% in 7,164 participants who did not receive dental scaling, almost twice as high as in the matched control group (1.9%) who received regular scaling.

Finally, several systematic reviews agreed that despite evidence of beneficial effects of periodontal treatment on surrogate measures of CV.

### Effects of periodontitis on cancer outcomes in the era of immunotherapy [^112sAez7]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2023). Low credibility.

Periodontitis results from dysbiosis of the oral microbiome and affects up to 70% of US adults aged 65 years and older. More than 50 systemic inflammatory disorders and comorbidities are associated with periodontitis, many of which overlap with immunotherapy-associated toxicities. Despite the increasing use of immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer, uncertainty remains as to whether the microbial shift associated with periodontal disease can influence response rates and tolerance to cancer immunotherapy. We herein review the pathophysiology of periodontitis and the local and systemic inflammatory conditions related to oral dysbiosis, and discuss the overlapping adverse profiles of periodontitis and immunotherapy. The effects of the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a key pathogen in periodontitis, highlight how the oral microbiome can affect the host's systemic immune responses, and further research into the local and systemic influence of other microorganisms causing periodontal disease is necessary. Addressing periodontitis in an aging population of people with cancer could have potential implications for the clinical response to and tolerability of immunotherapy and warrants further investigation.

### Effect of periodontal treatment on glycemic control of diabetic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115euR74]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The combined MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Cochrane Central searches resulted in 639 potentially eligible articles (Fig. 1). These articles were screened by title and abstract for relevance. The screening resulted in 74 articles that qualified for full-text reading. After full-text reading, 40 articles were deemed unsuitable and were therefore excluded. Supplemental Table 1A and C, available in an online appendix, presents the reasons for exclusion. Screening of the reviews (n = 29) did not provide any additional articles. Supplemental Table 1B presents the excluded intervention studies (n = 35) and the main reason for exclusion.

### Periodontal therapy for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic periodontitis [^113YYQGX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

There is an association between chronic periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it is not known whether periodontal therapy could prevent or manage CVD in patients with chronic periodontitis.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of periodontal therapy in preventing the occurrence of, and management or recurrence of, CVD in patients with chronic periodontitis.

- **Search methods**: The electronic databases that were searched included the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 7 April 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 7 April 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 7 April 2014), CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 7 April 2014), OpenGrey (to 7 April 2014), the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (1978 to April 2014), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1994 to April 2014), and the VIP database (1989 to April 2014). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Sciencepaper Online for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were considered eligible. Studies were selected if they included patients with a diagnosis of chronic periodontitis and previous CVD (secondary prevention studies) or no CVD (primary prevention studies).

### The clinical efficacy of triclosan/copolymer and other common therapeutic approaches to periodontal health [^117THAre]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

The maintenance of an effective level of oral hygiene is the cornerstone of all attempts to prevent and control periodontal disease, yet the widespread prevalence of the disease indicates the inability of most people to maintain a level of plaque control commensurate with periodontal health. The inclusion of antibacterial agents, such as chlorhexidine and triclosan, in oral care products has provided a means to improve oral health. Randomized, controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that the unsupervised use of a dentifrice (toothpaste) containing triclosan/copolymer significantly improves gingival health, prevents the onset of periodontitis, and reduces further progression of tissue destruction. The delivery of such benefits has positive implications for the oral health of individuals and populations.

### A randomized controlled trial of pre-conception treatment for periodontal disease to improve periodontal status during pregnancy and birth outcomes [^116pDnRu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study is to examine if the pre-conception treatment of periodontal disease leads to improved periodontal status during late pregnancy and birth outcomes, such as mean birth weight and mean gestational age.

We hypothesize that the pre-conception treatment of periodontal disease (periodontal treatment one year before pregnancy) will:

- **Reduce rate of periodontal disease during pregnancy**: By providing early periodontal treatment, we anticipate a decline in the prevalence of periodontal issues throughout the gestational period.

- **Increase birth weight and prolong gestational duration**: The treatment may result in higher birth weights and extended gestational periods.

- **Reduce mean levels of local and systemic inflammatory mediators**: This could lead to a decrease in inflammation-related complications during pregnancy.

The primary outcome is periodontal disease, determined by measuring probing depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and the percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP) between 32 and 36 weeks of gestational age. Secondary outcomes are mean birth weight (in grams) and mean gestational age (in weeks).

In addition, we will compare inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β, IL-6, β-glucuronidase, TNF-α, PGE2, AST, MMP-8, and OPG, in saliva, maternal blood during late pregnancy, and cord blood after delivery in both groups as secondary outcomes.

### A randomized controlled trial of pre-conception treatment for periodontal disease to improve periodontal status during pregnancy and birth outcomes [^1145qHFi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). High credibility.

Attempts at treating periodontal disease during pregnancy to achieve improved outcomes have had inconsistent conclusions. Recently, several large clinical randomized controlled trials failed to conclude that standard periodontal therapy during pregnancy reduced the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. This raises the question of when to treat periodontal disease.

Pregnancy may not be an appropriate period for periodontal disease treatment, as discussed by Xiong et al. The reasons include:

- **Inflammation risks**: Treating periodontal disease during pregnancy may be too late to reduce the local and systemic inflammation activated by oral bacterial pathogens.
- **Bacteremia risks**: Dental scaling and root planing during treatment can cause bacteremia, triggering systemic inflammation, which could lead to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes.
- **Safety concerns**: Due to safety concerns regarding the frequency of periodontal treatment during pregnancy, treatments are often restricted to one or two courses, which may not be effective in preventing the progression of periodontal disease.

In contrast, the pre-conception period may be optimal for interventions:

- **Intensive treatment**: Pre-conception periodontal therapy may lead to better outcomes as it can be more intensive compared with treatment during pregnancy, allowing the use of adjunctive antibiotics.
- **Causal risk factor evidence**: Pre-conception treatments may provide more evidence as to whether periodontal disease is a causal risk factor for adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, such as preterm birth.

### Interventions to prevent and manage infections in pregnancy [^111WYe9g]. Neonatology (2025). Low credibility.

The review compared the treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy with no treatment. Eleven studies were included, of which three were from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Overall, treatment of periodontal disease had no effect on the risk of preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA), or perinatal mortality. Evidence from LMICs suggested the intervention had a significant effect on the risk of LBW (risk ratio 0.48 [0.33–0.71]; 2 studies), but no evidence of difference was seen on preterm birth or perinatal mortality.

No evidence of previous or ongoing studies addressing the treatment of documented deep caries or periapical periodontal disease during pregnancy was found.

### Inborn errors of immunity-related immunological mechanisms and pharmacological therapy alternatives in periodontitis [^1155JNW9]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Periodontitis, the leading cause of tooth loss worldwide, occurs due to the oral microbiota in dental plaque. Chronic infection develops in the soft and mineralized tissues surrounding the teeth. More children are now being diagnosed with periodontitis at an early stage due to early detection and prevention of dental diseases.

There is an imbalance between subgingival microflora and the advantage of periodontal pathogens in periodontitis. Tissue damage occurs when the host defense mechanism cannot overcome the toxic activity of pathogens. The colonization and penetration of the gingival sulcus and specific interactions of host factors with microflora occur during the physiological response to microbial factors and mainly play a role in periodontal pathogenesis. The microbiota triggers uncontrolled inflammation in the oral mucosal tissues, destroying the structures that support the teeth. At the cellular level, disease activity and tissue destruction are modulated by producing inflammatory factors, including interleukins, prostaglandins, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

Periodontal disease is categorized based on disease severity, often into two stages: gingivitis (inflammation of the gum tissue) is the early stage of periodontal disease, which progresses to the second late stage, periodontitis, when left untreated. Periodontitis causes erosion of teeth and supporting tissues.

The untreated disease causes irreversible bone loss and architectural defects (craters) in the bone, as well as increased periodontal pocket depth.

### Biofilm formation - what we can learn from recent developments [^116uz7L3]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Although biofilms have been observed early in the history of microbial research, their impact has only recently been fully recognized. Biofilm infections, which contribute to up to 80% of human microbial infections, are associated with common human disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and poor dental hygiene, but also with medical implants. The associated chronic infections, such as wound infections, dental caries, and periodontitis, significantly enhance morbidity, affect quality of life, and can aid in the development of follow-up diseases such as cancer. Biofilm infections remain challenging to treat, and antibiotic monotherapy is often insufficient, although some rediscovered traditional compounds have shown surprising efficiency.

Innovative anti-biofilm strategies include:

- **Application of anti-biofilm small molecules**: Intrinsic or external stimulation of the production of reactive molecules.
- **Utilization of materials with antimicrobial properties**: Dispersion of biofilms by digestion of the extracellular matrix, also in combination with physical biofilm breakdown.

Although basic principles of biofilm formation have been deciphered, the molecular understanding of the formation and structural organization of various types of biofilms has just begun to emerge. Basic studies of biofilm physiology have also resulted in an unexpected discovery of cyclic dinucleotide second messengers that are involved in interkingdom crosstalk via specific mammalian receptors. These findings even open up new venues for exploring novel anti-biofilm strategies.

### Dental caries and periodontitis: contrasting two infections that have medical implications [^114cpiNL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Both dental decay and periodontal disease are diagnosable and treatable bacterial infections. They are distinctly different infections, with dental decay occurring on the supragingival surfaces of the teeth and periodontal infections occurring in the gingival tissue approximating the subgingival plaque. The bacteria involved and the pathophysiology of these infections are distinctly different.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections [^117N8BeF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically P. aeruginosa infections with difficult-to-treat resistance, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend administering ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, or imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam as preferred options for treating infections outside of the urinary tract caused by P. aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance. Additionally, cefiderocol is recommended as an alternative option for such infections.

### How periodontitis or periodontal bacteria can influence Alzheimer's disease features? A systematic review of pre-clinical studies [^114kHg6b]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). High credibility.

The study employed a meticulous procedure for study selection. Two independent, blinded reviewers, LS and YA, carried out the selection using the online Cochrane platform (COVIDENCE). They initially screened the titles, followed by abstracts, and finally the full texts of the 3,307 articles identified through electronic and manual searches. Agreement between the examiners was measured using Cohen's kappa (κ) coefficient at each level of selection to ensure reliability. Records were excluded solely to enhance sensitivity if both reviewers found them unsuitable based on title alone. Any disagreements encountered were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer, FL, who offered the final decision.

The inclusion criteria comprised the following:

- **Animal studies (preclinical studies)**: The research focused on animal models.
- **Species requirement**: Mice and rats.
- **In vivo studies**: These were crucial to the selection process.
- **Focus on periodontitis and Alzheimer's features**: Emphasizing the relationship between periodontitis or periodontal bacteria and Alzheimer's disease features.
- **Disease manifestation**: The animals studied must exhibit both Alzheimer's pathology and periodontitis.
- **AD characteristics**: The experimental animals needed to display one or more Alzheimer's disease characteristics:
	1. Cognitive impairment
	2. Pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood or brain, specifically IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, indicating systemic inflammation and/or neuroinflammation.
	3. Neurodegeneration
	4. Microgliosis and astrogliosis
	5. Aβ peptides levels in the blood or brain
	6. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and tau protein phosphorylation in the extracellular area of the brain

The experimental animals must exhibit periodontitis, which was induced through a ligature or by oral or systemic exposure to:

1. Periodontal bacteria or periodontal genetic materials such as DNA and RNA
2. Byproducts associated with periodontitis

### Cross-sectional study of periodontal care and glycosylated hemoglobin in an insured population [^113y63gK]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Among diabetic patients with periodontal care (n = 1,950), 44% received more than seven nonsurgical periodontal services, including periodontal maintenance, local antimicrobials, and other nonsurgical treatments. Surgical care was relatively uncommon; 93% had no periodontal surgeries, 4% had one, and 3% had two or more. As hypothesized, among individuals with periodontal care, those who received greater treatment intensity had lower GHb levels. In the adjusted model, people with more than the median number of nonsurgical visits had GHb 0.13 percentage points lower than individuals with seven or fewer nonsurgical visits (95% CI −0.24 to −0.03; P = 0.01). Compared with people with no periodontal surgeries, those with one and two or more surgeries had GHb levels that were 0.25 (95% CI −0.49 to −0.01; P = 0.04) and 0.36 (95% CI −0.58 to −0.13; P = 0.002) percentage points lower, respectively.

Similar findings were observed in analyses limited to nonsmokers. Among nonsmokers, people with more than the median number of nonsurgical visits had GHb 0.14 percentage points lower than individuals with fewer visits (P = 0.02). Compared with people with no periodontal surgeries, those with one and two or more surgeries had GHb levels that were 0.26 (P = 0.05) and 0.29 (P = 0.006) percentage points lower, respectively.

### Effect of periodontal therapy on COPD outcomes: A systematic review [^113sk9rp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the periodontal outcomes, the appraised parameters presented amelioration or no change. In the RCT by Das et al, periodontal therapy with full-mouth scaling and root planning using hand instruments combined with oral hygiene was associated with improvements in OHI-S (3.38 ± 1.27 vs. 2.32 ± 1.21; p = 0.018), GI (1.79 ± 0.54 vs. 1.19 ± 0.47; p = 0.001), and CAL (4.17 ± 0.75 vs. 3.26 ± 0.90; p = 0.003) at one year post-treatment.

In the case-control study by Kucukcoskun et al, full-mouth scaling and root planning with hand instruments plus oral hygiene effected improvements in BOP% (58 ± 28 vs. 47 ± 19; p < 0.01), GI (1.52 ± 0.37 vs. 1.34 ± 0.23; p < 0.01), PPD (2.70 ± 0.66 vs. 2.39 ± 0.41; p < 0.01), and CAL (3.73 ± 1.16 vs. 3.39 ± 1.01; p < 0.01) at six months, as compared to baseline. At twelve months, CAL continued to show significant improvement with respect to its baseline value (3.73 ± 1.16 vs. 3.52 ± 1.02; p < 0.01).

Likewise, in the RCT by Zhou et al, all assessed periodontal parameters (i.e. PD, CAL, BI, PI) exhibited significant improvements for both the SRP and the scaling group at any time point (six months, one year, two years). On the contrary, supragingival scaling plus oral hygiene did not result in any improvement in CPI and LOA scores (4 ± 0.51 vs. 4.0 ± 0.48 and 2 ± 0.37 vs. 2 ± 0.37, respectively; p = NS) after three to five months, as reported by Madalli and colleagues. Radiographic alveolar bone loss and levels of inflammatory biomarkers were not assessed by any of the included studies.

### Treatment of periodontal disease and prevention of preterm birth: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113YCeMq]. American Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

There is a controversy regarding the benefits of periodontal treatment during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to evaluate its effect on the risk of preterm birth and to explore the heterogeneity between studies.

- **Study design**: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials were performed. Studies in which women were randomized for periodontal treatment versus no treatment were included. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effect models, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted.

- **Results**: Twelve randomized trials were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled estimates showed no significant reduction of preterm birth with periodontal treatment (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.08). However, substantial heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 52%) could be attributed to the risk of bias, the level of income, or the use of chlorhexidine mouthwashes as a cointervention. The daily use of chlorhexidine mouthwash was associated with a reduction in preterm birth (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.95), with moderate heterogeneity among the five studies included (I2 = 43%).

- **Conclusion**: There is significant heterogeneity between randomized trials that evaluated the effect of periodontal treatment on the risk of preterm birth. Chlorhexidine mouthwash as a preventive agent should be further evaluated.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in adults: An international working group clinical practice guideline [^117RRPpw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Dental complications are common in patients with XLH and significantly alter quality of life. Mineralization of dentin is impaired, resulting in greater susceptibility to pulp infections. Periodontal tissues are compromised, leading to relatively frequent and severe periodontal diseases in affected adults of all ages, premature loss of teeth, and an increased risk of dental implant loss.

- **Dental and oral complications**:
	- **Dental recommendations (non-graded)**: The panel proposes dental visits at least once a year to screen for infections, and recommends periodontal supportive care with recall intervals based on each individual's condition. In the presence of active oral manifestations, treatment with active vitamin D and phosphate salts, or burosumab, is advised to reduce the risk of dental infections and the severity of periodontitis.
	- **Recommendations for dental professionals (non-graded)**: The panel proposes a thorough clinical and radiological assessment to search for spontaneous pulp infection (tooth color changes, fistula, swelling, abscess, cellulitis, pain, periapical bone loss) and periodontitis. Performing a dental orthopantomogram (radiograph of the upper and lower jaw and teeth), potentially complemented or replaced with cone-beam computed tomography imaging, is recommended for patients with recent oral manifestations. This can be repeated based on individual needs. Implant surgery may be performed after 3 to 6 months of medical treatment (conventional therapy or burosumab), which should be continued for 6 months following implant surgery; healing time should be extended up to 6 months.

### Full-mouth treatment modalities (within 24 hours) for periodontitis in adults [^113KGfHV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Periodontitis is a highly prevalent, chronic inflammation that causes damage to the soft tissues and bones supporting the teeth. Conventional treatment is quadrant scaling and root planing (the second step of periodontal therapy), which comprises scaling and root planing of teeth in one quadrant of the mouth at a time, with the four different sessions separated by at least one week. Alternative protocols for anti-infective periodontal therapy have been introduced to help enhance treatment outcomes: full-mouth scaling (subgingival instrumentation of all quadrants within 24 hours) or full-mouth disinfection (subgingival instrumentation of all quadrants in 24 hours plus adjunctive antiseptic). We use the older term "scaling and root planing" (SRP) interchangeably with the newer term "subgingival instrumentation" in this iteration of the review, which updates one originally published in 2008 and first updated in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the clinical effects of full-mouth scaling or full-mouth disinfection (within 24 hours) for the treatment of periodontitis compared to conventional quadrant subgingival instrumentation (over a series of visits at least one week apart) and to evaluate whether there was a difference in clinical effects between full-mouth disinfection and full-mouth scaling.

- **Search methods**: An information specialist searched five databases up to 17 June 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting at least three months.
