## Question

How should nausea, chills, and diarrhea be diagnosed and treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how nausea, chills, and diarrhea should be diagnosed and treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stability and dehydration risk. Then, I should verify red flags that trigger stool testing and urgent evaluation. Next, I will consider the symptom timeline and key exposure risks to shape the differential. After that, I will outline the diagnostic workup, including when to use stool NAATs, C. difficile testing, and imaging. Finally, I will synthesize a treatment plan emphasizing rehydration, selective symptomatic therapy, cautious antibiotic use, special-population nuances, and follow-up and public health actions, with self-checks at each step to avoid premature conclusions [^1147dqkc] [^114cLVtN].

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities. I need to ensure hemodynamic stability and quantify dehydration because acute vomiting and diarrhea can rapidly compromise perfusion; I should check orthostatics, mucous membranes, skin turgor, urine output, and mental status, and the presence of chills likely reflects fever and systemic inflammation, warranting higher vigilance for invasive infection and sepsis risk [^1147dqkc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should explicitly identify alarm features that mandate stool diagnostics and closer monitoring. Fever or chills, bloody or mucoid stools, severe abdominal tenderness or cramping, signs of sepsis, advanced age, immunocompromise, pregnancy, significant comorbidities, dehydration requiring IV fluids, and symptom duration beyond about a week all raise concern and should trigger targeted stool testing per IDSA, with ACG similarly emphasizing testing in dysentery, moderate-severe disease, prolonged symptoms, and outbreak settings [^1147dqkc] [^114cLVtN] [^111rjrmC].

> I need to check where the patient sits on a time axis because duration guides breadth of evaluation. Acute symptoms are generally within 7 days, persistent around 1–2 weeks, and chronic beyond 4 weeks; beyond 4 weeks the workup shifts to chronic diarrhea pathways rather than acute infectious algorithms, and nausea that is acute is typically approached symptomatically if no alarm signs are present [^115jhZxm] [^115tX9y8].

> Next, I should review exposure risks that reshape pretest probabilities. Recent antibiotic use or healthcare exposure elevates the risk of C. difficile; recent travel, brackish water or shellfish exposures suggest Vibrio; animal or foodborne vectors shift toward Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, or STEC; and immunocompromise, including HIV, broadens the infectious differential and increases the need for comprehensive stool studies; pregnancy status also alters testing and treatment thresholds and choices [^113iRdjj] [^112Yw7in] [^117SFMqP] [^1152cwfm].

> For the differential, let me consider infectious etiologies first because they are most common with this triad. Bacterial enterocolitides such as Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Vibrio, and STEC should be prioritized, along with viral gastroenteritis like norovirus, and protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium when exposures fit; systemic infections including COVID-19 can present with chills and GI symptoms, so I should keep SARS-CoV-2 on the list in the right epidemiologic context [^1147dqkc] [^114X7tTq].

> But wait, what if this is noninfectious — let me keep mimics in mind. Acute toxin-mediated food poisoning, medication-induced diarrhea and nausea, inflammatory bowel disease flares, ischemic colitis in older or vasculopathic patients, and endocrine disorders like hyperthyroidism or adrenal insufficiency can present similarly; a careful medication and comorbidity review plus exam often distinguishes these quickly [^115tX9y8] [^116Jkipx].

> I should double-check indications before ordering stool tests. Fever or chills with diarrhea, bloody or mucoid stools, severe abdominal pain or sepsis indicators, prolonged symptoms, immunocompromise, or outbreak risk settings all justify stool microbiologic evaluation; similarly, those with high risk of transmitting disease warrant testing even if symptoms are evolving [^1147dqkc] [^114cLVtN] [^111rjrmC].

> Now, I will outline specific stool diagnostics, but let me verify sequencing. A multiplex NAAT or targeted culture approach for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and STEC is appropriate; for STEC specifically, ensure O157 culture and non-O157 Shiga toxin or genomic assays to identify hemolytic-uremic risk organisms; test for C. difficile with a single diarrheal specimen when risk factors or persistent unexplained diarrhea are present; reserve Vibrio testing for rice-water stools, shellfish or brackish exposures, or travel to endemic regions; consider ova and parasite testing for persistent symptoms, travel, or immunocompromise; consider viral PCR panels in outbreaks; and add a COVID-19 test if epidemiology or symptoms warrant, while remembering that NAAT panels detect DNA that may not reflect viable organisms, requiring clinical correlation [^1147dqkc] [^1159NYzk] [^11119NUc] [^117SFMqP] [^1135EwHG] [^114X7tTq].

> I will now examine blood and basic labs to risk-stratify. CBC with differential for leukocytosis or leukopenia, electrolytes with BUN and creatinine for dehydration, and lactate if sepsis is suspected help guide disposition; inflammatory markers can support an inflammatory process but normal values do not exclude invasive disease, so I should interpret them cautiously [^11251zsX].

> Let me think about imaging and avoid overuse. CT abdomen and pelvis is generally not indicated in straightforward acute infectious gastroenteritis, but I should obtain imaging when IDSA red flags for Salmonella or Yersinia vascular complications are present, such as sustained fever or bacteremia despite treatment, underlying atherosclerosis, or new chest, back, or abdominal pain suggesting extraintestinal foci [^112cYGev].

> Hold on, I should verify tests to avoid. Routine blood cultures are low yield unless sepsis is suspected, and endoscopy is typically reserved for persistent symptoms with negative stool evaluation or when an alternative diagnosis like IBD is suspected, limiting unnecessary procedures in self-limited disease [^114cLVtN] [^1147dqkc].

> Rehydration is the cornerstone — let me confirm the hierarchy. Oral rehydration solution is first-line for mild to moderate dehydration across ages; IV crystalloid is indicated if severe dehydration, ongoing emesis precludes oral intake, or if hypotension or sepsis is present; small, frequent intake and early feeding as tolerated are appropriate, and these principles remain true for viral gastroenteritis, where therapy is largely supportive [^1132ywqx] [^116UtX9W].

> For symptoms, I need to check what is safe and effective. In adults with acute nausea, short-course serotonin antagonists such as ondansetron or dopamine antagonists like metoclopramide are appropriate; wait, let me verify pediatrics — yes, a single dose of ondansetron reduces vomiting and facilitates oral rehydration in children; in pregnancy, first-line therapy is pyridoxine with or without doxylamine, and I should avoid agents contraindicated in pregnancy; for diarrhea, I should avoid antimotility agents like loperamide when fever, chills, or blood is present because of risk of worsening invasive infection, while bismuth subsalicylate can be considered cautiously in nonpregnant adults without aspirin allergy [^115tX9y8] [^115TaTXr] [^113zxaGF] [^11251zsX].

> I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship while protecting high-risk patients. IDSA discourages routine empiric antibiotics for acute watery diarrhea; empiric therapy can be considered for febrile patients with systemic toxicity, dysentery suggestive of Shigella or other invasive pathogens, severe illness requiring admission, immunocompromise, or moderate-severe traveler's diarrhea, with azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone depending on local resistance and exposure history; critically, antibiotics are contraindicated in suspected STEC because of HUS risk, so I should withhold therapy until STEC is excluded if there is bloody diarrhea or epidemiologic clues [^1147dqkc] [^116Jkipx] [^1114Yef4] [^1159NYzk].

> COVID-19 remains in the differential for GI-dominant illness with chills. Supportive care and isolation precautions are mainstay, and I should monitor for respiratory deterioration while recognizing GI symptoms can accompany or precede respiratory features of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^114X7tTq].

> If C. difficile is confirmed, I should verify first-line therapy. For an initial episode, oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is recommended, with close monitoring; for severe-complicated disease or deterioration despite appropriate therapy, adding IV agents such as tigecycline on a case-by-case basis is suggested by ESCMID, and I should reassess the diagnosis if a noncomplicated case fails to respond while not otherwise worsening [^111M9dEN] [^1143ytzm].

> Special populations require tailored thresholds, so let me reconsider risks. Immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, warrant broader stool testing for bacterial, viral, and parasitic etiologies and a lower threshold for imaging and admission; in pregnancy, avoid teratogenic antibiotics and bismuth, and favor pyridoxine-doxylamine for nausea; in children, dehydration risk is higher, so I should use ORS aggressively and admit if severe dehydration is present, with single-dose ondansetron facilitating rehydration [^1152cwfm] [^113zxaGF] [^1132ywqx] [^115TaTXr].

> I should double-check monitoring and follow-up. Mild cases should improve within 48–72 hours on supportive care; lack of improvement by day 3–5 should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis, repeat or expanded stool testing, and potential imaging; immediate escalation is warranted for inability to maintain hydration, bloody or black stools, severe or worsening abdominal pain, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability, consistent with IDSA red flags [^1147dqkc].

> Lastly, I need to address public health and infection control. Suspected foodborne outbreaks should be reported to local health authorities, contact precautions are essential for C. difficile in healthcare settings, and norovirus prevention requires strict hand hygiene and environmental disinfection with bleach given poor efficacy of alcohol-based sanitizers against norovirus, with testing and control measures emphasized in outbreak-prone settings [^111rjrmC] [^115AD1jk].

> In summary, I should confirm that chills with diarrhea qualify for stool testing, prioritize rehydration, use antiemetics and antidiarrheals selectively and safely, reserve antibiotics for well-defined indications while excluding STEC, consider C. difficile with recent antibiotics or persistent diarrhea, include COVID-19 when epidemiologically relevant, tailor care in special populations, and reassess promptly if the course deviates from expected recovery trajectories, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-backed practice [^1147dqkc] [^1132ywqx] [^115tX9y8] [^1159NYzk] [^1152cwfm].

Nausea, chills, and diarrhea most often indicate **acute gastroenteritis** from viral or bacterial infection [^1147dqkc] [^116UtX9W], but can also signal serious conditions like C. difficile, COVID-19, or sepsis [^113iRdjj] [^114X7tTq]. Supportive care with oral rehydration and antiemetics is **first-line** [^1132ywqx] [^115tX9y8]; antibiotics are reserved for severe or high-risk cases [^114cLVtN] [^116Jkipx]. Obtain stool testing if symptoms are severe, prolonged, or have alarm features [^114cLVtN] [^1147dqkc], and escalate care for dehydration, shock, or immunocompromise [^11251zsX] [^1152cwfm].

---

## Common causes

- **Viral gastroenteritis**: Norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus [^116UtX9W].
- **Bacterial infections**: Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli, Vibrio, Yersinia [^1147dqkc].
- **Clostridioides difficile**: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^113iRdjj].
- **COVID-19**: GI symptoms including nausea, diarrhea, chills [^114X7tTq].
- **Foodborne illness**: Contaminated food or water [^114hNJNH].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical history and physical examination

History should address onset, duration, recent travel, food intake, antibiotic use, comorbidities, and immunocompromise; the **exam** should assess dehydration, abdominal tenderness, fever, rash, and neurologic deficits [^11251zsX] [^1147dqkc].

---

### Laboratory tests

CBC, electrolytes, and renal function tests help gauge severity and detect complications. Stool testing is indicated for **severe or prolonged (> 7 days) illness** [^114cLVtN], **bloody diarrhea** [^1147dqkc], or in **immunocompromised patients** [^1152cwfm]. C. difficile testing is warranted with recent antibiotic use or healthcare exposure [^113iRdjj], and COVID-19 testing is appropriate when COVID-19 is suspected [^114X7tTq].

---

### Imaging

Imaging with abdominal ultrasound or CT is indicated for **severe pain, suspected obstruction, or complications** [^11251zsX].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Supportive care

Oral rehydration therapy is **first-line** for dehydration [^1132ywqx]. Antiemetics such as ondansetron can be used for significant nausea and vomiting [^115TaTXr] [^115tX9y8]. For non-bloody, afebrile diarrhea, antidiarrheals like loperamide may be considered [^1147dqkc].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

- **Empiric antibiotics**: for severe, invasive, or high-risk patients [^116Jkipx] [^1147dqkc].
- **C. difficile**: oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin.
- **Travelers' diarrhea**: rifaximin or azithromycin.

---

### Special considerations

Immunocompromised patients require a **broad differential and targeted therapy** [^1152cwfm], and in **pregnancy**, safe antiemetics and careful hydration are recommended [^113zxaGF] [^113mocJ4].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

- **Severe dehydration**: Unable to tolerate oral fluids [^11251zsX].
- **Shock or sepsis**: Hemodynamic instability [^114cLVtN].
- **Immunocompromised**: High risk of complications [^1152cwfm].
- **Failure of outpatient management**: Persistent or worsening symptoms.

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention relies on **hand hygiene** (frequent handwashing) [^115AD1jk] and safe food practices, including proper cooking and storage [^1132ywqx]. Rotavirus vaccination is recommended for infants [^116UtX9W], and exposure to contaminated water and high-risk foods should be avoided [^114hNJNH].

---

Nausea, chills, and diarrhea are most often due to infectious gastroenteritis; management is **primarily supportive**, with antibiotics for selected severe or high-risk cases. Prompt evaluation and **targeted testing** guide therapy and prevent complications [^1147dqkc].

### Evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults [^115tX9y8]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illnesses. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically managed symptomatically without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication.

Chronic nausea and vomiting, lasting 4 weeks or longer, have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities.

Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement, small frequent meals, and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting; however, chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. Medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest duration necessary.

### Evaluation and management of treatment-related diarrhea in patients with advanced cancer: A review [^111sZa6a]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2008). Low credibility.

Diarrhea is a common and significant problem among patients with advanced cancer. Treatment-induced diarrhea can be severe and associated with life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. The causes of diarrhea among patients with advanced cancer are diverse, and some require specific therapies. Thus, careful evaluation of the underlying cause is necessary. Palliative care clinicians, particularly those dealing with patients receiving ongoing disease-modifying therapies, must be familiar with the common causes of diarrhea among cancer patients and the strategies to evaluate and manage these common and distressing symptoms.

This article addresses four major issues:

- **Review of causes**: A review of the causes of treatment-related diarrhea, focusing on diarrhea caused by chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and radiotherapy.
- **Differential diagnosis and evaluation approach**: Differential diagnosis and an approach to evaluation.

### Xifaxan [^111vwMv9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Persistent diarrhea: For patients being treated for travelers' diarrhea, discontinue Xifaxan if diarrhea persists more than 24 to 48 hours or worsens. Advise the patient to seek medical care if they experience fever and/or blood in the stool [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea**: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Xifaxan, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon, which may lead to C. difficile. Patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If diarrhea occurs after therapy or does not improve or worsens during therapy, advise patients to contact a physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Administration with food**: Inform patients that Xifaxan may be taken with or without food.

- **Antibacterial resistance**: Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs, including Xifaxan, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When Xifaxan is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment.

### Case report: COVID-19 masquerading as an acute surgical abdomen [^1172wPH7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can present with various clinical features, among which gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and mild abdominal pain have been reported. Recognition of rare presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection has increased over time. These atypical and rare presentations may lead to difficulties in establishing the diagnosis in a timely manner; furthermore, they may lead to unnecessary investigations, extended hospital stays, adverse outcomes, and more strain on healthcare resources.

We present three cases admitted to our hospital with a picture that mimicked an acute abdomen, necessitating surgical assessment and evaluation. All cases turned out to be SARS-CoV-2 positive and did not require surgical management. We discuss the management course, highlight the importance of abdominal symptoms in the setting of COVID-19, and discuss the implications of this association for medical practice amid the pandemic in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings.

### Diagnosis and treatments [^115w4AKC]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and is increasingly present in the community. Historically, C difficile infection was considered easy to diagnose and treat. Over the past two decades, however, diagnostic techniques have changed in line with a greater understanding of the physiopathology of C difficile infection and the use of new therapeutic molecules.

The evolution of diagnosis showed there was an important under- and misdiagnosis of C difficile infection, emphasizing the importance of algorithms recommended by European and North American infectious diseases societies to obtain a reliable diagnosis. Previously, metronidazole was considered the reference drug to treat C difficile infection, but more recently vancomycin and other newer drugs are shown to have higher cure rates.

Recurrence of infection represents a key parameter in the evaluation of new drugs, and the challenge is to target the right population with the adapted therapeutic molecule. In cases of multiple recurrences, fecal microbiota transplantation is recommended. New approaches, including antibodies, vaccines, and new molecules, are already available or in the pipeline, but more data are needed to support the inclusion of these in practice guidelines.

This review aims to provide a baseline for clinicians to understand and stratify their choice in the diagnosis and treatment of C difficile infection based on the most recent data available.

### Prenatal diagnosis of megaduodenum using ultrasound: a case report [^111gzTCp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with megaduodenum often present with abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition, and dystrophia. Because this case was diagnosed before birth, the child was kept fasting immediately after birth, and she had no other clinical manifestations except abdominal distension. The earliest reported case of megaduodenum was discovered in a 3-month-old infant; the clinical symptoms included failure to gain weight, an abdominal mass, nausea, and vomiting. That child was followed up for 3 years after surgery, gained adequate weight, and was able to lead a healthy life.

Megaduodenum is mainly treated by surgery. The tension-free duodenal wall should be completely removed to prevent postoperative functional anastomotic obstruction. For megaduodenum secondary to other diseases, the primary disease must be addressed first. In our case, extreme dilation of the duodenum was caused by a defect in the development of the nerve plexus, and radical duodenectomy was performed. Three months after surgery, the child was in good health. Further follow-up is required to determine the long-term prognosis.

In conclusion, although congenital megaduodenum is rare, it should be considered as part of the differential diagnoses of fetal abdominal cystic masses. In particular, if a giant cystic mass communicating with the stomach is detected on ultrasonography, the prenatal diagnosis of congenital megaduodenum should be considered.

### Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association [^112PuJ28]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is characterized by intermittent episodes of severe nausea and vomiting, which occur between symptom-free intervals. Nonetheless, patients may experience inter-episodic nausea or dyspepsia and may not be entirely asymptomatic between episodes. This characteristic of adult CVS was recognized in the updated Rome IV criteria. The expert committee currently endorses the Rome IV diagnostic criteria for CVS, although these criteria's sensitivity and specificity have not undergone rigorous evaluation. Additionally, chronic cannabis use within CVS has led to the new diagnosis of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), discussed separately in this special supplement.

- **Phases of cyclic vomiting syndrome**:
	- **There are four phases of CVS**: prodromal phase, vomiting phase, recovery, and asymptomatic or inter-episodic phase. During the prodromal phase, patients experience intense nausea, often accompanied by panic symptoms. Autonomic symptoms, such as diarrhea, cold and hot flashes, and profuse sweating, may also occur. This phase is followed by the acute emetic phase, during which patients endure severe vomiting and retching. Vomiting can be relentless, ranging from 1 to 6 episodes per hour, and retching often persists even after the stomach is completely emptied. Up to 70% of adults with CVS may suffer from abdominal pain. They may also experience restlessness and intense thirst, which can lead to extreme "drinking and guzzling" behavior.

### Acute abdominal pain in children [^115iWwmA]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for approximately 9% of childhood primary care office visits. Symptoms and signs that increase the likelihood of a surgical cause for pain include fever, bilious vomiting, bloody diarrhea, absent bowel sounds, voluntary guarding, rigidity, and rebound tenderness. The age of the child can help focus the differential diagnosis.

- **In infants and toddlers**: Clinicians should consider congenital anomalies and other causes, including malrotation, hernias, Meckel diverticulum, or intussusception.
- **In school-aged children**: Constipation and infectious causes of pain, such as gastroenteritis, colitis, respiratory infections, and urinary tract infections, are more common.
- **In female adolescents**: Clinicians should consider pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion.

Initial laboratory tests include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test. Abdominal radiography can be used to diagnose constipation or obstruction. Ultrasonography is the initial choice in children for the diagnosis of cholecystitis, pancreatitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian or testicular torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy-related pathology, and appendicitis. Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgery, with a peak incidence during adolescence. When the appendix is not clearly visible on ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

### Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms in Northern Italy: A single-center cohort study [^112ZrF4R]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The most typical presentation of COVID-19 is an acute respiratory syndrome, with the most common symptoms including fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and nausea/vomiting, are increasingly reported in patients affected by COVID-19. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and time of onset of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients affected by COVID-19 and to find potential associations between gastrointestinal symptoms and clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective single-center cohort study, enrolling patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 at our institution between March 23, 2020, and April 5, 2020. We collected patient demographics and medical history, laboratory data, and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we used a specifically designed questionnaire, administered to patients at the time of diagnosis, to obtain data on the presence and time of onset of fever, typical respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and other symptoms (fatigue, headache, myalgia/arthralgia, anosmia, ageusia/dysgeusia, sore throat, and ocular symptoms).

- **Results**: In our cohort, 138 (69%) of 190 patients showed at least one gastrointestinal symptom at diagnosis; excluding hyporexia/anorexia, 93 patients (48.9%) showed at least one gastrointestinal symptom. Gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly diarrhea, were associated with lower mortality. At multivariate analysis, diarrhea was confirmed as an independent predictive factor for lower mortality.

- **Discussion**: Gastrointestinal symptoms are very frequent in patients with COVID-19.

### Foodborne illness [^114hNJNH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

While few patients with foodborne illness present with life-threatening symptoms, there are a number of foodborne infectious diseases and toxins that the emergency physician or other health care provider must consider in the evaluation of these patients. Given the frequency of international travel, as well as the risk associated with outbreaks of foodborne illness from commercial food sources, it is important to recognize various syndromes of foodborne illness, including those which may require specific evaluation and management strategies. This article reviews a number of the most common causes of foodborne illness, as well as several less common pathogens with the potential for causing significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly identified and treated.

### Differentiating acute food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome from its mimics: A comparison of clinical features and routine laboratory biomarkers [^115bRq5u]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is frequently misdiagnosed and subject to diagnostic delay. Profuse vomiting, the cardinal feature of acute FPIES, may occur in more common pediatric disorders, such as gastroenteritis and sepsis.

- **Objectives**: We sought to determine differentiating features at acute presentation between FPIES, gastroenteritis, and sepsis in young children presenting to an emergency department (ED) with profuse vomiting.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of children aged 6 months to 4 years with a diagnosis of acute FPIES who had presented to ED and compared the clinical features, vital signs, and routine laboratory studies of this cohort to similarly aged children presenting to ED with vomiting diagnosed with bacterial/viral gastroenteritis or bacterial sepsis.

- **Results**: A total of 181 acute FPIES ED presentations were compared with 55 gastroenteritis and 36 bacterial sepsis ED presentations. Children with FPIES were more likely to present with lethargy, floppiness, and pallor. Compared with children with FPIES, children with sepsis were likely to present with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and diarrhea, whereas those with gastroenteritis were likely to present with fever, diarrhea, and blood in stools. Normal C-reactive protein (CRP), leucocytosis, lymphocytosis, thrombocytosis, low MPV, and an elevated albumin/globulin ratio were more commonly seen in FPIES than in sepsis or gastroenteritis. No other clinical or laboratory markers examined reliably distinguished between the three disease groups.

- **Conclusion**: The study underscores the importance of recognizing specific clinical features and routine laboratory biomarkers to differentiate FPIES from its mimics promptly.

### The transport of ciguatoxin: A case report [^117BFD4U]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Ciguatera fish poisoning has been responsible for as many as half of all food poisonings in the United States due to fish. The initial symptoms often include gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. As a result, patients may be discharged from the Emergency Department with a diagnosis of "acute gastroenteritis", only to return soon thereafter. This is a case report of such a patient who was evaluated and discharged, only to subsequently return because of worsening symptoms.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^112e39aT]. American Family Physician (2007). High credibility.

Nausea can be caused by a wide range of conditions and factors. Possible causes include cerebral neoplasm, hypercalcemia, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, and legionellosis. Additional conditions such as gastroparesis, salmonellosis, viral gastroenteritis, food poisoning, and emotional stress also contribute to nausea. Other potential causes are vertebro-basilar artery syndrome, paraneoplastic syndrome, cyclic vomiting syndrome, carcinoid syndrome, and autonomic seizures. Labyrinthitis, paralytic ileus, rumination syndrome, vestibular neuronitis, and myocardial infarction are additional possibilities. Furthermore, gangrene, colon cancer, esophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, and small bowel lymphoma can lead to nausea.

Additional causes include hyperemesis gravidarum, bulimia nervosa, acute angle-closure glaucoma, femoral hernia, colonic volvulus, small bowel intussusception, intracranial abscess, and ascariasis. Infections such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus, hepatitis A virus infection, acute altitude illness, intracranial hypertension, and influenza virus infection could also be responsible.

Other conditions such as achalasia, acquired pyloric stenosis, yellow fever, typhoid fever, small bowel obstruction, pharyngeal pouch, obturator hernia, large bowel obstruction, gallstone disease, and bowel strangulation can cause nausea. Additionally, motion sickness, basilar artery migraine, migraine, intracranial hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, and diabetic ketoacidosis are known to contribute to nausea symptoms. Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, Meniere's disease, and gastroenteritis are also significant causes, as well as hematemesis and gastric cancer.

Furthermore, certain medications are known to induce nausea. These include vortioxetine, verapamil, valproic acid, tranexamic acid, tigecycline, tazemetostat, talazoparib, selegiline, ropinirole, riluzole, quinine, quinidine ER, and procarbazine. Other medications like procainamide, phentolamine, omeprazole DR, nystatin, misoprostol, metformin ER, and meropenem are also associated with nausea.

**Warnings and precautions**: Before starting Mytesi, it is crucial to rule out infectious etiologies of diarrhea. If infectious causes are not considered, and Mytesi is initiated based on a presumptive diagnosis of non-infectious diarrhea, there is a risk that patients with infectious etiologies will not receive the appropriate treatments, and their disease may worsen. Mytesi is not indicated for the treatment of infectious diarrhea. Consider infectious etiologies before starting treatment to reduce the risk of inappropriate therapy and worsening disease.

### Understanding the gastrointestinal manifestations of Fabry disease: Promoting prompt diagnosis [^116E4Ppf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disease characterized by dysfunction in multiple systems, including significant gastrointestinal involvement, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, early satiety, and nausea. The gastrointestinal symptoms of Fabry disease are thought to result from neuropathic and myopathic changes leading to symptoms of dysmotility, which are encountered in many other disorders. These symptoms can often be among the presenting signs of the disease in childhood but can be misdiagnosed by gastroenterologists for many years due to their nonspecific presentation. As the primary treatment for Fabry disease is enzyme-replacement therapy, which has been shown to stabilize and possibly reverse the disease course, recognizing these symptoms and achieving early diagnosis to prevent progression with treatment is critical.

### Is irritable bowel syndrome more common in patients presenting with bacterial gastroenteritis? A community-based, case-control study [^112ffHY7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been reported to follow infectious diarrhea. Food-borne infections affect 76 million people in the United States and 9.4 million in England per year. Of these, only a small percentage of patients see their doctor, and even fewer will have stool culture confirmation. We hypothesized that patients who present to their doctor with gastroenteritis and have positive stool samples may differ from the normal population regarding their pre-existing bowel symptoms. Our aim was to determine if patients with bacterial gastroenteritis were more likely to have prior IBS, functional dyspepsia, or functional diarrhea compared to a control population.

Between January 2000 and January 2001, subjects with stool-positive bacterial gastroenteritis and control subjects from the same primary care practice were invited to participate. The main outcome measure was the presence of IBS, functional dyspepsia, or functional diarrhea, diagnosed using self-report Rome II modular questionnaires.

A total of 217 people with recent bacterial gastroenteritis and 265 community controls consented to participate in the study. Of these, 89 out of 217 cases and 46 out of 265 controls had one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (OR = 3.3; 95% CI = 2.17–5.00). IBS was present in 67 cases (31%) and 26 controls (10%) (OR = 4.1; 95% CI = 2.49–6.72). There was no statistically significant difference in the presence of prior functional dyspepsia or functional diarrhea.

IBS is more frequent before diagnosis in people with bacterial gastroenteritis compared to those without such a history.

### Clinical recognition and diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection [^116euxuc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Prompt and precise diagnosis is an important aspect of effective management of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI causes 15%-25% of all cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the severity of which ranges from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis. Several factors, especially advanced age and hospitalization, should be considered in the diagnosis of CDI. In particular, nosocomial diarrhea arising more than 72 hours after admission among patients receiving antibiotics is highly likely to have resulted from CDI. Testing of stool for the presence of C. difficile toxin confirms the diagnosis of CDI.

However, performance of an enzyme immunoassay is the usual method by which CDI is confirmed, but this test appears to be relatively insensitive compared with the cell cytotoxicity assay and stool culture for toxigenic C. difficile on selective medium. Endoscopy and computed tomography are less sensitive than stool toxin assays but may be useful when immediate results are important or other confounding conditions rank high in the differential diagnosis. Often overlooked aspects of this diagnosis are high white blood cell counts (which are sometimes in the leukemoid range) and hypoalbuminemia.

### Vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and gastroenteritis [^111SjUVz]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Diseases that cause vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and gastroenteritis are major problems for populations worldwide. Patients, particularly infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, may present at any point within a wide spectrum of disease states. This underscores the need for clinicians to treat these ailments aggressively. Over the past decade, several promising new treatment modalities have been introduced, ranging from oral rehydration solutions to antiemetic therapies. Future directions involve the use of probiotic agents and better-tolerated rehydration solutions. Gastrointestinal disease will continue to be a global focus in the ongoing search for improved methods to cure illnesses associated with vomiting and diarrhea.

### Beyond discovering the viral agents of acute gastroenteritis [^111wUN1C]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In the field of enteric microbiology, every major advance in diagnostics has enhanced our understanding of the etiology of gastroenteritis, the role of each pathogen, the different modes of transmission, and control methods that should be considered. Before 1970, more than 80% of gastroenteritis episodes did not have an etiologic diagnosis; these cases were attributed to weaning, malnutrition, or, most often, idiopathic causes. Then, in 1972, electron microscopists began to examine fecal specimens from patients with acute gastroenteritis, and within a decade, a collection of novel enteric viruses had been discovered: Norwalk virus (noroviruses), rotaviruses, astroviruses, enteric adenoviruses, classic human caliciviruses (sapoviruses), and others. Together, these novel viruses explained most of the severe cases of diarrhea in children and most of the acute outbreaks of disease occurring in the industrialized world.

For rotavirus, research progressed, and simple, sensitive, and inexpensive immunoassays soon displaced electron microscopy as the diagnostic test of choice available in laboratories around the world. On the basis of assay results, rotavirus was determined to be the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children worldwide. By contrast, the other enteric viruses, which are shed in lower quantities, could not be grown in culture and could not initially be detected by simple immunoassays. Consequently, for two decades, electron microscopy remained the main diagnostic tool available in a few research laboratories worldwide. A key breakthrough came around 1990 when the first…

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^116YLzzu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The primary clinical assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can largely be conducted in the primary care setting. The significance of thorough history taking and examination cannot be overstated.

- **Initial presentation in primary care**: In most countries with a divided primary/secondary care system, patients' initial consultations occur with a primary care physician. Approximately 10% of all consultations in primary care concern gastroenterological issues, with half of these related to lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most are self-limiting symptoms or functional GI disorders. A minimal proportion involves chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Chronic diarrhoea is defined as the abnormal passage of three or more loose stools per day for more than four weeks. Annually, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1,700 patients may encounter 50 to 85 patients with chronic diarrhoea. However, not all seek medical help; many self-manage with pharmacy solutions, and others receive care within primary care settings, often with antidiarrhoeals.

Data on referrals to secondary care are unavailable, though these likely represent a minority of total cases within the community. First-line investigations are typically performed in primary care. Referrals to secondary care are considered if the condition interferes significantly with normal activities or quality of life, warranting further action. As with other conditions, many patients manage symptoms independently.

### Multiple myeloma presenting as acute pancreatitis [^116qtKXf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A 36-year-old male presented to the emergency department with severe epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting without hematemesis, diarrhea, and anorexia. He was in respiratory distress, shock, and had a fever upon arrival. Subsequently, he was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit, diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, hypercalcemia, elevated amylase and lipase levels, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed lytic bone lesions in the spine and pancreatic necrosis. Further evaluation confirmed multiple myeloma through a bone marrow biopsy.

Multiple myeloma is typically seen in patients over 60 years of age. The usual presentation includes anemia, back pain, and an elevated sedimentation rate. Although patients with multiple myeloma often have hypercalcemia, it is rarely manifested as acute pancreatitis. This case highlights a rare presentation of multiple myeloma as acute pancreatitis in a younger adult.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms among ambulatory HIV patients: Appropriate symptom management requires improved symptom recognition [^1165xoSa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are among the most frequent complaints in patients with HIV disease. Before combination antiretroviral therapy, it was suggested that 50–93% of all patients with HIV had marked GI symptoms during the course of their illness. Inflammatory changes, direct mucosal invasion of the GI tract by HIV, opportunistic infections, and neoplasms are well-recognized causative factors. GI manifestations of HIV disease may be debilitating and include anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal pain, anorectal disease, GI bleeding, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and GI tumors. Progressive immunosuppression is associated with an increasing prevalence of GI symptoms, and thus, the evaluation of specific GI complaints must be based on an assessment of the degree of immunosuppression. However, antiretroviral therapy may change the nature of HIV disease and can lead to improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms for patients with advanced immunosuppression.

Appropriate symptom management requires improved symptom recognition and should be an essential component of patient care at all stages of any disease worldwide. However, limited data exist regarding the incidence of various GI manifestations in HIV-infected patients in certain areas of the world, including the Caribbean. The paper by Thompson et al. in this issue of Annals of Gastroenterology investigated the prevalence of common GI symptoms in the ambulatory Jamaican HIV-infected population compared to those seen in a healthy population of blood donors not known to have HIV.

### Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Clostridium difficile infections [^116BowSi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of hospital-associated gastrointestinal illness and places a high burden on our healthcare system. Patients with CDI typically experience extended lengths of stay in hospitals, and CDI frequently causes large hospital outbreaks. This guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI as well as for the prevention and control of outbreaks while supplementing previously published guidelines. New molecular diagnostic stool tests will likely replace enzyme immunoassay tests.

We suggest treatment of patients be stratified depending on whether they have mild-to-moderate, severe, or complicated disease. Therapy with metronidazole remains the choice for mild-to-moderate disease but may not be adequate for patients with severe or complicated disease. We propose a classification of disease severity to guide therapy that is useful for clinicians. We review treatment options for patients with recurring CDI and provide recommendations for the control and prevention of outbreaks of CDI.

### Diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage: What you need to know [^112rKvE9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common cause for hospital admission that requires prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary management to optimize clinical outcomes. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) includes both upper and lower GI tract sources with an extensive list of differential pathologies. This review provides a systematic approach to both upper and lower GIB management, emphasizing initial resuscitation, stabilization, diagnostic evaluation to identify the source, and treatment modalities. Endoscopy remains the cornerstone for diagnostic and interventional purposes, significantly reducing the need for surgical procedures. However, lower GIB and severe or refractory cases may necessitate additional imaging and interventions, including surgical management. Integrating clinical guidelines, evidence-based strategies, and individualized care, this review delineates what you need to know to diagnose and manage acute GI hemorrhage.

### Viral gastroenteritis [^116UtX9W]. Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of norovirus in 1972 as a cause of what was contemporarily known as acute infectious non-bacterial gastroenteritis, scientific understanding of viral gastroenteritides has continued to evolve. It is now recognized that a small number of viruses are the predominant cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, in both high-income and low-income settings. Although treatment is still largely restricted to the replacement of fluid and electrolytes, improved diagnostics have allowed attribution of illness, enabling both targeted treatment of individual patients and prioritization of interventions for populations worldwide.

Questions remain regarding specific genetic and immunological factors underlying host susceptibility and the optimal clinical management of patients who are susceptible to severe or prolonged manifestations of the disease. Meanwhile, the worldwide implementation of rotavirus vaccines has led to substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality and spurred interest in vaccine development to diminish the impact of the most prevalent viruses that are implicated in this syndrome.

### Implementation and outcomes of a pharmacist-led collaborative drug therapy management program for oncology symptom management [^113fgLB5]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea are common adverse effects of cancer and cancer therapy. Pharmacists are uniquely positioned to optimize patient symptom control and minimize excess use of hospital resources, such as emergency department visits.

- **Methods**: Michigan Medicine oncology clinical pharmacists have been independently providing patient symptom management through a collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM) program. This program established guidelines for managing gastrointestinal toxicities (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or constipation) secondary to a patient's cancer diagnosis or cancer treatment. Patients were referred to the pharmacist by their treating oncologist or hematologist.

- **Results**: From June 2019 to May 2020, there were a total of 62 patient referrals. Ten of these referrals did not meet the CDTM inclusion criteria, resulting in 52 patients who were managed by the pharmacists. The total number of individual pharmacist visits was 136, with a median of 2.2 visits per patient referred (range, 0–11). A total of 169 categorized pharmacist interventions were recorded. Most interventions (100/169, 59.2%) were related to nausea and vomiting. Diarrhea-related and constipation-related interventions accounted for 10 (5.9%) and 13 (7.7%) of the total interventions, respectively. Most patients (36/52, 69.2%) experienced a reduction in the severity of their referral diagnosis symptoms, based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading.

### Foodborne illness acquired in the United States — unspecified agents [^113mWXZ2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Estimating the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by unspecified foodborne agents is challenging. For an illness caused by a pathogen to be recorded, a physician must order the appropriate diagnostic tests, and the pathogen must be detected. Without identification of a pathogen, infections producing signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis may be coded as nonspecific signs or symptoms or as noninfectious illnesses. Our overall estimates of hospitalizations and deaths from acute gastroenteritis, derived from national data sources, include codes for infectious and noninfectious gastroenteritis.

- **Estimation methodology**: To avoid overestimating the number of hospitalizations, we selected outpatient visits resulting in hospitalization and hospital discharge records based on only the first three listed diagnoses. This approach was a compromise between limiting the analysis to hospitalizations where acute gastroenteritis was listed as the primary cause and including hospitalizations where signs or symptoms of gastroenteritis may have been a manifestation of another illness. This approach has been used in other studies.

- **Mortality records**: For deaths, we included all records in which acute gastroenteritis was listed as an underlying or a contributing cause.

### Construct validity of the pediatric Rome III criteria [^111pMCkC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common, and their diagnosis is based on the Rome criteria, a symptom-based diagnostic classification established by expert consensus. There is little evidence of validity for the pediatric Rome III criteria. The construct validity, an overarching term that incorporates other forms of validity, has never been assessed. This study assessed the construct validity of the Rome III criteria.

Children from two schools in Colombia completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms at baseline. They also completed weekly questionnaires of somatic symptoms and disability for 8 weeks, which assessed the presence and intensity of gastrointestinal symptoms, nongastrointestinal symptoms, and the impact on daily activities. A total of 255 children completed at least 6 weekly surveys, totaling 2041 surveys.

At baseline, 27.8% of children were diagnosed as having an FGID. The prevalence of nausea (Δ 7.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.46–11.14), constipation (Δ 4.39%, 95% CI 1.79–6.99), diarrhea (Δ 6.69%, 95% CI 3.25–10.13), headache (Δ 7.4%, 95% CI 3.51–11.09), chest pain (Δ 9.04%, 95% CI 5.20–12.88), and limb pain (Δ 4.07%, 95% CI 1.76–6.37) were higher in children with FGIDs (P < 0.001). Similarly, the intensity of nausea (Δ 0.23, 95% CI 0.127–0.333), diarrhea (Δ 0.30, 95% CI 0.211–0.389), abdominal pain (Δ 0.18, 95% CI 0.069–0.291), headache (Δ 0.17, 95% CI 0.091–0.249), and limb pain (Δ 0.30, 95% CI 0.084–0.516) was greater in these children. Children with FGIDs experienced greater interference with daily activities (P < 0.001).

### What is the current role of algorithmic approaches for diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection [^1173psYS]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

With the recognition of several serious outbreaks of Clostridium difficile infection in the industrialized world, coupled with the development of new testing technologies for detection of this organism, there has been renewed interest in the laboratory diagnosis of C. difficile infection. Two factors seem to have driven much of this interest:

- **Recognition of immunoassay limitations**: The recognition that immunoassays for detection of C. difficile toxins A and B, which for many years were the most widely used tests for C. difficile infection diagnosis, were perhaps not as sensitive as previously believed at a time when attributed deaths to C. difficile infections were showing a remarkable rise.

- **Availability of PCR assays**: The availability of FDA-approved commercial and laboratory-developed PCR assays, which could detect toxigenic strains of C. difficile, provided a novel and promising testing approach for diagnosing this infection.

In this point-counterpoint on the laboratory diagnosis of C. difficile infection, we have asked two experts in C. difficile infection diagnosis, Ferric Fang, who has recently published two articles in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology advocating the use of PCR as a standalone test [see this author's references 12 and 28], and Mark Wilcox, who played a key role in developing the IDSA/SHEA guidelines on Clostridium difficile infection [see Wilcox and Planche's reference 1], along with his colleague, Tim Planche, to address the following question: What is the role of algorithmic approaches to the diagnosis of C. difficile infection?

### Differential diagnosis of diarrhea in patients with neuroendocrine tumors [^115tPCnW]. Pancreas (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinoid syndrome often experience diarrhea, which can significantly impact their quality of life. Diarrhea may also occur in response to other hormonal syndromes associated with NETs, surgical complications, medical comorbidities, medications, or food sensitivities. The limited guidance on the practical approach to the differential diagnosis of diarrhea in these patients can delay appropriate treatment. This clinical review and commentary highlight the complexity in identifying the etiology of diarrhea in patients with NETs. Based on our collective experience and expertise, we propose a practical algorithm to guide medical oncologists and other care providers to expedite effective management of diarrhea and related symptoms in patients with NETs.

### Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in a 9-year-old girl [^116xMG4x]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Cryptosporidiosis is reported in an otherwise healthy child who had a history significant for playing in natural waters during a camping trip one week prior. Several days later, she began improving despite an incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Nitazoxanide was administered once the diagnosis was established. Obtaining a thorough patient history, administering appropriate antibiotics, and counseling patients on preventive measures are critical steps in treating and managing the transmission of this parasite.

- **Diagnosis and treatment**: The case emphasizes the value of stool ova and parasite examination for proper diagnosis of pediatric diarrheal illness in the emergency setting. In addition, the often overlooked diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is reviewed as an important cause of diarrheal illness in the immunocompetent pediatric population.

### Norovirus illnesses in children and adolescents [^115AD1jk]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Norovirus is a leading cause of childhood vomiting and diarrhea in the United States and globally. Although most illnesses caused by norovirus are self-resolving, severe outcomes may occur from dehydration, including hospitalization and death. A vast majority of deaths from norovirus occur in developing countries. Immunocompromised children are at risk for more severe outcomes. Treatment of norovirus illness focuses on early correction of dehydration and maintenance of fluid status and nutrition. Hand hygiene, exclusion of ill individuals, and environmental cleaning are important for norovirus outbreak prevention and control. Vaccines to prevent norovirus illness are currently under development.

### Chronic diarrhea: Diagnosis and management [^113uFvCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; four weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea.

Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency according to the Rome criteria. Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some cases. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected based on history alone.

Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or when the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more tailored treatment strategies.

### Outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis: What's new in 2004 [^112NgJ6o]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Descriptions of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis have become a prominent feature in scientific journals and other media such as the electronic reporting service 'ProMED'. A review of outbreak reports was conducted to further our understanding of the burden of disease, common and rare modes of transmission, complications, and possibilities for control and prevention.

Viral gastroenteritis outbreaks occur worldwide. In 2004, aside from outbreak reports and surveys, considerable attention was paid to food and waterborne outbreaks and the challenges in proving these modes of transmission. The costs of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks are high. Complications and unusual manifestations, such as convulsions, transplant rejection, and chronic infection, may have been underreported.

Viral gastroenteritis is a very common illness in health care settings that can cause significant disruption. Clinicians working in these settings should be familiar with the epidemiology and the possible modes of transmission of enteric viruses to translate them into strategies for prevention or intervention. Research is needed to support these strategies.

### Therapy of acute gastroenteritis: role of antibiotics [^1114Yef4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Acute infectious diarrhoea remains a common health problem, even in the industrialized world. One of the dilemmas in assessing patients with acute diarrhoea is deciding when to test for aetiological agents and when to initiate antimicrobial therapy. The management and therapy of acute gastroenteritis is discussed in two epidemiological settings: community-acquired diarrhoea and travellers' diarrhoea.

Antibiotic therapy is not required in most patients with acute gastroenteritis, as the illness is usually self-limiting. Antimicrobial therapy can lead to adverse events, and unnecessary treatments contribute to resistance development. Nonetheless, empirical antimicrobial therapy can be necessary in certain situations, such as in patients with febrile diarrhoeal illness with fever and bloody diarrhoea, symptoms persisting for more than one week, or in those with immunocompromised status.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms predict the outcomes from COVID-19 infection [^1112HxdZ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has taken hundreds of thousands of lives globally. Besides impacting the respiratory tract, the virus can affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Data regarding the significance of GI symptoms in the COVID-19 course are limited. In this largest US study at the time of writing, the authors reviewed electronic encounters of 1,003 consecutive patients who tested positive for the virus between March 12 and April 3, 2020. Initial GI symptoms were present in up to 22.4% of patients and were associated with worse outcomes after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and other clinical symptoms. COVID-19 with GI involvement may define a more severe phenotype.

### Ery [^113U6xFR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.

Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is one primary cause of "antibiotic-associated colitis".

After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against C. difficile colitis.

### Pediatric Clostridioides difficile infection: Diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship [^111fcBXn]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Low credibility.

Although the pathogenesis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is complex and incompletely understood, it is believed that the elaboration of C. difficile toxins is necessary for disease. There are a variety of tests available for the detection of both the C. difficile organism and its toxins; however, each has limitations and the best application of these tests to the diagnosis of CDI in children remains uncertain. Nucleic acid amplification tests are unable to reliably discriminate between CDI and C. difficile colonization, while commercially available enzyme immunoassays for toxin detection lack sensitivity. An understanding of preanalytic factors, relevant patient features, and test performance characteristics is essential to the accurate diagnosis of CDI in children. Specific diagnostic stewardship strategies can also increase the likelihood that positive tests reflect disease rather than colonization. Ultimately, CDI remains a clinical diagnosis and clinical judgment is essential when interpreting test results, regardless of the methods used.

### Rapid advances in understanding viral gastroenteritis from domestic surveillance [^113boS9i]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

"Winter vomiting disease" was the clinical moniker for viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE), including illnesses caused by norovirus and rotavirus, nearly 100 years ago. This nonspecific diagnosis represented a frequently observed illness, with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea occurring particularly in the colder months. One hundred years later, diagnosing specific AGE pathogens in clinical settings continues to be an elusive task. Clinical treatment options remain nonspecific, primarily involving rehydration and supportive therapies, and identifying the viral pathogens is still considered relatively time-consuming and costly.

Viral AGE has likely caused misery, illness, and death among human populations for thousands of years since people first facilitated disease transmission by congregating in groups. Notably, it has only been during the lifetime of many readers, beginning in the early 1970s, that norovirus, rotavirus, and an expanding collection of other viral AGE pathogens have been discovered. The advent of sensitive laboratory tools to detect and study the genetic evolution of these viruses has uncovered their critical role in the etiology of AGE. The flow of information is now so great that each year since 2008, more than 800 scientific papers have been published on this topic, as determined by a search of PubMed using the term acute gastroenteritis.

The field of viral gastroenteritis is in the midst of an extraordinary period of rapid development and transition. Vaccines to prevent rotavirus, the leading cause

### A 72-year-old man with a violaceous rash and sepsis [^114wYuyT]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old man presented to our emergency department less than 24 hours following the acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Within 12 hours of symptom onset, he noted bilateral lower extremity pain and swelling, which was associated with a new violaceous irregular rash on the anterior aspect of both feet and legs. There was no history of inciting trauma or recent wounds. Additionally, there was no history of consumption of raw or undercooked food, including seafood, or any recent change in food source. The patient experienced accompanying fever and chills for the same duration and painful swelling of his left thumb.

His comorbidities included stage IIIb classical Hodgkin lymphoma, diagnosed 4 months prior. His last dose of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine chemotherapy was administered 4 days before presentation. He had previously failed anti-CD30 monoclonal therapy due to attributed pancolitis.

### Are noroviruses emerging [^115FKnv4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Research on the disease prevalence of noroviruses is only beginning. If noroviruses are an increasingly common cause of infectious gastroenteritis, with some cases resulting in diarrhea-related deaths and hospitalizations, then substantially greater investments are required in their diagnosis. Increased use of diagnostics, along with improved surveillance, such as in sentinel sites, will permit identification of new strains and shifts in the epidemiology of norovirus disease. The development of easy-to-use, sensitive assays for use by clinical and public health laboratories should also have a high priority.

We do not know how to stop norovirus transmission. Foods can be contaminated with norovirus either at the source or at the point of service by infected food handlers. Noroviruses can spread by water, direct person-to-person contact, or airborne droplets of vomitus, and they can persist in the environment as a source of continuing infection despite efforts at disinfection. Recent advances in finding a cell culture system for noroviruses may allow for assessing the efficacy of various disinfectants. However, only through full epidemiologic investigation of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks and application of molecular tests will transmission routes be determined, differences in epidemiology between strains be detected, and targeted control measures implemented.

Norovirus infections are common and likely to become more so. Effective prevention strategies must now be designed and implemented.

### Probabilities in norovirus outbreak diagnosis [^1112zUTn]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Noroviruses are recognized as the most common cause of outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. Yet, diagnostic testing for norovirus is based mostly on RNA detection by RT-PCR, which is not widely available. While antigen detection tests (ELISAs) are easier to perform, they are generally less sensitive.

- **Objectives**: Our aim was to provide a scientific basis for declaring norovirus as the causative agent of an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis.

- **Study design**: Statistical analysis used binomial distribution to determine the minimal number of positive samples and the probability of detecting the required number of positive samples for different tests, necessary to assign norovirus as the causative agent of an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis.

- **Results**: For either a standard RT-PCR or a commercially available ELISA, finding only 1 sample positive out of 2, 3, or 4 samples is sufficient to assign norovirus as the causative agent of an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis. However, when ELISA is used, the probability of detecting this required minimum number of positive samples is low when small numbers of samples are tested (57% when 2 samples are tested; 72% when 3 samples are tested). To reach a 90% probability of detecting a norovirus outbreak (false negativity at outbreak level < 10%), at least 3 samples should be tested using RT-PCR, and 6 samples when using an ELISA.

- **Conclusions**: The sensitivity for NoV outbreak diagnosis will increase from 57% to 92%, or from 84% to 96%, for ELISA or RT-PCR respectively, when sample size increases from 2 to 6.
