## Question

In evaluating a patient for Crohn's disease the following impression was obtained from an EGD.

- Normal mucosa was found in the upper third of the esophagus and in the middle third of the esophagus. Biopsied.
- Large hiatal hernia.
- LA Grade B reflux esophagitis with no bleeding.
- Gastritis. Biopsied.
- Erosive gastropathy with stigmata of recent bleeding. Biopsied
- Normal second portion of the duodenum.

Is this indicative of Crohn's disease or not?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the EGD findings described are indicative of Crohn's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the endoscopic features that are classic for Crohn's disease in the upper GI tract. Then, I should verify how the reported findings map to those features. Next, I will consider alternative explanations for each finding, especially reflux and NSAID-related injury. After that, I need to check the role of histology, particularly granulomas and focally enhanced gastritis, and whether the biopsies were adequate. Finally, I should integrate guideline-based diagnostic criteria and outline what additional testing would be needed before concluding anything definitive.

> Let me first confirm the classic endoscopic features of upper GI Crohn's disease so I don't jump to conclusions. Typical findings include aphthae, linear or serpiginous ulcers, cobblestoning, nodularity, antral thickening, and duodenal strictures, with histology showing focal or discontinuous chronic inflammation, focal crypt irregularity, and non-caseating granulomas. Focally enhanced gastritis is also supportive in the right context [^1126BLpN] [^1133gNfz].

> Now, I will examine the reported EGD findings against those Crohn's features. Wait, let me verify each element: normal mucosa in the upper and middle esophagus argues against Crohn's esophagitis, which usually shows ulcers, strictures, or granulomas. LA Grade B reflux esophagitis is a GERD pattern, not a Crohn's pattern. A large hiatal hernia is a mechanical contributor to reflux. Gastritis and erosive gastropathy with stigmata of recent bleeding are nonspecific and commonly reflect NSAIDs, H. pylori, alcohol, or stress-related mucosal injury. And a normal second portion of the duodenum makes duodenal Crohn's unlikely here [^111xAriL] [^111ShjpY] [^1126BLpN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about gastritis meaning Crohn's. I need to ensure I'm not overinterpreting nonspecific inflammation. Gastritis and erosions are common in many settings, including NSAID use, H. pylori, alcohol, stress, and even ulcerative colitis; in fact, both UC and CD can show upper GI inflammation, so gastritis alone is not diagnostic of Crohn's disease, and the absence of aphthae, linear ulcers, cobblestoning, or strictures further lowers the likelihood of UGI Crohn's in this case [^1134Ymxr] [^116FQmku] [^1126BLpN].

> Next, I should review the role of histology, because endoscopic impressions can be misleading. I need to check whether the biopsies were sufficient and targeted. For suspected IBD, guidelines recommend at least two biopsies from esophagus, stomach, and duodenum; if granulomas are found, that strongly supports Crohn's, but they are present in only a minority of cases, and their absence does not exclude CD; focally enhanced gastritis can support CD but is not specific; thus, I should confirm that adequate sampling was done and await pathology before concluding anything definitive [^114Cypu7] [^1133gNfz] [^1126BLpN].

> But wait, what if the patient has isolated upper GI Crohn's without small bowel or colonic disease? I should double-check the prevalence and context. Upper GI Crohn's is uncommon in adults, typically seen in a small subset and usually in the setting of concomitant ileal or colonic disease; isolated upper GI CD without distal involvement is rare, so the pretest probability here is low unless there are specific endoscopic or histologic clues, which are not present in this report [^1126BLpN] [^112NJcTN].

> I will now examine the reflux findings more closely, because they offer a coherent alternative explanation. LA Grade B esophagitis, a large hiatal hernia, and erosive gastropathy fit a GERD/NSAID injury profile; reflux esophagitis is a chemical injury pattern distinct from the transmural, discontinuous, granulomatous inflammation of Crohn's, and the presence of a hiatal hernia mechanically predisposes to reflux, reinforcing GERD as the leading diagnosis for the esophageal findings [^111xAriL] [^111ShjpY].

> Let me consider the diagnostic framework so I don't overweigh a single endoscopy. Crohn's disease is a clinical–endoscopic–histologic–radiologic diagnosis; no single modality suffices. I should confirm that the patient has undergone ileocolonoscopy with ileal biopsies, obtain cross-sectional small-bowel imaging when indicated, and integrate symptoms, biomarkers, and histology before assigning a CD diagnosis; in the absence of typical CD features on EGD and with a clear GERD/NSAID explanation for the mucosal injury, CD is not supported by this EGD alone [^113gycZk] [^1179Ekcf] [^115qk3rK].

> Next, I should review what additional steps would clarify this. I need to ensure pathology is completed and that gastric biopsies were tested for H. pylori. I should confirm medication history for NSAIDs. If clinical suspicion for CD remains high despite a negative EGD, ileocolonoscopy with terminal ileum biopsies and dedicated small-bowel imaging (MRE/CTE or capsule endoscopy if no obstruction) are appropriate next steps. Fecal calprotectin can help differentiate inflammatory from noninflammatory conditions but does not localize disease and should be interpreted alongside endoscopic and radiologic data [^113gycZk] [^111Y6NMT] [^116Kzpn8].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. The described EGD findings are not indicative of Crohn's disease; they are most consistent with reflux esophagitis and erosive gastropathy from GERD and possible NSAID use, with a contributory hiatal hernia. The absence of classic CD endoscopic features and the presence of a more plausible alternative explanation make CD unlikely based on this EGD alone; definitive exclusion of CD would still require appropriate lower GI evaluation and, if suspicion persists, small-bowel imaging and histology integrated with clinical context [^1126BLpN] [^113gycZk] [^112NJcTN].

The EGD findings are **not diagnostic of Crohn's disease**. Crohn's disease typically shows **discontinuous, transmural inflammation** with aphthae, linear/serpiginous ulcers, cobblestoning, and granulomas on histology [^1126BLpN] [^1133gNfz]. Here, the esophagus is normal except for reflux esophagitis, the gastritis is erosive (likely NSAID/aspirin or H. pylori), and the duodenum is normal — all inconsistent with Crohn's. Reflux esophagitis and erosive gastropathy are common, nonspecific findings and do not support Crohn's without compatible endoscopic or histologic features. If Crohn's remains suspected, obtain ileocolonoscopy with biopsies and small-bowel imaging [^114LtrDe] [^112NJcTN]; routine EGD is not indicated in adults without upper GI symptoms [^112NJcTN].

---

## Endoscopic features of Crohn's disease

Crohn's disease shows **characteristic endoscopic features** that help distinguish it from other GI conditions:

- **Discontinuous inflammation**: Skip lesions with normal mucosa between inflamed segments [^1134Ymxr].

- **Aphthous ulcers**: Small, shallow ulcers often early lesions [^112brrCn].

- **Linear/serpiginous ulcers**: Long, thin ulcers parallel to the bowel axis [^113usbDT].

- **Cobblestoning**: Intersecting ulcers creating a cobblestone appearance [^112brrCn].

- **Strictures**: Transmural inflammation causing narrowing [^112brrCn].

- **Granulomas**: Non-caseating granulomas on histology are highly suggestive [^116FMmWP].

---

## Analysis of the provided EGD findings

| **Segment** | **Findings** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Esophagus | - Normal mucosa in upper and middle thirds <br/> - LA Grade B reflux esophagitis | - Reflux esophagitis is common and nonspecific <br/> - Not suggestive of Crohn's disease [^111gFjks] |
| Stomach | - Gastritis <br/> - Erosive gastropathy with recent bleeding | - Erosive gastropathy is common with NSAIDs, aspirin, or H. pylori <br/> - Not specific for Crohn's [^1139tj8k] |
| Duodenum | Normal second portion | - Normal duodenum argues against Crohn's involvement [^notfound] |

---

## Absence of specific Crohn's disease features

The provided EGD lacks **specific features of Crohn's disease**:

- **No skip lesions**: Inflammation appears continuous rather than discontinuous.

- **No aphthous or linear ulcers**: No characteristic ulcerations seen.

- **No cobblestoning**: Mucosa lacks cobblestone appearance.

- **No granulomas**: Histologic hallmark of Crohn's disease absent [^116FMmWP].

- **Normal duodenum**: Crohn's often involves duodenum; normal appearance is uncommon [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The findings are more consistent with **alternative diagnoses**:

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: LA Grade B reflux esophagitis and hiatal hernia are classic for GERD [^111xAriL].

- **NSAID-induced gastropathy**: Erosive gastropathy with recent bleeding is typical of NSAID use [^notfound].

- **Helicobacter pylori gastritis**: Common cause of gastritis and erosions [^notfound].

---

## Recommended further evaluation

If Crohn's disease remains suspected, **additional evaluation is recommended**:

- **Ileocolonoscopy with biopsies**: Gold standard for suspected Crohn's disease [^111pircp] [^113gycZk].

- **Small bowel imaging**: MR enterography or CT enterography to assess small bowel involvement [^1179Ekcf].

- **Capsule endoscopy**: Consider if small bowel disease is suspected and no obstruction [^111Y6NMT].

- **Laboratory tests**: Fecal calprotectin, CRP, and ESR to assess inflammation [^116Kzpn8].

---

## Conclusion

The EGD findings are **not indicative of Crohn's disease**. The presence of reflux esophagitis, erosive gastropathy, and a normal duodenum are inconsistent with Crohn's. If suspicion persists, pursue ileocolonoscopy, small-bowel imaging, and targeted labs.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease… [^111ShjpY]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a chronic upper gastrointestinal disease in which stomach content persistently and regularly flows up into the esophagus, resulting in symptoms and/or complications. Symptoms include dental corrosion, dysphagia, heartburn, odynophagia, regurgitation, non-cardiac chest pain, extraesophageal symptoms such as chronic cough, hoarseness, reflux-induced laryngitis, or asthma. In the long term, and when not treated, complications such as esophagitis, esophageal stricture, and Barrett's esophagus may arise. Risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatal hernia, and taking certain medications. Medications that may cause or worsen the disease include benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, NSAIDs, and certain asthma medicines.

Acid reflux is due to poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter, which is at the junction between the stomach and the esophagus. Diagnosis among those who do not improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy, upper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry. GERD sometimes causes injury to the esophagus. These injuries may include one or more of the following:

- Reflux esophagitis – inflammation of esophageal epithelium which can cause ulcers near the junction of the stomach and esophagus
- Esophageal strictures – the persistent narrowing of the esophagus caused by reflux-induced inflammation
- Barrett's esophagus – intestinal metaplasia of the distal esophagus
- Esophageal adenocarcinoma – a form of cancer. GERD sometimes causes injury of the larynx. Other complications can include aspiration pneumonia.

Barrett's esophagus GERD may lead to Barrett's esophagus, a type of intestinal metaplasia, which is in turn a precursor condition for esophageal cancer. The risk of progression from Barrett's to dysplasia is uncertain, but is estimated at 20% of cases. Due to the risk of chronic heartburn progressing to Barrett's, EGD every five years is recommended for people with chronic heartburn, or who take drugs for chronic GERD. Factors that can contribute to GERD:
- Hiatal hernia, which increases the likelihood of GERD due to mechanical and motility factors.
- **Obesity**: increasing body mass index is associated with more severe GERD. In a large series of 2, 000 patients with symptomatic reflux disease, it has been shown that 13% of changes in esophageal acid exposure is attributable to changes in body mass index.
- GERD can be a symptom of mast cell activation syndrome. In 1999, a review of existing studies found that, on average, 40% of GERD patients also had H. pylori infection.

The eradication of H. pylori can lead to an increase in acid secretion, leading to the question of whether H. pylori-infected GERD patients are any different from non-infected GERD patients. A double-blind study, reported in 2004, found no clinically significant difference between these two types of patients with regard to the subjective or objective measures of disease severity. Diagnosis The diagnosis of GERD is usually made when typical symptoms are present. Reflux can be present in people without symptoms and the diagnosis requires both symptoms or complications and reflux of stomach content. Other investigations may include esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Barium swallow X-rays should not be used for diagnosis. Esophageal manometry is not recommended for use in the diagnosis, being recommended only prior to surgery. Ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring may be useful in those who do not improve after PPIs and is not needed in those in whom Barrett's esophagus is seen.

4.1.3 Diagnostic tests

Good Practice Recommendation 7. Suspected Crohn's disease should be investigated with ileocolonoscopy including segmental colonic and ileal biopsies (to look for microscopic disease); and with imaging to assess location and extent of small bowel disease (Agreement: 97.8%).

Ileocolonoscopy with biopsy is established as the first-line investigation for suspected Crohn's disease. Ileoscopy with biopsy histology is superior in establishing the diagnosis of mild ileal Crohn's disease, however, intubation of the terminal ileum may not always be possible, and up to 20% of patients have isolated proximal small bowel disease beyond the reach of even complete ileocolonoscopy. For example, out of a cohort of 150 Crohn's disease patients, 36 had active small bowel disease diagnosed using CT enterography following a normal ileocolonoscopy. Ileoscopy and radiological imaging are complementary in diagnosis of ileal Crohn's disease. Dedicated small bowel imaging should be performed to complement ileocolonoscopy in all patients with suspected Crohn's disease and those with an unclassified colitis at ileocolonoscopy. Mucosal biopsy specimens are essential for a complete macroscopic and microscopic assessment of the colon and distal ileum.

Statement 27. We suggest that adult patients with Crohn's disease do not routinely require upper gastrointestinal endoscopy as part of the diagnostic evaluation unless they have upper gastrointestinal symptoms (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 91.1%).

Crohn's disease in the upper gastrointestinal tract has a prevalence up to 13% in some studies, and 16% in a more recent study of 119 patients. When found, it is usually accompanied by ileal or colonic disease. It has been suggested that upper GI endoscopy can help to differentiate between UC and Crohn's disease in patients with an unclassified colitis. Changes of focal gastritis occur, however, in UC as well as Crohn's disease, and so gastroscopy may not be helpful. If there is vomiting, dyspepsia or other upper GI symptoms then upper GI endoscopy is indicated, but not routinely in adults with suspected or proven Crohn's disease.

### Diagnostic efficacy of double-balloon enteroscopy in patients with suspected isolated small bowel Crohn's disease [^116FMmWP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ideally, DBE can provide pathological support for the diagnosis of small bowel CD. The histology usually detected in patients with established CD includes focal (discontinuous) chronic inflammation, focal crypt irregularities, and granulomas. Non-caseous granulomas are generally recognized as the most important microscopic features detectable for the diagnosis of CD. Non-caseous granuloma and at least one other microscopic feature (focal chronic inflammation or focal crypt irregularity) can be considered for CD. In a retrospective study, despite positive macroscopic findings from DBE, 58% of the patients had normal or nonspecific histology, and 45% of patients were treated as having CD on the basis of a combination of histology, endoscopic appearance, clinical symptoms and laboratory tests. Although the discontinuity of inflammation and the superficiality of the biopsy tissue results in a lower chance of obtaining a granuloma under endoscopy, 10–30% of histological findings can still provide evidence to establish a diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis requires pathological support to confirm the diagnosis of small bowel CD and to help differentiate it from intestinal tuberculosis, Behcet's disease, lymphoma, and other diseases. Small bowel CD can be diagnosed using the six diagnostic points proposed by the WHO. The diagnosis of small bowel CD involves clinical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological features; however, satisfying all the criteria may be impossible or unnecessary in practice. DBE should be considered complementary to other diagnosis methods. In ambiguous cases, the "test of time" is useful for CD diagnosis. Recurrent complaints, responses to therapy, and recurrent symptoms after stopping therapy may eventually verify the diagnosis.

ACG Crohn's disease key concepts — disease course and objective monitoring: Over long periods of observation, only 20%–30% of patients with CD will have a nonprogressive or indolent course, and symptoms of CD do not correlate well with the presence of active inflammation; therefore, objective evaluation by endoscopy or cross-sectional imaging should be undertaken periodically to avoid errors of under- or over-treatment.

### Role of small-bowel endoscopy in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: an international OMED-ECCO consensus [^112LUnCk]. Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are lifelong diseases seen predominantly in the developed countries of the world. Whereas ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition causing diffuse and continuous mucosal inflammation of the colon, Crohn's disease is a heterogeneous entity comprised of several different phenotypes, but can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract. A change in diagnosis from Crohn's disease to ulcerative colitis during the first year of illness occurs in about 10% - 15% of cases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) restricted to the colon that cannot be characterized as either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease is termed IBD-unclassified (IBDU). The advent of capsule and both single- and double-balloon-assisted enteroscopy is revolutionizing small-bowel imaging and has major implications for diagnosis, classification, therapeutic decision making and outcomes in the management of IBD. The role of these investigations in the diagnosis and management of IBD, however, is unclear. This document sets out the current Consensus reached by a group of international experts in the fields of endoscopy and IBD at a meeting held in Brussels, 12–13th December 2008, organised jointly by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and the Organisation Mondiale d'Endoscopie Digestive (OMED). The Consensus is grouped into seven sections: definitions and diagnosis; suspected Crohn's disease; established Crohn's disease; IBDU; ulcerative colitis (including ileal pouch-anal anastomosis [IPAA]); paediatric practice; and complications and unresolved questions. Consensus guideline statements are followed by comments on the evidence and opinion. Statements are intended to be read in context with qualifying comments and not read in isolation.

### Capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected Crohn's disease and negative endoscopy [^113usbDT]. Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

The aim of the present study was to assess the value of capsule endoscopy in the diagnostic work-up of patients in whom there is a clinical suspicion of small bowel Crohn's disease that cannot be confirmed using traditional techniques.

Patients and Methods

A total of 21 patients (14 men, seven women; mean age 43 ± 8 years) with a clinical and biochemical suspicion of Crohn's disease were included in the study. Conventional imaging work-up, including upper and lower endoscopy, as well as a small-bowel follow-through, was carried out in all of the patients.

Results

Pathological findings were not observed in 12 of the 21 patients (57%). In the other nine patients (43%), lesions supporting the diagnosis of Crohn's disease were seen. The most frequent findings were located in the distal ileum and included aphthae, lineal and serpiginous ulcers, and fissures. Four patients had lesions in the jejunum. One patient showed erosions in the distal duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. No adverse effects of the technique were observed in any of the patients.

Conclusions

Capsule endoscopy is a valuable diagnostic tool in patients with suspected Crohn's disease that has not been confirmed using standard imaging techniques.

### Different clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease patients with esophagogastroduodenal, jejunal, and proximal ileal disease involvement: is L4 truly a single phenotype? [^115fdMDW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disorder with relapsing inflammation of the gut and presents with variable manifestations that require individualized approaches to management. Precise risk stratification of patients may facilitate tailoring of an optimal treatment, which remains a challenge in clinical practice. Disease extent is associated with treatment response, complication development, and risk for surgery and postoperative recurrence. – Thus, extent and location of involvement is a major determinant in phenotyping and risk stratification of CD patients.

In realizing the differences in outcomes between upper and different segments of lower gastrointestinal disease, the Vienna classification divided locations into ileal (L1), colonic (L2), ileocolonic (L3), or upper (L4) disease. Recognizing the possibility of concurrent diseases, the Montreal classification made further modifications, in that L4 can be added to L1, L2, and L3. This change was supported by mounting evidence that proximal disease is an important independent risk factor for stricturing and penetrating behavior even in patients with ileocolonic disease involvement, and is associated with an increased risk of disease relapse and hospitalizations among several ethnic groups. –,

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) disease (L4) anatomically includes esophagogastroduodenal (EGD), jejunal, and proximal ileal disease. Recent studies showed that jejunal involvement portends unfavorable prognosis compared to L4-EGD, indicating that patients with jejunal disease should be distinguished as carrying a higher risk of surgery. The Paris classification for pediatric CD patients was also modified by designating patients with upper gastrointestinal diseases into two more detailed subgroups of L4a (proximal to ligament of Treitz) and L4b (ligament of Treitz to above distal ileum).

However, whether the outcome of L4-proximal ileal disease differs from that of L4-jejunal and L4-EGD disease has hitherto not been investigated. This is an important knowledge gap because identifying the phenotype of disease predicts prognosis and guides early aggressive treatment in patients. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate whether the outcome differs among CD patients with L4-EGD, L4-jejunal, and L4-proximal ileal disease.

4.1.3.6 Balloon-assisted enteroscopy

Device-assisted endoscopy such as balloon-assisted enteroscopy can visualise the small bowel mucosa beyond the reach of ileocolonoscopy, allowing tissue biopsy for histological assessment. The diagnostic yield may be similar to capsule endoscopy, with a recent systematic review reporting a yield of 63.4% (95% CI 42% to 82.3%) in known or suspected Crohn's disease, with likely greater sensitivity than MRE. The procedures are however costly, invasive, requiring deep sedation or general anaesthesia, and not without risk. A recent meta-analysisreported a perforation rate of 0.15% (95% CI 0.05% to 0.45%) for diagnostic balloon-assisted enteroscopy, and an overall major complication rate (including perforation and bleeding) of 0.72% (95% CI 0.56% to 0.90%) has been reported. Given the high diagnostic accuracy of alternative less invasive tests, notably cross-sectional imaging and capsule endoscopy, diagnostic device-assisted techniques should be reserved for patients with high clinical suspicion of Crohn's disease despite negative ileocolonoscopy, who have suspicious but not diagnostic cross-sectional imaging or capsule endoscopy, particularly if findings would alter therapeutic strategy, or in patients where a firm histological diagnosis would alter management. Device-assisted enteroscopy does have a role in established Crohn's disease where therapeutic intervention, such as stricture dilatation, is needed.

Conclusions

In patients with suspected small bowel CD, we recommend the use of DBE for the comprehensive evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract, thus contributing to clinical diagnosis in cases of negative EGD and colonoscopy. DBE is suitable when VCE or radiological examination reveals abnormal lesions, or when the results of these two methods are negative but small bowel CD is highly suspected. In the future, more indications using DBE will be developed to diagnose, monitor and treat small bowel CD.

Introduction

Capsule endoscopy (CE) can detect Crohn's disease in patients with suggestive symptoms but with negative results from the traditional diagnostic work-up (ileocolonoscopy and small bowel follow-through). The objective of this study was to determine which clinical features predict the diagnosis of Crohn's disease by CE in this subgroup of patients.

Material and Methods

Twenty-three patients (7 men, 16 women; mean age: 40 ± 15 y) with negative results from conventional imaging techniques were prospectively included in the study because of suspicion of Crohn's disease (long-standing abdominal pain and/or diarrhea and at least one of the following symptoms: anemia, weight loss, long-standing fever, perianal disease, extraintestinal manifestations typical of inflammatory bowel disease, elevated inflammatory parameters, or family history of inflammatory bowel disease).

Results

CE diagnosed Crohn's disease in 6 patients (26%). Crohn's disease diagnosis was more frequent in patients with a combination of anemia and elevated inflammatory parameters than in patients without this combination (57% vs. 12.5%; P = 0.04). The only statistically significant association between an inflammatory parameter and Crohn's disease was an increased platelet count.

Conclusions

CE is a useful tool for the diagnosis of subtle small bowel Crohn's disease. The diagnostic yield of CE in patients with suspicion of Crohn's disease but negative results from the traditional diagnostic work-up is significantly higher in patients with anemia and increased platelet count than in patients without this combination of clinical features.

### From terminal ileitis to Crohn's disease: how capsule endoscopy is crucial to diagnosis [^113iHTTW]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Terminal ileitis is a common condition and may be associated with a wide variety of diseases, mostly Crohn's disease. Although small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) is a valuable diagnostic tool for small-bowel diseases, data regarding its diagnostic impact on isolated terminal ileitis are sparse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of SBCE for isolated terminal ileitis detected during ileocolonoscopy and to assess predictive factors for Crohn's disease diagnosis.

Methods

This is a retrospective study including consecutive patients undergoing SBCE after diagnosis of terminal ileitis without colonic mucosal abnormalities on ileocolonoscopy between January 2016 and September 2019.

Results

This included 102 patients with isolated terminal ileitis on ileocolonoscopy. Positive findings on SBCE were found in 82.4% of patients. After performing SBCE, 61.8% of patients had a final diagnosis, being Crohn's disease the most common (34.3%), followed by NSAIDs enteropathy (12.7%). Extraintestinal manifestations (P = 0.003), weight loss (P = 0.02), abnormal imaging (P = 0.04) and positive SBCE findings (P = 0.001) were independently associated with Crohn's disease diagnosis. Regarding SBCE, presence of proximal small-bowel disease (P = 0.02), diffuse findings (P = 0.002) and moderate to severe inflammatory activity (Lewis score ≥ 790) (P < 0.001) were independently associated with Crohn's disease diagnosis.

Conclusion

SBCE is a valuable tool that should be systematically used in patients with isolated terminal ileitis on ileocolonoscopy, since it revealed a high diagnostic yield, supporting a definite diagnosis in almost two-thirds of patients, and Crohn's disease diagnosis in approximately one-third of patients. A diagnosis of Crohn's disease should be considered when a patient with terminal ileitis on ileocolonoscopy shows proximal involvement, diffuse findings and/or moderate to severe inflammatory activity on SBCE.

Upper gastrointestinal evaluation in Crohn's disease — Upper endoscopy should be performed in patients with upper GI complaints, and CD of the upper GI tract is often underdetected with most studies in adults suggesting that the range is 0.3%–5%. At the time of evaluation, only 37% of patients exhibit upper GI symptoms, yet routine endoscopic evaluation in asymptomatic patients with CD is associated with mild endoscopically visible inflammation in up to 64% of patients and histologic inflammation in up to 70% of patients. Endoscopic features suggestive of CD include mucosal nodularity, ulceration, antral thickening, and duodenal strictures, and histologic changes include granulomatous inflammation, focal cryptitis of the duodenum, and focally enhanced gastritis.

### The first endoscopy in suspected inflammatory bowel disease [^113o9P2p]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

In a patient presenting with suspected inflammatory bowel disease, the initial endoscopic evaluation is a valuable tool for determining the correct disease diagnosis and the extent and severity of disease. A full colonoscopy and ileoscopy should be performed when possible, with systematic biopsies from each segment. When a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is established, it is possible to distinguish between Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, and specific endoscopic features may assist in this categorization. Because patchy healing can occur with treatment, it is important to obtain a thorough and accurate assessment of disease characteristics and distribution before initiating therapy.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Indeterminate colitis (IC) — classification and documentation in pediatric colitis is outlined as follows: We suggest that clinicians try to avoid overuse of the IC diagnosis. Physicians should be aware that backwash ileitis, rectal sparing, histological patchiness, periappendiceal inflammation, and gastritis all can be seen in children with UC at the time of diagnosis, and medical therapy of UC before biopsy or resection can also result in attenuation of inflammation, resulting in less severe histological inflammation, focal disease, or even normal biopsies. A patient may be given a putative diagnosis of IC if he or she has IBD limited to the colon, and clinical features that are inconsistent with the diagnosis of UC; if the clinician decides to classify a patient as having IC, then it is suggested the physician clearly state in the medical record the precise piece of clinical data that prompted the use of the IC diagnosis, and at some point after diagnosis, patients may benefit from additional endoscopic and radiographic evaluation to determine whether the finding has changed or resolved and to attempt to establish a definitive diagnosis of CD or UC. Features that suggest IC in patients with colitis include colitis with an endoscopically and histologically normal rectum (absolute rectal sparing), mild ileitis with features atypical for backwash (eg, ileal aphthae), microscopic ileitis seen in a patient with colitis limited to left colon, severe focal gastritis, pancolitis with anal fissures or anal tags, and colitis with growth failure.

DISCUSSION

This was a large study reviewing the diagnostic endoscopic and histologic UGI tract findings in pediatric patients with IBD who had an established diagnosis of CD or UC. Macroscopic lesions were found in 40% of our patients (43% of CD and 38% of patients with UC). Kovacs et alnoted EGD macroscopic lesions in 64% (113/176) of patients with CD and 40% (19/48) of patients with UC. Consistent with other studies, aphthous ulcers and erosions were the most frequent EGD findings in CD. After the antrum, the duodenum is the second most common site of reported macroscopic EGD abnormalities in patients with CD. Review of endoscopic reports demonstrated a wide variation in terminology used by endoscopists, suggesting the need for standardization of macroscopic descriptions. In 2018, an UGI-Simple Endoscopic Score for CD was proposed to standardize reporting for UGI involvement in CD. This score accounts for features of the ulcers and presence of narrowing.

Several studies suggest that two-thirds of patients with CD and half of those with UC have microscopic UGI tract abnormalities. Histologic disease is often more extensive than macroscopic findings. While 60% of our patients had a macroscopically "normal" upper endoscopy, there were high rates of microscopic changes within this group (100% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC). Moreover, 25% of our patients with CD with macroscopically normal upper endoscopy had granulomas on histology. Given the high frequency of microscopic abnormalities, if upper endoscopy is included in the workup of IBD, routine biopsies are important even without macroscopic lesions.

Our study described the extent of inflammation in each UGI tract site. Chronic deep, superficial, and diffuse inflammation were more common in our CD cohort. This has not been reported in other studies. The significance of such findings is unclear, and further studies are needed to clarify whether extent of inflammation can be helpful to characterize UGI tract disease in IBD.

AGA disease-location considerations for biomarker interpretation note that gastrointestinal symptoms may correlate less accurately with endoscopic activity in patients with small bowel CD or those with prior intestinal resection compared with those with predominant or extensive colonic involvement, and fecal biomarkers may be modestly less accurate in small bowel CD or upper gastrointestinal disease; to interpret results in predominantly small bowel involvement, close anchoring of symptoms and biomarkers with endoscopic findings by measuring biomarker and endoscopic activity simultaneously in active disease and in remission is preferred.

Diagnostic approach shifts and misclassification risk — Before 1990 diagnosis used a combination of clinical features, radiography, and pathological features at bowel resection, whereas recent studies place less emphasis on radiographic studies such as barium enema and emphasize histology to confirm endoscopic findings; examples include criteria where focal disease or inflammation extending below the muscularis mucosa on colonic biopsy changed a diagnosis from UC to CD and where any microscopic ileal inflammation excluded UC, yet the histologic criteria were not well standardized and overreliance on histology without integrating clinical and gross endoscopic findings may inappropriately classify UC as CD.

### Histologic changes in the esophagus in patients with GERD… [^111xAriL]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

LA indicates Los Angeles; PPI, proton pump inhibitor. At baseline, HD-WLE showed an irregular tongue of columnar mucosa in the 12 o'clock position, but no esophagitis. At day 9, HD-WLE showed long linear mucosal breaks extending up the esophagus from the gastroesophageal junction. At day 16, HD-WLE showed long mucosal breaks continuous between the tops of mucosal folds. CLE revealed fluorescein within bright intraepithelial capillaries, with fluorescein that leaked from blood vessels into intercellular spaces surrounding individual cells, creating a reticular appearance characteristic of squamous epithelium. Also evaluated were changes in epithelial basal cell and papillary hyperplasia, surface erosions, intercellular space width, endoscopic grade of esophagitis, esophageal acid exposure, and mucosal impedance. Results.

Biopsies also showed widening of intercellular spaces, and basal cell and papillary hyperplasia developed without surface erosions. 2 This concept, that reflux esophagitis develops as an acid-peptic chemical injury, has been largely unchallenged. The esophageal histologic abnormalities thought to be typical of GERD have been attributed to refluxed gastric acid–related chemical injury to esophageal epithelial cells starting at the luminal surface. The acid-induced death of surface cells is assumed to stimulate hyperplasia of basal progenitor cells, make papillae appear elongated, and attract granulocytes. 3–6. An earlier study in rats found that reflux esophagitis did not develop as a chemical injury starting at the epithelial surface, but rather began with a submucosal infiltration by lymphocytes that later progressed upward to the epithelial surface.

7 Basal cell hyperplasia and papillary elongation were observed to precede surface. The endoscopy database of the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center was searched for patients with Los Angeles grade C reflux esophagitis diagnosed between December 2011 and January 2014. 12 Two gastroenterologists reviewed endoscopic images, and invited patients with verified LA-C esophagitis to participate. Patients took a PPI that evening and the next morning, when esophagoscopy was performed using both high-definition white light endoscopy and confocal laser endomicroscopy.

Patients with LA-B, LA-C, or LA-D esophagitis were not eligible for further study. Patients with no esophagitis or LA-A esophagitis had 4 esophageal biopsies obtained 1 cm to 3 cm proximal to the squamocolumnar junction for histologic evaluation. PPIs were then stopped; patients were given antacids for heartburn. On day 9, esophagoscopy was performed for LA grading and biopsy. On day 15, patients completed another GERD-HRQL questionnaire and had pH and impedance monitoring. The next day, esophagoscopy was performed for LA grading and biopsy, and patients resumed PPI therapy. During the second and third esophagoscopy, care was taken to avoid obtaining biopsies from prior biopsy sites or mucosal breaks. Histologic features were assessed by consensus of 2 study pathologists blinded to endoscopic order and findings.

### Upper gastrointestinal mucosal disease in pediatric Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis: a blinded, controlled study [^116FQmku]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic biopsies often show histologic abnormalities in Crohn disease. Consequently, it has been proposed that routine endoscopy could help to distinguish Crohn disease from ulcerative colitis. Surprisingly, however, recent case reports and an uncontrolled study suggested that similar abnormalities may occur in ulcerative colitis. Therefore, a blinded, controlled study was performed.

Methods

Esophageal, gastric antral, and duodenal biopsies from children with Crohn disease (n = 28) and ulcerative colitis (n = 14) were compared with those from controls undergoing endoscopy for suspected reflux esophagitis (n = 22). Two pathologists, unaware of patient identity and diagnosis, agreed on a consensus report. Severity of inflammation was scored semiquantitatively. Helicobacter pylori colonization was an exclusion criterion.

Results

Inflammation was reported as follows: esophagitis: controls 91%; Crohn disease: 72%; ulcerative colitis: 50%; gastritis: controls: 27%; Crohn disease: 92% (P < 0.001); ulcerative colitis: 69%; duodenitis: controls: 9%; Crohn disease: 33%; ulcerative colitis: 23%. In Crohn disease, granulomas were noted in 40% of patients (P = 0.001). Duodenal cryptitis was noted in 26% of patients with Crohn disease but not ulcerative colitis. In one patient with ulcerative colitis, neutrophilic infiltration of gastric glands was seen. Abnormalities seen in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis included gastroduodenal ulceration (Crohn disease, 7%; ulcerative colitis, 8%), villus atrophy (Crohn disease, 11%; ulcerative colitis, 15%), and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (Crohn disease, 15%; ulcerative colitis, 31% [P < 0.05]). None of these abnormalities was noted in the controls.

Conclusion

Although the presence of granulomas can support a diagnosis of Crohn disease, severe inflammation and other abnormalities occur in the proximal gastrointestinal tract in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.

### Investigation of potential early histologic markers of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease [^1139tj8k]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Upper endoscopy is considered an essential component of the initial evaluation of a child with possible IBD. In a prospective evaluation of the importance of EGD in the diagnosis of IBD, focally enhanced gastritis was noted in 11 of 21 cases. Focally enhanced gastritis has been seen more commonly in children with CD than UC and has also been noted to be present in 76% of adults with CD compared to 0.8% of controls. An increased association of active gastritis in children with CD has also been noted. The gastritis noted in our patients was not active or "focally enhanced" but more indicative of chronic inflammation with a diffuse increase of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the lamina propria with or without reactive epithelial changes. The frequency of gastritis did not differ between CD and UC patients within the IBD group. As our finding of gastritis is rather nonspecific, it invites further investigation regarding the different types of gastritis noted in early IBD in children.

### The role of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the diagnosis of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease [^113bedWK]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study include blinding of pathologists to IBD diagnosis, standardization and systematic histologic descriptions, and large sample size. The weaknesses include absence of a control group, interobserver variability of endoscopic reporting, and lack of symptom or disease correlation with endoscopic or histologic findings.

In conclusion, histologic disease is more extensive than macroscopic changes, supporting routine biopsies despite the absence of macroscopic findings. Chronic deep, superficial, and diffuse inflammation were more frequent among patients with CD. The only microscopic change unique to patients with CD included granulomas. While there may have been a subgroup of patients with granuloma-negative colitis whose diagnosis could be established by finding UGI tract granuloma(s), most cases of CD could have been diagnosed based on macroscopic colonic appearance, L2 granuloma, small bowel disease on imaging, strictures, or perianal disease without EGD. We identified 1 patient for whom the UGI endoscopy helped in establishing a diagnosis of CD. Although upper endoscopy is recommended for initial workup of pediatric IBD, the extent of its utility in distinguishing between CD and UC may be limited. On the other hand, in patients with CD, whether the presence of specific UGI tract abnormalities, L4a alone, or L4a in combination with L4b correlates with progression to more complicated disease warrants further study.

Gastritis in patients with UC — upper gastrointestinal (GI) evaluation in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is increasingly part of the initial evaluation in children with suspected IBD, and ESPGHAN's Porto working group has recommended routine upper endoscopy at initial presentation to aid in the diagnosis of pediatric IBD; EGD may identify gastric pathology requiring treatment in children with IBD, although in colitis such findings may raise uncertainty between Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Upper GI inflammation is present in 30% of patients with CD, and adults and children with UC also have gastric inflammation at diagnosis; routine biopsies at initial diagnosis will identify noncaseating granulomas in 12% to 28% of patients, establishing CD. In one series, 39 children with UC or indeterminate colitis and normal small-bowel radiographs underwent upper endoscopy and granulomas were found on antral biopsy in 5 patients (14%); differentiating features have included granulomas and duodenal cryptitis in CD in 40% and 26% of patients, respectively.

4.6 Upper gastrointestinal Crohn's disease

Statement 52. We suggest that mild gastroduodenal Crohn's disease may be treated with proton pump inhibitors. We suggest that moderate or severe disease may also require treatment with corticosteroids, and other immunosuppressive or biological therapies as for Crohn's disease elsewhere in the gut (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 92.7%).

Statement 53. We suggest that mild oesophageal Crohn's disease may be treated with proton pump inhibitors. Nutritional assessment and support is essential. A short course of corticosteroids may be required if symptoms worsen, but early anti-TNF therapy should be considered for ongoing moderate to severe disease. Oesophageal dilatation should be used for strictures, and surgery is a last resort for disease refractory to all medical therapy (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.6%).

A multidisciplinary international expert panel (European Panel on the Appropriateness of Crohn's Disease Therapy, EPACT II) published guidance on the management of special situations in Crohn's disease in 2009, including upper gastrointestinal disease. No discrimination was made between oesophageal, gastric or duodenal disease, and limited evidence was provided in support of recommendations. However, the group split guidance into patients with stenosis and those without, with recommendation that Helicobacter pylori be sought and eradicated in all.

In the absence of stenosis, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) were recommended as first-line therapy, with steroids second-line, and thiopurines and infliximab as third-line. Adalimumab was deemed of uncertain benefit. 5-ASA, certolizumab, surgery and natalizumab were deemed inappropriate.

In the presence of stenosis, balloon dilatation was recommended as first-line therapy, with PPI second-line, and steroids/thiopurines/surgery as third-line. Infliximab was deemed of uncertain benefit.

Nutritional support is often needed, and may be best delivered by gastrostomy tube for severe or stricturing disease. Exclusive enteral nutrition is beneficial, especially in children. In isolated oesophageal disease, alternative diagnoses should be considered, including gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, disseminated fungal disease, Behçet's disease and malignancy.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^113yTNTy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease colorectal cancer surveillance — Surveillance colonoscopy is suggested for patients who have a minimum of 8 years of disease with involvement of more than 30% of their colon, and individuals with PSC should initiate surveillance colonoscopy at the time of their diagnosis regardless of disease distribution. PSC and diagnosis of CD before the age of 40 years are also associated with increased risk of both CRC incidence and mortality, and CRC surveillance has been shown to increase detection of early CRC and lead to decreased CRC mortality. Most surveillance guidelines have been adapted from UC practice guidelines with findings from a study of 23,751 colonoscopies supporting that surveillance strategies should be similar for both UC and CD. The incidence of small bowel cancer is also increased in CD compared with the non-IBD population; however, routine surveillance is not currently recommended, and there should be a high index of suspicion for small bowel cancer in a stable patient with small bowel CD who has an abrupt change in symptoms.

Endoscopy plays an integral role in the diagnosis, management, and surveillance of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because there is no single pathognomonic test that establishes the diagnosis of IBD, endoscopy is useful in establishing the diagnosis, excluding other etiologies, distinguishing Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis, defining the patterns, extent, and activity of mucosal inflammation, and obtaining mucosal tissue for histologic evaluation. In established IBD, endoscopy helps define the extent and severity of involvement, which in turn influences medical and surgical decisions, aids in targeting medical therapies, and allows for the management of IBD-related complications. Furthermore, endoscopy plays a key role in the surveillance of patients with long-standing colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia and the development of colorectal cancer.

Results

A total of 49 patients were diagnosed with small bowel CD, of which 18 patients were difficult to confirm by conventional tests. 13 males and 5 females were included in this study and 21 DBEs were performed. The mean age of patients diagnosed with small bowel CD was 41.5 years. In seven patients, the insertion route was oral, in eight patients the insertion was through the anal route, and in three patients both oral and anal approaches were used. We estimated insertion depth on the basis of the number of strokes (insertion and withdrawal cycles). The average depth of insertion was 235 ± 95 cm (oral route) and 77 ± 40 cm (anal route). Clinical characteristics of the patients, endoscopic findings and CT results are summarized in Table 1.

The endoscopic features suggesting a diagnosis of CD include aphthous ulcers, longitudinal ulcers, a cobblestone-like appearance, intestinal stenosis and segmental lesions, as shown in Fig. 1. Microscopic characteristics of CD in biopsy specimens are focal (discontinuous) chronic inflammation, focal crypt irregularity (discontinuous crypt distortion), and granulomas (not related to crypt injury). Aphthous ulcers, linear ulcers, deep fissures with knife-like clefts, and transmural lymphoid hyperplasia also suggest a CD diagnosis. The results of DBE, histological findings and clinical diagnoses are summarized in Table 2.

4 Crohn's disease

4.1 Diagnosis, classification and assessment

Crohn's disease is a complex chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal condition with variable age of onset, disease location and behaviour. There is no single unifying definition of Crohn's disease and a combination of investigative modalities is often needed to confirm the diagnosis. The most widely accepted framework for making a diagnosis dates back nearly 30 years. Factors include an appropriate clinical history and examination, ileocolonoscopy, small bowel imaging, blood tests and histology. Mucosal biopsies from endoscopic procedures or surgical resection specimens show focal or patchy (rather than diffuse) inflammation and/or crypt distortion. Discontinuous segments of disease ('skip lesions'), ileal involvement and granulomatous inflammation are more suggestive of Crohn's disease, as is a tendency for inflammation to be worse in the proximal colon.

Distinguishing between Crohn's disease and UC can sometimes be complicated; partially-treated UC can demonstrate patches of inflammation, backwash ileitis occurs in UC, and granulomas only occur in about half of Crohn's disease patients. Cryptolytic granulomas can occur in UC, diverticular inflammation and all forms of colitis and are very non-specific. Pathologists find it easier to distinguish between IBD and non-IBD than they do to separate Crohn's from UC, and the diagnosis is helped greatly by discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting with clinicians and pathologist present. Studies have shown about 3% of UC patients will be reclassified as Crohn's colitis, and conversely a small number (0.6–3%) will be reclassified to UC after an initial diagnosis of Crohn's disease. There is a separate cohort who can be neither assigned as Crohn's disease or UC, so are labelled as IBD unclassified.

### Tools for the diagnosis and management of Crohn's disease [^11112hQe]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Numerous tools have emerged over recent decades to aid in the increasingly complex management of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) beyond endoscopy, including video capsule endoscopy, magnetic resonance enterography, computed tomography enterography, a variety of biomarkers, and even wearable biosensors and smartphone applications. These tools have allowed for a more sophisticated and less invasive complementary approach to the evaluation of disease activity and treatment response in patients with CD. This article details the characteristics, practical application, and limitations of these various modalities and discusses how updated guidelines are now incorporating many of them into a treat-to-target strategy.

### Causes… [^112thsGr]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Esophagitis can be asymptomatic; or can cause epigastric and/or substernal burning pain, especially when lying down or straining; and can make swallowing difficult. The most common cause of esophagitis is the reverse flow of acid from the stomach into the lower esophagus: gastroesophageal reflux disease. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of esophagitis include:

- Heartburn – a burning sensation in the lower mid-chest
- Nausea
- Dysphagia – swallowing is painful, with difficulty passing or inability to pass food through the esophagus
- Vomiting
- Abdominal pain
- Cough. Complications If the disease remains untreated, it can cause scarring and discomfort in the esophagus. If the irritation is not allowed to heal, esophagitis can result in esophageal ulcers. Esophagitis can develop into Barrett's esophagus and can increase the risk of esophageal cancer. Causes Infectious esophagitis cannot be spread.

However, infections can be spread by those who have infectious esophagitis. Esophagitis can develop due to many causes. GERD is the most common cause of esophagitis because of the backflow of acid from the stomach, which can irritate the lining of the esophagus.
- Chemical injury by alkaline or acidic solutions
- Physical injury resulting from nasogastric tubes.
- Alcohol use disorder – Can wear down the lining of the esophagus.
- Crohn's disease – a type of IBD that can cause esophagitis if it attacks the esophagus.
- Stress – Can cause higher levels of acid reflux.
- Radiation therapy – Can affect the immune system.
- Allergies – Allergies can stimulate eosinophilic esophagitis.
- Infection – People with immunodeficiencies have a higher chance of developing esophagitis.
- Vomiting – Acid can irritate esophagus.
- Hernias – A hernia can poke through the diaphragm muscle and can inhibit stomach acid and food from draining quickly.
- Surgery
- Eosinophilic esophagitis, a more chronic condition with a theorized autoimmune component. The mucosa, the inner most layer and lining of the esophagus, is composed of stratified squamous epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosae. At the end of the esophagus is the lower esophageal sphincter, which normally prevents stomach acid from entering the esophagus. If the sphincter is not sufficiently tight, it may allow acid to enter the esophagus, causing inflammation of one or more layers. Esophagitis may also occur if an infection is present, which may be due to bacteria, viruses, or fungi; or by diseases that affect the immune system. Irritation can be caused by GERD, vomiting, surgery, medications, hernias, and radiation injury. Inflammation can cause the esophagus to narrow, which makes swallowing food difficult and may result in food bolus impaction.

Diagnosis Esophagitis can be diagnosed by upper endoscopy, biopsy, upper GI series, and laboratory tests. An upper endoscopy is a procedure to look at the esophagus by using an endoscope. While looking at the esophagus, the doctor is able to take a small biopsy. The biopsy can be used to confirm inflammation of the esophagus. An upper GI series uses a barium contrast, fluoroscopy, and an X-ray. During a barium X-ray, a solution with barium or pill is taken before getting an X-ray. The barium makes the organs more visible and can detect if there is any narrowing, inflammation, or other abnormalities that can be causing the disease. The upper GI series can be used to find the cause of GI symptoms. An esophagram is if only the throat and esophagus are looked at. Laboratory tests can be done on biopsies removed from the esophagus and can help determine the cause of the esophagitis. Laboratory tests can help diagnose a fungal, viral, or bacterial infection.

Diagnostic algorithm in suspected CD

Ileocolonoscopy is the accepted gold standard for diagnosing CD located in the colon and terminal ileum and is currently recommended as the initial diagnostic modality in suspected CD. In the majority of patients, CD is located within the reach of the colonoscope, whereas CD isolated in the upper small bowel, without involvement of the colon or terminal ileum, is uncommon. At the present time, international guidelines recommend small bowel imaging in all patients with a clinical suspicion of CD, irrespective of the findings at ileocolonoscopy (evidence level 5, recommendation grad D), and CE should be the first-line investigation in patients without obstructive symptoms (Fig. 2A). In patients with obstructive symptoms or known stenosis, cross-sectional imaging, such as MRE or CTE is preferred. However, additional studies determining the benefit and clinical impact of performing CE in adult patients with suspected CD after ileocolonoscopy are warranted. Future guidelines should also consider noninvasive markers such as fCal as a tool for selecting patients for ileocolonoscopy. An alternative algorithm based on a single prospective study of fCal, ileocolonoscopy, CE and cross-sectional imaging in suspected CD has previously been published by our group. Patients with an elevated fCal should undergo colonoscopy, including a persistent attempt to intubate the terminal ileum. In patients with a normal ileocolonoscopy or non-complicated CD in the colon and/or terminal ileum, small bowel imaging provides little extra information compared to ileoscopy alone. Small bowel imaging is primarily indicated if ileoscopy is not achieved and CE is the preferred first-line imaging technique. MRE and CTE are complimentary modalities preferably used in patients with stenosis detected at ileocolonoscopy or suspicion of extra-intestinal disease complications. Additional studies are required to validate this diagnostic approach.

### Diagnostic efficacy of double-balloon enteroscopy in patients with suspected isolated small bowel Crohn's disease [^117FGe1W]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease that can involve the entire gastrointestinal tract. According to previous reports, in 30–70% of patients with CD, the small bowel is affected, and in up to 30% of patients diagnosed with CD, only the small bowel is involved. It is difficult to diagnose isolated small bowel CD because of the nonspecific symptoms and anatomic location of the small bowel. According to the location and pathological behavior (including the development of penetration and strictures), CD has different clinical manifestations. The pathological changes occurring in the distal part of the ileum manifest mainly as intestinal stenosis, which occurs as the disease progresses. Stenosis and penetration (perforation) are major complications and require surgical intervention. Some patients with a long medical history and recurrence of disease complain of obstructive symptoms in the first medical consultation, and many patients receive delayed diagnosis and treatment. Early identification and treatment of CD involving the small bowel may be beneficial to these patients.

As there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of CD, the defined diagnosis usually requires the combination of clinical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological features and the exclusion of an infectious etiology. Traditionally, the tools for diagnosing CD have included esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, X-ray tests, and high-resolution ultrasound. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) are traditionally used standards for examining the small intestine. CT and MR are accurate techniques for detecting extraluminal complications. The European consensus has proposed the use of MR enterography/enteric (MRE) and CT enterography/enteric (CTE) to detect intestinal involvement and penetrating lesions in CD. Both are considered imaging techniques with the highest diagnostic accuracy. Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) and double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) have become effective tools in diagnosing small bowel CD. The advantage of DBE is not only direct visualization of the small bowel mucosa but it also allows for biopsy of the lesion and therapeutic interventions. DBE can be used to diagnose unclear small bowel disease or suspected cancer and can also be used in rare cases in which tissue pathological examination is required. The aim of this research was to explore the value of DBE for the diagnosis of isolated small bowel CD.

### Pathophysiology… [^11785i4p]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

5 Other complications of GERD include strictures, ulcerations and Barrett's esophagus. Patients with Barrett's esophagus have a 30 to 125 times greater risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. 3 Younger age at onset and longer duration of symptoms seem to increase the risk of malignancy.
3. Treatment of GERD associated with Barrett's esophagus has not been shown to eliminate the metaplasia of that condition or the risk of malignancy. Consequently, patients with Barrett's esophagus require periodic endoscopic biopsy to assess esophageal tissue for malignant changes.
6. Pathophysiology GERD is thought to have a multifactorial etiology rather than a single cause.

Contributing factors include the caustic materials that are refluxed, a breakdown in the defense mechanisms of the esophagus and a functional abnormality that results in reflux. OFFENDING AGENTS Stomach secretions and contents are naturally at a lower pH than the normal esophageal environment. If these more acidic substances are not cleared rapidly from the esophagus, they can harm esophageal tissue. Acidic gastric material is undoubtedly the primary offending agent in the development of GERD, with duration of exposure being a key factor. 1 The role of bile acids from the duodenum is also being investigated. As many as 60 percent of patients with GERD reflux both gastric and duodenal juices. 7 Although definite proof is lacking, bile acid reflux may be the reason that more severe esophagitis can be difficult to heal despite adequate suppression of gastric acid secretion.
7. DEFECTS AND ABNORMALITIES The contribution of hiatal hernia to GERD is another source of controversy.

Although the incidence of prolonged reflux appears to be increased with hiatal hernia, patients may have a hiatal hernia without reflux or reflux without a hernia. 9 Other possible causal factors in GERD include delayed clearance of physiologic reflux by saliva, decreased secretion of bicarbonate by esophageal submucosal glands and attenuated ability of the cells lining the esophagus to resist acid injury.

1. Diagnosis CLINICAL PRESENTATION When patients present with typical symptoms and no complications, the diagnosis of GERD is usually straightforward. The classic symptoms are heartburn and regurgitation, which may also include dysphagia. 10 In the absence of classic symptoms, GERD becomes more difficult to diagnose. Other symptoms that may be caused by GERD are atypical chest pain, hoarseness, nausea, cough, odynophagia and asthma.

11 Symptoms that may indicate a more serious problem, such as chest pain, dysphagia, odynophagia and weight loss, require more extensive investigation before the diagnosis of GERD can be established. Diagnostic tests are used when the diagnosis is in doubt or complications are a concern. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS Only one third of patients with GERD have radiologic signs of esophagitis. 13 Findings include erosions and ulcerations, strictures, hiatal hernia, thickening of mucosal folds and poor distensibility. 13, 14 Only a minority of patients with documented abnormal pH have radiographically evident esophagitis. 13 Consequently, a radiographic study is not the test of choice for the diagnosis of GERD. ENDOSCOPY Endoscopy is useful for diagnosing the complications of GERD, such as Barrett's esophagus, esophagitis and strictures, but it is not sensitive for diagnosis of GERD itself.

### Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder: is it what it seems to be? [^114qfCP1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that EGEs can precede the occurrence of IBD. Patients persistently symptomatic or who do not respond to treatment should be reassessed to exclude IBD, given its high prevalence in this group of patients.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Eosinophilic esophagitis and gastroenteritis are chronic inflammatory conditions that can occur in response to allergens
Eosinophilic esophagitis is defined as ≥ 15 eosinophils (Eo)/high power field (HPF), whereas eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder in the rest of the gastrointestinal tract is usually defined as an eosinophilic count that exceeds 20 Eo/HPF
Patients can present with dysphagia and a variety of non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea

What the new findings are:

Asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema can coexist in patients with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders
Inflammatory bowel disease can be preceded by eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders
Patients with persistent symptoms and no explanation for the raised Eo on histology in the gastrointestinal tract should undergo repeat endoscopy

### Different clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease patients with esophagogastroduodenal, jejunal, and proximal ileal disease involvement: is L4 truly a single phenotype? [^111SoGw5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present study documented a relatively high rate of L4 disease and demonstrated that substantial difference in clinical outcome may exist among patients with subtypes of L4, namely L4-EGD, L4-jejunum, and L4-proximal ileum. Upper GI involvement in CD is common across ethnic groups. In some earlier reports, the prevalence of upper GI involvement was 4–5% among Western populations. The higher rate of L4 disease in our study was in accordance with previous Asian cohort studies. Indeed, a recent Japanese study also showed that ulcerative lesions were observed in 39 (39.8%) of 98 proximal ileal segments, and in 5 (12.5%) of 40 jejunal segments by small bowel enteroscopy. The inconsistent rates of upper GI involvement in different studies could be ascribed to the different study population, but probably also reflect the advanced techniques in assessing the upper gastric tract and the utilization of different phenotyping methods. A recent prospective study showed that small bowel video capsule endoscopy and MRE could detect previously unrecognized disease locations in 51% and 25% of 79 patients, respectively. Both modalities combined thereby altered the original Montreal classification in 49 of 76 patients (64%). As part of L4 disease, proximal ileal disease, which differs from L4-jejunal and L4-EGD disease, has been overlooked and not computed as an L4 phenotype in some studies. – This might also explain the higher rate of L4 disease in our study.

Guidelines for clinical practice are intended to suggest preferable approaches to particular medical problems as established by interpretation and collation of scientifically valid research, derived from extensive review of published literature. When data that will withstand objective scrutiny are not available, a recommendation may be made based on a consensus of experts. Guidelines are intended to apply to the clinical situation for all physicians without regard to specialty. Guidelines are intended to be flexible, not necessarily indicating the only acceptable approach, and should be distinguished from standards of care that are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of choices in any health-care problem, the physician should select the course best suited to the individual patient and the clinical situation presented. These guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee. Expert opinion is solicited from the outset for the document. The quality of evidence upon which a specific recommendation is based is as follows: Grade A: Homogeneous evidence from multiple well-designed randomized (therapeutic) or cohort (descriptive) controlled trials, each involving a number of participants to be of sufficient statistical power. Grade B: Evidence from at least one large well-designed clinical trial with or without randomization, from cohort or case-control analytic studies, or well-designed meta-analysis. Grade C: Evidence based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees. The Committee reviews guidelines in depth, with participation from experienced clinicians and others in related fields.

### Advances in diagnosis and therapy for upper gastrointestinal Crohn's disease [^116WJea3]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing and remitting inflammatory process that can involve the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract. Upper gastrointestinal involvement (UGI) in Crohn's disease is present in up to 15% of patients and can present as a diagnostic challenge given nonspecific symptoms and overlapping disease entities. This review provides an update on diagnosing and risk stratifying UGI-CD.

Recent Findings

Literature suggests the use of imaging modalities (such as video capsule endoscopy, cross-sectional imaging and intestinal ultrasound) to help identify proximal inflammation when clinical suspicion for UGI involvement exists based on symptoms and patient factors. Additionally, proximal disease involvement has been associated with increased disease severity, a higher prevalence of strictures and an increased risk for surgery. First-line therapies are corticosteroids and antitumor necrosis factor therapies if systemic treatment is needed based on disease severity. For stricturing disease, endoscopic balloon dilation, strictureplasty, surgical resection or bypass can be considered for medically refractory or recurrent disease.

Summary

As the prevalence and progression of UGI-CD is still understudied due to its variable definition, presentation and incidence, the development of a standardized approach to diagnosis could aid in determining the overall prevalence and most effective treatments.

A panel of experts consisting of IBD specialists, endoscopists, and GI pathologists participated in virtual conferences and developed this modified Delphi-based consensus document to address endoscopic aspects of IBD management.

Crohn's disease natural history — behavior at diagnosis and progression risk: Between 5% and 25% each present with stricturing or penetrating disease behavior, and among those presenting with inflammatory behavior the cumulative risk of developing an intestinal complication was 51% at 20 years after diagnosis. Ileal, ileocolonic, or upper GI involvement was significantly associated with faster time to the development of intestinal complications, whereas colonic disease was found to be protective against progression in the European Epi-IBD cohort.

Purpose Of Review

Crohn's disease remains a clinical diagnosis based on a typical clinical history, physical examination, small bowel radiography, and ileocolonoscopy with biopsy. Wireless video capsule endoscopy allows direct visualization of the entire small bowel mucosa. This review analyzes recently reported studies assessing diagnostic yield, impact on management, and outcomes associated with this new procedure. Safety issues, particularly capsule retention, are also reviewed.

Recent Findings

A number of recently published studies report 'diagnostic yields' for Crohn's disease from capsule endoscopy of over 70% in patients with negative, or inconclusive, findings on prior small bowel series and ileocolonoscopy. Capsule endoscopy is a more sensitive examination than traditional radiography, but the specificity and positive predictive values remain to be established. Most series report a positive influence on patient outcome based on capsule findings, but the specific details of management changes and specific outcomes are often not adequately described. Furthermore, 'mucosal breaks' are seen in 14% of normal volunteers, even in the absence of recent nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Capsule retention occurs in less than 1% of patients with suspected Crohn's, but retention rates of 4–6% are reported in patients with established Crohn's.

Summary

Capsule endoscopy is an effective tool in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with Crohn's disease. Prospective comparative studies with adequate control groups and predefined clinical endpoints are necessary to determine the true role of this technology in Crohn's disease.

Best practice advice 8 — Crohn's disease: In individuals with Crohn's disease, clinicians should be aware that a minority of individuals can develop esophageal involvement from inflammatory, stricturing, or fistulizing changes with granulomas seen histologically. Esophageal manifestations of Crohn's disease tend to occur in individuals with active intestinal disease.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy, ESGE 2023 guidelines recommend to perform device-assisted enteroscopy with small-bowel biopsies in patients with noncontributory ileocolonoscopy and suspected CD on small-bowel cross-sectional imaging or small-bowel capsule endoscopy.

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^1133gNfz]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in inflammatory bowel disease — role, biopsy strategy, and pediatric considerations — states that EGD can be useful in the evaluation of Crohn's disease (CD) and inflammatory bowel disease–unclassified (IBD-U), with upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement occurring in up to 16% of patients with CD. Upper GI tract biopsy specimens may be more likely to display granulomas (49%-68%) than colon biopsy specimens (13.6%-55.6%). For suspected upper tract disease, at least 2 biopsies should be taken from the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum during EGD, and routine EGD is not recommended in adult patients suspected of having CD. In pediatrics, isolated upper GI tract granulomas occur in 12% to 28% of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with CD despite negative colonoscopy with ileoscopy, and European societies recommend EGD for all pediatric patients, regardless of upper GI symptoms, during the initial diagnostic work-up of suspected pediatric IBD.

With the heterogeneous clinical presentation of IBD, endoscopy plays an integral role in the initial diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although radiographic tests often are supplemental in the work-up of IBD, colonoscopy with biopsy is the test of choice if IBD is suspected and is more sensitive than radiographic tests. Endoscopic features can be helpful in differentiating ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Currently the only mode for detecting dysplasia and stratifying the risk of developing colorectal cancer is through complete colonoscopy with multiple biopsy specimens. Complications of IBD can be managed effectively with endoscopic therapy. The role of endoscopic ultrasound and future developments in endoscopic therapy need to be defined by future studies.
