## Question

Any diet help with slowing kidney disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether any diet can slow kidney disease progression and, if so, which dietary strategies are most evidence-based and how to apply them safely across CKD stages. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and staging of CKD because diet is stage-specific. Then, I should verify which dietary components have the strongest evidence for slowing progression, including protein quantity and quality, sodium restriction, and acid load reduction. Next, I will review broader dietary patterns like plant-based and Mediterranean diets and weigh their benefits against potential risks. After that, I should examine the quality and limitations of the evidence, including guideline positions and controversies. Finally, I will translate this into practical, individualized recommendations and monitoring plans, making sure I double-check safety considerations such as potassium and phosphorus in advanced CKD [^112Ns7Cs] [^113KcXG9].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why diet matters mechanistically. CKD progression is driven by hemodynamic stress, proteinuria, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation; diet can modulate several of these pathways, so I need to ensure recommendations align with CKD stage and the patient's comorbidities, especially diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which are common in CKD and influence both risk and response to diet [^111uLYtr].

> Now, I will examine protein intake, since this is the most debated and potentially impactful area. Wait, let me verify the guideline ranges before drawing conclusions. KDIGO advises avoiding high protein intake above 1.3 g/kg/day and supports 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day in adults with CKD G3–G5, with KDOQI similarly recommending 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day, and the VA/DoD guideline suggests offering 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day in stages 3–4 to potentially slow eGFR decline, so the convergence supports moderate restriction rather than severe restriction for most patients [^116E735m] [^117XBTaj] [^113HzT3Q]. Hold on, I should verify the evidence strength; the Cochrane review in non-diabetic CKD suggests very low protein diets may reduce ESKD events but low protein diets alone show little difference, and the diabetic CKD Cochrane review finds uncertain effects on kidney function decline, so I should be cautious not to overstate benefits outside carefully selected patients and supervised settings [^1134NqDG] [^115QeEaX]. But wait, what if we consider observational signals and subgroup data; some analyses suggest each 0.1 g/kg/day reduction in protein associates with slower progression, and in advanced CKD with metabolic acidosis, a keto-analogue–supplemented very low protein, plant-based diet slowed eGFR decline and reduced kidney replacement therapy or 50% eGFR loss, which supports a role in selected advanced patients, so I need to tailor the intensity to patient motivation, supervision, and stage [^1148pMRp] [^114CT1WZ].

> Next, I should review protein quality, because plant versus animal sources may matter beyond quantity. Let me consider the acid load and phosphorus bioavailability; plant proteins generate less acid and contain phosphorus that is less bioavailable due to phytate, which can help control phosphate and metabolic acidosis, both linked to CKD progression, so shifting toward more plant protein within the 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day target is reasonable when potassium allows [^113KcXG9] [^113mrvth]. I should double-check safety; in earlier stages, higher fruit and vegetable intake is generally safe and beneficial, but in advanced CKD I must individualize potassium advice rather than reflexively restrict plants, given potential net benefit on acidosis and uremic complications [^112Ns7Cs] [^113KcXG9].

> I will now examine sodium restriction, since blood pressure and proteinuria strongly influence progression. High-certainty evidence shows sodium reduction lowers systolic/diastolic blood pressure by about 7/4 mmHg and reduces albuminuria by roughly one-third in CKD, and although trials are short, sustained BP and proteinuria reductions plausibly slow progression, so I should target less than 2 g/day sodium when feasible and monitor for hypotension symptoms, especially in patients on RAAS blockade or diuretics [^115A9CQA] [^112tGY8J]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across populations; benefits appear similar in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD, reinforcing sodium restriction as a core measure alongside optimized pharmacotherapy [^notfound].

> Let me consider acid load and metabolic acidosis, because this is an underrecognized modifiable driver. Small randomized trials show that increasing fruits and vegetables to reduce dietary acid load can correct acidosis and reduce kidney injury markers comparably to sodium bicarbonate in stage 2–4 CKD, and a very low protein, plant-based diet with keto-analogues improved serum bicarbonate and slowed eGFR decline in advanced CKD, so I should actively address acidosis when present and consider base-inducing foods when potassium is not a limiting factor [^114CT1WZ] [^113KcXG9]. I need to ensure I monitor serum bicarbonate and titrate interventions, including bicarbonate supplementation if diet alone is insufficient or if hyperkalemia limits produce [^114CT1WZ].

> Next, I should review broader dietary patterns. Mediterranean and other plant-predominant patterns are associated with slower CKD progression and better cardiometabolic profiles, likely via lower acid load, higher fiber, anti-inflammatory effects, and improved phosphate control, though much of the evidence is observational and trials are limited; still, the risk–benefit balance favors these patterns in most non-dialysis CKD patients when individualized for potassium and phosphorus [^113KcXG9] [^112nmcq2] [^113mrvth]. Wait, let me verify potassium concerns; contemporary data suggest hyperkalemia risk with plant-based diets may be lower than traditionally feared when medications and dietary counseling are optimized, so blanket potassium restriction without indication can deprive patients of meaningful benefits [^113KcXG9] [^113mrvth].

> I should confirm the strength and limitations of the evidence before making firm claims. Many diet trials in CKD are small, short, and at high risk of bias, and large pragmatic trials on hard outcomes are still needed, which is why guidelines often frame diet as an adjunct with conditional recommendations rather than definitive disease-modifying therapy; nonetheless, converging signals for protein moderation, sodium restriction, and acid load reduction, along with guideline alignment, justify incorporating these strategies into routine care with appropriate monitoring [^116E735m] [^114rFfX9]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating mortality effects; most diet studies did not power for death or ESKD, so I will focus on surrogate benefits with biologic plausibility and emphasize individualized risk–benefit discussions [^112DA9GB].

> Translating this into practice, I need to ensure individualized medical nutrition therapy. For stages 1–2 CKD, I would emphasize weight management, blood pressure control, and a generally heart-healthy, plant-forward pattern without specific protein restriction unless there is proteinuria or rapid progression; for stages 3–4, I would target 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day protein with at least half from plant sources, sodium under 2 g/day, and address acidosis with produce and, if needed, oral bicarbonate; for stage 5 without dialysis, a supervised very low protein diet with keto-analogues may be considered to delay dialysis while preserving nutrition, with close monitoring of adherence and labs [^112tGY8J] [^117XBTaj] [^114CT1WZ]. I should double-check that potassium and phosphorus are individualized; in advanced CKD, I will monitor serum potassium and phosphate, adjust plant choices and portions, and use binders when indicated rather than indiscriminately restricting beneficial plant foods [^113KcXG9] [^114rYJ3h].

> I need to ensure safety monitoring and address adherence barriers. Frequent dietary counseling, periodic urine urea nitrogen or 24-hour urea to estimate protein intake, and tracking of serum bicarbonate, potassium, phosphate, and albumin are essential, especially in the first year of dietary change; patients often struggle with meal planning, cost, and taste preferences, so providing practical resources, recipes, and behavioral support improves adherence and outcomes [^115JJzmS] [^115XDPQf]. But wait, what if protein intake drifts upward; I should schedule follow-ups at least every 3–6 months initially to recalibrate goals and troubleshoot barriers, aligning with best-practice MNT models [^115JJzmS].

> In summary, yes, diet can slow kidney disease progression when implemented thoughtfully: avoid high protein intake, target 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day with emphasis on plant sources, restrict sodium to under 2 g/day, and reduce acid load with fruits and vegetables and, when indicated, bicarbonate; Mediterranean and plant-predominant patterns are reasonable frameworks, and in advanced CKD, a supervised very low protein diet with keto-analogues can delay dialysis in selected patients, all under dietitian-guided, individualized care with lab monitoring for safety and adherence [^112nmcq2] [^117XBTaj] [^115A9CQA] [^114CT1WZ] [^113KcXG9].

Yes, dietary changes can slow CKD progression [^117XBTaj], with the strongest evidence for **low-protein diets (0.6–0.8 g/kg/day)** [^113HzT3Q] [^1134NqDG] and **sodium restriction (< 2 g/day)** [^115A9CQA] to reduce proteinuria and blood pressure. Plant-based diets lower acid load [^113KcXG9], phosphate, and uremic toxins [^113KcXG9], and may slow eGFR decline [^1129PW38]. Very low-protein diets with keto acids [^114CT1WZ] can further delay dialysis in advanced CKD [^117FxsqY] [^1134NqDG]. These strategies should be individualized and supervised by a dietitian to avoid malnutrition and ensure adherence [^117XBTaj] [^113uj8fh].

---

## Dietary protein restriction

- **Low-protein diet (LPD)**: 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day is recommended for CKD stages 3–5 [^notfound] to reduce proteinuria, uremic symptoms, and slow eGFR decline [^1165YFLh].

- **Very low-protein diet (VLPD)**: 0.3–0.4 g/kg/day with keto acid analogs [^114CT1WZ] can further delay dialysis in advanced CKD [^1134NqDG] [^117FxsqY].

- **Evidence**: Meta-analyses and RCTs show VLPD reduces ESKD risk and slows progression [^1134NqDG]; LPD benefits are modest and depend on adherence [^115QeEaX] [^115u3D4o].

---

## Sodium restriction

Sodium restriction to **< 2 g/day** [^112tGY8J] lowers blood pressure and proteinuria — key drivers of CKD progression [^115A9CQA] — and is recommended for CKD stages 1–5 [^112tGY8J]. Evidence from RCTs shows sodium restriction **reduces systolic/diastolic blood pressure by ~7/4 mmHg** and albuminuria by ~36% [^115A9CQA] [^1139T1xG].

---

## Plant-based diets

- **Benefits**: Plant-based diets reduce acid load [^113KcXG9], phosphate burden, and uremic toxins [^113KcXG9]; they may slow eGFR decline and delay dialysis [^114CT1WZ].

- **Evidence**: Observational and interventional studies link plant-based diets to slower CKD progression and better metabolic outcomes [^113KcXG9] [^112JZW27].

- **Safety**: Hyperkalemia risk is low with proper selection and monitoring; individualized counseling is essential [^113KcXG9] [^1163PiGr].

---

## Dietary acid load reduction

Increasing fruits and vegetables to **lower dietary acid load** [^112Ns7Cs] improves serum bicarbonate and slows eGFR decline, particularly in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114CT1WZ]. Evidence shows that **base-producing diets** are comparable to sodium bicarbonate for correcting acidosis and slowing CKD progression [^111sukyh] [^116h875H].

---

## Phosphorus control

Phosphorus control focuses on **limiting phosphate intake** — especially from processed foods and additives [^114rYJ3h] — to reduce vascular calcification and slow CKD progression. Evidence indicates that **lower phosphate intake** is associated with slower CKD progression and improved survival [^notfound].

---

## Practical implementation and adherence

- **Individualized counseling**: Dietitian-led MNT [^115XDPQf] improves adherence and outcomes [^117XBTaj].

- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of nutritional status, adherence, and labs is critical to avoid malnutrition and electrolyte disorders [^115JJzmS].

- **Barriers**: Taste, cost, and complexity limit adherence; structured support and education improve long-term success [^117147yn].

## Summary of evidence

| **Dietary intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Effect on ckd progression** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-protein diet (0.6–0.8 g/kg/day) | High | Moderate slowing of progression |
| Very low-protein diet + keto acids | High | Significant delay in dialysis |
| Sodium restriction (< 2 g/day) | High | Reduces BP and proteinuria |
| Plant-based diet | Moderate | Slows eGFR decline |
| Dietary acid load reduction | Moderate | Improves bicarbonate, slows progression |
| Phosphorus control | Moderate | Slows progression |

---

Dietary changes — especially protein restriction, sodium reduction, and plant-based eating — can slow **CKD progression** [^112tGY8J]. VLPD with **keto acids** is useful in advanced CKD [^114CT1WZ]. Individualized, **dietitian-supervised plans** are essential to balance benefits with nutritional safety and adherence [^117XBTaj].

### Chronic kidney disease and dietary measures to improve outcomes [^112kiRbt]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is an ongoing deterioration of renal function that often progresses to end-stage renal disease. Management goals in children include slowing disease progression, prevention and treatment of complications, and optimizing growth, development, and quality of life. Nutritional management is critically important to achieve these goals. Control of blood pressure, proteinuria, and metabolic acidosis with dietary and pharmacologic measures may slow progression of chronic kidney disease. Although significant progress in management has been made, further research is required to resolve many outstanding controversies. We review recent developments in pediatric chronic kidney disease, focusing on dietary measures to improve outcomes.

Dietetic practice aims to help people modify their diet to slow disease progression and manage disease-related complications while also meeting their nutritional and personal dietary needs. This can be challenging in people with kidney failure undergoing dialysis, particularly in our current food environment and culture. Fortunately, advancements in nutritional-behavioral science and technology are providing new avenues and resources to help meet the challenge. However, progress is slow, and much of dietetic practice in the dialysis population still relies on the interpretation, translation, and application of low-quality, indirect evidence. This Special Issue of Seminars in Dialysis provides readers with an update on and critical insights into some of the major issues and controversies impacting the field of kidney nutrition today.

### Effects of dietary interventions on incidence and progression of CKD [^116dDxXf]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Traditional strategies for management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not resulted in any change in the growing prevalence of CKD worldwide. A historic belief that eating healthily might ameliorate kidney disease still holds credibility in the 21(st) century. Dietary sodium restriction to < 2.3 g daily, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and increased water consumption corresponding to a urine output of 3–4 l daily might slow the progression of early CKD, polycystic kidney disease or recurrent kidney stones. Current evidence suggests that a reduction in dietary net acid load could be beneficial in patients with CKD, but the supremacy of any particular diet has yet to be established. More trials of dietary interventions are needed, especially in diabetic nephropathy, before evidence-based recommendations can be made. In the meantime, nephrologists should discuss healthy dietary habits with their patients and provide individualized care aimed at maximizing the potential benefits of dietary intervention, reducing the incidence of CKD and delaying its progression to end-stage renal disease. Keeping in mind the lack of data on hard outcomes, dietary recommendations should take into account barriers to adherence and be tailored to different cultures, ethnicities and geographical locations.

### Dietary interventions to improve outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^115EPinc]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major epidemic which has global outcomes with increased morbidity and mortality. Given the global implications of CKD, interventions that target modifiable risk factors for CKD are needed. Despite the effectiveness of kidney protection strategies such as hypertension and lipid control as well as the use of antiangiotensin II drugs, the nephropathy in many patients with CKD and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) nevertheless continues to progress toward complete kidney failure. More concerning, CKD-related deaths and in years of life lost due to CKD continue to increase. In this article, we will explore the dietary interventions that recent small-scale studies support slowing the progression of CKD.

Recent Findings

Dietary acid reduction with Na-based alkali has been shown to be an effective kidney protection strategy for CKD patients with reduced GFR. In addition, recent analyses support diet as the largest CKD-related death and disability risk factor. Small-scale studies show that diets which emphasize ingestion of plant-sourced protein more than animal-sourced protein reduce dietary acid, improve metabolic acidosis, and slow further nephropathy progression in patients with CKD and reduced GFR.

Summary

Dietary interventions are underused as kidney protection strategies. As further studies better define how to best use these dietary interventions for kidney protection, clinicians must become aware of their potential utility in the management of CKD patients.

### Progression of chronic kidney disease: can it be prevented or arrested? [^116BJv2y]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease constitutes a highly prevalent health problem worldwide. Left untreated, it progresses inexorably to greater levels of severity at variable rates. The morbid impact of chronic kidney disease is heightened by its role as risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In the past two decades, considerable gains have been realized in retarding progression of chronic kidney disease by emphasizing blood pressure control and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Notwithstanding, the therapeutic goal of preventing or arresting chronic kidney disease progression remains unfulfilled. Currently attainable rates of decrease in glomerular filtration rate remain at 2 to 8 mL/min/y depending on the underlying disease. It is now believed that to achieve optimal therapeutic targets (proteinuria of < 500 mg/day and decrease in glomerular filtration rate of 1 mL/min/y, the average age-related decline) we must introduce novel strategies and a multifaceted approach to treatment that interrupts multiple mechanisms of progression. To this end, and wherever relevant, new approaches to cause-specific treatment must be applied, such as targeted immunosuppression, intensive glycemic control, gene therapy, and enzyme replacement therapy. Furthermore, in all chronic kidney disease, we must interfere more effectively with the multitude of common mechanisms of progression. Established or putative, such approaches include aggressive blood pressure control; advanced renin-angiotensin system blockade; cytokine modulation and antifibrotic therapy; aldosterone blockade; endothelin blockade, nitric oxide modulation and vasopeptidase inhibition; antioxidant therapy; statin therapy; glycosaminoglycan therapy; anemia therapy; dietary restrictions; lifestyle changes; and pharmacogenomic profiling. Such a concerted, multifaceted approach to management might indeed prevent or arrest progression of chronic kidney disease, or even achieve regression of chronic kidney disease.

### Traditional and novel dietary interventions for preventing progression of chronic kidney disease [^117UUijF]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications remain largely unresolved. Currently used treatments include blood pressure control and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which can slow down the progression of CKD but are unable to halt or reverse it. Dietary protein restriction represents an additional therapeutic measure used to slow the progression of CKD. The putative mechanisms of action responsible for its therapeutic effects include beneficial hemodynamic effects and the limitation of absorbable protein breakdown products that could lead to the accumulation of uremic waste and consequent various deleterious effects. The practical implementation of protein restriction through dietary intervention has been hindered on multiple levels, including patient nonadherence, lack of health care resources, and concerns related to adverse effects associated with the development of protein-energy wasting (PEW). As a result, alternative interventions have been designed to address some or all of these shortcomings and concerns. One such intervention is the administration of medications that prevent the absorption of protein catabolic products from the gut. This article reviews the various interventions using such a strategy to prevent or slow the progression of CKD, with special focus on recent advances in this field.

### Diets for patients with chronic kidney disease, should we reconsider? [^112xd9tq]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Here we revisit how dietary factors could affect the treatment of patients with complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD), bringing to the attention of the reader the most recent developments in the field. We will briefly discuss five CKD-induced complications that are substantially improved by dietary manipulation: 1) metabolic acidosis and the progression of CKD; 2) improving the diet to take advantage of the benefits of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) on slowing the progression of CKD; 3) the diet and mineral bone disorders in CKD; 4) the safety of nutritional methods utilizing dietary protein restriction; and 5) evidence that new strategies can treat the loss of lean body mass that is commonly present in patients with CKD.

### New insights into protein intake and progression of renal disease [^113CXSwY]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

For several decades, dietary protein restriction has been considered as a strategy to slow renal disease progression. Recently, a National Kidney Foundation advisory board incorporated recommendations for supervised low-protein diets into guidelines for the care of non-dialyzed patients with chronic kidney failure. Despite this consensus statement, the clinical utility of dietary modification remains controversial. This article reviews new investigations of protein intake as a mediator of renal function and physiology published since 1 October 2002.

Recent Findings

Population-level data indicate graded risk for progressive renal functional decline with increasing protein intake among women with mild renal insufficiency, and support a possible association of higher protein consumption with the risk of microalbuminuria in people with concomitant diabetes and hypertension. A link between the quantity of protein intake and the rate of renal deterioration is suggested by preliminary prospective studies among incident peritoneal dialysis patients, renal transplant recipients, and animal models of kidney disease. Varied renal consequences based on protein composition were reported in population-based studies, animal-model experiments, and animal studies of in-utero protein exposure. Clinical trial experience raises concern for the feasibility of dietary interventions in practice.

Summary

New research supports the view that high-protein diets accelerate renal disease progression, suggests differential consequences based on protein source, and explores risk among defined sub-populations. Topics for future exploration include the renal impact of high-protein weight-loss regimens, implications of dietary protein quantity and type across the stages of chronic kidney disease, and translation of animal studies of prenatal nutrition to humans.

### Diets for patients with chronic kidney disease, should we reconsider? [^112pVWox]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

When we published a Commentary on how dietary factors could affect the treatment of patients with complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 2004, we relied heavily on results from older publications. There were two reasons for this decision: firstly, clinicians and investigators working on this topic were still reeling from the negative conclusion of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease trial (MDRD), namely that dietary modification exerted only a minor impact on the progression of CKD. Secondly, there were too few hypotheses addressing how dietary manipulation could affect the development of CKD and its complications [1]. We now revisit this topic because new insights have identified how dietary factors can overcome the development of CKD and its complications, including the progression of CKD. Notably, these insights can be largely traced to results obtained during rigorous studies of patients with CKD rather than intensive investigations of animal models, indicating there is clinical relevance to the reports. To illustrate why we are keen to bring these developments to the reader's attention, we will briefly discuss in this article five CKD-induced complications that are substantially improved by dietary manipulation.

### Is it the low-protein diet or simply the salt restriction? [^1151JJnp]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Dietary factors, such as salt and protein intake, may play an important role in the progression of kidney disease. Consequently, dietary manipulations of these constituents are of interest both in experimental models of kidney disease and in clinical trials with patients with chronic kidney disease to assess whether modification of these exposures will result in a stabilization of disease progression.

### The international society of renal nutrition and metabolism commentary on the National Kidney Foundation and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in chronic kidney disease [^117XBTaj]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the National Kidney Foundation collaborated to provide an update to the Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for nutrition in chronic kidney disease (CKD). These guidelines provide a valuable update to many aspects of the nutrition care process. They include changes in the recommendations for nutrition screening and assessment, macronutrients, and targets for electrolytes and minerals. The International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism assembled a special review panel of experts and evaluated these recommendations prior to public review. As one of the highlights of the CPG, the recommended dietary protein intake range for patients with diabetic kidney disease is 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day, whereas for CKD patients without diabetes it is 0.55–0.6 g/kg/day. The International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism endorses the CPG with the suggestion that clinicians may consider a more streamlined target of 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day, regardless of CKD etiology, while striving to achieve intakes closer to 0.6 g/kg/day. For implementation of these guidelines, it will be important that all stakeholders work to detect kidney disease early to ensure effective primary and secondary prevention. Once identified, patients should be referred to registered dietitians or the region-specific equivalent, for individualized medical nutrition therapy to slow the progression of CKD. As we turn our attention to the new CPG, we as the renal nutrition community should come together to strengthen the evidence base by standardizing outcomes, increasing collaboration, and funding well-designed observational studies and randomized controlled trials with nutritional and dietary interventions in patients with CKD.

### Pro: the rationale for dietary therapy for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [^116aLSqU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Dietary treatment offers many benefits to patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are approaching the need for renal replacement therapy. A large number of these benefits are independent of whether diets slow the rate of progression of CKD. These diets are low in protein and many minerals, and provide adequate energy for the CKD patient. The diets can reduce accumulation of potentially toxic metabolic products derived from protein and amino acid degradation, maintain a healthier balance of body water, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium and other minerals, and prevent or improve protein-energy wasting. Such diets may enable patients to safely delay the onset of chronic dialysis therapy or kidney transplantation. Dietary therapy may also augment the effectiveness of infrequent or incremental dialysis by maintaining healthier metabolic and clinical status and may enable some end-stage renal disease patients to avoid the need for temporary placement of hemodialysis catheters while their arterial venous fistulae or grafts mature. The anxiety that many advanced CKD patients commonly experience with regard to starting dialysis may incentivize them to accept and adhere to dietary therapy.

### Does correction of metabolic acidosis slow chronic kidney disease progression? [^116h875H]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), despite current treatment practices. Recent studies support that dietary acid reduction with oral sodium based alkali or base-inducing food types add kidney protection to that provided by current kidney-protective interventions. Related studies also support that correction of metabolic acidosis with dietary acid reduction slows CKD progression. We reviewed these recent studies that show improvement in CKD parameters and slower CKD progression in response to improvement of CKD-associated metabolic acidosis with these interventions.

Recent Findings

Animal as well as human models of CKD show that alkali treatment ameliorates indices of kidney injury and also might slow GFR decline in patients with or without metabolic acidosis. These benefits have been similar with oral sodium-based alkali and base-inducing fruits and vegetables, supporting dietary acid reduction as an effective adjunct to conventional kidney-protective interventions.

Summary

Recent studies suggest that metabolic acidosis mediates nephropathy progression, and its treatment with the comparatively inexpensive and well tolerated intervention of dietary acid reduction holds promise to be an additional kidney-protective strategy in CKD management.

### Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets for diabetic kidney disease [^111uLYtr]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease has a high global disease burden and substantially increases the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events. Despite treatment, there is substantial residual risk of disease progression with existing therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the molecular mechanisms driving diabetic kidney disease to help identify new therapies that slow progression and reduce associated risks. Diabetic kidney disease is initiated by diabetes-related disturbances in glucose metabolism, which then trigger other metabolic, hemodynamic, inflammatory, and fibrotic processes that contribute to disease progression. This review summarizes existing evidence on the molecular drivers of diabetic kidney disease onset and progression, focusing on inflammatory and fibrotic mediators-factors that are largely unaddressed as primary treatment targets and for which there is increasing evidence supporting key roles in the pathophysiology of diabetic kidney disease. Results from recent clinical trials highlight promising new drug therapies, as well as a role for dietary strategies, in treating diabetic kidney disease.

### An integrative review of the methodology and findings regarding dietary adherence in end stage kidney disease [^1124DSV6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is increasing rapidly. Driven by an aging population and increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and hypertension, approximately 1 in 8 adults globally are known to have CKD; and it is estimated that about 2% of these individuals with CKD will progress to End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD). An appropriate diet can slow progression of CKD to ESKD; ameliorate the complications of CKD and ESKD, and increase survival, making dietary modification a critical part of the management of CKD and ESKD.

There is no standard renal diet. Instead, a progressive accumulation of dietary restrictions occurs as patients' progress from CKD to ESKD. Typically, people with early CKD need to modify their intake of protein and sodium. In contrast, people with ESKD need to modify their intake of kilojoules; their fluid and protein intake; reduce their intake of minerals, such as sodium, potassium and phosphate; and potentially increase their intake of vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, B, folate, B12 and zinc. Because of the large number of dietary modifications required, the diet for people with ESKD is considered by dietitians to be one of the most complex and restrictive therapeutic diets. Adults with ESKD also perceive diet to be complicated and contradictory to typical healthy eating advice. For example, fruits, vegetables and dairy products are often restricted in ESKD due to their potassium or phosphate content.

### Low protein diets for non-diabetic adults with chronic kidney disease [^1134NqDG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as reduced function of the kidneys present for 3 months or longer with adverse implications for health and survival. For several decades low protein diets have been proposed for participants with CKD with the aim of slowing the progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and delaying the onset of renal replacement therapy. However the relative benefits and harms of dietary protein restriction for preventing progression of CKD have not been resolved. This is an update of a systematic review first published in 2000 and updated in 2006, 2009 and 2018.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of low protein diets in preventing the natural progression of CKD towards ESKD and in delaying the need for commencing dialysis treatment in non-diabetic adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 7 September 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi RCTs in which adults with non-diabetic CKD (stages 3 to 5) not on dialysis were randomised to receive a very low protein intake (0.3 to 0.4 g/kg/day) compared with a low protein intake (0.5 to 0.6 g/kg/day) or a low protein intake compared with a normal protein intake (≥ 0.8 g/kg/day) for 12 months or more.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes (death, all causes), requirement for dialysis, adverse effects) the risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and summary statistics estimated using the random effects model. Where continuous scales of measurement were used (glomerular filtration rate (GFR), weight), these data were analysed as the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales had been used. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified 17 studies with 2996 analysed participants (range 19 to 840). Four larger multicentre studies were subdivided according to interventions so that the review included 21 separate data sets. Mean duration of participant follow-up ranged from 12 to 50 months. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were considered at low risk of bias in eleven and nine studies respectively. All studies were considered at high risk for performance bias as they were open-label studies. We assessed detection bias for outcome assessment for GFR and ESKD separately. As GFR measurement was a laboratory outcome all studies were assessed at low risk of detection bias. For ESKD, nine studies were at low risk of detection bias as the need to commence dialysis was determined by personnel independent of the study investigators. Five studies were assessed at high risk of attrition bias with eleven studies at low risk. Ten studies were at high risk for reporting bias as they did not include data which could be included in a meta-analysis. Eight studies reported funding from government bodies while the remainder did not report on funding. Ten studies compared a low protein diet with a normal protein diet in participants with CKD categories 3a and b (9 studies) or 4 (one study). There was probably little or no difference in the numbers of participants who died (5 studies 1680 participants: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.18; 13 fewer deaths per 1000; moderate certainty evidence). A low protein diet may make little or no difference in the number of participants who reached ESKD compared with a normal protein diet (6 studies, 1814 participants: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.53; 7 more per 1000 reached ESKD; low certainty evidence). It remains uncertain whether a low protein diet compared with a normal protein intake impacts on the outcome of final or change in GFR (8 studies, 1680 participants: SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.38; very low certainty evidence). Eight studies compared a very low protein diet with a low protein diet and two studies compared a very low protein diet with a normal protein diet. A very low protein intake compared with a low protein intake probably made little or no difference to death (6 studies, 681 participants: RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.54; 10 more deaths per 1000; moderate certainty evidence). However it probably reduces the number who reach ESKD (10 studies, 1010 participants: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; 165 per 1000 fewer reached ESKD; moderate certainty evidence). It remains uncertain whether a very low protein diet compared with a low or normal protein intake influences the final or change in GFR (6 studies, 456 participants: SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.52; very low certainty evidence). Final body weight was reported in only three studies. It is uncertain whether the intervention alters final body weight (3 studies, 89 participants: MD -0.40 kg, 95% CI -6.33 to 5.52; very low certainty evidence). Twelve studies reported no evidence of protein energy wasting (malnutrition) in their study participants while three studies reported small numbers of participants in each group with protein energy wasting. Most studies reported that adherence to diet was satisfactory. Quality of life was not formally assessed in any studies.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found that very low protein diets probably reduce the number of people with CKD 4 or 5, who progress to ESKD. In contrast low protein diets may make little difference to the number of people who progress to ESKD. Low or very low protein diets probably do not influence death. However there are limited data on adverse effects such as weight differences and protein energy wasting. There are no data on whether quality of life is impacted by difficulties in adhering to protein restriction. Studies evaluating the adverse effects and the impact on quality of life of dietary protein restriction are required before these dietary approaches can be recommended for widespread use.

### Diets for patients with chronic kidney disease, should we reconsider? [^113t9L98]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Why is dietary counseling used so infrequently? We believe there are four major reasons: 1) designing the diets is complex and requires a skilled dietician which can be costly (in the U.S. this cost is paid for Medicare recipients). 2) Changing the diet can be complicated when there are other illnesses. 3) There is concern that low-protein diet could cause loss of protein stores or other complications. 4) The outcomes from the MDRD trial led to the conclusion that low-protein diets did not significantly slow progression in non-diabetic, CKD patients.

### Risks and benefits of different dietary patterns in CKD [^116FPkJv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Food has the potential to cause and exacerbate many lifestyle diseases. Or it can be used to prevent and treat illnesses like primary hypertension, the metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance. In parallel, there is also a growing body of evidence of the role of diet in the treatment of kidney disease and its ensuing complications. Popular diets for this purpose have included low-carbohydrate diets, including the ketogenic diet, and higher carbohydrate diets like Mediterranean diets and other plant-based dietary patterns. Low-carbohydrate diets have not shown harm in patients with kidney disease and may benefit a select few. Mediterranean diets have an established record of cardioprotective benefits but also may be beneficial for the kidney. Intermittent fasting has benefits for metabolic health, but limited research exists on the risk or benefit for patients with kidney disease. Plant-based diets, especially those that are lower in protein, may slow kidney disease progression, mitigate uremia, and delay dialysis initiation. Although each dietary pattern has its unique pros and cons, most healthful dietary patterns favor the inclusion of whole, unprocessed foods, preferably from plant-based sources. In this perspective, we discuss the risks and benefits of major popular diets to help guide health care professionals in treating patients with kidney disease.

### Diets for patients with chronic kidney disease, should we reconsider? [^111Fx1hj]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We conclude that integrating dietary manipulations into a comprehensive strategy will help prevent or ameliorate complications of CKD including acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and uremic symptoms and possibly influence CKD progression. We believe particular attention should be paid: 1) to correcting metabolic acidosis with either sodium bicarbonate supplements or more simply with diet instructions how to include supplements of fruits and vegetables; and 2) to lower the intake of sodium chloride as well as phosphates by choosing foods that provide low contents of these ions. Changing the diet by concentrating on these dietary constituents will allow us to maximize the renoprotective anti-proteinuric effect of renin angiotensin system blockers. These considerations on dietary approaches for CKD prevention and management are particularly valuable for low-resource setting worldwide where patients with CKD are beset with numerous challenges often traceable to poverty and a lack of access to life-saving dialysis and transplantation. The feasibility of these management approaches for CKD and its risk factors even in low-income countries is exemplified by the program set up in the communities of Eastern Nepal in collaboration with the International Society of Nephrology (ISN). Dietary recommendation of low-sodium intake and increase of fruits and vegetable together with low-cost anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic or renoprotective drugs as deemed appropriate, have been able to control proteinuria and slow renal function decline in more than a third of 3,400 individuals on active monitoring.

Regarding the very low protein diet with essential keto acids and amino acids regimen, there is recent and reassuring evidence for its efficacy and nutritionally safety but efforts are needed to improve compliance with dietary regimens. Nutritional educational programs and dieticians could help to increase patient adherence to dietary recommendations. We also recommend that components of the diet and regular monitoring of nutritional status should be jointly assessed by physicians and dieticians, just as recommended for patients with inherited metabolic defects, cirrhosis and diabetes.

### Novel dietary and pharmacologic approaches for acid-base modulation to preserve kidney function and manage uremia [^113kTDdq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review mechanisms for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression that might be addressed with nonpharmacologic and novel pharmacologic interventions as strategies by which to slow or even prevent CKD progression.

Recent Findings

Evolving data support the contribution of the broad spectrum of disorders of acid (H) accumulation, which we refer to as 'H stress', to CKD progression. Recent studies support that amelioration of H stress, including spectra of H accumulation that are insufficient to cause metabolic acidosis, is kidney-protective. In addition, gut-derived toxins appear to contribute to CKD progression and to the well described increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with CKD. Dietary and novel pharmacologic interventions hold promise as strategies to slow CKD progression through reducing levels of these gut-derived toxins. In addition, oxidative stress appears to mediate CKD progression and contributing factors like diet and cigarette smoking can exacerbate oxidative stress. Dietary changes and smoking cessation hold promise to favorably affect CKD progression by reducing kidney oxidative stress.

Summary

The urgent need to add to the traditional armamentarium of blood pressure control and antiangiotensin II pharmacologic therapy for kidney protection has led to investigations into additional kidney-protective strategies. Acid stress, a disordered gut microbiome, and oxidative stress each appear to contribute to CKD progression and can be potentially addressed by nonpharmacologic and novel pharmacologic interventions.

### Nutritional and dietary interventions to prolong renal allograft survival after kidney transplantation [^115zfwW7]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diet plays an important role in slowing progression of chronic kidney disease in native and transplanted kidneys. There is limited evidence on the association on dietary intake with renal allograft function. Mechanisms of major nutrients and dietary patterns with focusing on a plant-based diet related to kidney transplant health and longevity are reviewed.

Recent Findings

High dietary protein intake may adversely affect renal allograft. Low protein plant-focused diets such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, plant-dominant low-protein diet and Mediterranean diets appear associated with favorable outcomes in slowing renal allograft function decline. The mechanism may be related to a change in renal hemodynamic by decreasing glomerular hyperfiltration from low dietary protein intake and plant-based ingredients. Recent observational studies of association between dietary protein intake and kidney allograft outcomes are conflicting. Although strong evidence is still lacking, a low protein diet of 0.6–0.8g/kg/day with at least 50% of the protein source from plant-based components in kidney transplant recipients with stable kidney allograft function should be considered as the dietary target.

Summary

Dietary intervention with low-protein plant-focused meals may improve outcomes in kidney transplant recipients, but the evidence remains limited and further studies are warranted.

### Altered dietary salt intake for people with chronic kidney disease [^1139T1xG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Salt intake shows great promise as a modifiable risk factor for reducing heart disease incidence and delaying kidney function decline in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, a clear consensus of the benefits of reducing salt in people with CKD is lacking.

Objectives

This review evaluated the benefits and harms of altering dietary salt intake in people with CKD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 13 January 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared two or more levels of salt intake in people with any stage of CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and conducted risk of bias evaluation. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Mean effect sizes were calculated using the random-effects models.

Main Results

We included eight studies (24 reports, 258 participants). Because duration of the included studies was too short (1 to 26 weeks) to test the effect of salt restriction on endpoints such as mortality, cardiovascular events or CKD progression, changes in salt intake on blood pressure and other secondary risk factors were applied. Three studies were parallel RCTs and five were cross-over studies. Selection bias was low in five studies and unclear in three. Performance and detection biases were low in two studies and unclear in six. Attrition and reporting biases were low in four studies and unclear in four. One study had the potential for high carryover effect; three had high risk of bias from baseline characteristics (change of medication or diet) and two studies were industry funded. There was a significant reduction in 24 hour sodium excretion associated with low salt interventions (range 52 to 141 mmol) (8 studies, 258 participants: MD -105.86 mmol/d, 95% CI -119.20 to -92.51; I(2) = 51%). Reducing salt intake significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (8 studies, 258 participants: MD -8.75 mm Hg, 95% CI -11.33 to -6.16; I(2) = 0%) and diastolic blood pressure (8 studies, 258 participants: MD -3.70 mm Hg, 95% CI -5.09 to -2.30; I(2) = 0%). One study reported restricting salt intake reduced the risk of oedema by 56%. Salt restriction significantly increased plasma renin activity (2 studies, 71 participants: MD 1.08 ng/mL/h, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; I(2) = 0%) and serum aldosterone (2 studies, 71 participants: 6.20 ng/dL (95% CI 3.82 to 8.58; I(2) = 0%). Antihypertensive medication dosage was significantly reduced with a low salt diet (2 studies, 52 participants): RR 5.48, 95% CI 1.27 to 23.66; I(2) = 0%). There was no significant difference in eGFR (2 studies, 68 participants: MD -1.14 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -4.38 to 2.11; I(2) = 0%), creatinine clearance (3 studies, 85 participants): MD -4.60 mL/min, 95% CI -11.78 to 2.57; I(2) = 0%), serum creatinine (5 studies, 151 participants: MD 5.14 µmol/L, 95% CI -8.98 to 19.26; I(2) = 59%) or body weight (5 studies, 139 participants: MD -1.46 kg; 95% CI -4.55 to 1.64; I(2) = 0%). There was no significant change in total cholesterol in relation to salt restriction (3 studies, 105 participants: MD -0.23 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.10; I(2) = 0%) or symptomatic hypotension (2 studies, 72 participants: RR 6.60, 95% CI 0.77 to 56.55; I(2) = 0%). Salt restriction significantly reduced urinary protein excretion in all studies that reported proteinuria as an outcome, however data could not be meta-analysed.

Authors' Conclusions

We found a critical evidence gap in long-term effects of salt restriction in people with CKD that meant we were unable to determine the direct effects of sodium restriction on primary endpoints such as mortality and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). We found that salt reduction in people with CKD reduced blood pressure considerably and consistently reduced proteinuria. If such reductions could be maintained long-term, this effect may translate to clinically significant reductions in ESKD incidence and cardiovascular events. Research into the long-term effects of sodium-restricted diet for people with CKD is warranted, as is investigation into adherence to a low salt diet.

### Low protein diets in patients with chronic kidney disease: a bridge between mainstream and complementary-alternative medicines? [^1111onZz]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in the new millennium: why is it difficult to measure progression?

At the beginning of the new millennium, "renal insufficiency" was redefined and CKD became an umbrella term encompassing several affections having variable evolution rates towards end-stage kidney disease (ESRD). The staging of CKD underlines the similarities of all advanced kidney diseases, despite different progression rates which depend upon race, age and underlying nephropathy.

Therapies aimed at slowing CKD progression have to deal with high baseline heterogeneity that hinders the demonstration of their long-term advantages and drawbacks. Even the method that is used to measure progression rate is a matter of controversy. Furthermore, differences in the hard outcomes, namely start of dialysis or death, require trials with long observation times which are expensive and are often affected by many confounding factors.

Several studies have focused on different therapeutic goals which may partially overlap: these goals include removing the cause of CKD, treating the metabolic derangements, correcting lifestyle habits that are not necessarily consequent to CKD but that may potentially worsen the diseases, and reducing the work-load on the remnant nephrons.

Dietary interventions in general, and low protein diets in particular may play a role at all these levels by, for example, treating obesity, correcting hypophosphataemia, avoiding processed foods, and most importantly, reducing the work-load on the remnant nephrons.

Furthermore, the outcome measure is non-univocal: slowing the progression of CKD is not synonymous of delaying dialysis.

Long-term follow-up of either homogeneous populations with similar baseline progression rates or of very large cohorts is ideally needed to demonstrate an effect of dietary interventions (and, indeed, one of the observations of the famous MDRD study was that it would have probably given different results over a longer follow-up). The initial GFR decrease, achieved by "renal rest", or correction of the relative hyperfiltration may interfere with short-term analyses.

### Dietary phosphate and the forgotten kidney patient: a critical need for FDA regulatory action [^114rYJ3h]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Careful dietary management that reduces high phosphate intake is recommended to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and prevent complications of CKD and may help reduce chronic disease risks such as incident CKD associated with high phosphate intake in the healthy general population. For patients treated with maintenance dialysis, control of serum phosphorus levels is considered a marker of good care and requires a coordinated plan that limits dietary phosphate intake, uses oral phosphate binders, and provides an adequate dialysis prescription. Even with traditional thrice-weekly hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, use of phosphate binders, and a concerted effort to limit dietary phosphate intake, adequately controlled serum phosphorus levels are not possible in all dialysis patients. Efforts to limit phosphate intake are thwarted by the underestimated and unquantified phosphate content of processed foods and some medications due to the hidden presence of phosphate additives or excipients added during processing or drug formulation. Effectively limiting phosphate intake could potentially be achieved through simple US Food and Drug Administration regulatory actions. Mandatory labeling of phosphate content on all packaged foods and drugs would enable identification of healthy low-phosphate foods and medications and permit critically important control of total phosphate intake. Simple changes in regulatory policy and labeling are warranted and would enable better management of dietary intake of phosphate at all stages of kidney disease, as well as potentially reduced health risks in the general population.

### Altered dietary salt intake for people with chronic kidney disease [^115A9CQA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence indicates that reducing dietary salt may reduce the incidence of heart disease and delay decline in kidney function in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is an update of a review first published in 2015.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of altering dietary salt for adults with CKD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 6 October 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing two or more levels of salt intake in adults with any stage of CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, conducted risk of bias evaluation and evaluated confidence in the evidence using GRADE. Results were summarised using random effects models as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 21 studies (1197 randomised participants), 12 in the earlier stages of CKD (779 randomised participants), seven in dialysis (363 randomised participants) and two in post-transplant (55 randomised participants). Selection bias was low in seven studies, high in one and unclear in 13. Performance and detection biases were low in four studies, high in two, and unclear in 15. Attrition and reporting biases were low in 10 studies, high in three and unclear in eight. Because duration of the included studies was too short (1 to 36 weeks) to test the effect of salt restriction on endpoints such as death, cardiovascular events or CKD progression, changes in salt intake on blood pressure and other secondary risk factors were examined. Reducing salt by mean -73.51 mmol/day (95% CI -92.76 to -54.27), equivalent to 4.2 g or 1690 mg sodium/day, reduced systolic/diastolic blood pressure by -6.91/-3.91 mm Hg (95% CI -8.82 to -4.99/-4.80 to -3.02; 19 studies, 1405 participants; high certainty evidence). Albuminuria was reduced by 36% (95% CI 26 to 44) in six studies, five of which were carried out in people in the earlier stages of CKD (MD -0.44, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.30; 501 participants; high certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lower salt intake on weight, as the weight change observed (-1.32 kg, 95% CI -1.94 to -0.70; 12 studies, 759 participants) may have been due to fluid volume, lean tissue, or body fat. Lower salt intake may reduce extracellular fluid volume in the earlier stages of CKD (-0.87 L, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.58; 3 studies; 187 participants; low certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lower salt intake on reduction in antihypertensive dose (RR 2.45, 95% CI 0.98 to 6.08; 8 studies; 754 participants). Lower salt intake may lead to symptomatic hypotension (RR 6.70, 95% CI 2.40 to 18.69; 6 studies; 678 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Data were sparse for other types of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high certainty evidence that salt reduction reduced blood pressure in people with CKD, and albuminuria in people with earlier stage CKD in the short-term. If such reductions could be maintained long-term, this effect may translate to clinically significant reductions in CKD progression and cardiovascular events. Research into the long-term effects of sodium-restricted diet for people with CKD is warranted.

### Dietary management of chronic kidney disease: protein restriction and beyond [^116YyGv4]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

More kidney protective strategies are needed to reduce the burden of complete kidney failure from chronic kidney disease (CKD). Clinicians sometimes use protein restriction as kidney protection despite its demonstrated lack of effectiveness in the only large-scale study. Small-scale studies support that dietary acid reduction is kidney-protective, including when done with base-inducing foods like fruits and vegetables. We review these studies in light of current kidney-protective recommendations.

Recent Findings

Animal models of CKD show that acid-inducing dietary protein exacerbates and base-inducing protein ameliorates nephropathy progression, and that increased intake of acid-inducing but not base-inducing dietary protein exacerbates progression. Clinical studies show that dietary acid reduction with Na-based alkali reduces kidney injury and slows nephropathy progression in patients with CKD and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR); base-inducing fruits and vegetables reduce kidney injury in patients with reduced GFR; and base-inducing fruits and vegetables improve metabolic acidosis in CKD.

Summary

Protein type rather than amount might more importantly affect nephropathy progression. Base-inducing foods might be another way to reduce dietary acid, a strategy shown in small studies to slow nephropathy progression. Further studies will determine if CKD patients should be given base-inducing food as part of their management.

### Dietary interventions for adults with chronic kidney disease [^112DA9GB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary changes are routinely recommended in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the basis of randomised evidence in the general population and non-randomised studies in CKD that suggest certain healthy eating patterns may prevent cardiovascular events and lower mortality. People who have kidney disease have prioritised dietary modifications as an important treatment uncertainty.

Objectives

This review evaluated the benefits and harms of dietary interventions among adults with CKD including people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register (up to 31 January 2017) through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised RCTs of dietary interventions versus other dietary interventions, lifestyle advice, or standard care assessing mortality, cardiovascular events, health-related quality of life, and biochemical, anthropomorphic, and nutritional outcomes among people with CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. Results were summarised as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) or standardised MD (SMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or in descriptive format when meta-analysis was not possible. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 17 studies involving 1639 people with CKD. Three studies enrolled 341 people treated with dialysis, four studies enrolled 168 kidney transplant recipients, and 10 studies enrolled 1130 people with CKD stages 1 to 5. Eleven studies (900 people) evaluated dietary counselling with or without lifestyle advice and six evaluated dietary patterns (739 people), including one study (191 people) of a carbohydrate-restricted low-iron, polyphenol enriched diet, two studies (181 people) of increased fruit and vegetable intake, two studies (355 people) of a Mediterranean diet and one study (12 people) of a high protein/low carbohydrate diet. Risks of bias in the included studies were generally high or unclear, lowering confidence in the results. Participants were followed up for a median of 12 months (range 1 to 46.8 months). Studies were not designed to examine all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events. In very-low quality evidence, dietary interventions had uncertain effects on all-cause mortality or ESKD. In absolute terms, dietary interventions may prevent one person in every 3000 treated for one year avoiding ESKD, although the certainty in this effect was very low. Across all 17 studies, outcome data for cardiovascular events were sparse. Dietary interventions in low quality evidence were associated with a higher health-related quality of life (2 studies, 119 people: MD in SF-36 score 11.46, 95% CI 7.73 to 15.18; I² = 0%). Adverse events were generally not reported. Dietary interventions lowered systolic blood pressure (3 studies, 167 people: MD -9.26 mm Hg, 95% CI -13.48 to -5.04; I² = 80%) and diastolic blood pressure (2 studies, 95 people: MD -8.95, 95% CI -10.69 to -7.21; I² = 0%) compared to a control diet. Dietary interventions were associated with a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (5 studies, 219 people: SMD 1.08; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.97; I² = 88%) and serum albumin levels (6 studies, 541 people: MD 0.16 g/dL, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.24; I² = 26%). A Mediterranean diet lowered serum LDL cholesterol levels (1 study, 40 people: MD -1.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.44).

Authors' Conclusions

Dietary interventions have uncertain effects on mortality, cardiovascular events and ESKD among people with CKD as these outcomes were rarely measured or reported. Dietary interventions may increase health-related quality of life, eGFR, and serum albumin, and lower blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels. Based on stakeholder prioritisation of dietary research in the setting of CKD and preliminary evidence of beneficial effects on risks factors for clinical outcomes, large-scale pragmatic RCTs to test the effects of dietary interventions on patient outcomes are required.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^116RcBnG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — dietary protein restriction in diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1 to 4: Management of diabetes and CKD should include nutritional intervention. A dietary protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day (about 10% of total calories), the recommended daily allowance (RDA), has been achieved in intervention studies and in 2 meta-analyses low-protein diets reduced risks of progression of albuminuria/proteinuria and loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The Work Group concluded that limiting dietary protein to the RDA level of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day should stabilize or reduce albuminuria, slow the decrease in GFR, and may prevent CKD stage 5; the current recommendation for dietary protein in diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4 represents an update to the diet recommended by the NKF-KDOQI CPGs for Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents in CKD. In people with type 1 diabetes and stage 2 CKD, a modest limitation (0.89 versus 1.02 g/kg body weight per day) reduced the risk of CKD stage 5 or death (relative risk [RR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.72; P = 0.04).

### Con: the role of diet for people with advanced stage 5 CKD [^111ByGXY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Restriction of dietary protein intake has been used in the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) for many decades, yet remains controversial, with marked variations in its application in clinical practice. There is extensive literature on the subject, with some expert opinion advocating the use of protein restriction based on the balance of the available evidence. The largest randomized trial of low-protein diets is the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study. Despite multiple secondary analyses, the essential intention-to-treat analysis failed to demonstrate a benefit in the primary outcome of rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate. There are criticisms of many published studies and meta-analyses, including the likelihood of publication bias and unsuitable biochemical endpoints that may be affected by dietary restriction in the absence of effects on kidney function, leading to false positive findings. It is also uncertain whether any benefits observed in these often older studies would be derived in patients undergoing modern standards of CKD management, including blood pressure control and renin-angiotensin blockade. Thus it is unclear whether, even in the strictly controlled environment of a clinical study, low-protein diets significantly slow CKD progression. Important questions exist regarding the applicability of these diets in routine clinical practice. Even in carefully selected study populations with intensive dietetic input, adherence to low-protein diets is poor. It is likely that only a small minority of CKD patients in routine practice could adhere to these diets, and although risks of malnutrition arising from protein restriction are uncertain, they will be greater in less supervised care outside of studies.

### Nutrition in kidney disease: core curriculum 2022 [^116RsAK3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

As chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses, the requirements and utilization of different nutrients change substantially. These changes are accompanied by multiple nutritional and metabolic abnormalities that are observed in the continuum of kidney disease. To provide optimal care to patients with CKD, it is essential to have an understanding of the applicable nutritional principles: methods to assess nutritional status, establish patient-specific dietary needs, and prevent or treat potential or ongoing nutritional deficiencies and derangements. This installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology provides current information on these issues for the practicing clinician and allied health care workers and features basic, practical information on epidemiology, assessment, etiology, and prevention and management of nutritional considerations in patients with kidney disease. Specific emphasis is made on dietary intake and recommendations for dietary patterns, and macro- and micronutrients. In addition, special conditions such as acute kidney injury and approaches to obesity treatment are reviewed.

### Protein restriction for diabetic kidney disease [^115QeEaX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) continues to be the leading cause of kidney failure across the world. For decades dietary protein restriction has been proposed for patients with DKD with the aim to retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) towards kidney failure. However, the relative benefits and harms of dietary protein restriction for slowing the progression of DKD have not been addressed.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of low protein diets (LPD) (0.6 to 0.8 g/kg/day) in preventing the progression of CKD towards kidney failure and in reducing the incidence of kidney failure and death (any cause) in adult patients with DKD. Moreover, the effect of LPD on adverse events (e.g. malnutrition, hyperglycaemic events, or health-related quality of life (HRQoL)) and compliance were also evaluated.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 17 November 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs in which adults with DKD not on dialysis were randomised to receive either a LPD (0.6 to 0.8 g/kg/day) or a usual or unrestricted protein diet (UPD) (≥ 1.0 g/kg/day) for at least 12 months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model. Results were summarised as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised MD (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We identified eight studies involving 486 participants with DKD. The prescribed protein intake in the intervention groups ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg/day. The prescribed protein intake in the control groups was ≥ 1.0 g/kg/day, or a calculated protein intake ≥ 1.0 g/kg/day if data on prescribed protein intake were not provided. The mean duration of the interventions was two years (ranging from one to five years). Risks of bias in most of the included studies were high or unclear, most notably for allocation concealment, performance and detection bias. All studies were considered to be at high risk for performance bias due to the nature of the interventions. Most studies were not designed to examine death or kidney failure. In low certainty evidence, a LPD may have little or no effect on death (5 studies, 358 participants: RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.44; I² = 0%), and the number of participants who reached kidney failure (4 studies, 287 participants: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.59; I² = 0%). Compared to a usual or unrestricted protein intake, it remains uncertain whether a LPD slows the decline of glomerular filtration rate over time (7 studies, 367 participants: MD -0.73 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, 95% CI -2.3 to 0.83; I² = 53%; very low certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether the restriction of dietary protein intake impacts on the annual decline in creatinine clearance (3 studies, 203 participants: MD -2.39 mL/min/year, 95% CI -5.87 to 1.08; I² = 53%). There was only one study reporting 24-hour urinary protein excretion. In very low certainty evidence, a LPD had uncertain effects on the annual change in proteinuria (1 study, 80 participants: MD 0.90 g/24 hours, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.31). There was no evidence of malnutrition in seven studies, while one study noted this condition in the LPD group. Participant compliance with a LPD was unsatisfactory in nearly half of the studies. One study reported LPD had no effect on HRQoL. No studies reported hyperglycaemic events.

Authors' Conclusions

Dietary protein restriction has uncertain effects on changes in kidney function over time. However, it may make little difference to the risk of death and kidney failure. Questions remain about protein intake levels and compliance with protein-restricted diets. There are limited data on HRQoL and adverse effects such as nutritional measures and hyperglycaemic events. Large-scale pragmatic RCTs with sufficient follow-up are required for different stages of CKD.

### Diabetic nephropathy: recent advances in pathophysiology and challenges in dietary management [^116mz1Ff]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this review summarizes the recent advances in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy and the importance of dietary factors in modifying treatment outcomes for patients. A critical analysis of studies that emphasize the importance of patient-centered dietary intervention in successful management of advanced CKD patients has been presented. Large-scale cohort studies are necessary to evaluate the efficiency of diet as a new therapeutic paradigm. Nevertheless, proactive personalized diet-management plans tailored to the disease stage is likely to be the future trend in diabetic nephropathy therapy as it will have a large impact on the patient's quality of life and may prolong survival. Notably, in newly diagnosed DN patients these dietary interventions may no longer be regarded as complementary measures but significant factors that delay progression of the disease.

### Dietary intake and gut microbiome in CKD [^116FXhyv]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gut dysbiosis, characterized by an imbalance in the gut microbiota, has emerged as a potential factor influencing chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. This condition plays a crucial role in the gut-kidney axis, where changes in microbial composition can contribute to systemic inflammation and uremic toxin production and ultimately exacerbate kidney damage. Understanding the dynamics of the gut-kidney axis provides new insights into potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate CKD progression. Diet is the primary driver of gut microbiota composition. Therefore, an approach emphasizing healthy nutritional patterns is recommended for improving overall health, cardiovascular disease, and profoundly altered metabolic patterns in CKD patients. Dietary modifications have been explored as therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome to improve outcomes in CKD. An emerging therapeutic target is the production of dysmetabolites by the gut microbiota, which may help alleviate uremic and cardiovascular toxicity. Additionally, future research should broaden the scope to include other microorganisms, such as fungi, archaea, and viruses. This expanded focus will enable a more comprehensive understanding of the gut-kidney axis and pave the way for more personalized and effective treatment strategies for CKD patients. This review explores the role of lifestyle, particularly diet, in kidney health, highlights new gut microbiome therapies, and identifies research opportunities in CKD.

### Caring for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: dietary options and conservative care instead of maintenance dialysis [^113Reg7h]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

An expert advisory board discussed the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a focus on dietary options. This is timely, given the uptake of value based models for kidney care in the United States. Timing of dialysis start is influenced by patients' clinical status and complex patient-clinician interactions. Patients value personal freedom and quality of life and may want to delay dialysis, whilst physicians are sometimes more concerned with clinical outcomes. Kidney-preserving therapy can prolong the dialysis-free period and preserve residual kidney function, thus patients are asked to adjust their lifestyle and diet, to follow a low- or very low-protein diet, with or without ketoacid analogues. Multi-modal approaches include pharmacotherapies, management of symptoms, and a gradual, individualized dialysis transition. Patient empowerment is vital, including CKD education and involvement in decision making. These ideas may help patients, their families, and clinical teams to improve the management of CKD.

### Plant-based diets to manage the risks and complications of chronic kidney disease [^113KcXG9]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Traditional dietary recommendations for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) focus on the quantity of nutrients consumed. Without appropriate dietary counselling, these restrictions can result in a low intake of fruits and vegetables and a lack of diversity in the diet. Plant nutrients and plant-based diets could have beneficial effects in patients with CKD: increased fibre intake shifts the gut microbiota towards reduced production of uraemic toxins; plant fats, particularly olive oil, have anti-atherogenic effects; plant anions might mitigate metabolic acidosis and slow CKD progression; and as plant phosphorus has a lower bioavailability than animal phosphorus, plant-based diets might enable better control of hyperphosphataemia. Current evidence suggests that promoting the adoption of plant-based diets has few risks but potential benefits for the primary prevention of CKD, as well as for delaying progression in patients with CKD G3–5. These diets might also help to manage and prevent some of the symptoms and metabolic complications of CKD. We suggest that restriction of plant foods as a strategy to prevent hyperkalaemia or undernutrition should be individualized to avoid depriving patients with CKD of these potential beneficial effects of plant-based diets. However, research is needed to address knowledge gaps, particularly regarding the relevance and extent of diet-induced hyperkalaemia in patients undergoing dialysis.

### Kidney nutrition for value-based care models: the role of low protein diets and keto-analogue supplementation to delay dialysis [^117FxsqY]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Government-led end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) programs in most countries primarily focus on quality and safety measures for dialysis initiation and management. However, in the United States, chronic kidney disease (CKD) management may be shifting upstream of ESKD toward value-based care models that prioritize delaying dialysis initiation and improving outcomes for patients with advanced CKD (stages 4 and 5 CKD). Nutritional interventions, particularly low and very low protein diets supplemented with keto-analogues of amino acids, are re-emerging as key strategies to reduce nitrogenous waste production, manage uremia, and slow CKD progression without causing malnutrition. Indeed, supplemented diets can help correct protein-energy wasting. Clinical trials and meta-analyses suggest that these diets can prolong dialysis-free periods and improve quality of life, although patient adherence and careful monitoring are crucial. This approach maintains nutritional status while adjunct therapies, such as blood pressure control, volume management with diuretics, improved glycemic control, and anemia treatment with new oral medications, can manage comorbidities effectively without dialysis. Patients on such dietary regimens and their care partners often experience fewer unpleasant symptoms, greater satisfaction, and reduced transportation burdens. Unlike disease progression pharmacotherapies that are frequently associated with hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, infections, and weight loss in advanced CKD, nutritional interventions are usually safe and patient-centered. Incorporating nutritional strategies into value-based care aligns with cost-effectiveness, preservation of residual kidney function, and end-of-life planning, offering a holistic approach to CKD management. These interventions also support incremental dialysis transition, where keto-analogue supplemented very low protein diets continue on non-dialysis days vs. higher protein intake on dialysis days 1–2 times/week. Whereas quality and safety measures are needed to assess diet program success, integrating nutritional strategies with adjunct pharmacotherapy in value-based care models offers a multimodal, cost-effective strategy to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs for patients with advanced CKD without dialysis or with less frequent dialysis.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^115vbAsB]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Accumulating evidence identifies acidosis not only as a consequence of, but as a contributor to, kidney disease progression. Several mechanistic pathways have been identified in this regard. The dietary acid load, even in the absence of overt acidosis, may have deleterious effects. Several small trials now suggest that the treatment of acidosis with oral alkali can slow the progression of kidney disease.

### Low protein diets in patients with chronic kidney disease: a bridge between mainstream and complementary-alternative medicines? [^111doeaK]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conversely, delaying dialysis requires attaining stable metabolic balance that is, at least partly, independent of GFR. However, the analysis of this short term goal is only apparently easier since it is deeply entangled with the pharmacological "mainstream approach" and reflects various policies of dialysis start which are not merely based upon (relatively) simple measures, such as GFR. The new Canadian guidelines on dialysis start clearly underline that whenever an "intent to defer" policy is chosen, wise clinical judgement cannot be replaced by formulae.

Heterogeneity of diseases, heterogeneity of progression, and heterogeneity of goals and measures add to the charm, but also to the complexity of the analysis of dietary approaches in CKD patients. Without a change in the approach, the issue will probably remain open forever.

Low-protein diets in CKD: why is the evidence not evident enough?

Many of the questions posed in the 1986 paper published in the Lancet entitled: "Dietary treatment for chronic renal failure, ten unanswered questions" are currently still unanswered. Among them, some highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of chronic kidney disease (Does chronic renal failure always progress?), while others underline the difficulties in standardization of low protein diets in clinical practice (When should a low-protein diet start? Which low-protein diet? How should we assess progression, nutritional status or compliance?). However, in the literature there are several evidence-based demonstrations of the possible role low protein diets may play in delaying ESRD, including several RCTs and a Cochrane review. Furthermore, we are not aware of any large studies demonstrating a higher progression rate in non-malnourished, on-diet patients; in addition, data on lower costs are concordant, and there is no evidence showing that being on the diet results in any survival disadvantage after the start of dialysis.

### Eleven reasons to control the protein intake of patients with chronic kidney disease [^1165YFLh]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

For many years patients with chronic kidney disease have been advised to control the protein content of their diet. This advice has been given on the basis of a number of reported metabolic effects of lowering protein intake, such as lowering serum urea nitrogen levels, improving phosphocalcic metabolism and insulin resistance and, more recently, ameliorating proteinuria (independent of antiproteinuric medications). The effects on the progression of kidney disease, although spectacular in experimental studies, have been less convincing in humans. It is possible that flawed design of clinical trials is responsible for this discrepancy. In this Review, we comment on experimental findings that indicate that limiting protein intake protects the kidney and ameliorates uremic symptoms, outline how the body adapts to a reduction in protein intake, and describe the metabolic benefits to the patient. We then review the evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses that pertains to the effects of low-protein diets in adults with chronic kidney disease.

### Altered dietary salt intake for preventing diabetic kidney disease and its progression [^113tnCV4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is strong evidence that our current consumption of salt is a major factor in the development of increased blood pressure (BP) and that a reduction in our salt intake lowers BP, whether BP levels are normal or raised initially. Effective control of BP in people with diabetes lowers the risk of strokes, heart attacks and heart failure and slows the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with diabetes. This is an update of a review first published in 2010.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of altered salt intake on BP and markers of cardiovascular disease and of CKD in people with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 31 March 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of altered salt intake in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Studies were included when there was a difference between low and high sodium intakes of at least 34 mmol/day.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies and resolved differences by discussion. We calculated mean effect sizes as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random-effects model. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Thirteen RCTs (313 participants), including 21 comparisons (studies), met our inclusion criteria. One RCT (two studies) was added to this review update. Participants included 99 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 214 individuals with type 2 diabetes. Two RCTs (four studies) included some participants with reduced overall kidney function. The remaining studies either reported that participants with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were excluded from the study or only included participants with microalbuminuria and normal GFR. Five studies used a parallel study design, and 16 used a cross-over design. Studies were at high risk of bias for most criteria. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were adequate in only three and two studies, respectively. One study was at low risk of bias for blinding of participants and outcome assessment, but no studies were at low risk for selective reporting. Twelve studies reported non-commercial funding sources, three reported conflicts of interest, and eight reported adequate washout between interventions in cross-over studies. The median net reduction in 24-hour urine sodium excretion (24-hour UNa) in seven long-term studies (treatment duration four to 12 weeks) was 76 mmol (range 51 to 124 mmol), and in 10 short-term studies (treatment duration five to seven days) was 187 mmol (range 86 to 337 mmol). Data were only available graphically in four studies. In long-term studies, reduced sodium intake may lower systolic BP (SBP) by 6.15 mm Hg (7 studies: 95% CI -9.27 to -3.03; I² = 12%), diastolic BP (DBP) by 3.41 mm Hg (7 studies: 95% CI -5.56 to -1.27; I² = 41%) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 4.60 mm Hg (4 studies: 95% CI -7.26 to -1.94; I² = 28%). In short-term studies, low sodium intake may reduce SBP by 8.43 mm Hg (5 studies: 95% CI -14.37 to -2.48; I² = 88%), DBP by 2.95 mm Hg (5 studies: 95% CI -4.96 to -0.94; I² = 70%) and MAP by 2.37 mm Hg (9 studies: 95% CI -4.75 to -0.01; I² = 65%). There was considerable heterogeneity in most analyses but particularly among short-term studies. All analyses were considered to be of low certainty evidence. SBP, DBP and MAP reductions may not differ between hypertensive and normotensive participants or between individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In hypertensive participants, SBP, DBP and MAP may be reduced by 6.45, 3.15 and 4.88 mm Hg, respectively, while in normotensive participants, they may be reduced by 8.43, 2.95 and 2.15 mm Hg, respectively (all low certainty evidence). SBP, DBP and MAP may be reduced by 7.35, 3.04 and 4.30 mm Hg, respectively, in participants with type 2 diabetes and by 7.35, 3.20, and 0.08 mm Hg, respectively, in participants with type 1 diabetes (all low certainty evidence). Eight studies provided measures of urinary protein excretion before and after salt restriction; four reported a reduction in urinary albumin excretion with salt restriction. Pooled analyses showed no changes in GFR (12 studies: MD -1.87 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.05 to 1.31; I² = 32%) or HbA1c (6 studies: MD -0.62, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.26; I² = 95%) with salt restriction (low certainty evidence). Body weight was reduced in studies lasting one to two weeks but not in studies lasting for longer periods (low certainty evidence). Adverse effects were reported in only one study; 11% and 21% developed postural hypotension on the low-salt diet and the low-salt diet combined with hydrochlorothiazide, respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review shows an important reduction in SBP and DBP in people with diabetes with normal GFR during short periods of salt restriction, similar to that obtained with single drug therapy for hypertension. These data support the international recommendations that people with diabetes with or without hypertension or evidence of kidney disease should reduce salt intake to less than 5 g/day (2 g sodium).

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^112Ns7Cs]. AND (2020). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1–4 — fruit and vegetable intake recommendation: In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest that prescribing increased fruit and vegetable intake may decrease body weight, blood pressure and net acid production (NEAP) (2C). Safety considerations highlight high intakes of fruit and vegetables in advanced stages of kidney disease, especially in regard to serum potassium control and adequacy of protein intake, and individualized support and follow-up may be required to support patients to implement complex dietary changes. There are no obvious costs associated with these interventions.

### Nutritional and dietary management of chronic kidney disease under conservative and preservative kidney care without dialysis [^111CBuUq]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

While dialysis has been the prevailing treatment paradigm for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), emphasis on conservative and preservative management in which dietary interventions are a major cornerstone have emerged. Based on high-quality evidence, international guidelines support the utilization of low-protein diets as an intervention to reduce CKD progression and mortality risk, although the precise thresholds (if any) for dietary protein intake vary across recommendations. There is also increasing evidence demonstrating that plant-dominant low-protein diets reduce the risk of developing incident CKD, CKD progression, and its related complications including cardiometabolic disease, metabolic acidosis, mineral and bone disorders, and uremic toxin generation. In this review, we discuss the premise for conservative and preservative dietary interventions, specific dietary approaches used in conservative and preservative care, potential benefits of a plant-dominant low-protein diet, and practical implementation of these nutritional strategies without dialysis.

### Effect of dietary protein restriction on the progression of kidney disease: long-term follow-up of the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) study [^117V9x4g]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The long-term effect of a low-protein diet on the progression of chronic kidney disease is unknown. We evaluated effects of protein restriction on kidney failure and all-cause mortality during extended follow-up of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study.

Methods

Study A was a randomized controlled trial from 1989 to 1993 of 585 patients with predominantly nondiabetic kidney disease and a moderate decrease in glomerular filtration rate (25 to 55 mL/min/1.73 m² [0.42 to 0.92 mL/s/1.73 m²]) assigned to a low- versus usual-protein diet (0.58 versus 1.3 g/kg/d). We used registries to ascertain the development of kidney failure (initiation of dialysis therapy or transplantation) or a composite of kidney failure and all-cause mortality through December 31, 2000. We used Cox regression models and intention-to-treat principles to compute hazard ratios for the low- versus usual-protein diet, adjusted for baseline glomerular filtration rate and other factors previously associated with the rate of decrease in glomerular filtration rate. We estimated hazard ratios for the entire follow-up period and then, in time-dependent analyses, separately for 2 consecutive 6-year periods of follow-up.

Results

Kidney failure and the composite outcome occurred in 327 (56%) and 380 patients (65%), respectively. After adjustment for baseline factors, hazard ratios were 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.12) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.08), respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios for both outcomes were lower during the first 6 years (0.68; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.93 and 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.87, respectively) than afterward (1.27; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.80 and 1.29; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.78; interaction P = 0.008 and 0.002, respectively). Limitations include lack of data for dietary intake and clinical conditions after conclusion of the trial.

Conclusion

The efficacy of a 2- to 3-year intervention of dietary protein restriction on progression of nondiabetic kidney disease remains inconclusive. Future studies should include a longer duration of intervention and follow-up.

### Effect of dietary potassium restriction on serum potassium, disease progression, and mortality in chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117HDskV]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Low-potassium diets are recommended to reduce serum potassium (Sk) and prevent complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but evidence underpinning this recommendation has not been systematically reviewed and synthesized. We conducted a systematic review comparing change in Sk, CKD progression, and mortality between those on a low-potassium versus unrestricted potassium diet.

Methods

We searched Medline, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.org from inception to 3 April 2018. We included randomized and observational studies that compared these outcomes in adults with CKD who ate a restricted versus unrestricted amount of dietary potassium. We pooled mean change in Sk and adjusted hazard ratios of disease progression and mortality using random-effects meta-analyses.

Results

We identified 5,563 articles, of which seven studies (3,489 participants) met our inclusion criteria. We found very low-quality evidence that restricted (1,295 mg/d) versus unrestricted (1,570 mg/d) dietary potassium lowered Sk by -0.22 mEq/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.33, -0.10; I² = 0%). Lower (1,725 mg/d) versus higher (4,558 mg/d) dietary potassium was not significantly associated with disease progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.70; I² = 57%). Lower (1,670 mg/d), compared with higher (4,414 mg/d) dietary potassium intake was associated with a 40% reduction in mortality hazard (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.89; I² = 56%).

Conclusions

Very-low-quality evidence supports consensus that dietary potassium restriction reduces Sk in normokalemia and is associated with a reduced risk of death in those with CKD. High-quality randomized controlled trials are needed.

### The impact of a vegetarian diet on chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression-a systematic review [^115m4tEJ]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

As the presented systematic review shows, a vegetarian diet might improve renal filtration function in patients with CKD also delaying its progression. Therefore, given the potential positive effects of a vegetarian diet on the progression of CKD, the patients with CKD should consider following a vegetarian diet in order to improve the renal functions. However, only a small number of studies were eligible and, out of these, only two were considered valuable due to their low bias. Clearly, more research with regard to this topic is necessary, including studies of extended duration, as well as involving larger groups and improved homogeneity. Additionally, it is worth noting other positive aspects of a vegetarian diet, including lower proteinuria and serum urea, which were not explored in this review.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: slowing of chronic kidney disease progression in type 2 diabetes [^111QqtUy]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Slowing or Preventing DKD Progression

Addressing Risk Factors: Lifestyle and Pharmacological Interventions

Several lifestyle and pharmacological approaches have been recommended to help prevent or delay the progression of DKD. These are summarised in Box 1. Guidelines include regular evaluation of kidney and/or vascular complications, as well as interventions that aim to improve glycaemic control and lipid levels, maintain healthy body weight and optimise blood pressure. Advice may incorporate adjustments to diet and exercise, management of stress or referral for smoking cessation support.

Box 1

Key lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for DKD progression

Detailed dietary assessment (to address obesity), followed by appropriate support and education, can be a helpful first step toward slowing kidney function decline. Encouragement to give up smoking, with cessation advice and pharmacological interventions (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy) where appropriate, may be helpful for patients who need extra support in this area. Regular reviews of HbA1c and prescribed glucose-lowering medications are also important. Other risk factors should be checked routinely, such as blood pressure and prescribing of appropriate antihypertensive drugs in line with national and local guidelines, usually angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Statins are considered standard care for people with CKD in both primary and secondary prevention according to NICE guidelines. Some concurrent medications may adversely affect renal function, e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). It is necessary to review prescribed treatments and provide education on the use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications and their potential impact on the kidneys. Recommendations on the use of aspirin and other anti-platelet medications in people with T2DM and kidney disease are unclear. NICE guidelines for the management of T2DM do not recommend aspirin for people without CV disease and the NICE CKD guidelines highlight the need for additional evidence on the benefits of aspirin as a primary prevention measure for people with CKD at the highest risk of CV disease.

### Plant-based diets across the spectrum of kidney disease [^112JZW27]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diet is gaining traction as a major CKD-related risk factor for death and disability. Furthermore, a "healthy" diet in patients with CKD is associated with reduced mortality. The data to be discussed support diet as the foundational, "food integrated with pharmacologic therapy", approach to management of individuals with CKD, and those at risk for it. This is the reverse of the current approach in which pharmacologic therapy is considered as foundational to CKD management. In this review, we will discuss the following: (1) overview of plant diet approaches-discuss different types of Plant-Based Diet (PBD) Approaches, (2) evidence from trials and observational studies regarding CKD incidence and progression in participants without known CKD with PBDs, and (3) efficacy of PBDs in participants with known CKD and across various stages of CKD.

### Low-protein diet for chronic kidney disease: evidence, controversies, and practical guidelines [^1148pMRp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KDIGO defined rapid progression of CKD as a decline greater than 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year. Hansen et al. tested the effect of LPD (< 0.6 g/kg/day) compared with usual protein intake (1 g/kg/day) in delaying CKD progression and improving survival in patients with type 1 diabetes and CKD over 4 years. The annual rate of decline in GFR was 3.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the low‐protein group and 3.9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the usual protein group, with no difference between the groups. However, the authors observed that 27% of patients with average protein intake had stage CKD 5 or died compared to only 10% in the LPD group. A prospective study that followed over 1400 patients with CKD stage 3–4 for 5 years revealed that after adjusting for relevant covariates, each additional 0.1 g of protein intake per kg was associated with an increased hazard ratio (1.09 [95% confidence interval 1.04–1.14]) for kidney replacement therapy (KRT). This suggests that lower protein intake is linked to a slower progression to the final stage of CKD and that any 0.1 g/kg reduction in protein intake is worth doing.

### Renal function following three distinct weight loss dietary strategies during 2 years of a randomized controlled trial [^11664pmm]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, growing evidence has linked obesity with progression of kidney disease as assessed by deteriorating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or microalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria has been identified as an early marker of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and as a predictor of progression to end-stage kidney disease. Moreover, CKD manifesting with microalbuminuria is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension.

There is a graded association between the severity of obesity and the magnitude of microalbuminuria. Surgical weight loss can normalize glomerular hyperfiltration and the albumin excretion rate in severely obese patients, and dietary weight loss trials show benefits on albuminuria, proteinuria, and the decline in the estimated GFR (eGFR) in patients with pre-existing CKD. A review and meta-analysis of 13 studies, including 2 randomized trials, reported that nonsurgical weight loss interventions reduce proteinuria and blood pressure and seem to prevent further decline in renal function. However, most of the studies were relatively small and duration of follow-up short (typically not exceeding 12 months). Different dietary strategies to promote weight loss have not directly been compared in a randomized, long-term study. This is especially pertinent to low-carbohydrate high-protein diets that are debated for potentially adversely affecting kidney function, especially among patients with diabetes. A recent study among obese individuals showed that a low-carbohydrate high-protein weight loss diet was not associated with harmful effects on GFR and albuminuria compared with a low-fat diet.

We therefore investigated the long-term effect of low-fat, Mediterranean, and low-carbohydrate dietary intervention strategies on renal function among overweight or obese people with or without type 2 diabetes and pre-existing mild to moderate renal dysfunction in the Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT).

Low‐protein diet for non‐dialysis CKD patients: current evidence

Protein restriction in the diet of patients with CKD was described more than 140 years ago as an essential strategy for delaying disease progression. The first physician‐scientist to advocate for an LPD was Dr. Semmola in 1850, followed by Dr. Beale, who in 1869 recommended an LPD for non‐dialysis patients with CKD. In 1918, Dr. Volhard made a significant contribution to renal nutritional therapy with the introduction of a low‐protein, normal‐calorie vegetarian diet, observing a decrease in urea nitrogen, an improvement in symptoms, and an increase in patient survival. In 1934, Kempner et al. administered a low‐protein, low‐fat, and low‐sodium diet to patients with CKD and reported decreased blood pressure. In the 1960s, Italian researchers Giordano and Giovannetti showed that an LPD could improve uremic symptoms, delay dialysis onset, positively influence the quality of life, and reduce patient mortality. Epstein et al. hypothesized that reduced renal mass leads to hemodynamic changes in the remaining nephrons, contributing to further progressive deterioration of renal function through increased renal blood flow and GFR. They also observed that dietary protein restriction at the onset of the disease minimized adaptive changes, thus slowing its progression by preserving the workload of the surviving nephrons.

### Plant-based diets in kidney disease: nephrology professionals' perspective [^113nyVMM]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Plant-based diets can delay the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and help manage complications and co-morbid conditions such as hypertension, acidosis, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. However, it is unclear how often plant-based diets are recommended to patients with kidney disease. The objective of this study was to understand nephrology professionals' familiarity, perception, and recommendation of plant-based diets to people with kidney disease.

Design and Methods

A survey to understand perception of recommendation of plant-based diets for patients with CKD was developed. Nephrology professionals from the National Kidney Foundation's member directory were e-mailed a link to complete the survey online. This directory includes professionals who work in a variety of nephrology settings, including both CKD and end-stage renal disease care. Survey items were evaluated with descriptive statistics. Differences across items were determined using chi-square tests and t-tests.

Results

A total of 3,901 professionals were sent the survey, and 644 completed the survey. A majority were dietitians (58%) and worked in dialysis clinics (54%). Most (88%) had heard of using plant-based diets for kidney disease treatment, and a majority (88%) believed it could improve CKD management, cardiovascular disease (90%), hypertension (90%), diabetes (84%), high cholesterol (90%), and obesity (84%). Dietitians were more likely to report plant-based diets as beneficial for each health condition (P < .05). Professionals were most confident that a plant-based diet could help control hypertension (3.75 ± 0.99 on a scale of 1–5), compared with delaying progression of CKD (3.68 ± 1.15) or treating acidosis (3.68 ± 1.13). Dietitians felt more confident in their ability to plan a balanced plant-based diet compared with other specialties (3.49 vs. 2.74, P < .001).

Conclusion

Nephrology professionals who work in nondialysis-dependent CKD settings, and those who work with patients on dialysis, are aware of the benefits of plant-based diets in kidney disease. However, plant-based diets are not routinely being offered as a treatment option. Nephrology practices should work to increase dietitian referrals to offer patients support in transitioning to a plant-based diet.

### Low protein diets in patients with chronic kidney disease: a bridge between mainstream and complementary-alternative medicines? [^115u3D4o]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The risk of malnutrition is frequently cited, but the data are at best as inconclusive as those cited by the diet "advocates".

Low protein diets are however still underutilized.

Table 1 summarizes some of the reasons why even "best quality" evidence is often considered non conclusive or does not affect the clinical management of CKD patients. Many of these reasons underline how the prescriptive modality, which is typical of high-tech medicine, may be less suitable than the educational modality, which is typical of CAMs, for the management of diets in CKD patients.

Table 1
Some comments on the main RCTs con LPDs enrolling at least 50 patients per arm

Legend: LPD low protein diet, vLPD very low protein diet, CKD chronic kidney disease, BP blood pressure; numbers indicate the prescribed protein intake per Kg per day

The first reason why the treatment with the best cost-benefit ratio is underutilized in the expensive CKD scenario may be the difference between the amount of time it takes to prescribe a drug or define the parameters of a dialysis treatment (mainly requiring technical skills), and to recommend lifestyle changes (especially in the case of diet) which are deeply rooted in personal preferences and social habits. In this regard, the barriers for the implementation of LPDs may be the result of the difficulty in conciliating the prescription and follow-up of a diet with a classic "mainstream medicine" approach. Some comments regarding the MDRD study, the largest randomised controlled study on LPDs in CKD, are in line with this interpretation: some experts claimed that MDRD actually demonstrated that prescribing a diet is not enough, since patients tend to lean to the dietary habits of their choice. Hence, the results of the "intention to treat" analysis (diet as a "mainstream prescription") are negative (no advantage of an LPD on CKD progression), while the results of the "per protocol" analysis (diet as an educational intervention) suggest a positive role for LPDs in slowing CKD progression (Table 1).

### Diet in the management of non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease: perceptions and practices of health professionals [^114KQtJV]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Therapeutic strategies, including dietary intervention, to target Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression have been at the forefront of renal research. In CKD Stages 1–4, dietary modification is used to manage CKD progression by targeting risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, proteinuria and managing electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload. Once patients reach CKD stage 5 (end-stage kidney failure, ESKF) there are significant health care costs and a decline in patients' physical and psychological health, quality of life, and societal productivity.

There is clear evidence of benefit for non-pharmacological therapies such as dietetic intervention in the management of patients with CKD. Dietetic interventions have investigated the effects of lower sodium (< 2300 mg/day) and low to moderate protein (0.6–0.8 g/kg) diets in patients with CKD Stages 3–4. These studies demonstrated significant reductions in systolic blood pressure control up to 11 mmHg and a 51% reduction in proteinuria. In comparison, Dapagliflozin (a SGLT2 inhibitor used to treat proteinuria) found a 26% reduction in proteinuria and a 3.5 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure compared to the placebo. Thus dietary therapy is comparable and in some studies more effective to pharmacotherapy in managing hypertension and proteinuria with fewer side effects but often under-utilized and under-appreciated in the management of CKD.

### Diets for patients with chronic kidney disease, should we reconsider? [^111sukyh]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Do publications also document that dietary factors influence the relationship between metabolic acidosis and progression of CKD? The answer is yes because it is known that the catabolism of dietary proteins, especially if the diet supplied proteins of animal origin, is the principal source of acid generation. When the kidney is challenged with acid, such as by eating an animal-source protein diet, it increases levels of hormones (i.e. angiotensin II, aldosterone, endothelin) that help it excrete the acid over short-term observations. However, in the long-term, high levels of these hormones worsen kidney function. Consequently, limiting proteins in the diet will reduce the generation of acid and should aid in the correction of metabolic acidosis. Indeed, there is evidence that protein restricted diets can also suppress the progression of CKD. For example, in 2012, these relationships were tested by Goraya and colleagues. They reduced the daily amount of acid generated by simply increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet. This recommendation achieved the goal of reducing acid generation by 50%. The strategy used by the investigators simply amounted to increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet. The amount of added fruit and vegetables was based on adding what would be required for a 50% reduction in daily acid generation. For most of the patients, this amounted to adding two to four cups of fruits and vegetables to their daily diets. In the clinical trial of the influence of adding these foods, hypertensive patients with stages 1 or 2 CKD (presumably due to hypertensive nephropathy) were treated with ACEi and outcome measures were documented. The measures studied included a decrease in urinary markers of kidney damage, namely N-acetyl beta-D-glucosaminidase and TGF-β1. After 30 days, stage 2 CKD patients who were treated with either sodium bicarbonate supplements or changes in the diet designed to increase the content of fruit and vegetables had comparably positive responses estimated from decreased appearance of markers of kidney damage (Fig. 1). These positive results were obtained during studies of a small number of patients with relatively mild CKD but were sufficiently intriguing that the investigators were stimulated to undertake a larger trial. In this second clinical trial, hypertensive patients with stage 4 CKD (eGFR of 15–29 ml/min/1.73 m²) and metabolic acidosis (i.e. total CO₂ < 22 mM) were randomly assigned to either daily sodium bicarbonate supplements (1 mEq/kg/day) or to an increase in dietary fruits and vegetables that was sufficient to reduce dietary acid by 50%. After 1 year of treatment, the total CO₂ had increased to a similar extent (compared to baseline values) in both the sodium bicarbonate and fruits plus vegetables groups. Regarding kidney functional outcomes, the eGFR calculated from plasma cystatin C levels did not differ between the groups but indices of kidney injury were lower in patients treated with diets enriched in fruits and vegetables.

### CORRECTED ARTICLE: effect of dietary potassium restriction on serum potassium, disease progression, and mortality in chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113iPd3o]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Low-potassium diets are recommended to reduce serum potassium (Sk) and prevent complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but evidence underpinning this recommendation has not been systematically reviewed and synthesized. We conducted a systematic review comparing change in Sk, CKD progression, and mortality between those on a low-potassium versus unrestricted potassium diet.

Methods

We searched Medline, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.org from inception to 3 April 2018. We included randomized and observational studies that compared these outcomes in adults with CKD who ate a restricted versus unrestricted amount of dietary potassium. We pooled mean change in Sk and adjusted hazard ratios of disease progression and mortality using random-effects meta-analyses.

Results

We identified 5,563 articles, of which seven studies (3,489 participants) met our inclusion criteria. We found very low-quality evidence that restricted (1,295 mg/d) versus unrestricted (1,570 mg/d) dietary potassium lowered Sk by -0.22 mEq/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.33, -0.10; I² = 0%). Higher (4,558 mg/d) versus lower (1,725 mg/d) dietary potassium was not significantly associated with disease progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.14, 95% CI: [0.77, 1.70] I² = 57%). Higher (4,414 mg/d) compared with lower (1,670 mg/d) dietary potassium intake was not significantly associated with reduced mortality risk (HR: 0.80, 95% CI: [0.46, 1.41] I² = 78%).

Conclusions

Very-low-quality evidence supports consensus that dietary potassium restriction reduces Sk in normokalemia but whether this is associated with risk of death in those with CKD is uncertain. High-quality randomized controlled trials are needed.

### Easy kidney-healthy recipes [^116JebjD]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

As the diet for people with CKD changes based on new clinical trials, patients are not clear on how to accurately use their diet to protect their kidneys or best manage their electrolytes if they are on dialysis. They often make restrictions where they shouldn't and miss the dietary interventions that could actually make a difference. In this article, I present four recipes that can be tailored to any stage of kidney disease. They are low in sodium, easy to make at home, and can be adapted to low phosphorus, low protein, or low potassium diets as needed.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^114CT1WZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Dietary interventions that severely limit the amount of acid-producing animal protein or increase the consumption of base-producing fruits and vegetables ameliorate metabolic acidosis, the rate of eGFR decline, and markers of kidney injury. A recent study by Garneata et al. explored the potential contributions of very low-protein, plant-based diets and ketoanalogue supplementation on nephropathy progression. In this single-center, open-label, prospective, parallel-group study, 207 patients with CKD stage 4–5 and metabolic acidosis were treated for 15 months. One hundred four (104) patients were randomized to receive a vegetarian, ketoanalogue-supplemented, very low-protein diet (VLPD) (0.3 g/kg/day) and the remaining 103 patients served as the control group and received a typical low-protein (from plant and animal sources) diet (LPD) (0.6 g/kg/day). The patient population had a baseline eGFR of ∼18 ml/min/1.73 m² and a serum HCO₃ of ∼17 mEq/l. Patients with poorly controlled arterial BP (≥ 145/85 mmHg), diabetes, or heart failure were excluded and only 14% of the screened patients met all the eligibility criteria, agreed to adhere to the dietary requirements, and were randomized in this study. Baseline serum HCO₃ was similar in the two treatment groups, with median values of 16.7 and 16.8 mEq/l in the VLPD and LPD groups, respectively. However, at the end of study, serum HCO₃ significantly increased (+6.2 mEq/l) in the VLPD group but slightly decreased (−0.6 mEq/l) in the LPD group, a difference between groups of 6.8 mEq/l (Fig. 1a). The rate of kidney function decline, as measured by eGFR, was slower in patients on the VLPD diet compared to controls on the LPD diet. At the end of the 15-month treatment period, the patients on the VLPD regimen had a −2.9 ml/min/1.73 m² decrease of eGFR relative to their baseline value, whereas patients on the LPD regimen had a −7.1 ml/min/1.73 m² decrease relative to their baseline value, a difference between groups of 4.2 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (Fig. 1 b). The mean eGFR at end of study was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the VLPD group (15.1 ml/min/1.73 m², 95% confidence interval 13.2–17.4) than in the LPD group (10.8 ml/min/1.73 m²; 95% confidence interval 9.0–12.2). Patients eating the VLPD diet were significantly less likely (P < 0.001) than LPD controls to meet the primary endpoint of kidney replacement therapy or a decrease in eGFR of more than 50% (13 versus 42%; VLPD and LPD, respectively) over the 15-month intervention period (Fig. 2).

### Recent advances in the management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^111nE6zH]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common monogenic cause of ESKD, is characterized by relentless development of kidney cysts, hypertension, and destruction of the kidney parenchyma. Over the past few years, major advancements in diagnosing, prognosticating, and understanding the pathogenesis and natural course of the disease have been made. Currently, no kidney disease is more suitable for nephron-protective strategies. Early nephrology referral and implementation of these strategies may have a substantial effect. Total kidney volume is a good prognostication marker and allows stratification of patients into slow or rapid progressing disease, with implications for their management. Measurement of total kidney volume, disease stratification, and prognostication are possible using readily available tools. Although some patients require only monitoring and basic optimized kidney protective measures, such as rigorous BP control and various lifestyle and dietary changes, others will benefit from disease-modifying treatments. Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, a likely disease-modifying treatment, has been approved in several countries and recently by the US Food and Drug Administration; other therapies, such as somatostatin analogs and other novel agents, are currently in clinical trials. The purpose of this article is to present our views on the optimal management to delay kidney disease progression in ADPKD.

Low‐protein diet in experimental models

In animal models of CKD, an LPD significantly protects the kidneys by reducing urinary protein excretion, which helps slow disease progression. In mice with adenine‐induced kidney failure, a low‐aromatic amino acid diet and LPD significantly reduced kidney fibrosis, proteinuria, and inflammation. Moreover, a low‐aromatic amino acid diet reduced plasma levels of uremic toxins. However, applying LPD presents challenges, particularly in reducing muscle mass and protein‐energy malnutrition, which can result in low serum albumin levels. Malnutrition contributes to oxidative stress that extends beyond the kidneys. Oxidative stress decreases muscle mass by stimulating the ubiquitin‐proteasome system, which promotes muscle protein degradation. Reduced muscle mass is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in CKD, facilitated by the activation of the ph66Shc pathway, which amplifies the ROS generation. This redox‐dependent process renders cells sensitive to the phosphorylation of FoxO3, a transcription factor involved in protein degradation, which negatively regulates the activation of antioxidant gene expression, thereby creating a vicious cycle. Studies on LPDs in experimental models are summarized in Table 1.

### Implications of chronic kidney disease for dietary treatment in cardiovascular disease [^1139gpri]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often accompanies cardiovascular disease (CVD). Trends foretelling a greater burden of CKD and CVD are largely a result of increasing frequencies of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Nutritional therapy occupies a critical role in reducing risk factors and preventing progressive damage to the kidneys and heart. Nutritional assessment and treatment should take into account both health concerns. This review examines several diet components and eating styles for efficacy in the treatment of these conditions. A variety of dietary regimens claim to provide health benefits, but rigorous scientific validation of long-term efficacy is frequently lacking. An urgent need exists for eating styles that reduce risk of chronic diseases and that are acceptable and achievable in free-living populations. We describe our ongoing study, a randomized controlled trial comparing the American Heart Association Step II diet and a Mediterranean diet, in survivors of a first myocardial infarction. The primary end point is a composite of mortality and major CVD events. Because many in this population have CKD, indicators of kidney damage and function are prespecified secondary end points. Results of this trial should provide insight into optimal dietary interventions for persons with both CVD and CKD.

Medical Nutrition Therapy

Patients with CKD are at higher risk of malnutrition and are likely to have risk factors that benefit from specific dietary modifications such as sodium, calorie, and carbohydrate limited diets. It is recommended that patients at all stages of CKD be referred to medical nutrition therapy (MNT), which can be performed by registered dieticians or diabetes educators. Individualized dietary counseling or MNT should routinely be part of the care plan so that patients can make better informed choices to maximize their long-term health. Nutrition interventions have demonstrated improvements in glucose and blood pressure control, slowing of CKD progression, and delaying need for dialysis.

Pharmacist

Inequities in SGLT2is have been demonstrated in practice, and probably also exist for finerenone. Pharmacists may be the health care professionals best able to help patients select the medication choices and resources that allow the least out of pocket costs to optimize access. In addition, complex medication management and medication reconciliation may be improved with pharmacist engagement. Pharmacist interventions have been shown to effectively improve glycemic control and blood pressure, both crucial for patients with CKD. Data specifically for CKD patients is limited and focuses more on dialysis patients but does suggest benefit to management of the numerous risk factors and complications of CKD. Thus, the addition of a pharmacist to the care team may be an important intervention for access to medications and health equity.

Nephrologist

Referral to a nephrologist is an important consideration for the patient with CKD. In addition to implementation of evidence-based pharmacotherapy, nephrologists are also well-versed in the screening for and management of the many complications of advanced kidney disease including anemia, metabolic bone disease, as well as dialysis and transplant planning. Early referral to a nephrologist (defined by timing until dialysis) has been associated with mortality benefit based on meta-analysis data from about 100 observational studies and one RCT. KDIGO guidelines for CKD management recommend opinion-based criteria for nephrology referral including AKI, unknown cause of disease, rapidly progressive CKD, eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m², persistent A3 (> 300 mg/g), unexplained hematuria, refractory hypertension, persistent hyperkalemia, recurrent nephrolithiasis, and hereditary kidney disease. Please refer to Fig. 3 for a summative figure of the who, how, and what of CKD screening.

### Serum metabolomic signatures of plant-based diets and incident chronic kidney disease [^1129PW38]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important health problem. In the United States, nearly 15% of adults have CKD, including > 780,000 adults with kidney failure receiving replacement therapy (KFRT). Dietary modification is an effective approach for preventing the onset of CKD and delaying progression to KFRT.

Evidence has suggested that plant-based diets, which are comprised predominantly of plant foods and are low in animal products, may be beneficial for kidney health. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, those in the highest compared with the lowest quintile of vegetarian diets and healthful plant-based diets had 10%–14% lower risk of incident CKD, whereas those in the highest compared with the lowest quintiles of unhealthful plant-based diets had 11% higher risk of incident CKD. In addition, overall plant-based diets and healthful plant-based diets were associated with slower decline in kidney function. Despite the evidence, there is a lack of objective biomarkers of plant-based diets and our understanding of the mechanisms through which plant-based diets are associated with a lower risk of CKD is limited.

Metabolomic techniques measure hundreds of low-molecular-weight metabolites (usually < 1500 daltons) in biofluids simultaneously. Dietary intake alters the metabolome. Metabolites involved in the pathophysiology of CKD and the physiological changes that occur in response to food intake can be evaluated through metabolomics. This approach can help identify objective biomarkers of dietary patterns and, as such, improve upon existing methods for assessing dietary intake. In addition, metabolomic profiling is useful for elucidating metabolic pathways that are relevant for diet–kidney disease associations.

Using untargeted metabolomics, we aimed to extend the previous findings on plant-based diets and incident CKD by identifying metabolites associated with 4 plant-based diet indices (PDIs) (overall PDI, provegetarian diet, healthful PDI, and unhealthful PDI) and evaluating whether candidate biomarkers of plant-based diets are associated with incident CKD in 2 subgroups within a large prospective study.

### Dietary factors and prevention: risk of end-stage kidney disease by fruit and vegetable consumption [^115cBg9o]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent complex disease and is fast becoming a growing public health problem, leading to premature mortality or poor quality of life, imposing a heavy burden on health-care systems. Available evidence reveals that the global prevalence of CKD has a sharply increasing trend from 2000 to 2016, affecting 10–15% of general populations. Aging, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and poor dietary intake have been identified as risk factors for CKD occurrence. There is relatively little knowledge as to how to prevent CKD and most of the recommendations stem from lifestyle modifications extrapolated from lowering blood pressure and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, which is lowering the intake of salt.

Diet may influence the occurrence of CKD. Studies examining adherence to a Mediterranean diet or a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, or patterns of diet consistent with vegetarian, pro-vegetarian or healthy plant-based foods in the general population have shown consistent associations with a lower CKD prevalence and a lower incidence rate of CKD. Emerging evidence in patients with CKD suggests these diets may be helpful to delay progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and prevent complications. Both the diets encourage whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, beans/legumes, whole grains, and nuts with a restriction on the amount of animal protein consumed. However, it is not known whether a single component of these diets, that is, a higher intake of fruits and vegetables (FVs), associates with the lower risk of ESKD. The effectiveness of an increasing FV consumption has only been tested in selected patients with CKD stages 3–4 with hypertension and macroalbuminuria in a small trial, and FV intake was found to be as effective as sodium bicarbonate in delaying CKD decline. Despite such a positive association noted in individuals with advanced CKD, consuming FVs is traditionally discouraged in this group as a hyperkalemia prevention strategy. The existence of an association between higher FV intake and lower risk of ESKD may inform patient discussions in clinical practice around lifestyle modifications for primary prevention of CKD and secondary disease prevention of CKD such as CVD protection and type 2 diabetes. Delayed progression of CKD has major beneficial effects on both the patient and health-care system. Studies on the general population examining the impact of FV intake on the risk of ESKD have not been conducted, a mini review of the cohort studies available in literature is listed under Table 1.

### Low-protein diet for chronic kidney disease: evidence, controversies, and practical guidelines [^112RfLdg]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Research shows that LPD can be safely implemented with sufficient energy intake (> 30 kcal/kg/day). Thus, under adequate dietary supervision, LPD does not generally lead to malnutrition, and a precision medicine approach tailored to individual patient needs can be applied to optimize outcomes. On the other hand, an excess of protein in the nephrons leads to glomerular hyperfiltration, which accelerates CKD progression. Thus, this narrative review highlights the detrimental effects of a high‐protein diet on kidney function, particularly in individuals predisposed to CKD. It also underscores the importance of a personalized and carefully monitored protein intake plan for individuals with or at risk of CKD, aiming to balance the benefits of protein intake reduction with the potential risks of malnutrition.

### Low-protein diet for chronic kidney disease: evidence, controversies, and practical guidelines [^113uj8fh]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Low‐protein diet: how much should be prescribed?

The main nutritional recommendation for non‐dialysis patients is LPD, regardless of its origin (animal or vegetable), which may reduce the rate of disease progression. Nutritional recommendations for energy and protein intake in non‐dialysis patients with CKD are shown in Table 2. The KDIGO CKD guidelines recommend a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg of body weight per day for adults with CKD stages G3 to G5. However, these guidelines do not recommend a daily energy intake.

Table 2
Daily energy and protein recommendations for non‐dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.

In the elderly population, particularly those with CKD, protein requirements may differ owing to age‐related sarcopenia, changes in protein metabolism, and the need to balance muscle preservation with kidney function. Current recommendations suggest that protein intake for healthy older adults should be 1.0–1.2 g/kg/day, whereas those with CKD without dialysis may require 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day, depending on disease progression and nutritional status. It is essential to note that for older people with acute or chronic disease and malnutrition, the protein should be 1.2–1.5 g protein/kg body weight/day. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of precise nutrition in managing CKD because a "one‐size‐fits‐all" approach may not be suitable.

Although the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) only recommends the amount of protein and does not suggest its source, there is growing evidence that a low‐protein, plant‐dominant diet reduces disease outcomes, such as cardiometabolic complications and metabolic acidosis. The predominant consumption of plant‐based proteins could also be beneficial in reducing the production of uremic toxins owing to the greater consumption of dietary fiber, which can lead to a greater intestinal output of short‐chain fatty acids and lower production of toxins by intestinal bacteria generated from essential amino acids present in foods of animal origin. Moreover, a diet with more vegetables and fruits has a beneficial impact on mineral bone disorders because the bioavailability of phosphorus from plant sources is lower, up to approximately 40%, owing to the presence of phytates in plants.

### Nutritional and dietary management of chronic kidney disease under conservative and preservative kidney care without dialysis [^11278PXo]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Revisiting Traditional Paradigms in the Management of Advanced CKD

For approximately 5 decades, dialysis has been the default treatment strategy for ESKD globally. In 1972, the United States Congress approved the 1972 Medicare End-Stage Renal Disease Program which ended rationing of dialysis due to limited resources and led to near-universal access to this form of renal replacement therapy. However, an unintended consequence of uninhibited access to dialysis has been the limited progress and innovation in alternative dialysis-free treatment strategies of ESKD until recently.

Multiple studies show that dialysis, while life-extending, may not always exert the intended effect of restoring health nor improving outcomes in patients with advanced nondialysis dependent (NDD) CKD who are transitioning to ESKD. For example, large population-based studies across multiple international cohorts have shown a mortality peak in the initial months following dialysis initiation. – Furthermore, incident patients with ESKD transitioning to dialysis may exhibit frequent hospitalizations and readmissions, lower HRQOL, loss of independence, decline in physical function, increased symptom burden, and higher healthcare costs. Furthermore, large multicenter trial data did not show that planned early initiation of dialysis conferred improved survival nor clinical outcomes as compared with late-start dialysis. Recognizing these limitations of dialysis therapy, the federally mandated Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative unveiled in 2019 has recommended the adoption of treatments that slow or stop CKD progression, which has elevated the role of conservative and preservative management to the forefront of clinical care.

### Plant-based diets for kidney disease: a Guide for clinicians [^113mrvth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In recent years, a growing body of evidence has emerged on the benefits of plant-based diets for the prevention and treatment of lifestyle diseases. In parallel, data now exist regarding the treatment of chronic kidney disease and its most common complications with this dietary pattern. Improving the nutrient quality of foods consumed by patients by including a higher proportion of plant-based foods while reducing total and animal protein intake may reduce the need for or complement nephroprotective medications, improve kidney disease complications, and perhaps favorably affect disease progression and patient survival. In this In Practice article, we review the available evidence on plant-dominant fiber-rich diet as it relates to kidney disease prevention, chronic kidney disease incidence and progression, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypertension, uremic toxins, need for kidney replacement therapy including dialysis, patient satisfaction and quality of life, and mortality. Further, concerns of hyperkalemia and protein inadequacy, which are often associated with plant-based diets, are also reviewed in the context of available evidence. It is likely that the risks for both issues may not have been as significant as previously thought, while the advantages are vast. In conclusion, the risk to benefit ratio of plant-based diets appears to be tilting in favor of their more prevalent use.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^114D3VNq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Kidney function and proteinuria in CKD — Restriction of sodium intake may slightly reduce kidney function markers of creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in short-term crossover trials of stage 1–5 nondialysis populations (low-certainty evidence), whereas a single 6-month parallel RCT found no difference in eGFR. Sodium restriction may reduce proteinuria, supported by randomized crossover, parallel RCTs, and observational studies. A 3-month self-management intervention using sodium intake < 100 mmol/d reduced proteinuria but this reversed after stopping the restriction, and higher sodium intake was associated with increased risk for progressing to end-stage kidney disease compared with a lower sodium diet < 100 mmol/d.

### Patient perception of plant based diets for kidney disease [^117147yn]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Plant-based diets can delay the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and help manage complications and comorbid conditions such as hypertension, acidosis, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study was to understand nephrology patients' familiarity, perception, and use of plant-based diets.

Design & Methods

A survey was shared via the National Kidney Foundation's social media channels. Analysis included 844 responses. Survey items were evaluated with descriptive statistics. Differences across items were determined using chi-square tests.

Results

Most respondents were 61–70 years of age (26.7%, n = 225), female (56.5%, n = 477) and achieved a Bachelor's or advanced degree (49.9%, n = 421). The majority of respondents suffered from nondialysis-dependent CKD (34%) or received a kidney transplant (34%). About half (45%) of respondents were familiar with plant-based diets and most (58%) were aware that plant-based diets can improve CKD. Twenty-two percent reported following some version of a vegetarian diet, and 29% reported "eating less meat". Respondents were not confident (Mdn = 2, IQR = 2, on a scale of 1–5) in their ability to plan a balanced plant-based meal, and were moderately confident that a plant-based diet could help blood pressure (Mdn = 3, IQR = 2) and slow progression of CKD (Mdn = 3, IGR = 2). Family eating preference, meal planning skills, preference for meat, figuring out what is healthy to eat, food cost, time constraints, and ease of cooking were rated as equal barriers to following a plant-based diet (Mdn = 3). A sample meal plan, individual counseling session with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN), handouts, and cooking classes were resources rated most helpful to transition to a plant-based diet (Mdn = 4).

Conclusion

Approximately half of respondents were aware that plant-based diets can be beneficial for CKD. Many patients are following a vegetarian or plant-based eating pattern. More research should be done to see how effective RDNs are in educating and moving patients toward a plant-based eating pattern, as they are an underutilized resource in the CKD population.

### Reducing the dietary acid load: how a more alkaline diet benefits patients with chronic kidney disease [^112PnKhz]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

It has been proposed that a low-protein diet will slow progression of chronic kidney disease although studies have not always supported this belief. The accepted practice is that 60% to 70% of protein comes from high biological value (HBV) protein, but this limits patient choice and patients struggle to follow the diet. When a diet with only 30% HBV protein was trialed, there was a significant increase in serum bicarbonate, and patients preferred the diet. The dietary advice given in predialysis clinics was changed. HBV protein was restricted to approximately 50% of total protein, bread and cereal foods were allowed freely, and fruits and vegetables (F&V) were encouraged. Patients who followed the diet have seen a slowing of progression and occasionally regression of their renal function. Both observations and scientific literature indicate that this is because of a reduction in the acid content of the diet. When foods are metabolized, most proteins produce acid, and most F&V produce alkali. A typical 21 st -century diet produces 50 to 100 mEq H + per day which the kidney is challenged to excrete. Acid is excreted with phosphate and is limited to about 45 mEq H + per day. With chronic kidney disease, this falls progressively to below 20 mEq H + per day. Historically, ammonium excretion was believed to be excretion of acid (NH₃⁺ + H⁺ → NH₄⁺), but it is now understood to be a by-product in the neutralization of acid by glutamine. The remaining acid is neutralized or stored within the body. Bone and muscle are lost in order to neutralize the acid. Acid also accumulates within cells, and serum bicarbonate falls. The author postulates that reducing the acid load through a low-protein diet with greater use of vegetable proteins and increased F&V intake will slow progression or occasionally improve renal function while maintaining the nutritional status of the individual.

### Renal function following three distinct weight loss dietary strategies during 2 years of a randomized controlled trial [^116vgzLs]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we describe the renal outcome in a relatively large, long-term randomized controlled trial in which low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean, and low-fat diets were used to induce weight loss in obese and overweight subjects with or without type 2 diabetes and serum creatinine of ≤ 176 µmol/L. The low-carbohydrate diet was at least as effective as the Mediterranean or low-fat diets in improving eGFR, an effect likely mediated in all three diets by the weight loss-induced improvement in blood pressure and in insulin sensitivity. Remarkably, this trend of apparent improvement in renal functions was not attenuated, and indeed tended to be more pronounced, in participants with pre-existing (baseline) conditions indicating diminished renal function or being at high risk for deterioration of renal function; namely, lower baseline eGFR, type 2 diabetes, and microalbuminuria.

Several limitations of our study warrant consideration. Few women were enrolled in the study, thus compromising our ability to identify sex-specific risk factors in the effects of the various diets on kidney function, although there seemed to be similar weight loss-induced improvements in eGFR and microalbuminuria in men and women (data not shown). In addition, although the subgroups of patients with diabetes and advanced renal impairment are of great interest to assess the effects of weight loss diets on kidney function, most of our participants were not diabetic and had relatively conserved kidney function. In particular, only 23 had microalbuminuria at baseline. Use of this relatively healthy population could have potentially led to underestimation of the beneficial effect of weight loss on kidney function in the most vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, a significant improvement in eGFR could still be observed in addition to robust regression of microalbuminuria, thus underscoring the importance of weight loss on slowing the progression, and perhaps even regressing, CKD at early stages of the disease in patients with and without diabetes.

### Relationship between modifiable lifestyle factors and chronic kidney disease: a bibliometric analysis of top-cited publications from 2011 to 2020 [^114rFfX9]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we used bibliometric analysis to identify and characterize the top 100-cited articles published between 2011 and 2020 in the field of lifestyle factors' impact on CKD. Our study provides legible insights on the publishing trends and research themes on the topic. We found about two-thirds of the most cited papers addressing the association between modifiable factors and CKD were clinical research, while basic studies only accounted for a small fraction. Developed countries, especially the US, showed overwhelming influence in this field in terms of the number of top-cited publications. We also noticed the transition of research hotspots over the decade, with diet, nutrition, obesity, and physical activity being the factors constantly drawing attention, and alcohol consumption, gut-kidney axis, fish oil, chain fatty-acids, molecular-weight protein, and water-soluble vitamins being among the newly emerging keywords.

Our finding, that the modifiable factors gaining most popularity were diet or nutritional management, is consistent with the fact that diet contributes substantially to the incidence and progression of CKD, and stays focused in the academic community. Recommendations on protein and sodium intake have been incorporated into guidelines for clinical management of CKD, such as the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline, and National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline. However, as Suetonia C Palmer pointed out, current evidence for dietary interventions in the setting of CKD, with clinical uncertainty, is yet sufficient to guide comprehensive clinical practice. For instance, there are very limited data available evaluating potential adverse effects and participants' quality of life related to dietary protein restriction. Thus, as indicated in our study, the impact of diet and nutrition on CKD remains an important research topic, and further studies to evaluate the effects of nutritional interventions in the general population for the prevention of incident CKD and in CKD participants for slowing the progression to ESRD are required.

Treatment Strategies for CKD in People With T2D

Multiple treatment strategies have been shown to reduce the development and progression of CKD in people living with T2D. The most common goal of intervention is to slow progression of CKD, but sometimes with early intervention in mild CKD, UACR and eGFR may revert to normal levels.

Lifestyle

A healthy diet with appropriate nutrition, adequate physical activity, smoking cessation, and body weight management can reduce both kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes, especially when combined with appropriate drug therapies. The KDIGO guideline recommends that people with CKD should undertake moderate physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 min per week or as tolerated and consume more plant-based foods versus animal-based foods, maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day for adults with CKD stages G3 to G5. The KDIGO guideline also recommends a sodium intake of < 2 g per day (or < 90 mmol of sodium per day or < 5 g of sodium chloride per day) for people with CKD.

### Obesity-related renal damage: changing diet to avoid progression [^117CvFuZ]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Obesity is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for the development of end-stage renal disease. However, few studies have investigated the influence of dietary changes on kidney function in the obese. Friedman et al. report that dietary protein intake is unlikely to fully account for elevations in glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria observed in obesity. The relationship between diet and renal hemodynamics in obesity is complex, and more studies (including ones on the effect of caloric restriction) are needed.

### Microbiome modulation as a novel therapeutic approach in chronic kidney disease [^1163PiGr]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gut dysbiosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Interventions aimed at restoring gut microbiota have emerged as a potential therapeutic option in CKD. This review summarizes the current evidence on gut microbiota-targeted strategies in patients with CKD.

Recent Findings

A growing number of studies have shown that plant-based diets, low-protein diets, prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic supplementation, and constipation treatment may lead to favorable alterations in the gut microbiota. Current evidence suggests that the implementation of both plant-based and low-protein diets has potential benefits for the primary prevention of CKD, and for slowing CKD progression, with minimal risk of hyperkalemia and/or cachexia. The use of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics and laxatives may have beneficial effects on uremic toxin generation, but their evidence is limited for the prevention and treatment of CKD. Recent advances in diagnostic technologies (e.g., high-throughput sequencing and nanotechnology) could enhance rapid diagnosis, monitoring, and design of effective therapeutic strategies for mitigating gut dysbiosis in CKD.

Summary

Plant-based and low-protein diets, prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic supplementation, and constipation treatment represent novel gut microbiota-targeted strategies in the conservative management of CKD, which could improve clinical outcomes in CKD.

### National Kidney Foundation council on renal nutrition survey: past-present clinical practices and future strategic planning [^11416Geb]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Early nutritional intervention is thought to play a major role in the preservation of renal function and the overall wellbeing in the renal patient. In preparation for renal replacement therapy (RRT), a consultation with the renal nutritionist to establish a diet consistent with the existing diagnosis may increase the likelihood of reducing cardiovascular risk factors, preventing malnutrition and anemia, and slowing the progression of renal disease, all of which can contribute to positive patient outcomes. In a 1999 United States Renal Data System survey of 3,468 new dialysis patients, 46% indicated that they had not consulted with a dietitian before the initiation of dialysis. To help with establishing education programs, determine staffing guidelines, and planning future endeavors, the National Kidney Foundation Council on Renal Nutrition conducted a survey of their 1,748 members. The survey was designed to assess the current demographic profile and clinical practice elements of practicing renal dietitians. Surveys were distributed as a section of the 1999–2000 winter issue of the CRN Quarterly Newsletter, with 353 of the members responding. Information collected pertained to patient care settings, number of facilities covered, patient age, patient treatment modalities, dietitian contact hours required to effectively educate pre-end-stage renal disease patients on a low-protein diet and to ensure optimal nutrition status for the chronic kidney disease patients. The dietitians of this cohort had practiced dietetics for 14.5 ± 8.6 years and renal nutrition for 9.15 ± 6.9 years. The survey data showed a discrepancy between what the clinical practices were in 1999 and what the current recommendations are, based on the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiatives (K/DOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines.

### Low adherence to CKD-specific dietary recommendations associates with impaired kidney function, dyslipidemia, and inflammation [^1118k6yG]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a globally rising health issue characterized by a high burden of comorbidities and mortality. Poor diet can increase the incidence and progression of CKD directly, e.g. through the path of obesity, or indirectly through its effects on contributing CKD risk factors such as diabetes or hypertension. Dietary interventions are highly relevant to reduce the risk of CKD complications such as sodium and volume overload, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, or malnutrition, which affect the cardiovascular system, bones, and other organs. Nutritional education is therefore recognized as an important tool in the treatment of patients with CKD, but is underutilized as a preventive approach for slowing the progression of CKD.

Current recommendations for nutritional management of CKD typically focus on few individual components of diet such as protein and sodium. Data on adherence to dietary recommendations in patients with CKD are scarce, and it has not been shown whether adherence to dietary CKD recommendations associates with better kidney function or other biomarkers. We therefore assessed dietary and nutrient intake by a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients of the multicenter German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) observational cohort study. We developed a CKD diet score system based on the intake of sodium, potassium, fiber, total protein, sugar, and cholesterol to estimate the adherence to CKD-specific dietary recommendations from National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). The objectives of the present study were to (a) estimate adherence to the CKD-specific dietary recommendations, (b) identify predictors for poor dietary adherence as defined by the CKD diet score system, and (c) associate health-relevant biomarkers with the degree of adherence to the CKD-specific dietary recommendations.

### The impact of low-protein diet on residual renal function in dialysis patients: a systematic review and metaanalysis [^114VUYLr]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As a significant global public health issue, chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide. The progression of CKD can result in a gradual deterioration of renal function and ultimately come to end-stage renal disease (ESKD), requiring life-sustaining peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. While these methods effectively remove waste and excess water from the body, they also present various complications and reduce quality of life.

Residual renal function, the portion that remains functional during dialysis, plays a crucial role in fluid and electrolyte balance control, reducing dialysis-related complications, improving quality of life, and increasing survival rates. Therefore, preserving residual renal function has become a key objective in treating CKD patients.

In the nutritional management of kidney disease, low-protein diets have always been an important consideration. These diets are designed to alleviate strain on the kidneys and slow down further decline in renal function. For dialysis patients specifically, appropriate protein intake is essential for maintaining nutritional status, enhancing treatment outcomes, and safeguarding residual renal function. However, in published meta-analyses, it is controversial whether a low-protein diet has an impact on residual renal function among CKD patients. At the same time, studies among dialysis patients on the influence of low-protein diets on residual renal function have produced inconsistent results due to factors such as study design, patient characteristics, and dialysis mode. The safety of low-protein diets also needs to be further explored due to possible malnutrition and other problems.

As such, this meta-analysis aims to comprehensively assess the influence of low-protein diets on dialysis patients' residual renal function and potential safety issues. By rigorously screening existing literature for data extraction and quality assessment purposes, this study will further delve into the mechanism by which low-protein diets affect residual renal function in this specific population as well as their potential clinical value so as to provide a more robust evidence base for nutritional treatment strategies targeting the progression of kidney diseases.

### Vegetarian diets and chronic kidney disease [^116bP1gT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

While dietary restriction of protein intake has long been proposed as a possible kidney-protective treatment, the effects of changes in the quality of ingested proteins on the prevalence and risk of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been scarcely studied; these two aspects are reviewed in the present article. The prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which are the main causes of CKD in Western countries, is lower in vegetarian populations. Moreover, there is a negative relationship between several components of plant-based diets and numerous factors related to CKD progression such as uraemic toxins, inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic acidosis, phosphate load and insulin resistance. In fact, results from different studies seem to confirm a kidney-protective effect of plant-based diets in the primary prevention of CKD and the secondary prevention of CKD progression. Various studies have determined the nutritional safety of plant-based diets in CKD patients, despite the combination of a more or less severe dietary protein restriction. As observed in the healthy population, this dietary pattern is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in CKD patients. We propose that plant-based diets should be included as part of the clinical recommendations for both the prevention and management of CKD.

Data on the Efficacy/Effectiveness and Safety of Low-Protein Diets

A large body of evidence has shown that lower dietary protein intake is associated with decreased proteinuria, CKD progression, and uremic complications. – For example, in a meta-analysis of 16 RCTs of low dietary protein intake in NDD-CKD, pooled data showed that lower protein intake of < 0.8 g/kg/day was associated with lower risk of ESKD and all-cause mortality. The meta-analysis also demonstrated improved biochemical parameters including higher serum bicarbonate levels, decreased serum phosphorus levels, and less azotemia, as compared with a dietary protein intake of ≥ 0.8 g/kg/day. Although the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease trial showed marginal reduction in CKD progression with a very-low-protein diet, reanalysis of both achieved and prescribed dietary protein intake showed that low-protein diets significantly reduced eGFR decline. – Other clinical trials and observational studies have corroborated the benefits of low-protein diets on CKD outcomes – and survival.

### Diabetic kidney disease benefits from intensive low-protein diet: updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^117JJiqX]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Our analysis also provided evidence that patients with DKD possibly benefited from LPD as early as CKD stages 1–3. Current standards of medical management in DKD, including diet intervention, glucose and lipid control, inhibition of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, are recommended strategies to suppress the progression of DKD and decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. Diet intervention, including a low-protein diet, plays a fundamental role in all aspects of the treatment of patients with CKD, including DKD. Kalantar-Zadeh and Fouque reported that early diet therapy can decelerate the progression of early stages of CKD and may help delay the need for kidney replacement therapy in the advanced stage. In the KDOQI Clinical Practice Guideline, a low-protein diet (0.6–0.8 g/kg/day) is recommended to patients with DKD. Similarly, in animal models and human kidney diseases, a LPD was reported to ameliorate glomerular hyperfiltration and proteinuria even in an early stage of kidney disease and in patients previously consuming a high-protein diet. Importantly, the combination of LPD–keto acid administration could slow or halt the progression of renal insufficiency, especially when the treatment is initiated early. However, most studies to date have focused on patients at CKD stages 3–4, and only a few studies followed up with an early stages of DKD for a short term of 3–4 weeks. Although a protective effect of LPD on residual renal function has been reported, the assessment of a single effect of dietary restriction in patients with early DKD is complicated due to the high drop-out rate in previous studies.

Management OF CKD In Patients With T2D

Glycemic Control

Intensive glycemic control in patients with T2D results in significant reductions in the development of microvascular complications, with the evidence of prevention of incident CKD being stronger than that for decreasing progression of established CKD. Therefore, the ADA guidelines provide treatment goals for glucose control (target levels of glycated hemoglobin [A1C], described in Table 1), and recommend that A1C is assessed at least twice per year in patients meeting these goals, and quarterly in patients who have switched therapy or who are not meeting treatment goals. This approach is endorsed in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO®) 2020 Clinical Practice Guidelines. It is important to note that in patients with advanced CKD, A1C levels may be falsely low, and therefore patients with T2D and CKD should be encouraged to self-monitor their blood glucose levels more frequently. This is due to patients commonly having anemia of chronic disease, and the decreased survival time of erythrocytes in these patients leads to falsely low A1C results. The incidence of adverse effects associated with intensive glycemic control is increased in patients with concomitant CKD, so careful individualization of glycemic goals is recommended (Table 1).

Table 1
American Diabetes Association treatment goals and guidance

A1C Glycated hemoglobin, ADA American Diabetes Association, BP blood pressure, CKD chronic kidney disease, CVD cardiovascular disease, T2D type 2 diabetes

Dietary Intervention

Dietary interventions can help to improve blood pressure (BP) and glucose control, as well as slow the progression of CKD. Recommended nutritional interventions include protein intake of approximately 0.8 g/kg/day and sodium intake < 2300 mg/day (ADA) or < 2000 mg/day (KDIGO) Dietary protein intake less than the recommended daily allowance of 0.8 g/kg/day does not improve outcomes. For patients on dialysis, higher levels of dietary protein intake should be considered, as malnutrition is a problem in some dialysis patients. It is helpful to have the input of a registered dietician or a certified diabetes educator to help operationalize these goals for patients.

### Mediterranean diet for cardiovascular risk reduction in chronic kidney disease [^112nmcq2]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

The Mediterranean diet is a plant-based healthy diet similar to the vegetarian and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets. Unlike vegetarian and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets, the Mediterranean diet encourages a lifestyle associated with physical activity, and social connections. In addition, the Mediterranean diet is not based on restriction of nutrients but does limit intake of processed foods. Prospective studies have confirmed that the Mediterranean diet confers primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in the general population. The benefits of the Mediterranean diet lifestyle include reducing the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and lowers blood pressure. In adults with CKD, adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower risk of CKD progression and its complications such as hyperphosphatemia and metabolic acidosis, and reduces production of uremic toxins and inflammatory mediators when compared to omnivore dietary patterns. Nevertheless, prospective studies are needed to confirm the cardiovascular disease prevention with the Mediterranean diet in adults with CKD. Medical nutrition therapy remains a cornerstone of CKD management, and the Mediterranean diet could be utilized to slow CKD progression and complications.

### Diabetes diet… [^116DVBRy]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes diet A healthy diabetes diet looks pretty much like a healthy diet for anyone. Eat lots of fruits, veggies, healthy fats, and lean protein. Eat less salt, sugar, and foods high in refined carbs. Your individual carb goal is based on your age, activity level, any medicines you take, and other factors. Following your meal plan will help keep blood sugar levels in your target range. This will also prevent more damage to your kidneys. Kidney diet With a CKD diet, you'll avoid or limit certain foods to protect your kidneys. You'll include other foods to give you energy and keep you nourished. Your specific diet will depend on whether you're in early-stage or late-stage CKD or if you're on dialysis. Foods to limit Eat less salt/sodium. Over time, your kidneys lose the ability to control your sodium-water balance. Less sodium in your diet will help lower blood pressure.

It will also decrease fluid buildup in your body, which is common in kidney disease. Focus on fresh, homemade food to better control the amount of sodium in your food. Eat only small amounts of restaurant food and packaged food, which usually have lots of sodium. Look for low sodium on food labels. potassium, phosphorus, and protein in your diet. Many foods that are part of a typical healthy diet may not be right for a CKD diet. Phosphorus is a mineral that keeps your bones strong and other parts of your body healthy. Your kidneys can't remove extra phosphorus from your blood very well. Too much weakens bones and can damage your blood vessels, eyes, and heart. Meat, dairy, beans, nuts, whole-grain bread, and dark-colored sodas are high in phosphorus. Phosphorus is also added to lots of packaged foods. Eat the right amount of protein. More protein than you need makes your kidneys work harder and may make CKD worse. But too little isn't healthy either.

Both animal and plant foods have protein. Your dietitian can help you figure out the right combination and amount of protein to eat. Say no to herbal supplements. Here's one way your CKD diet and diabetes diet can work together. If you drink orange juice to treat low blood sugar, switch to kidney-friendly apple or grape juice. You'll get the same blood-sugar boost with a lot less potassium.

### Eating fruits and vegetables lowers kidney failure risk… [^114RZ7Xx]. archive.cdc.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

Eating Fruits and Vegetables Lowers Kidney Failure Risk Low intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with a higher risk of kidney failure in US adults with and without chronic kidney disease, according to a recent CDC study in the American Journal of Nephrology. This result is consistent with other findings that plant-rich diets can help prevent kidney failure or end-stage kidney disease. Data were analyzed from the 1988–1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey linked to the US Renal Data System. NHANES combines interviews and physical exams to assess the health and nutritional status of US adults and children. USRDS is the national data registry of the US population being treated for kidney failure. The study included 14, 725 adults aged 20 years or older who were followed up for kidney failure through 2008. During follow-up, 230 participants developed kidney failure.

In the general US population, compared to adults with the highest fruit and vegetable intake, adults with the lowest intake had the highest risk of developing kidney failure:

- **Less than 2 servings per day**: 45% increased risk.
- **2 to less than 3 servings per day**: 40% increased risk.
- **3 to less than 4 servings per day**: 25% increased risk.
- **4 to less than 6 servings per day**: 14% increased risk. A similar association was seen in people with stage 3 or 4 CKD. People with CKD are advised to meet with a dietitian to create a kidney-healthy eating plan that is low in salt and fat and has the right amount and type of protein. However, as kidney disease gets worse, the plan may be adjusted to reduce fruit and vegetable intake to limit phosphorus and potassium. Learn more about how CKD can be prevented and managed.

### Diabetes and kidney disease: what to eat? [^115hRqVh]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Foods to limit Eat less salt/sodium. Over time, your kidneys lose the ability to control your sodium-water balance. Less sodium in your diet will help lower blood pressure. It will also decrease fluid buildup in your body, which is common in kidney disease. Focus on fresh, homemade food to better control the amount of sodium in your food. Eat only small amounts of restaurant food and packaged food, which usually have lots of sodium. Look for low sodium on food labels. potassium, phosphorus, and protein in your diet. Many foods that are part of a typical healthy diet may not be right for a CKD diet. Phosphorus is a mineral that keeps your bones strong and other parts of your body healthy. Your kidneys can't remove extra phosphorus from your blood very well. Too much weakens bones and can damage your blood vessels, eyes, and heart. Meat, dairy, beans, nuts, whole-grain bread, and dark-colored sodas are high in phosphorus.

Phosphorus is also added to lots of packaged foods. Eat the right amount of protein. More protein than you need makes your kidneys work harder and may make CKD worse. But too little isn't healthy either. Both animal and plant foods have protein. Your dietitian can help you figure out the right combination and amount of protein to eat. Say no to herbal supplements. Diabetes and CKD foods Below are just a few examples of foods a person with both diabetes and CKD can eat. Your dietitian can give you more suggestions and help you find recipes for tasty meals: Fruits: berries, grapes, cherries, apples, plums Veggies: cauliflower, onions, eggplant, turnips Proteins: lean meats, eggs, unsalted seafood Carbs: white bread, bagels, sandwich buns, unsalted crackers, pasta Drinks: water, clear diet sodas, unsweetened tea. Here's one way your CKD diet and diabetes diet can work together.

If you drink orange juice to treat low blood sugar, switch to kidney-friendly apple or grape juice. You'll get the same blood-sugar boost with a lot less potassium.
