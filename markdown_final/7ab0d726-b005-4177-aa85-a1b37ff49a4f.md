## Question

Is falicular lymphoma cured

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether follicular lymphoma is cured. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between cure and functional cure. Then, I should verify how modern immunochemotherapy has changed survival and whether any plateau in progression-free survival suggests cure. Next, I will examine exceptions such as early-stage disease and grade 3B histology. After that, I need to check high-risk subsets like POD24 and transformation that remain hard to cure. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically useful answer and counseling framework based on current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead. Cure implies eradication of disease with negligible long-term recurrence risk, whereas functional cure means near-normal life expectancy despite episodic relapses that are manageable over decades; contemporary reviews emphasize that many patients with follicular lymphoma now achieve a functional cure, even though classical cure remains elusive for most [^113KzwZ4] [^113WTFog].

> Wait, let me verify the historical baseline and how much rituximab-era therapy has shifted outcomes. Historically, follicular lymphoma carried a median overall survival around 8–10 years and was considered incurable; with rituximab-based immunochemotherapy and maintenance, median OS now approaches or exceeds 20 years, and 10-year OS is roughly 80% in many cohorts, which supports the concept of functional cure for a large proportion of patients [^113Jj8UN] [^116ikJ69] [^112GTTnS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about eradication just because survival is long. I should confirm whether progression-free survival curves plateau, because a plateau would argue for cure; however, most PFS curves in follicular lymphoma do not show a clear plateau, indicating persistent relapse risk over time, even though many patients never die of lymphoma due to the indolent biology and effective salvage options [^112GTTnS] [^113KzwZ4].

> I will now examine the exceptions where cure is more plausible. For truly limited-stage disease, involved-field radiotherapy can be curative in a subset, but I need to ensure I note that a meaningful fraction still relapse distantly, reflecting occult systemic disease; thus, "potentially curative" is accurate but not universal even in stage I–II presentations [^1122winE] [^111dxiWS]. But wait, what if the histology is grade 3B? Some population-based and series data suggest grade 3B behaves more aggressively yet may be curable with anthracycline-containing immunochemotherapy, with reports of no disease-related deaths beyond 5–10 years in selected cohorts; however, these are retrospective and require cautious interpretation, so I should qualify this as "potentially curable" rather than definitively cured [^114wCRSZ] [^115J5RUf].

> Next, I should review the high-risk subset where cure is least likely. Early progression within 24 months of immunochemotherapy, so-called POD24, identifies patients with markedly inferior 5-year survival around 50% and a high risk of transformation; this group remains a major unmet need and is the focus of intensified strategies including transplant and novel agents, underscoring that conventional approaches are often insufficient here [^1164wwUi] [^115EJMza] [^116ikJ69].

> Let me consider how guidelines frame this for day-to-day care. Major guidelines endorse individualized strategies: observation or rituximab monotherapy for low tumor burden, immunochemotherapy with rituximab or obinutuzumab plus bendamustine or CHOP for high tumor burden, and rituximab maintenance for 2 years after response; none of these recommendations assert cure as a routine goal, reinforcing that management prioritizes durable control and quality of life rather than guaranteed eradication [^115VyJfZ] [^116yGVYY] [^111ax1cj] [^111YRDNs] [^117N5xqq] [^113CcvPJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "most patients are cured", but I should double-check that against the biology. The absence of a PFS plateau and the known late relapses mean that, strictly speaking, most patients are not cured in the classical sense; however, the dramatic OS extension means many experience a functional cure with near-normal life expectancy, which is the more honest and clinically useful way to counsel patients [^112GTTnS] [^113KzwZ4].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Follicular lymphoma is not universally cured, but it is highly treatable and often functionally cured: median OS can exceed 20 years, 10-year survival is about 80%, and a subset with limited-stage disease or grade 3B histology may be cured with appropriate therapy; conversely, POD24 and transformation remain hard to cure and require aggressive, individualized strategies and clinical trial consideration [^113Jj8UN] [^116ikJ69] [^1122winE] [^1164wwUi] [^114wCRSZ].

Follicular lymphoma is **generally not considered curable** in advanced stages, but many patients live for decades with a chronic, relapsing course [^113WTFog] [^113Jj8UN]. Cure is **possible in early-stage disease** (stage I–II) with involved-site radiotherapy, with about 40–60% long-term disease control [^1122winE] [^111dxiWS]. For advanced disease, modern immunochemotherapy achieves high response rates and prolonged survival, yet relapse is common and cure remains rare [^1148zfgb] [^116ikJ69]. Early relapse within 24 months (POD24) signals poor outcomes and limited curability [^1164wwUi]. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation offers the only potentially curative option for select high-risk patients, but it carries significant risks [^113yqrXq].

---

## Curability in early-stage follicular lymphoma

- **Involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT)**: For stage I–II disease, ISRT (24–30 Gy) achieves durable remissions in 40–60% of patients, with 10–15 year disease-free survival around 40–60% [^1122winE] [^111dxiWS].

- **Role of systemic therapy**: Rituximab monotherapy or combination with radiotherapy can improve response rates, but evidence for superior long-term outcomes versus radiotherapy alone is limited [^1122winE].

- **Watchful waiting**: In select asymptomatic stage I–II patients, observation may be appropriate, but it does not improve curability [^115moang].

---

## Curability in advanced-stage follicular lymphoma

- **Immunochemotherapy**: Rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy (e.g. R-CHOP, R-Bendamustine) yields high response rates and median progression-free survival of 3–7 years, yet relapse is common and cure is rare [^111psSGZ].

- **Maintenance therapy**: Rituximab maintenance prolongs PFS but does not clearly improve overall survival or cure rates [^111pwJR8].

- **Early relapse (POD24)**: Progression within 24 months of therapy is linked to poor survival and limited curability [^1164wwUi].

---

## Role of stem cell transplantation

Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) provides **prolonged remissions** but does not reliably cure follicular lymphoma and is generally reserved for relapsed or transformed disease [^1136Exbc]. In contrast, **allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT)** is the only potentially curative modality, with 5-year progression-free survival of 40–60% and a non-relapse mortality of 20–30%; it is reserved for fit patients with high-risk features or multiple relapses [^113yqrXq].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Targeted therapies**: PI3K inhibitors, BTK inhibitors, and EZH2 inhibitors show promise but have not yet proven curative [^notfound].

- **Immunotherapies**: CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies are under study, with early results suggesting potential for deep remissions, though durability and cure remain uncertain [^115NgM3z].

- **Personalized medicine**: Biomarkers (e.g. m7-FLIPI) may help identify patients who could benefit from more aggressive or novel therapies [^112XkbFd].

---

## Conclusion

Follicular lymphoma is **curable in a subset of early-stage patients** with radiotherapy, but advanced disease remains generally incurable despite improved survival. Allogeneic transplantation offers potential cure for select high-risk patients, and emerging therapies may expand curative options in the future.

### Follicular lymphoma: is there an optimal way to define risk? [^114t2jFd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) has a long natural history and typically indolent behavior. In the present era, there are a plethora of prognostic factors combining clinical, biological, and genetic data to determine patient prognosis and help develop treatment strategies over the course of a patient's lifetime. The rapid pace of tumor-specific and clinical advances in FL has created a challenge in the prioritization and implementation of these factors into clinical practice. Developing a comprehensive understanding of existing prognostic markers in FL will help select optimal ways of utilization in the clinical setting and investigate opportunities to define and intervene upon risk at FL diagnosis and disease recurrence.

### Management options, survivorship, and emerging treatment strategies for follicular and Hodgkin lymphomas [^115Rb7gs]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2010). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the biology underlying lymphoma is continually increasing and leading to improved treatment strategies for affected patients. However, clinical approaches differ between disease subtypes based on the likelihood of achieving durable remissions. For example, follicular lymphoma (FL) is a common and indolent form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in which most patients relapse after treatment and periods of remission become progressively shorter after each course of treatment. Thus, the main focus of research efforts in FL is to develop improved treatment strategies that provide prolonged periods of disease remission. In contrast, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), although rare, is considered to be highly curable with current treatments and the clinical need is for effective-management strategies, potentially avoiding chemotherapy, that reduce long-term toxicity and improve quality of life for patients. This report summarizes the latest advances in our understanding of FL and HL, and demonstrates the different approaches required when developing novel treatment strategies for the two diseases.

### Is watch and wait still acceptable for patients with low-grade follicular lymphoma? [^117WSyva]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) represents more than 20% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas worldwide and approximately 30% of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas diagnosed in the United States. Although occasionally localized at the time of diagnosis, most patients have disseminated disease. However, patients are frequently asymptomatic, and this, in combination with a long median survival, led to the initial studies of observing asymptomatic patients without initial therapy, ie, "watch and wait". Since the initial report of watch and wait as a treatment strategy for patients with low-grade FL, our understanding of the biology of the disease has advanced; multiple active new agents have been introduced into practice, and the survival of patients with low-grade FL has improved. Given these changes, is watch and wait still an acceptable treatment recommendation for a newly diagnosed patient with low-grade FL?

### Time for an individualized approach to first-line management of follicular lymphoma [^113Jj8UN]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Follicular lymphoma is a heterogeneous B-cell lymphoma both in presentation and at progression. For most patients it is a chronic, relapsing indolent disease with overall survival expectations now potentially beyond 20 years. However, in a significant minority (~20%) who experience early progression or histological transformation after treatment, the disease no longer has an indolent behavior. This review looks at the development of prognostic indices, staging and therapies for follicular lymphoma, identifying where the data can, and cannot, guide the multidisciplinary team to determine an individualized approach to first-line therapy. A nuanced patient- and disease-specific approach is necessary to maximize disease response and survival while minimizing therapeutic toxicity.

Remaining Unmet Needs

The protracted multiply relapsing clinical course of FL presents a fundamental challenge for how clinicians should best balance treatment efficacy, minimizing toxicity and preserving QoL.
Although the armamentarium of FL therapies has expanded, the optimal approach to selecting and sequencing treatments for an individual patient continues to be elucidated (Table 3).
Although several risk stratification tools exist with new models being developed, we continue to lack a clinically useful tool that can accurately identify patients with high‐risk disease who may benefit from individualized management to achieve longer remission, prevent transformation or resistance, and thereby further improve clinical outcomes.

### Is observation dead in follicular lymphoma? Still appropriate [^1141QNhM]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

Given the incurable yet indolent nature of follicular lymphoma (FL) and the lack of a survival benefit seen with the early treatment of patients with a low tumor burden, watchful waiting has been the predominant strategy for treating asymptomatic patients with newly diagnosed FL for more than 2 decades. The success and tolerability of rituximab for the treatment of this disease, however, has led to challenges for this treatment paradigm and the consideration of early upfront treatment with rituximab monotherapy, with or without rituximab maintenance. These strategies have resulted in improvements in quality of life with a low incidence of toxicity and have led some to practice changes. However, based on uncertainty about how early treatment affects response to second treatment, the differential cost of treatment, and the lack of a survival benefit, observation remains an appropriate and viable strategy for select patients.

### Frontline strategy for follicular lymphoma: are we ready to abandon chemotherapy? [^111psSGZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy combinations have been the backbone of therapy for follicular lymphoma, and are associated with high initial response rates. Unfortunately, toxicity and secondary malignancies remain concerns, and most advanced-stage patients still relapse within 5 years, regardless of the regimen. Advances in the understanding of lymphoma biology have resulted in a new generation of noncytotoxic therapeutics with significant activity in follicular lymphoma. Recent studies exploring biological and targeted combinations in the frontline have shown promise, with response rates similar to chemotherapy. However, these regimens are also associated with significant cost as well as a unique toxicity profile. Large randomized studies are underway to compare noncytotoxic regimens with chemotherapy in the frontline, and several new combinations are being tested in the phase 2 setting. Ongoing work to identify predictive biomarkers and investment in mechanistic studies will ultimately lead to the personalization of therapy in the frontline setting for follicular lymphoma.

### Follicular lymphoma: recent and emerging therapies, treatment strategies, and remaining unmet needs [^113kymT6]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in Western countries, with an annual incidence of 3.4–5 per 100,000 in Europe and the U.S. [1] [2]. Median age of diagnosis is 65 years [3], but a large proportion of cases also occurs in younger adults [4]. Although incurable, prognosis has improved for early‐ and advanced‐stage disease, largely attributed to therapeutic advances.

FL is a heterogeneous disease with varying prognosis, influenced by differences in clinical, laboratory, and disease parameters between patients. Spontaneous regressions might occur in about 5%–10% of patients [5]. Although many patients can be initially observed, most require therapy after a median of 3–4 years after diagnosis [6]. Approximately 20% of patients will have early relapse within 2 years following current first‐line therapy [7]. Thus, FL has a typically protracted course, with multiple remissions and relapses.

Although continued elucidation of the biologic and molecular basis of FL is leading to identification of new potential therapeutic avenues, the heterogeneity of FL presents challenges, including selection of appropriate management for individual patients. This review considers prognostic approaches and the FL treatment landscape, including recent and emergent therapies and remaining unmet needs.

### Aiming at a curative strategy for follicular lymphoma [^113NBqy1]. CA (2008). Low credibility.

Follicular lymphoma is often managed as an incurable disease. However, a substantial and growing fraction of patients are achieving long-term disease-free survival from aggressive treatment approaches. The application of novel therapeutic tools, including monoclonal antibodies, radioimmunotherapy, and vaccines, as well as new and more active chemotherapeutic agents, is producing complete responses in the majority of treated patients, with a 2-fold increase in disease- and progression-free survival in randomized trials. For some of these treatment approaches, follow up has not yet been long enough to determine a median response duration, but it certainly exceeds the "2 to 3 years" that is routinely stated as dogma to patients with this illness. Furthermore, some patients remain in complete remission beyond a decade from their initial treatment, implying that the assumption of inevitable relapse also must be challenged. One clear fact is that no patients will ever be cured by adopting a palliative treatment approach. The assumption that patients with follicular lymphoma are incurable is certain to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Here the author summarizes the large and growing body of knowledge that suggests an expectant approach to management is not appropriate for all patients.

### Follicular lymphoma: redefining prognosis, current treatment options, and unmet needs [^115pWhsa]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent lymphoma in the United States. In this review article, the authors discuss the different prognostic biomarkers available for follicular lymphoma. Treatment options, including observation, immunotherapy versus chemoimmunotherapy, in both the frontline and the relapse setting are also discussed in detail. Patients with follicular lymphoma with unmet needs include those with early relapse, with multiple relapses, and with histologic transformation. The treatment options for these patients are not well defined, and the authors discuss the available data for treating these patients.

### Follicular lymphoma: recent and emerging therapies, treatment strategies, and remaining unmet needs [^115hbKyn]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a heterogeneous disease with varying prognosis owing to differences in clinical, laboratory, and disease parameters. Although generally considered incurable, prognosis for early- and advanced-stage disease has improved because of therapeutic advances, several of which have resulted from elucidation of the biologic and molecular basis of the disease. The choice of treatment for FL is highly dependent on patient and disease characteristics. Several tools are available for risk stratification, although limitations in their routine clinical use exist. For limited disease, treatment options include radiotherapy, rituximab monotherapy or combination regimens, and surveillance. Treatment of advanced disease is often determined by tumor burden, with surveillance or rituximab considered for low tumor burden and chemoimmunotherapy for high tumor burden disease. Treatment for relapsed or refractory disease is influenced by initial first-line therapy and the duration and quality of the response. Presently, there is no consensus for treatment of patients with early or multiply relapsed disease; however, numerous agents, combination regimens, and transplant options have demonstrated efficacy. Although the number of therapies available to treat FL has increased together with an improved understanding of the underlying biologic basis of disease, the best approach to select the most appropriate treatment strategy for an individual patient at a particular time continues to be elucidated. This review considers prognostication and the evolving treatment landscape of FL, including recent and emergent therapies as well as remaining unmet needs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In follicular lymphoma, a personalized approach to management based on disease biology, patient characteristics, and other factors continues to emerge. However, application of current management requires an understanding of the available therapeutic options for first-line treatment and knowledge of current development in therapies for previously untreated and for relapsed or refractory disease. Thus, this work reviews for clinicians the contemporary data in follicular lymphoma, from advances in characterizing disease biology to current treatments and emerging novel therapies.

### Prognostic factors in follicular lymphoma: new tools to personalize risk [^112XkbFd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent lymphoma, and it has a long median overall survival (OS). However, the recent discovery of clinical and biological prognostic biomarkers in FL is shedding light on FL heterogeneity and the need for a precise and risk-stratified individual approach at diagnosis and relapse. Many FL patients who are asymptomatic with indolent disease can be vulnerable to the toxicity, emotional distress, and financial burden of overtreatment. Yet a subset of FL patients develop chemoresistance to standard chemoimmunotherapy, experience transformation to aggressive lymphoma and rapid progression, and represent the population most in need of novel therapies and curative approaches. Novel biomarkers that incorporate both clinical and genetic determinants of poor risk are being developed with the hope of identifying high-risk patients at diagnosis in order to offer biologically rational targeted therapies.

### Controversies in follicular lymphoma: "who, what, when, where, and why? " (not necessarily in that order!) [^1163TdxS]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent lymphoma. Specific "facts" about FL that were generated by past research and have been passed down as dogma to a majority of practicing oncologists over the past 20 to 30 years that need to be revisited, include: (1) do not initiate therapy soon after diagnosis in asymptomatic, advanced-stage patients since it does not change outcome; (2) initiate therapy with single-agent oral alkylators when intervention needed and "save" more aggressive combination chemotherapy for "later" since the standard chemotherapy regimen used did not seem to impact survival; (3) FL is an incurable disease and palliation of symptoms was an acceptable approach to the expected pattern of repeated relapses; (4) transformation of FL is independent of the type or timing of therapies received by a patient; (5) median overall survival (OS) for FL patients is 8–10 years. Although the heterogeneity of FL will never change, we are developing the scientific tools to identify and better understand the biologic and genetic features associated with its clinical variability. In the current exciting era of targeted therapies (e.g., rituximab, radioimmunoconjugates) and novel treatment approaches demonstrating an improvement in treatment outcomes (e.g., disease-free survival and OS), our old beliefs and historically accepted dogma need to be retested and revitalized. The optimal combination(s) of old and new agents and the optimal timing of when to initiate and how to sequence specific therapies will require data from well-designed clinical trials that should include important correlative laboratory studies.

### Excellent response to very-low-dose radiation (4 Gy) for indolent B-cell lymphomas: is 4 Gy suitable for curable patients? [^115RygRS]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Radiotherapy plays an important role in managing highly radiosensitive, indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas, such as follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. Although the standard of care for localized indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas remains 24 Gy, de-escalation to very-low-dose radiotherapy (VLDRT) of 4 Gy further reduces toxicities and duration of treatment. Use of VLDRT outside palliative indications remains controversial; however, we hypothesize that it may be sufficient for most lesions. We present the largest single-institution VLDRT experience of adult patients with follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma treated between 2005 and 2018 (299 lesions; 250 patients) using modern principles including positron emission tomography staging and involved site radiotherapy. Outcomes include best clinical or radiographic response between 1.5 and 6 months after VLDRT and cumulative incidence of local progression (LP) with death as the only competing risk. After VLDRT, the overall response rate was 90% for all treated sites, with 68% achieving complete response (CR). With a median follow-up of 2.4 years, the 2-year cumulative incidence of LP was 25% for the entire cohort and 9% after first-line treatment with VLDRT for potentially curable, localized disease. Lesion size > 6 cm was associated with lower odds of attaining a CR and greater risk of LP. There was no suggestion of inferior outcomes for potentially curable lesions. Given the clinical versatility of VLDRT, we propose to implement a novel, incremental, adaptive involved site radiotherapy strategy in which patients will be treated initially with VLDRT, reserving full-dose treatment for those who are unable to attain a CR.

### Follicular lymphoma research: an open dialogue for a collaborative roadmap [^117Nfjqa]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common type of lymphoma (20% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas), derived from germinal centre (GC) B cells, and is characterised by its significant clinical, prognostic and biological heterogeneity, leading to complexity in management. Despite significant biological investigation and indisputable clinical progress since the advent of the immunotherapy era more than 20years ago, much remains to be done to understand and cure this lymphoma. Today, FL is metaphorically a giant puzzle on the table with patches of sky, landscape and foliage clearly appearing. However, many of the remaining pieces are held by various stakeholders (e.g. clinicians, pathologists, researchers, drug developers) without global agreement on what the gaps are, or any clear blueprint on how to solve the puzzle of understanding the heterogeneity of this disease and create curative and tailored therapies. With the advent of new investigation and drug technologies, together with recent advances in our capacity to manage big data, the time seems ripe for a change of scale. More than ever, this will require collaboration between and within all stakeholders to overcome the current bottlenecks in the field. As for every investigator, we acknowledge that this first draft is necessarily biased, incomplete and some FL expert readers might recognise some remaining gaps not addressed. We hope they will reply to make this effort a collaborative one to assemble all the pieces in the most ideal fashion. As such, this review intends to be a first step and an interactive platform to a collaborative roadmap towards better understanding and care of FL.

### Recommendations for clinical trial development in follicular lymphoma [^114rBNon]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common lymphoid malignancy, representing 20% to 25% of all cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and the most common of the indolent NHLs. FL is considered incurable in the majority of patients with the current standard therapeutic approaches, although outcomes have improved in the last few decades with our current therapies, with a median overall survival that now exceeds 18 years. While the majority of patients with FL have improved outcomes with our current therapeutic approaches, there are patients with high-risk disease features that have inferior outcomes to these therapies. There is an urgent need to integrate novel therapeutic agents into the treatment regimens for these patients to improve outcomes with continued evaluation of biomarkers indicative of prognosis and effects of these regimens on quality of life.

### Is there a role for "watch and wait" in follicular lymphoma in the rituximab era? [^114dtUTJ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The paradigm of "watch and wait" for low-tumor-burden follicular lymphoma (LTB-FL) was established in an era when the treatment options were more limited. With the introduction of rituximab, it appears that the natural history of this incurable disease has changed. However, most of the contemporary treatment data have been generated in patients with high tumor burden, and it is unclear whether the improvements in outcome also apply to the LTB population. There are no published trials evaluating rituximab-chemotherapy combinations and just a few studies evaluating single-agent rituximab in this population. As a result, there are many unknowns in the management of LTB-FL. Would the application of rituximab-chemotherapy combination cure a fraction of patients? Would the application of rituximab-chemotherapy combination improve the overall survival of the population? Would treatment with single-agent rituximab improve the psychologic quality of life by avoiding a watch and wait interval or by delaying the time to first chemotherapy? This review, a mixture of data and opinion, will discuss goals of therapy for an LTB-FL patient, summarize existing data, and propose a management algorithm.

### In pursuit of a functional cure for follicular lymphoma [^113KzwZ4]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

We are now a quarter of a century after the transformative impact of rituximab in improving overall survival for patients with follicular lymphoma. With a burgeoning array of effective immunochemotherapy approaches, we can now frame many patients' expectations of longevity and a "functional cure", with survival estimates for many newly diagnosed patients comparable to age- and gender-matched populations. We highlight not just heterogeneity in disease but also in patients, which influences therapeutic decision-making in an immunochemotherapy era where progression-free survival advances are associated with efficacy-toxicity trade-offs, and no clear overall survival advantage is associated with any specific regimen. We provide the metrics that assist, prognostication both at diagnosis and after initial therapy, but we also highlight the limited long-term follow-up in institutional, population, and clinical trial data sets to inform our survival estimates. Nonetheless, the data are sufficient to empower us to reframe more optimistic conversations with our patients and the lymphoma community, discussions that engender hope and planning for a life lived long, and well, after therapy for follicular lymphoma.

### How we manage follicular lymphoma [^1112nGPN]. Leukemia (2014). Low credibility.

Major changes have taken place within the last few years in the management of follicular lymphoma (FL) leading to substantial improvement in prognosis and overall survival. For some patients with limited disease stages I and II, radiotherapy may be associated with durable responses; however, it is unclear whether patients are cured and new approaches such as the combination of irradiation with rituximab or even single-agent rituximab need to be explored. Whereas watch and wait is the current standard for stage III and IV disease with low tumour burden, better indices are warranted to potentially select patients for whom early intervention is preferred. For advanced stages with a high tumour burden, immunochemotherapy followed by 2 years of rituximab maintenance is widely accepted as standard therapy, although re-treatment at recurrence may be an alternative option. Highly attractive new therapeutic options have recently arisen from new antibodies, and from new agents targeting oncogenic pathways such as B-cell receptor signalling pathways or inhibition of bcl 2. Furthermore, immunomodulatory drugs may add to the therapeutic armamentarium and may lead to 'chemotherapy-free' therapies in the near future. Hence, the management of FLs has become a moving target and the hope is justified that the long-term perspectives of patients suffering from the disease will be further improved in the near future.

### Unmet needs in the first-line treatment of follicular lymphoma [^114cFHwV]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

For the majority of patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma (FL), current treatments, while not curative, allow for long remission durations. However, several important needs remain unaddressed. Studies have consistently shown that ∼20% of patients with FL experience disease progression within 2years of first-line treatment, and consequently have a 50% risk of death in 5years. Better characterization of this group of patients at diagnosis may provide insight into those in need of alternate or intensive therapies, facilitate a precision approach to inform clinical trials, and allow for improved patient counseling. Prognostic methods to date have employed clinical parameters, genomic methods, and a wide assortment of biological and biochemical markers, but none so far has been able to adequately identify this high-risk population. Advances in the first-line treatment of FL with chemoimmunotherapy have led to a median progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 7years; creating a challenge in the development of clinical trials where PFS is a primary end point. A surrogate end point that accurately predicts PFS would allow for new treatments to reach patients with FL sooner, or lessen toxicity, time, and expense to those patients requiring little to no therapy. Quality of response to treatment may predict PFS and overall survival in FL; as such complete response rates, either alone or in conjunction with PET imaging or minimal residual disease negativity, are being studied as surrogates, with complete response at 30 months after induction providing the strongest surrogacy evidence to date. A better understanding of how to optimize quality of life in the context of this chronic illness is another important focus deserving of further study. Ongoing efforts to address these important unmet needs are herein discussed.

### Refining the treatment of follicular lymphoma [^111TQAaC]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

Many effective treatments are currently available for patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). However, given the heterogeneity of this disease, identifying the most beneficial treatment for an individual patient remains a challenge, although clinical, genetic and biological features can all potentially be used to refine therapies in individual cases. The Follicular Lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) algorithm is a valuable prognostic tool for risk categorisation. Despite its current limitations, further investigation will help to develop the role of FLIPI in treatment decision-making, and will increase its value in identifying the optimal therapy for individuals. Biological factors such as bulky disease, over-expression of Bcl-2, or histological grade can help to identify patients at high risk of relapse, and distinguish between the benefits of early intervention vs. a watch-and-wait policy in early-stage FL. The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the development of FL, and identification of biological and genetic markers could help clinicians determine the prognosis of individual patients. Although much work remains to be done, a greater understanding of the biology of FL will lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets and therapies, bringing individualised treatment a step closer.

### Prospects in the management of patients with follicular lymphoma beyond first-line therapy [^116ikJ69]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While the median overall survival (OS) of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) was under 10 years over two decades ago, the vast majority (~80%) of patients diagnosed today are likely to be alive 10 years after their initial diagnosis, and their expected median OS may exceed 20 years. This remarkable progress reflects the improved efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions with the introduction of anti-CD20 antibodies, and our ability to deliver active therapies in subsequent lines for those patients experiencing disease progression. Several important challenges should be considered regarding the treatment of patients with disease progression after first-line therapy, who are still generally considered to have an incurable disease after the lymphoma recurrence.

The first challenge is the possibility of histological transformation – the leading cause of death of patients with FL. Transformation can occur any time during the disease course, although some data suggest an increased risk in the early years after diagnosis which decreases thereafter. This feared event should always be anticipated, and a new tumor biopsy performed whenever lymphoma progresses or does not respond to therapy. The use of positron emission tomography/computed tomography to guide the site of biopsy in the nodal area with the highest glucose uptake is recommended. The detailed management of transformed FL has been recently reviewedand is beyond the scope of this paper.

### Clinical significance of the WHO grades of follicular lymphoma in a population-based cohort of 505 patients with long follow-up times [^114wCRSZ]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of grading follicular lymphoma has been debated since the 1980s. There is consensus that World Health Organization (WHO) grades 1 and 2 are indolent, but not whether grades 3A or 3B are aggressive. We retrospectively reviewed the follicular lymphoma diagnoses according to the 2008 WHO classification in all diagnostic specimens from a population-based cohort of 505 patients with a median follow-up time of 10.0years (range, 4.6–16.0). After excluding 43 patients with concomitant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 345 remained with grade 1–2, 94 with grade 3A, and 23 with grade 3B follicular lymphoma. Grades 1–2 and 3A seemed equally indolent, with indistinguishable clinical courses, even in patients receiving anthracyclines. Compared with grades 1–3A and independently of clinical factors, grade 3B correlated with higher mortality (P = 0.008), but outcome was improved after upfront anthracycline-containing therapy (P = 0.015). In contrast to grade 1–3A patients, grade 3B patients experienced no relapses or deaths beyond 5years of follow-up. Furthermore, patients with grade 3B were predominantly male and seldom presented with bone-marrow involvement. We conclude that follicular lymphoma grade 1–3A is indolent and incurable with conventional therapy. Grade 3B appears to be an aggressive but curable disease.

### Incidental vs. symptomatic diagnosis of follicular lymphoma: implications of earlier detection [^111rxyBY]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which can be cured with chemoimmunotherapy regardless of stage, FL may only be potentially curable when localized at early stages, eg, with radiation. Although FL is the second most common NHL, it tends to present more indolently and is more likely to be discovered incidentally than DLBCL. As incidental detection becomes more common, whether through routine imaging or, in the future, molecular screening, these cases offer a glimpse into what might be uncovered through MCED strategies. Yet whether such early identification translates into better outcomes remains uncertain. To explore this, we examined the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with FL diagnosed incidentally versus those presenting with signs or symptoms, aiming to better understand the potential implications of earlier detection in this indolent lymphoma.

### Follicular lymphoma research: an open dialogue for a collaborative roadmap [^115gp4Gu]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

There are three critical unmet clinical needs in FL: (1) lack of useful prognostic tools at the time of diagnosis and prior to therapy, to guide clinical management; (2) the need for novel and more effective therapeutic targets derived from a comprehensive understanding of FL biology and tailored for defined subsets of FL patients; and (3) the lack of effective biomarkers to effectively follow therapeutic responses. In this review we will discuss the issues underlying these bottlenecks, highlight evidence gaps and propositions to overcome them.

### Follicular lymphoma [^117EX5PL]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Follicular lymphoma is an indolent and usually incurable disease. It has been therefore traditionally approached either by watch and wait or with single-agent treatments. The purpose was to maintain a good quality of life for a prolonged time. More aggressive regimens, including polychemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue and the emergence of new cytotoxic drugs have significantly improved the remission duration but could never demonstrate an impact on overall survival. In the past decade, through the addition of drugs acting on the immune system such as interferon or rituximab, the survival of follicular lymphoma patients could be improved by the range of several years. As a consequence several clinicians believe that we are near to a cure for follicular lymphoma so that the first-line treatment should be more aggressive to reach this goal. Nevertheless, at present, none of the new strategies can be shown to cure. We believe that even in the presence of many possible treatment options, watch and wait remains a good option for many patients with follicular lymphoma. When treatment is needed, chemotherapy with rituximab is the standard even though none of the chemotherapy regimens can be shown to be superior. As quality of life remains an issue, the combination of rituximab and bendamustine, a drug with high efficacy and a favourable toxicity profile, is a good new option for patients.

### Outcome of follicular lymphoma grade 3: is anthracycline necessary as front-line therapy? [^115J5RUf]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Table 5
Survival of patients with follicular large cell lymphoma in recently reported series). Although our inclusion of stage I and II disease patients may explain the better survival, our long-term outcome still compares favourably with series which included stage I and II only.

Although there is no difference in CSS among grades 1, 2 and 3, no disease-related deaths occurred beyond 10 years for grade 3. This suggests that a proportion of patients may be potentially curable or successfully salvaged, but prolonged survival means that patients may die from unrelated causes. A long-term follow-up of 62 patients from the MD Anderson series treated between 1973 and 1981 showed that lymphoma-related mortality continued to occur beyond 15 years suggesting that longer follow-up for our cohort of patients is necessary before this plateau in CSS can be confirmed. No difference in FFS was observed among grades 1–3. Patients with FL grade 3 had a continuing risk of relapses with 10 patients relapsing after 5 years. Although no relapses have been observed beyond 9 years, only five patients are failure free at this time point. Again longer follow-up and larger patient number are necessary to determine the curability of grade 3.

### Current treatment options in follicular lymphoma: science and bias [^111QpAky]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2007). Low credibility.

Follicular lymphoma is a disease usually characterized by sensitivity to treatment but a pattern of multiple recurrences. Over the last decades, a single optimal therapeutic approach could not be identified and agreed upon. As a result, the selection of the treatment employed for a given patient was both a result of clinical science and bias. The outcomes have been recently improved substantially with the implementation of rituximab, an antiCD20 antibody. Randomized studies have documented repeatedly the clinical benefit conferred by its use, both in combination with chemotherapy, as well as monotherapy applied after remission induction. Although such studies have resulted in important conclusions that help formulate a widely accepted model of treatment sequences for patients with follicular lymphoma, there still remains a considerable area of uncertainty, open for speculation and biased choices. The current review intends to describe the current status of follicular lymphoma treatment, making also an effort to distinguished firm knowledge from reasonable speculation.

### Prospects in the management of patients with follicular lymphoma beyond first-line therapy [^115NgM3z]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma has evolved markedly in the last decade, with the availability of new classes of agents (phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors, immunomodulators, epigenetic therapies, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells) supplementing the multiple approaches already available (cytotoxic agents, anti-CD20 antibodies, radiation therapy, radioimmunotherapy, and autologous and allogeneic transplants). The diversity of clinical scenarios, the flood of data derived from phase II studies, and the lack of randomized studies comparing treatment strategies preclude firm recommendations and require personalized decisions. Patients with early progression require specific attention given the risk of histological transformation and their lower response to standard therapies. In sequencing therapies, one must consider prior treatment regimens and the potential need for future lines of therapy. Careful evaluation of risks and expected benefits of available options, which vary depending on location and socioeconomics, should be undertaken, and should incorporate the patient's goals. Preserving quality of life for these patients is essential, given the likelihood of years to decades of survival and the possibility of multiple lines of therapy. The current landscape is likely to continue evolving rapidly with other effective agents emerging (notably bispecific antibodies and other targeted therapies), and multiple combinations being evaluated. It is hoped that new treatments under development will achieve longer progression-free intervals and minimize toxicity. A better understanding of disease biology and the mechanisms of these different agents should provide further insights to select the optimal therapy at each stage of disease.

BOX 2
Key challenges and opportunities towards therapeutic innovation

The current drug market remains mostly follicular lymphoma (FL)‐biology agnostic. We need to:
Change the way the drug market is approached and align the development of drugs in FL with its key biological characteristics/mechanism of action rather than repositioning drugs showing efficacy in other indications (or even other lymphoma subtypes). Together with this, drug repurposing based on biological and testable rationales should become more frequent and used in parallel to our progress on FL biology
Advocate for a personalised approach with theragnostic information as part of pathology reporting
Provide the community with a routinely available biomarker of response, or a theragnostic classification, for each novel agent in development

Going forward, we should keep in mind that one size does not fit all in FL and that a personalised strategy should be the goal. We need to define effective therapeutic targets that consider the heterogeneity observed for decades in FL (clinical and biological) and the complex layers of biology that underlie this heterogeneity. This probably means defining different therapeutic targets for different subpopulations of FL driven by the unique biological features of that subpopulation. As part of this effort, it is critical that specific and reliable biomarkers of response are developed for each therapeutic agent. This will require the collaboration of pathologists and clinicians in the performance of clinical trials (including Phase III) that are carefully designed with paired clinical and biological endpoints integrated as part of the trial design. Naturally, the identification of novel high‐yield targets in subsets of FL will depend upon significant advances in our understanding of the complex layers of FL biology (Box 2).

### Prognostic factors in follicular lymphoma [^1122DYBe]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most common types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, for which many treatment options exist, however, no curative standard therapy has been identified. The outcome is highly variable with a median survival of approximately 10 years. The life expectancy of patients with FL has been extended with the use of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 antigen on FL cells, but there remains a group of patients who fail to respond to chemoimmunotherapy and die early of their disease. Transformation of FL to an aggressive histology is an important event with high morbidity and mortality. The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index has become the clinically useful prognostic tool, but gives only a rough estimate of expected outcome. There is a need for useful biomarkers for prediction of the disease course of single patients to individualize therapy, especially in the new era of chemoimmunotherapy.

### How I treat early-relapsing follicular lymphoma [^1164wwUi]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most frequently occurring indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with generally favorable outcomes but a variable clinical course. Recent studies have elucidated the consistent and reproducible frequency of early disease progression in FL, occurring in ∼20% of patients. Relapse of FL within 24 months of chemoimmunotherapy (POD24) is now established as a robust marker of poor survival, leading to increased risk of death. Currently, there is no established method of identifying patients at risk for early disease progression at the time of their FL diagnosis. However, numerous studies worldwide are investigating clinical, pathologic, and radiographic biomarkers to help predict POD24, thereby improving subsequent outcomes and adapting therapy based on individual risk. There is also a paucity of standardized treatments for patients with POD24, but investigations are ongoing testing novel targeted therapies and autologous stem cell transplantation strategies. This review provides an overview of early-relapsing FL and our approach to patient management based on recent available data.

Introduction

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma, with a median survival approaching two decades. Advanced-stage disease is present at diagnosis in up to 90% of cases and treatment initiation in these is predominantly determined by the patient's tumor burden and symptomatology; high-burden or symptomatic disease is generally managed with immunochemotherapy-based regimens. Over the past decades substantive improvements have been made to the outcomes of those with FL, with some responders to frontline treatment having similar survival to sex- and age-matched populations. Despite this however, many patients subsequently experience relapse, with treatment causing acute and long-term toxicities. -In contrast, patients with low tumor burden, asymptomatic FL undergo initial surveillance or a so-called 'watch-and-wait' (W&W) approach, based on an absent survival advantage with early treatment initiation in both retrospective and randomized studies. The 10% of patients presenting with limited-stage disease often undergo curative-intent radiotherapy.-In order to optimize long-term outcomes for all FL patients, the basis for a decision to treat, and its timing, are key.

### Transformation in follicular lymphoma: biology, prognosis, and therapeutic options [^117Kd7LR]. Current Oncology Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The transformation of follicular lymphoma to an aggressive lymphoma is a well-recognised complication that occurs at a rate of approximately 3% a year for the first 10 years of observation. Transformation is accompanied by increased risk of refractoriness and a poor expectation of survival. Genetic and epigenetic triggers for transformation have been described. Prior to routine use of rituximab, transformed lymphoma was managed in a fashion similar to that for de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with generally poor results. Rituximab appears to have improved outcomes. Some centres, including our own, use high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation as consolidation for those with responsive disease. Here, we focus on transformed follicular lymphoma, and provide an overview of the current literature and our approach to management.

### Dissecting follicular lymphoma: high versus low risk [^115xVJmC]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Progress in the management of follicular lymphoma (FL) has translated to improved outcomes, with most patients surviving a decade or more from the time of diagnosis. However, the disease remains quite heterogeneous and a substantial number of patients have more aggressive disease with short responses to therapy and/or transformation to higher-grade lymphomas. Given the lack of a single standard approach, it is important to understand sources of heterogeneity among patients that influence initial management, surveillance strategies, and overall prognosis. Most of the validated tools, such as the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) and FLIPI-2, apply to the frontline setting, and there is an unmet need for prognostic tools in relapsed and refractory disease states. In particular, the number of prior treatment regimens may be less important than the duration of response to the most recent regimen and the type of prior therapy received. Furthermore, despite awareness of progressive genetic and epigenetic derangements and a growing appreciation of the microenvironment's role in FL outcomes, there is no validated means of incorporating biologic data into clinical prognostic indices. This review highlights the current state of knowledge regarding risk stratification in FL.

Conclusion

Significant strides have been made in outcomes for patients with FL. Our next priorities must tackle the subsets of patients that are early progressors or multiply relapsed by defining optimum strategies to improve survival. Successfully achieving this will require improved prognostication, understanding and integration of the disease biology, and delineating molecular determinants of response and resistance to existing and emergent therapies. Most notably, POD24 has been shown to be a powerful predictor of poor outcome, although it is not clear if it can become a standard surrogate endpoint to evaluate efficacy of investigational treatments. Finally, current FL treatment strategies are based on a "one size fits all" approach; specific genetic and epigenetic aberrations in an individual patient are not currently accounted for in their management. No genomic studies can be recommended currently with sufficient validation, although this is an area of ongoing investigation if we can identify biomarkers correlated with predictive or prognostic value. In the future, a personalized approach to treatment could help determine the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient based on specific patient, clinical, genetic, and epigenetic factors with our improved ability to marry disease biology to therapy.

### Is there a role for a maintenance rituximab in indolent lymphoproliferative diseases other than follicular lymphoma? [^113SC5nq]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2017). Low credibility.

Rituximab (R) is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which has become an essential component for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas. When associated to chemotherapy it improves the outcome of the patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and other lymphoproliferative diseases in comparison to chemotherapy alone. For patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma achieving at least a partial response to initial immuno-chemotherapy, maintenance R was associated with an improvement in progression-free survival and a meta-analysis of randomized maintenance trials suggests an overall survival advantage. The role of maintenance R in other indolent diseases is less well-defined. In this article, we summarize the data available for this strategy in less frequent subtypes of indolent B-cell lymphomas.

### Time for an individualized approach to first-line management of follicular lymphoma [^1139iHgK]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent lymphoid neoplasm derived from germinal center B cells. Rapid therapeutic initiation is rarely required. With the oftenadvanced age of patients at diagnosis and the indolent nature of the disease, some patients will never need treatment. Almost half of patients with asymptomatic disease undergoing an accepted "watch and wait strategy" will not have commenced treatment 31 months after diagnosis. For symptomatic patients, the combination of a monoclonal antibody against CD20 (rituximab, obinutuzumab) with chemotherapy results in 80% survival at 10 years. Many of these patients will not experience disease relapse or die from their disease, even though FL remains the most common cause of death. The challenge for hematologists is to identify patients who need treatment and to define the most appropriate treatment for them considering their age, comorbidities and likelihood of subsequent relapse, to optimize both longevity and quality of life. While most patients are destined to have a prolonged survival, described as a "functional cure", approximately 20% of patients will progress within the first 2 years of initiating treatment. These early failures, which frequently correspond with histological transformation into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, constitute the true evolutionary turning point of this disease, accounting for more than 50% of patinets' deaths in the first decade. Faced with difficulty in predicting an individual patient's outcome before treatment initiation, it is important to implement a dynamic strategy that ensures the early identification of those patients who experience histological transformation in order to offer them innovative therapeutic strategies. The nuanced management of FL is now well charted. With our comprehensive knowledge of the disease, its evolution and patient-related factors, we are now able to discuss different therapeutic approaches with our patients. The recent arrival of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) challenges certain therapeutic choices. Here again, our evolving knowledge and a balanced and honest discussion with the patient should enable informed decision-making adapted to the patient's life priorities.

### Follicular lymphoma research: an open dialogue for a collaborative roadmap [^114PNpZC]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction: unmet clinical needs as a starting point

The management of follicular lymphoma (FL) begins with histological diagnosis by a surgical pathologist, which is relatively straightforward, and based on the presence of centrocytes and admixed centroblasts with an immunophenotype consistent with a GC cell of origin (COO). FL is, at least partly, usually associated with a follicular pattern and the presence of BCL2 and/or BCL6 gene rearrangements, although subtypes that deviate from this have been recently characterised. The majority of FL patients present with lymphadenopathy in multiple sites with variable systemic distribution, tumour burden and association with symptoms (e.g. localised or systemic lymphadenopathy with no symptoms versus extensive lymphadenopathy with B symptoms or symptoms related to site of involvement). FL is characterised by a clinical heterogeneity at time of diagnosis that relies upon biological heterogeneity, which is still challenging to capture fully. This heterogeneity results in the application of a variety of first‐line treatment strategies, including 'watch and wait' for patients without symptoms to immunochemotherapy (ICT) with rituximab maintenance for patients with a clinically symptomatic disease, associated with a median progression‐free survival (PFS) of 10.5 years, with a 10‐year overall survival (OS) estimate of 80%. However, the absence of a plateau on all progression‐free survival curves after this and other available first‐ and second‐line therapies reflects the frequent occurrence of relapses, leading to FL being considered as a mainly incurable disease. Each sequential relapse tends to occur more quickly and with increased aggressivity and refractoriness to subsequent therapeutic options.

The clinical prognosis of FL patients after therapy is also heterogeneous and relatively unpredictable. A significant subset of treated FL patients (15–20%) harbour a chemo refractory disease from the outset or experience an early relapse within 24 months of first‐line chemotherapy (POD24), associated with an increased risk of death from lymphoma. Transformation to an aggressive lymphoma (tFL) is responsible for this poor outcome in most of these cases. Conversely, 50% of treated FL patients will be long‐term responders without relapses after 10 years of follow‐up and for whom the leading cause of death will not be lymphoma, but rather independent malignancies, cardiovascular disease or other unrelated causes. This has led to the evolution of the definition of 'cure' in FL, and the emergence of the concept of 'functional cure'.

Based on these considerations, we sought to define survival outcomes and test the definition of cure in young (≤ 50 years) MM patients treated in the contemporary era, and compare outcomes with similarly aged patients with three other hematologic malignancies (follicular lymphoma [FL], DLBCL, and Hodgkin lymphoma [HL]), the latter two of which are widely considered to be curable cancers and meet accepted definitions of cure. We specifically chose a cohort ≤ 50 years of age since this age group is likely to have few comorbidities, have access to and be able to tolerate the best possible treatments concurrently or sequentially, and thereby have the best opportunity to achieve "cure". Moreover, if the disease is curable, subsequent mortality in younger persons should be close to the general population. This eliminates the problem encountered in a disease affecting predominantly older adults, like MM, where curability is difficult to test due to deaths from competing causes.

### Follicular lymphoma: diagnostic and prognostic considerations in initial treatment approach [^112xgxTJ]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Follicular lymphoma is a diverse disease, with a diverse variable biology, clinical presentation, and prognosis. The identification of factors that can predict the specific outcome of follicular lymphoma patients remains an area of need. Here, we review the significant advances made in follicular lymphoma prognosis in the last two decades, particularly with the advent of new genetic models.

Recent Findings

Tumor burden remains an important predictor of prognosis and is still a standard upon which treatment initiation decisions are made. Clinical prognostic indices, including the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) and FLIPI-2, are validated to predict overall survival and progression-free survival, respectively. However, clinical decisions are rarely made based on these and other indices. Recently described molecular abnormalities in follicular lymphoma include those involving epigenetic regulation, cell-surface receptor signaling, and those controlling the interactions of the follicular lymphoma cell with the microenvironment. Clinicogenetic indices, such as the m7-FLIPI, take into account molecular information and provide a more accurate prognostic prediction than clinical indices. Significant advances have been made in the development of predictive models of risk in follicular lymphoma, in particular with the incorporation of genetic information to predict risk. New models are capable of identifying groups of patients at highest risk of progression. However, it is not yet possible to predict the specific clinical course of a particular patient based on baseline factors. Continued research is needed to identify patients at highest risk of failing initial therapy and the therapeutic approaches to improve their outcomes.

### Time for an individualized approach to first-line management of follicular lymphoma [^116q5zXi]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

FL is an indolent B-cell lymphoma and affected patients now have a very prolonged median OS approaching 20 years. A hallmark of FL is its heterogeneity both at presentation and in the event of relapse. A significant proportion of patients managed with a "watch and wait" approach do not require any therapy, and the use of rituximab monotherapy for treating these patients is likely lower in the current COVID pandemic. With more accurate staging and expansion of therapeutic options in the modern era the treatment of each patient needs to be individualized. Nuanced decisions made in partnership with the patient and their families must account for competing priorities between efficacy and safety as we "play the long game" in lymphoma management. This is particularly important as data make it clear that neither PFS nor POD24 75 are surrogates for OS. The small but cumulative risk of histological transformation mandates biopsy at relapse, especially in patients with early symptomatic progression for whom aggressive approaches may mitigate the poorer prognosis of early histological transformation. Conversely, for other patients a prolonged first remission after either radiotherapy for low-volume, localized disease or chemoimmunotherapy for high-tumor burden may be sustained for several years. In the elderly or those with substantial co-morbidities, FL may not relapse in their lifetime. The lack of an obvious preferred option for first-line chemoimmunotherapy for FL is exacerbated by the challenges and uncertainties of the COVID era. This pandemic brings into sharp focus the importance of attention to not just PFS but also to treatment toxicities and quality of life when choosing initial chemo-immunotherapy and making an individualized risk:benefit analysis of continuing therapy with antibody maintenance.

Natural course of the disease

FL is still considered as an indolent but usually incurable disease, although the age- and gender-matched survival in patients who have remained event-free for 2 years after initial treatment challenges our concepts of cure.FL is characterized by a heterogeneous presentation and outcome reflecting its biological heterogeneity. Patients with advanced stage indolent disease are manageable with a "wait and watch" strategy for many years whereas others may experience short OS related to transformation into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In the former population, representing one third of patients, an indolent presentation does not require therapeutic intervention. For such asymptomatic patients, 50% and 20% will not require treatment at 3 and 10 years, respectively, after diagnosis and their estimated OS is probably higher than the median 80% charted at 10 years after rituximab chemotherapy. The pattern of clinical evolution seems to be the same for FL grades 1,2 and 3A whereas, grade 3B FL is now recognized to be genetically closer to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with a more aggressive course that requires anthracycline-containing immunochemotherapy at diagnosis. For patients requiring treatment, the use of combined immunochemotherapy results in a 10-year OS of around 80%. However, the lack of a plateau in the PFS curve suggests that we have probably only extended the natural history of this indolent disease with repeated relapses at increasingly shorter intervals. Despite recent therapeutic progress and improved OS, FL remains the leading cause of death in patients with a cumulative incidence of 10% at 10 years. Nonetheless, even after first relapse/progression the survival data are promising, with a median OS for patients who received second-line treatment beyond 10 years. Patients experiencing disease progression within 24 months after treatment initiation (POD24) represent a particular group of need, with a 5- year survival of only 50%. However, it should be noted that this datum was derived in an era that predated PETbased staging and in one large retrospective populationbased study the prognostic impact of POD24 is not as powerful in the modern era.

### Improvement of overall and failure-free survival in stage IV follicular lymphoma: 25 years of treatment experience at the university of Texas M.D. anderson cancer center [^113LVWtb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Advanced-stage follicular lymphoma is considered incurable. The pace of improvements in treatment has been slow. This article analyzes five sequential cohorts of patients with stage IV follicular lymphoma treated between 1972 and 2002.

Methods

Five consecutive studies (two were randomized trials) involving 580 patients were analyzed for overall survival (OS), failure-free survival (FFS), and survival after first relapse. A proportional hazards analysis, and subset analyses using the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) score were performed. Treatment regimens included: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, bleomycin (CHOP-Bleo); CHOP-Bleo followed by interferon alfa (IFN-alpha); a rotation of three regimens (alternating triple therapy), followed by IFN-alpha; fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone (FND) followed by IFN-alpha; and FND plus delayed versus concurrent rituximab followed by IFN-alpha.

Results

Improvements in 5-year OS (from 64% to 95%) and FFS (from 29% to 60%) indicate steady progress, perhaps partly due to more effective salvage therapies, but the FFS data also indicate improved front-line therapies; these observations held true after controlling for differences in prognostic factors among the cohorts. The FLIPI model adds rigor to and facilitates comparisons among the different cohorts. An unexpected finding in this study was a trend toward an apparent FFS plateau.

Conclusion

Evolving therapy, including the incorporation of biologic agents, has led to stepwise significant outcome improvements for patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma. The apparent plateau in the FFS curve, starting approximately 8 to 10 years from the beginning of treatment, raises the issue of the potential curability of these patients.

FL Treatment

Newly Diagnosed Disease

Assessment of a patient newly diagnosed with FL includes consideration of disease burden, lymphoma‐related symptoms, presence of comorbidities, patient preference, and age. Newly diagnosed FL can be broadly classified as limited or advanced‐stage disease and further classified according to degree of tumor burden; choice of management varies accordingly (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Treatment options in newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma. *Patients with limited disease but high tumor burden should be treated as per patients with advanced disease and high tumor burden. † With or without anti‐CD20 maintenance therapy. ‡ For frail patients.

Localized/Limited‐Stage Disease.

Approximately 10%–15% of patients with FL have limited, nonbulky disease at diagnosis, which includes Ann Arbor stage I–II disease [2]. For Ann Arbor stage I or II (possibly confirmed by fluorodeoxyglucose‐PET) disease, use of 24‐Gy involved‐field radiotherapy (IFRT) administered in 12 fractions is potentially curative and is often the preferred treatment option for disease encompassed in a single appropriate radiation port, with no additional apparent efficacy benefit of higher doses [2] [12] [54]. By restricting the radiation field size to smaller volumes, IFRT limits radiation exposure to adjacent uninvolved tissue, thereby reducing risk of long‐term adverse effects [12]. A recent assessment of outcomes of definitive IFRT found that local relapses in or near irradiated fields are rare, and the vast majority of failures are distant [55]. Additionally, only about 25% of patients experience grade 1/2 and < 1% have grade 3 toxicities. For palliation and local control alone, two fractions of 2 Gy may be sufficient [2] [56].

Based on experience in advanced disease, patients with mildly symptomatic, localized disease have been treated with rituximab monotherapy [2] [12], but this strategy should only be used if radiotherapy cannot be safely administered. Different rituximab treatment strategies (alone, in combination with chemotherapy, or together with radiation therapy) and comparison with radiotherapy alone in limited disease have been reported [57] [58]. Although combined modality approaches improved PFS compared with radiotherapy alone, no OS difference between treatment approaches was seen. Additionally, extrapolation from the experience in advanced‐stage disease, in which surveillance is standard, has been used as a rationale to support use of surveillance for management of limited‐stage disease in selected patients [59].

### Follicular lymphoma: evolving therapeutic strategies [^111MBuF8]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the Western hemisphere. After decades of stagnation, the natural history of FL appears to have been favorably impacted by the introduction of rituximab. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to standard chemotherapy induction has improved the overall survival. Maintenance rituximab strategies can improve progression-free survival. Even chemotherapy platforms have changed in the past 5 years, as bendamustine combined with rituximab has rapidly become a standard frontline strategy in North America and parts of Europe. Recent discoveries have identified patients at high risk for poor outcomes to first-line therapy (m7-Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index [m7-FLIPI]) and for poor outcomes after frontline therapy (National LymphoCare Study). However, several unmet needs remain, including a better ability to identify high-risk patients at diagnosis, the development of predictive biomarkers for targeted agents, and strategies to reduce the risk of transformation. The development of targeted agents, exploiting our current understanding of FL biology, is a high research priority. A multitude of novel therapies are under investigation in both the frontline and relapsed/refractory settings. It will be critical to identify the most appropriate populations for new agents and to develop validated surrogate end points, so that novel agents can be tested (and adopted, if appropriate) efficiently.

Patients with localized follicular lymphoma are potentially curable; however, the failure rate for local treatment suggests that a proportion of apparently localized disease is being under-staged.

This case provides some evidence to the cause of treatment failure in patients with clinically localized follicular lymphoma, and is a histologically proven example of the association between melanoma and lymphoma.

### Treatment patterns and outcomes in follicular lymphoma with POD24: an analysis from the LEO consortium [^115EJMza]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second-most common lymphoma and the most common indolent lymphoma in the United States and Western Europe. Although outcomes have improved over time and the overall survival (OS) for patients at 10 years after diagnosis is ∼80%, lymphoma-related events and lymphoma-related death still constitute a significant risk to patients. Results of the National LymphoCare Study (NLCS) demonstrated that patients with relapse or progression of disease within 24 months of initial immunochemotherapy (POD24) of frontline immunochemotherapy (IC) had a 5-year OS of 50% vs 90% for those without. Data from the Follicular Lymphoma Analysis of Surrogate Hypothesis, which included multiple international randomized clinical trials with heterogeneous treatments, similarly validated POD24 as a clinical end point of importance and redemonstrated its association with early mortality. Efforts to better identify patients at risk of POD24 and mitigation strategies are areas of ongoing research efforts.,

Treatment of patients with retained follicular histology at POD24 constitutes a specific clinical challenge. Although guidelines are available for relapsed FL, there is no established standard of care. Specific guidelines for the treatment of POD24 are based on modest available evidence and expert opinion. Recommendations from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network address refractory disease but not specifically POD24 in their treatment algorithms, with mention of treatment with anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy based on recently published data in this population. European guidelines similarly lack established standards, with consideration of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in those eligible. These diverse recommendations underscore a lack of consensus regarding the optimal therapy for this patient subset, which has historically relied on post hoc analyses of outcomes for subgroups with POD24.

The Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) Consortium for Real World Evidence database included a large multicenter US cohort of relapsed or refractory FL, including patients from the LEO Cohort study (NCT02736357) and LEO-participating institutions. This analysis uses the LEO Consortium for Real World Evidence database to address what therapeutic choices are made in patients with FL after POD24 in contemporary academic practices and what outcomes are observed.

### Radiolabeled and native antibodies and the prospect of cure of follicular lymphoma [^116ShraE]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Advanced-stage follicular lymphoma is incurable by conventional treatment. Rituximab has been introduced in various combinations with chemotherapy and has resulted in a significantly superior treatment outcome compared with chemotherapy alone. Multiple studies have also shown the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy. Rituximab and RIT have clearly distinct mechanisms of action, the first acting exclusively as a biological treatment, while the second acts by a combination of biologic mechanisms and radiation effects. Despite the therapeutic efficacy of both approaches, the potential exists to further improve both modalities. Repeat administrations of RIT using appropriate radioisotopes for treatment of residual disease or new targeting strategies might afford additional benefits. Unlabeled antibody treatment could potentially benefit from the combination of antibodies directed against different target antigens or combination therapy with cytokines capable of further mobilizing patients' cellular defenses. In this review, we hypothesize that the combination of an optimized biological treatment together with radiolabeled antibodies and chemotherapy early in the disease course of advanced-stage follicular lymphoma may represent the best approach to achieve prolonged disease-free survival and eventually cure.

### Low-grade non-hodgkin lymphomas [^111dxiWS]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The most common low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas are of B-cell origin. This review will focus on follicular lymphomas and extranodal marginal zone lymphomas, also known as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. These are radiation-sensitive lymphomas. Moderate doses (30–35 Gy) for these stage I and II low-grade lymphomas result in long-term local control and possible cure. Involved-field radiation therapy is the standard approach and produces minimal morbidity. However, a significant proportion of patients relapse with systemic disease outside of radiation fields. For follicular lymphoma, this occurs in approximately 50% of patients after 15 years and for nongastric MALT lymphoma 30% to 40% after 10 years. Patients with relapsed disease are not curable with chemotherapy, but the disease often remains indolent and prolonged survival is observed. For gastric MALT lymphomas associated with Helicobacter pylori but which did not respond to antibiotic therapy, radiation treatment is indicated and almost always curative. For localized MALT lymphomas not related to microorganisms, radiation therapy is the initial standard therapy regardless of anatomic location. Patients with stage III and IV low-grade lymphoma and local symptoms are often successfully palliated with a low dose regimen of 2 x 2 Gy (total dose 4 Gy).

### Prolonged survival in the absence of disease-recurrence in advanced-stage follicular lymphoma following chemo-immunotherapy: 13-year update of the prospective, multicenter randomized GITMO-IIL trial [^1148zfgb]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

A prospective trial conducted in the period 2000–2005 showed no survival advantage for high-dose chemotherapy with rituximab and autograft (R-HDS) versus conventional chemotherapy with rituximab (CHOP-R) as first-line therapy in 134 high-risk follicular lymphoma patients aged < 60 years. The study has been updated at the 13-year median follow up. As of February 2017, 88 (66%) patients were alive, with overall survival of 66.4% at 13 years, without a significant difference between R-HDS (64.5%) and CHOP-R (68.5%). To date, 46 patients have died, mainly because of disease progression (47.8% of all deaths), secondary malignancies (3 solid tumor, 9 myelodysplasia/acute leukemia; 26.1% of all deaths), and other toxicities (21.7% of all deaths). Complete remission was documented in 98 (73.1%) patients and associated with overall survival, with 13-year estimates of 77.0% and 36.8% for complete remission versus no-complete remission, respectively. Molecular remission was documented in 39 (65%) out of 60 evaluable patients and associated with improved survival. In multivariate analysis, complete remission achievement had the strongest effect on survival (P < 0.001), along with younger age (P = 0.002) and female sex (P = 0.013). Overall, 50 patients (37.3%) survived with no disease recurrence (18 CHOP-R, 32 R-HDS). This follow up is the longest reported on follicular lymphoma treated upfront with rituximab-chemotherapy and demonstrates an unprecedented improvement in survival compared to the pre-rituximab era, regardless of the use of intensified or conventional treatment. Complete remission was the most important factor for prolonged survival and a high proportion of patients had prolonged survival in their first remission, raising the issue of curability in follicular lymphoma.

### Maintenance rituximab in follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma: facts and controversies [^113d5uTy]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2012). Low credibility.

The advent of rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20, has arguably improved and changed the natural history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and has become an essential component of front-line and relapsed disease treatment strategies. Given its tolerability and long half-life, rituximab has been investigated in the maintenance setting in follicular lymphoma. Several landmark studies have demonstrated improvement in progression-free survival in patients receiving maintenance rituximab compared to those observed. These favorable results were witnessed in front-line and in the relapsed setting using a variety of induction programs such as rituximab monotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. Importantly, toxicities were predictable and manageable. Despite these encouraging results, many vital and practical questions remain unanswered. In this review, we critically analyze the data that led to the widespread use of maintenance rituximab in follicular lymphoma and attempt to answer the most important questions facing practicing oncologists when deciding on using this approach in their patients.

### Revising the treatment pathways in lymphoma: new standards of care-how Do we choose? [^113yqrXq]. ASCO (2025). Medium credibility.

1Patients typically present with rapidly evolving nodal and/or extranodal disease and frequently require immediate treatment. DLBCL is curable with immunochemotherapy in a majority of patients, with the likelihood of cure affected by underlying biology, clinical presentation, and ability to receive optimal therapy. 2Unfortunately, in approximately 40% of patients, DLBCL is refractory to or relapses after initial treatment and continues to pose a therapeutic challenge. Numerous attempts have been made to improve outcomes beyond those achieved with R-CHOP. The use of intensive chemotherapy or consolidative stem cell transplantation has not yielded a survival benefit. 55Standard of care for eligible patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL has been salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, established by the PARMA trial, which found improved 5-year OS with incorporation of autologous stem cell transplantation.

72Loncastuximab resulted in an overall response rate of 48%, complete response rate of 24%, and median PFS and median OS of 5 and 10 months, respectively. For patients who had previously received CAR T-cell therapy, the overall response rate was 46%, similar to that for the overall study population, and those who had received CAR T cells after loncastuximab had an overall response rate of 47%. 73After 35 months or longer of follow-up, the study demonstrated an overall response rate of 57. 5%, with a complete response rate of 40%, and median PFS and median OS of
11. 6 and 34 months, respectively. 74Compared with other regimens, administration of therapy was somewhat more cumbersome, because it entailed weekly infusions of tafasitamab for 12 weeks, followed by infusions every 2 weeks until progression.

For patients experiencing early relapses who are fit enough, immunochemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation as consolidation may be a suitable option. Data from three retrospective transplantation series suggest that patients with follicular lymphoma with early progression had superior outcomes if they underwent autologous stem cell transplantation, compared with those who did not. 86–88Although allogeneic transplantation is potentially curative, the higher nonrelapse mortality and the emergence of alternative cellular therapies have limited this modality to the subset of fitter patients who experience relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation.

### What is the best first-line treatment strategy for patients with indolent lymphomas? [^114f69pQ]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

Abstract Overview: Although advanced follicular lymphoma is considered incurable, patient outcomes have improved over the last decade with the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Multiple treatment options are available and their use depends on clinical presentation and patient condition and age. Radiation therapy for patients with limited stage disease remains useful, although its use in the era of anti-CD20 antibodies should be re-evaluated. 1For patients with follicular lymphoma, several comparisons from single-center and cooperative-group studies indicate that the median OS has increased from 8 to 10 years to 12 to 15 years 2, 3 This progress has been achieved, at least partly, because of the introduction of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.

However, the lack of clinical or biologic criteria either to plan the optimal time to initiate therapy or to select between using anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy likely explain the heterogeneity of first-line treatment decisions observed in the LymphoCare study. Is Radiation Therapy for Patients with Limited-Stage Follicular Lymphoma Still an Option in 2012. Radiation therapy has long been considered the treatment of choice for patients with follicular lymphoma with Ann Arbor stage I or stage II disease. This option has been promoted as potentially curative, although the disease might recur in areas outside the radiation fields in most patients. What Is the Role of Radioimmunotherapy in the First-Line Treatment of Patients with Follicular Lymphoma. Radioimmunotherapy has been investigated as single-agent and consolidation therapy after chemotherapy.

Tositumomab administered as single-agent therapy in 76 patients provided a high response rate and the 5-year PFS was 59%. 35Unfortunately, this approach was never evaluated in a randomized study against other forms of therapy. Two randomized studies addressed the role of radioimmunotherapy as consolidation therapy in patient responders to chemotherapy. In the FIT study, 36, 37administration of a single course of ibritumomab tiutexan resulted in high rates of complete response and significant improvements in PFS.

### Follicular lymphoma, survival, and rituximab: is It time to declare victory? [^117L1GjD]. ASCO (2008). Low credibility.

2Improvements in survival were reported in each of three eras of Southwest Oncology Group therapeutic trials conducted from 1974 to 2000, and the highest 4-year overall survivals were achieved with chemotherapy plus anti-CD20 antibody. 3The authors attributed the 10% gain in survival for patients treated from 1988 to 1994 — the prerituximab era — to effective sequential treatment options, because there was no advantage in progression-free survival after initial therapy in this era. In this issue of JCO, Marcus et al 6describe a survival benefit for patients with advanced stage follicular lymphoma requiring therapy, based on their initial treatment. In a randomized controlled trial, 4-year overall survival rates were 83% for rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone and 77% for CVP. The enormity of the difficulty in demonstrating a survival difference in follicular lymphoma with a true cross-over design has been recently demonstrated by Ladetto et al.

In concert, the data suggest that primary treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy in follicular lymphoma patients who require therapy leads to longer overall survival, particularly in higher risk disease and if the use of subsequent rituximab is delayed or uncertain. But of far greater importance are that patients with follicular lymphoma are living longer than ever and that rituximab is a major contributor to this accomplishment. In part, longer survivals observed in patients diagnosed before the rituximab era can be attributed to better education of physicians and patients, earlier recognition and treatment of histologic transformation, new therapies offered at relapse, and better supportive care. For patients diagnosed before 1997 and living long enough, rituximab, radioimmunotherapy, nonmyeloablative transplantation, and other new agents have contributed to longer survival.

Rituximab represents the most important advance in the treatment of B-cell lymphoma in the past 30 years. Even without an observed survival advantage, the magnitude of the delay in disease progression with primary combined chemotherapy and rituximab justifies its use for patients with follicular lymphoma needing treatment. It is time to declare a giant leap forward for patients with follicular lymphoma. But it is premature to declare victory. That will come when we produce an individualized treatment approach, hopefully leading to cure, that preserves life expectancy and the quality of life for patients diagnosed with follicular lymphoma.
