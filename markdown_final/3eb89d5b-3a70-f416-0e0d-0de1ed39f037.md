## Question

For asthma should they take one or two puffs a day

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether asthma treatment should be one or two puffs per day. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which medication and inhaler we are discussing, because "puffs" could mean SABA, ICS, ICS-LABA, or ICS-formoterol. Then, I should verify the patient's age, since pediatric and adult dosing differ. Next, I will review guideline-based stepwise therapy and the specific dosing language for maintenance versus reliever use. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with safety limits and follow-up advice.

> Let me first confirm the medication context, because the phrase "one or two puffs a day" is ambiguous and could refer to SABA relievers, daily ICS controllers, or combination ICS-formoterol used as single maintenance and reliever therapy. Wait, let me verify the most likely interpretation: the question aligns with how combination ICS-formoterol (SMART/MART) is dosed for maintenance, which is commonly described as 1 to 2 puffs once or twice daily, with additional puffs as needed for relief, and with age-specific daily formoterol maximums that constrain total puffs per day [^5217db2e] [^cdabadb9] [^861f4ac7].

> I need to check the age dimension next, because dosing and safety ceilings vary. For adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, the preferred approach in Steps 3–4 is ICS-formoterol used both as daily maintenance and as-needed reliever, with maintenance typically 1 to 2 puffs once or twice daily and a maximum total daily formoterol dose of 12 puffs (54 mcg delivered), beyond which patients should contact their clinician. For children aged 4–11 years, maintenance is generally 1 puff once daily with a lower daily formoterol maximum of 8 puffs (36 mcg), again with additional puffs as needed for symptoms [^5217db2e] [^cdabadb9] [^b593eb25].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "one versus two puffs" without anchoring to stepwise therapy. In Step 3 (low-dose ICS), maintenance is often 1 puff once daily plus as-needed doses, whereas in Step 4 (medium-dose ICS), maintenance is commonly 2 puffs twice daily plus as-needed doses. I should double-check that this matches both NHLBI and GINA language, which it does, noting that the exact maintenance count depends on the ICS dose in the combination and asthma severity, and that patients should not exceed the age-specific formoterol maximums [^5217db2e] [^cdabadb9] [^bf7d6afb].

> Let me consider the reliever component, because SMART/MART hinges on using the same inhaler for rescue. Adults and adolescents can take 1 to 2 additional puffs as needed for symptoms, with the total formoterol exposure not exceeding 12 puffs per day. Children 4–11 years can take 1 to 2 additional puffs as needed, not exceeding 8 puffs per day. I should confirm that this is consistent with action-plan guidance, which it is, and emphasize that increasing reliever use signals worsening control and should prompt reassessment [^5217db2e] [^cdabadb9] [^861f4ac7].

> But wait, what if the question is not about ICS-formoterol at all? If the user meant SABA relievers, the answer is different: SABA is used as needed, not as a fixed daily dose, and during exacerbations the acute dosing is 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes up to three doses, followed by reassessment. Routine SABA use more than two days a week indicates poor control and warrants stepping up therapy, so a standing "one or two puffs a day" for SABA would be inappropriate outside of a specific action plan context [^5ff0ef99] [^1a499770] [^dbf07062].

> I should also confirm the alternative for mild persistent asthma, where some patients use as-needed low-dose ICS with SABA rather than daily ICS. In that scenario, the ICS is taken concomitantly with SABA when symptoms occur, not as a fixed daily puff count, so again "one or two puffs a day" would misstate the regimen. Shared decision-making is recommended because outcomes with daily low-dose ICS versus as-needed ICS plus SABA are similar in adults, though adherence and symptom perception should guide the choice [^90940596] [^4229f497].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring, because exceeding formoterol limits increases risk. Patients should be counseled to contact their clinician if they need more than the allowed daily puffs or if reliever use increases, as this suggests loss of control and may require stepping up therapy or addressing adherence and inhaler technique. I need to ensure I note that SMART/MART is not appropriate if the patient is on ICS-salmeterol maintenance, which is a key contraindication in the guidance [^5217db2e] [^cdabadb9] [^b593eb25].

> Putting this together, I should give a direct, clinically useful answer. For adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older using ICS-formoterol as SMART/MART, maintenance is typically 1 to 2 puffs once or twice daily, with additional 1 to 2 puffs as needed for symptoms, not exceeding a total of 12 puffs of formoterol per day. For children aged 4–11 years, maintenance is usually 1 puff once daily with additional 1 to 2 puffs as needed, not exceeding 8 puffs per day. The exact maintenance count should be individualized to asthma severity and the specific ICS-formoterol product, and any increase in reliever use warrants reassessment of control and adherence [^5217db2e] [^cdabadb9] [^b593eb25].

---

The answer depends on the medication and asthma severity. For **daily controller therapy**, typical dosing is 1–2 puffs once or twice daily (e.g. fluticasone 88–220 mcg twice daily) [^4e546803], adjusted to the lowest effective dose once control is achieved [^a1658534]. For **reliever therapy**, use 1–2 puffs as needed for symptoms, not exceeding 8 puffs/day in children or 12 puffs/day in adults [^cdabadb9] [^861f4ac7]. Always follow the specific inhaler's instructions and your clinician's plan, and reassess if you need more than the recommended puffs or if symptoms persist [^5217db2e].

---

## Daily controller therapy

Daily controller medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or combination inhalers (ICS-LABA), are used to maintain long-term control and prevent symptoms. The **typical dosing** is 1–2 puffs once or twice daily, depending on the medication, asthma severity, and patient response [^5217db2e]. Examples include fluticasone propionate (Flovent) 88–220 mcg twice daily [^notfound] or budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort) 1–2 puffs twice daily for maintenance [^notfound]. Dosing should be **individualized** based on asthma severity, control, and patient response, with the lowest effective dose used to minimize side effects [^a1658534].

---

## Reliever therapy

Reliever medications, such as short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) or combination ICS-formoterol, are used for rapid symptom relief. The **typical dosing** is 1–2 puffs as needed for symptoms, with a maximum of 8 puffs/day in children and 12 puffs/day in adults [^cdabadb9] [^861f4ac7]. Examples include albuterol 1–2 puffs every 4–6 hours as needed or budesonide-formoterol 1–2 puffs as needed for relief [^5217db2e].

---

## Factors influencing dosing

Several factors influence the appropriate number of puffs per day, including:

- **Age**: Children typically require lower doses than adults [^b593eb25].
- **Asthma severity**: More severe asthma may require higher doses or additional medications [^8f0afeac].
- **Medication formulation**: Different inhalers have varying strengths and dosing instructions [^a1658534].
- **Patient response**: Dosing should be adjusted based on asthma control and patient preference [^55ce005b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized dosing** and regular reassessment of asthma control. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) recommend adjusting therapy based on symptom control, exacerbation risk, and patient preference [^55ce005b] [^5217db2e]. Regular follow-up and **patient education** are essential to ensure optimal asthma management [^7982e124].

---

## Risks of incorrect dosing

Incorrect dosing can lead to **poor asthma control**, increased exacerbations, and medication side effects. Overuse of reliever medications, particularly SABA, is associated with increased risk of severe exacerbations and mortality [^f5ac6b50]. Underuse of controller medications can result in persistent symptoms and increased exacerbation risk [^e390be0f].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Patients should work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the appropriate number of puffs per day. Factors such as **adherence, inhaler technique, and comorbidities** should be considered when determining dosing [^55ce005b]. Regular follow-up and adjustment of therapy are essential to maintain optimal asthma control [^efc28042].

---

The number of puffs of asthma medication per day varies depending on the medication, asthma severity, and patient response. Daily controller medications are typically 1–2 puffs once or twice daily, while reliever medications are used as needed, not exceeding 8 puffs/day in children and 12 puffs/day in adults. Individualized dosing and regular reassessment are essential for optimal asthma management.

Clinician's Summary:

In individuals aged 12 years and older, the preferred Step 4 therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol used both daily and as needed. The maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 12 puffs (54 μg) for those aged 12 years and older. The recommended alternate therapy of maintenance ICS-LABA along with SABA as quick-relief therapy does not need to be changed if it is providing adequate control. However, individuals whose asthma is uncontrolled on such therapy should receive the preferred SMART if possible before stepping up their treatment to a higher step of therapy.

In individuals aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, combination ICS-formoterol used daily and intermittently is more beneficial than an increase in the daily ICS dose if they are already taking combination ICS-LABA (and as needed SABA). The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of daily and intermittent combination ICS-formoterol for individuals aged 12 years and older:
This recommendation applies to all individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older.
Individuals with asthma should use ICS-formoterol as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once or twice daily (depending on asthma severity and ICS dose in the ICS-formoterol preparation). The additional rescue dose is 1 to 2 puffs as needed for asthma symptoms, up to a maximum of 12 puffs (54 μg formoterol) per day. Clinicians should advise individuals with asthma to contact their clinician if they need to use more than these amounts.
The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, the most common preparation used in the RCTs reviewed.
Clinicians managing asthma should regularly assess individuals using this therapy.
This therapy is appropriate for Step 4.
Individuals with asthma should not use ICS-formoterol as reliever therapy if they are taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy.
SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled with alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy.
For individuals aged 5 to 11 years, the evidence was insufficient to make a recommendation regarding SMART compared to higher-dose ICS-LABA. SMART with low- or medium-dose ICS therapy is preferred for children aged 5 to 11 years as opposed to same-, low-, or medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA as part of Step 3 and Step 4 therapy (Recommendation 12).
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma and their caregivers that the major demonstrated benefits of combination ICS-formoterol used daily and as needed are reductions in asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits and in use of systemic corticosteroids. Clinicians should also inform individuals with asthma that studies found no difference in documented harms between this type of therapy and daily ICS-LABA. Studies showed that combination ICS-formoterol reduces exposure to corticosteroids, suggesting that the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid associated harms. This recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals for such reasons as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-", "medium-", and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

Asthma management — Recommendation 13 for individuals aged 12 years and older conditionally recommends inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared with higher-dose ICS–long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) as daily controller therapy and short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) for quick relief, with high certainty of evidence; for Step 4, the preferred therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol used both daily and as needed, and the maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 12 puffs (54 μg) for those aged 12 years and older. This recommendation applies to all individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older. Individuals with asthma should use ICS-formoterol as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once or twice daily, with an additional 1 to 2 puffs as needed for symptoms up to a maximum of 12 puffs (54 μg formoterol) per day, and clinicians should advise individuals to contact their clinician if they need to use more than these amounts. The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, clinicians managing asthma should regularly assess individuals using this therapy, and this therapy is appropriate for Step 4. Individuals with asthma should not use ICS-formoterol as reliever therapy if they are taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy, and SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled with alternate treatments such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy. If maintenance ICS-LABA plus SABA provides adequate control, it does not need to be changed; however, if uncontrolled, individuals should receive the preferred SMART if possible before stepping up to a higher step of therapy.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^b593eb25]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of daily and intermittent combination ICS-formoterol in individuals aged 4 years and older:
No patient characteristics exclude consideration of this option in individuals aged 4 years and older with asthma.
The studies demonstrating reduced exacerbations (see below) enrolled individuals with a severe exacerbation in the prior year. The results suggest that such individuals are particularly good candidates for SMART to reduce exacerbations.
SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled on alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy.
SMART is appropriate for Step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol) treatment.
ICS-formoterol should be administered as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once to twice daily (depending on age, asthma severity, and ICS dose in the ICS formoterol preparation) and one to two puffs as needed for asthma symptoms. The maximum number of puffs per day is 12 (54 μg formoterol) for individuals aged 12 years and older and 8 (36 μg formoterol) for children aged 4 to 11 years. Clinicians should advise individuals with asthma or their caregivers to contact their physician if they need to use more than these amounts.
The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, the most common preparation used in the RCTs reviewed.
ICS-formoterol should not be used as quick-relief therapy in individuals taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma and their caregivers that in studies, this intervention consistently reduced asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits or systemic corticosteroids. In addition, this intervention improved asthma control and quality of life in some studies. No differences have been documented in harms between this type of therapy and the comparators (ICS or ICS-LABA) in individuals aged 12 years and older. The reductions in exposure to oral corticosteroids and to ICS treatment in most studies suggest that the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid associated harms. In children aged 4 to 11 years, there may be a lower risk of growth suppression among those taking SMART versus daily higher-dose ICS treatment. This recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals with asthma for such reasons as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance. However, the additional cost of the medication may be offset by the decrease in exacerbations and the associated improvement in quality of life and reduction in costs to both the patient and the payer. A 1-month supply of ICS-formoterol medication that is sufficient for maintenance therapy may not last a month if the inhaler is used for reliever therapy as well. Providers, individuals with asthma, pharmacists, and payers need to be aware of this possibility and prescribe, plan, dispense, or provide coverage accordingly.

Question 4.3

What is the comparative effectiveness of ICS with LABA used as both controller and quick-relief therapy compared to ICS with or without LABA used as controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

Recommendation 12: In individuals aged 4 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared to either a higher-dose ICS as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy or the same-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy.

Strong recommendation, high certainty of evidence for ages 12 years and above, moderate certainty of evidence for ages 4 to 11 years

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

In individuals aged 4 years and older, the preferred Step 3 (low-dose ICS) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS) therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol both daily and as needed. In the literature, inhaled ICS-formoterol is referred to as "single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART)". This form of therapy has only been used with formoterol as the LABA. Formoterol has a rapid onset and a maximum total daily dose that allows it to be used more than twice daily. The maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 8 puffs (36 μg) for ages4 to11 years and12puffs (54 μg) for ages12 years and above. SMART is administered with a single inhaler containing both formoterol and an ICS (primarily budesonide in the reviewed studies, but one study used beclomethasone). The regimens compared to address this key question required two inhalers: the controller (ICS or ICS-LABA) and the reliever (SABA). The recommended alternate therapy of maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy does not need to be changed if it is providing adequate control. However, patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on such therapy should receive the preferred SMART if possible before moving to a higher step of therapy.

Adolescents and adults with mild persistent asthma (age 12 years and older) — the Expert Panel conditionally recommends two Step 2 options: either daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick relief or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly, with a conditional recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly; the recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years, and the Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence. For implementation, individuals aged 12 years and older with a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy and regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred; one studied approach is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed, administered sequentially in two separate inhalers. Individuals can initiate intermittent therapy at home but should receive regular follow-up, and clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations, with side effects equally infrequent; shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting, SABAs, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer inhaled short-acting β-agonists up to 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes for a total of 3 doses if needed to achieve rapid reversal of airflow limitation in patients with mild-to-moderate exacerbations.
Do not administer additional short-acting β-agonists if there is a good response to initial treatment, such as peak expiratory flow > 60–80% of predicted or personal best for 3–4 hours.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and one important outcome (asthma symptoms) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 12 can be found in EtD Tables XVIII and XIX in Appendix B.

SMART versus higher-dose ICS treatment in ages 4 years and older (EtD Table XVIII).

Three large RCTs – (total N = 4662) enrolled individuals aged 12 years and older who were being treated with a low- to medium-dose or medium- to high-dose ICS. Study participants treated with SMART used daily budesonide-formoterol, 160/9 to 320/9 μg, via a dry-powder inhaler. They took up to 10 rescue puffs of budesonide-formoterol (total daily dose of 12 puffs or 54 μg formoterol). The investigators compared this intervention to daily budesonide, 320 to 640 μg, along with SABA for quick-relief therapy. Rabe et alshowed a 51% RR reduction in exacerbations, whereas the rates were 35% and 43% RR reduction in Scicchitano et aland O'Byrne et al, respectively. The latter two studies used a composite exacerbation score that included systemic corticosteroid use, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, increase in ICS or other medication doses, and peak expiratory flow less than 70%. – Collectively, these RCTs found an RR of 0.6 (range, 0.53–0.68) favoring SMART for asthma exacerbations (high certainty of evidence). The investigators of these studies did not report results from validated outcome measures of quality of life or asthma control. However, results for individual asthma control measures — including total asthma symptom scores, nighttime awakenings, symptom-free days, and asthma control days — significantly favored SMART. The overall doses of inhaled and oral corticosteroids were significantly lower with SMART (two- to fourfold less for inhaled ICS treatments).

Asthma — single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) with budesonide-formoterol versus higher-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in individuals aged 12 years and older — was evaluated in three large randomized controlled trials (total N = 4662) where SMART used daily budesonide-formoterol 160/9 to 320/9 μg with up to 10 rescue puffs (total daily dose of 12 puffs or 54 μg formoterol) compared with daily budesonide 320 to 640 μg plus short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), showing a 51% RR reduction in exacerbations in one trial and 35% and 43% in two others, and collectively an RR of 0.6 (range, 0.53–0.68) favoring SMART (high certainty of evidence); validated asthma outcomes were not reported, but individual asthma control measures significantly favored SMART, and overall corticosteroid exposure was lower with SMART (two- to fourfold less for inhaled ICS treatments).

Asthma — SMART in milder asthma and in children aged 4 to 11 years — was assessed in post hoc analyses showing that among 1239 participants aged 12 years and older with milder asthma (daily maintenance ICS dose equal to 400 μg or less budesonide equivalent), SMART reduced exacerbations overall, but in those with the mildest asthma at enrollment (rescue SABA use of ≤ 1 inhalation/d) benefit was marginal and statistically nonsignificant; in a pediatric analysis of 224 children aged 4 to 11 years on medium to high ICS doses (200–500 μg daily), SMART used budesonide-formoterol 80/4.5 μg once daily with up to seven additional rescue puffs (total daily dose of 36 μg formoterol) versus budesonide 320 μg daily with SABA, yielding a 57% drop in the RR for a composite exacerbation measure, significantly fewer nighttime awakenings, lower daily ICS dose (average 123 vs 320 μg), and improved growth rates (adjusted mean difference of 1 cm compared with fixed-dose budesonide).

Asthma — SMART versus same-dose inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta-agonist (ICS-LABA) controller therapy in ages 12 years and above — was evaluated in four blinded and two unblinded randomized controlled trials that collectively showed a 32% reduction in exacerbations with SMART (high certainty of evidence), with two studies using the Asthma Control Questionnaire 5-item (ACQ-5) showing clinically significant improvements; across three blinded studies (total 7555 participants) SMART used 160/9 or 320/9 μg budesonide-formoterol daily with up to 10 rescue puffs (total daily dose of 12 puffs or 54 μg formoterol) versus rescue SABA and significantly reduced exacerbations, while another blinded study (N = 1813) using beclomethasone-formoterol 100/6 μg two puffs daily with up to six rescue puffs (total daily dose of 48 μg formoterol) found severe exacerbations and systemic corticosteroid use were significantly lower with SMART but asthma control scores (ACQ-7) did not differ; an unblinded trial enrolled 2143 participants and reported a 20% RR decline with SMART using budesonide-formoterol 640/18 μg versus fluticasone/salmeterol 500/100 μg, and a reanalysis in 4,044 participants showed a 38% RR reduction.

SMART versus same-dose ICS-LABA controller therapy for ages 4 years and above (EtD Table XIX).

For ages 12 years and above, the Expert Panel considered four blinded RCTs,– and two unblinded RCTs, for this question. Collectively, these RCTs demonstrated a 32% reduction in exacerbations with SMART,– (high certainty of evidence). Two of the studies used validated asthma control measures (ACQ-5), and both demonstrated clinically significant improvements with SMART (high certainty of evidence).

Three of the blinded studies enrolled a total of 7555 participants with mild to severe persistent asthma. Participants were treated with 160/9 or 320/9 μg budesonide-formoterol daily with up to 10 rescue puffs (total daily dose of 12 puffs or 54 μg formoterol) of budesonide-formoterol (SMART) or rescue SABA. In these three blinded studies, SMART significantly reduced exacerbations.

One of these three studiesdemonstrated a statistically significant improvement in asthma control (based on ACQ-5). A second blinded study (N = 1748) enrolled participants aged 18 years or older with poorly controlled asthma who took a moderate to high dose of an ICS or ICS-LABA. The SMART group took two puffs daily of beclomethasone-formoterol, 100/6 μg, and up to six puffs of rescue beclomethasone-formoterol per day (total daily dose of 48 μg formoterol). The comparison group used rescue SABA. The investigators actively managed both arms with dose titration. Although severe exacerbations and systemic corticosteroid use were significantly lower with SMART, asthma control scores (ACQ-7) did not differ significantly between groups.

Jenkins et alconducted a post hoc analysis of these three studies in 1239 participants aged 12 years and older with milder asthma (daily maintenance ICS dose equal to 400 μg or less budesonide equivalent). The authors confirmed that SMART reduced exacerbations overall. However, in subgroup analyses, participants with the mildest asthma at enrollment (based on rescue SABA use of < 1 inhalation/d) showed a marginal and statistically nonsignificant benefit.

Another post hoc analysis of one of the three RCTs (O'Byrne et al) included 224 children aged 4 to 11 years who used medium to high ICS doses (any brand, 200–500 μg daily). The 118 participants in the SMART group were instructed to take budesonide-formoterol, 80/4.5 μg once daily, as their baseline therapy, with up to seven additional rescue puffs (total daily dose of 36 μg formoterol). The other 106 participants took budesonide, 320 μg daily, with rescue SABA. In the SMART group, the RR for a composite exacerbation measure comprised of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalization, emergency department visits, and increase in ICS or other medication dose dropped by 57% (moderate certainty of evidence). The authors did not report on validated outcome measures of quality of life or asthma control, but nighttime awakenings declined significantly with SMART. SMART participants used a lower daily ICS dose (average 127 vs 320 μg/d in the fixed-dose budesonide group) and demonstrated significantly improved growth rates (adjusted mean difference of 1 cm compared with fixed-dose budesonide).

Asthma management — Recommendation 11 (short-term increase in inhaled corticosteroid [ICS] dose) states that in individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to adhere to daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against a short-term increase in the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow, with a conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence. A short-term increase is defined as a doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling of the regular daily dose, and the Expert Panel does not recommend doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow; however, clinicians can consider quadrupling the regular daily dose for individuals aged 16 years and older whose adherence to daily therapy is not assured. Evidence includes pediatric data showing that in children aged 4 to 11 years, temporarily increasing the ICS dose did not significantly reduce exacerbations or improve quality of life, and in one 48-week study the growth rate in the intervention group was reduced without statistical significance (P = 0.06). In individuals aged 12 years and older, the intervention as implemented did not significantly reduce exacerbations or asthma hospitalizations; although a large study reported a modest but significant reduction in time to severe exacerbation and systemic corticosteroid use with a quadrupling action plan, baseline adherence was low, with only 50% in the quadruple-dose group and 42% in the non–quadruple-dose group having good adherence. Based on the lack of efficacy in the studies and possible growth effects, the Expert Panel made a recommendation against a short-term increase in the ICS dose.

### Bringing asthma care into the twenty-first century [^ddd04f8c]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

What is meant by asthma control?

Well-controlled asthma means that patients are free from troublesome respiratory symptoms during both day and night, need little or no reliever medication (no more than two puffs SABA/week), can lead normal, productive and active lives and continue to have normal or the best possible lung function. Daytime symptoms or use of reliever more than twice a week, night-time awakenings or limitation of activity all suggest only partial control and if a patient is experiencing all of these then their asthma can be considered uncontrolled.

Achieving well-controlled asthma greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of breakthrough symptoms and exacerbations of asthma resulting from increases in the airway inflammation that underlies most patients' asthma. Even patients with mild or intermittent asthma are at risk of these exacerbations. However, in many cases there is a discrepancy between what patients and healthcare professionals understand by the term 'asthma control'. For many patients, 'control' simply means being able to keep their symptoms at a manageable level through frequent use of reliever medication. For healthcare professionals, the definition of asthma control is usually broadly based on guideline definitions — absence of symptoms and restrictions on daily activities, good lung function with minimal or no use of reliever and no sleep disturbances.

### Asthma management guidelines: focused updates for 2020… [^0c68849e]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Inhaled Corticosteroids INTERMITTENT ASTHMA GINA recommends treating patients with mild intermittent asthma with as-needed inhaled corticosteroids with short-acting beta. PERSISTENT ASTHMA For patients with mild persistent asthma, the Focused Updates recommend either of the following: daily low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA or as-needed ICS with SABA for worsening asthma. For mild to moderate persistent asthma, single maintenance and reliever therapy is preferred. This approach reduces the potential adverse effects of chronic steroid use, lowers emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and simplifies patients' medication regimens. 1 For patients four years or older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, SMART with ICS/formoterol, used daily and as needed, is preferred. For patients 12 years or older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, a single ICS/formoterol inhaler, used daily and as needed, is conditionally preferred. 5 GINA recommends daily moderate-dose ICS or ICS/long-acting beta 2 agonist with as-needed ICS/formoterol as equivalent options; however, the Focused Updates panel found the evidence for ICS/formoterol daily and as-needed to be more compelling. SMART carries several caveats. Budesonide/formoterol is not approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for use as a quick relief agent. The device most studied was the dry-powder Symbicort Turbohaler; however, in the United States, only the metered-dose device is available. ACUTE ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS The use of ICS for acute asthma without the concomitant use of oral steroids was previously discouraged.

However, for patients from birth to four years of age with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections only and no wheezing between infections, the Focused Updates now conditionally recommend a short course of ICS at the onset of an upper respiratory tract infection with an inhaled SABA as needed. Long-Acting Muscarinic Agents In patients 12 years or older with asthma not controlled by ICS alone, adding a LABA instead of a long-acting muscarinic agent to the ICS is recommended unless LABA therapy cannot be tolerated. If control is inadequate with ICS/LABA, then the addition of a long-acting muscarinic agent is recommended.

An unblinded study, Vogelmeier et al, enrolled 2143 participants from Europe and Asia with poorly controlled asthma taking moderate to high ICS or ICS-LABA doses (500 μg or more of budesonide, fluticasone, or equivalent). They received either daily budesonide-formoterol, 640/18 μg, with budesonide-formoterol rescue (SMART group) or daily fluticasone/salmeterol, 500/100 μg, with SABA for quick-relief therapy. The investigators actively managed both arms with dose titration, and the study was unblinded. With SMART, the RR declined by 20% for exacerbations, defined as emergency department visits, oral corticosteroid days, and hospitalization. SMART also improved asthma control (measured by ACQ-5) and quality of life (measured by Asthma-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire), but these changes were not statistically significant. A reanalysis of these data in 404 participants in China, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand had similar results; the RR reduction in exacerbation rates was 38%.

Another blinded study, Patel et al, enrolled 303 participants in New Zealand who were at risk of severe exacerbations. Participants were treated with budesonide-formoterol, 800/24 μg (by metered-dose inhaler), with one rescue puff of budesonide-formoterol (SMART) or SABA for quick-relief therapy. SMART reduced exacerbations and oral corticosteroid use but increased the use of ICS, and the associated improvement in asthma control (measured by ACQ-7) was not significant.

For ages 4 to 11 years, one blinded RCTused budesonide-formoterol, 80/4.5 μg, with up to seven rescue puffs of budesonide-formoterol, 80/4.5 μg (36 μg total daily dose of formoterol; SMART), or SABA as quick-relief therapy. SMART reduced the RR for exacerbations by 72% (moderate certainty of evidence) and showed superiority in one unvalidated outcome measure of asthma control (nighttime awakenings). Growth rates and other safety measures did not differ between treatment groups.

Interpretation and use notes for ICS dosing emphasize that this is not a table of equivalence and that the table does NOT imply potency equivalence, that patients should be monitored to ensure stability after any change of treatment or inhaler device, that low-dose ICS provides most of the clinical benefit and some patients may need medium-dose ICS if their asthma is uncontrolled or they have ongoing exacerbations despite good adherence and correct technique with low-dose ICS, that high-dose ICS is needed by very few patients and its long-term use is associated with an increased risk of local and systemic side-effects which must be balanced against the potential benefits, that the timing of medication use also affects outcomes, particularly for exacerbations, as seen with an anti-inflammatory reliever in GINA Track 1, and that daily doses in this table are shown as metered doses with product information to be consulted for delivered doses.

### A multinational observational study identifying primary care patients at risk of overestimation of asthma control [^09eeed7f]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In this study, patients who overestimated their level of asthma control were 14 times more likely to have taken a maximum of 5–12 puffs or more of SABA reliever per day in the previous 4 weeks. This dose of SABA reliever is by far above what is expected and recommended in practice guidelines; that is, 1–2 puffs of SABA as needed for symptom relief during maintenance treatment in asthma. Overuse of SABA may itself potentially contribute to poor asthma control, increased risk of exacerbations, and fatal asthma. It has been well documented that with chronic or high-dose exposure, β-agonists demonstrate proinflammatory effects, rebound bronchoconstriction and toxicity that can masquerade as worsening asthma. Further, where overuse is associated with rebound bronchoconstriction, patients will often respond by taking even more SABA medication, thereby entering a vicious cycle of increasing use and progressively worsening symptoms. Our findings indicate a complete misunderstanding of the use of SABA relievers or what we are asking as HCPs, and a lack of awareness of the potential for SABA toxicity to be a significant contributor to poor asthma control. It highlights the deficiency in asking simply on how many times/days per week a patient has used their SABA reliever over the past 4 weeks. Our findings suggest a need for reconsideration of guideline questions that refer to SABA use, and better education of patients, particularly those who have used high doses in the emergency department for acute asthma and continue to use high doses when they have breakthrough symptoms thereafter. In addition, patients who had overestimated their control level were almost nine times more likely to have used oral steroids for worsening symptoms in the previous 12 months reflecting a 'rescue' rather than a 'prevention' of symptoms approach to asthma management, which is consistent with previous findings, and not without consequences.

Future research opportunities — The Expert Panel identified topics that would benefit from additional research. Priorities include differences by race and ethnicity in benefits and risks of the ICS recommendations and the cost-effectiveness of the ICS recommendations. Additional comparative work includes daily low-dose ICS with SABA for quick relief versus as-needed ICS plus SABA administered concomitantly in children aged 4 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma and additional studies powered as equivalence studies to confirm whether daily low-dose ICS with SABA for quick relief and concomitant as-needed ICS plus SABA lead to similar outcomes in individuals with mild persistent asthma. Real-world studies that monitor growth in children and adherence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of quadrupling the ICS dose in individuals with mild to moderate persistent asthma taking daily ICS controller therapy who experience early signs of loss of asthma control are also identified.

In Step 1, the recommendation for as-needed, low-dose ICS–formoterol for adults and adolescents with symptoms less than twice per month is supported by indirect evidence for a large reduction in the risk of severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA alone. Extension of this recommendation to Step 1 was also supported by several important considerations:

- Historically, recommendations for as-needed SABA alone were never supported by evidence of long-term safety or efficacy; early guidelines had assumed that patients with mild asthma would not benefit from ICS and were concerned about its risks based on experience with OCS.
- The past distinction between eligibility for Step 1 and Step 2 treatment based on symptom frequency (e.g. ≤ or > 2 d/wk) was arbitrary, not evidence-based.
- The use of as-needed ICS–formoterol markedly reduces severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA, even in patients with SABA use less than or equal to two times per week at baseline (so-called intermittent asthma).
- A single day with more than two, more than four, more than six, or more than eight doses of as-needed budesonide–formoterol reduced the short-term (21-d) risk of severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA alone (post hoc analysis). A similar effect was seen with ICS–formoterol MART in Steps 3–4.
- Even modest overuse of SABA (e.g. dispensing three or more albuterol canisters per year, i.e. average of ⩾1.6 puffs/d) is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and, in one study, higher asthma mortality.
- Even occasional short courses of OCS (e.g. four to five courses over 7 yr [i.e. less than one course per year]), are associated with significant short-term risks and cumulative risks of long-term adverse effects such as osteoporosis and diabetes.
- Regular, daily, low-dose ICS treatment is highly effective in reducing asthma symptoms and risk, including in patients with infrequent symptoms, but poor adherence to ICS is common, exposing patients to the risks of SABA-only treatment.
- As-needed budesonide–formoterol is well tolerated in mild asthma.
- Starting treatment with SABA alone trains the patient to regard it as their primary asthma treatment.

Rationale and discussion

Outcomes did not differ in the groups treated with the two alternate regimens in the three studies, in individuals aged 12 years and older. However, because none of these studies was powered as an equivalence study, the Expert Panel made a conditional recommendation. Although the studies had high certainty of evidence for asthma control and quality of life, they had low certainty of evidence for exacerbations and, taken together, resulted in over all low certainty for the recommendation statement. The Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison for children aged 4to 11 years because the only small included study in this population had low certainty of evidence, and one additional study had a study design that precluded evaluation for this key question.

Recommendation 11: In individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to be adherent to daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against a short-term increase in the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow.

Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

This recommendation addresses temporary increases in the dose of an ICS that is otherwise taken as controller therapy in response to worsening asthma. For this recommendation, a short-term increase in ICS dose refers to a doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling of the regular daily dose. For individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to adhere to their daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel does not recommend doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow. Clinicians can consider quadrupling the regular daily dose for individuals aged 16 years and older whose adherence to daily therapy is not assured (see the Discussion section below).

Global Strategy for Asthma — initial treatment for adults and adolescents with infrequent or less-than-3–5 days/week symptoms states that for "Infrequent asthma symptoms, e.g., 1–2 days/week or less", the preferred initial treatment (Track 1) is "As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol (Evidence A)", while the alternative (Track 2) is "Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken, in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B). Such patients are highly unlikely to be adherent with daily ICS". For "Asthma symptoms less than 3–5 days/week, with normal or mildly reduced lung function", an alternative initial treatment is "Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A). Before choosing this option, consider likely adherence with daily ICS". These recommendations are "based on evidence, where available, and on consensus".

Initial home management of asthma exacerbations — an action plan should enable the child's family members and carers to recognize worsening asthma and initiate treatment, recognize when it is severe, identify when urgent hospital treatment is necessary, and provide recommendations for follow up (Evidence D), and should include specific information about medications and dosages and when and how to access medical care. Parents/caregivers should be advised to seek medical attention immediately if the child is acutely distressed, the child's symptoms are not relieved promptly by inhaled bronchodilator, the period of relief after doses of SABA becomes progressively shorter, or a child younger than 1 year requires repeated inhaled SABA over several hours. For initial treatment at home, the parent/caregiver should initiate treatment with two puffs of inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) (200 mcg salbutamol [albuterol] or equivalent), given one puff at a time via a spacer device with or without a facemask (Evidence D). This may be repeated a further two times at 20-minute intervals, if needed, and the child should be observed by the family/carer and, if improving, maintained in a restful and reassuring atmosphere for an hour or more. Medical attention should be sought urgently if any of the features listed above apply; or on the same day if more than 6 puffs of inhaled SABA are required for symptom relief within the first 2 hours, or if the child has not recovered after 24 hours.

### Dangers of under-treatment and over-treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma [^52d240de]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Considering the information in Tables 5 and 6, FDA‐approved doses don't always align with doses recommended in asthma guidelines. For example, the low dose of FP in NHLBI, 88 mcg/day, can only be administered using the formulation containing 44 mcg/puff, one puff twice daily. The only dose approved by the FDA is two puffs twice daily (88 mcg twice daily [176 mcg]), so 88 mcg/day is an unapproved dose even though it is a safer dose. Likewise, the only way to administer a medium dose of FP to a child (e.g. 220 or 352 mcg/day) is with one puff twice daily of the 110 mcg/puff formulation or four puffs twice daily of the 44 mcg/puff formulation. These are unapproved doses for children.

Table 5
FP formulations, regulatory agency‐approved dosing, and guideline‐recommended dosing in the United States and Europe.

Table 6
ICS dose recommendations for children age 6−11 years.

The ICS doses (mcg) for low, medium, and high ranges differ between GINA and NHLBI. For each ICS, the doses in GINA are lower than those in NHLBI. This likely reflects the availability of different formulations and strengths and differences in the design of the pivotal controlled clinical trials required for regulatory agency approval in different countries. Nonetheless, the lower doses recommended in GINA should have a better safety profile in children.

There are differences in the regulatory approval process of ICS between the FDA in the United States and the EMA in Europe. For FDA, pivotal phase III controlled clinical trials of ICS in children were designed with efficacy as the primary outcome and safety as a secondary outcome. After the conduct of those trials and FDA approval of ICS (and INCS), the FDA required a Phase IV (post‐marketing) commitment from pharmaceutical companies to conduct lengthy, expensive, and well‐designed studies with childhood growth as the primary outcome. Such studies were not done pre‐approval for several reasons. Safety based on the HPA axis function supported the approval of ICS for children and growth studies would have caused unnecessary and significant delays in the entry of these drugs into the US market.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment, stepping down, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to reduce ICS doses by 25–50% at 3-month intervals in most patients.
Recognize that too far or too quickly stepping down may increase exacerbation risk even if symptoms remain reasonably controlled,
and complete cessation of ICSs is associated with a significantly increased risk of exacerbations.

Track 2 Step 4 treatment for adults and adolescents — maintenance inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta2-agonist (ICS-LABA) with as-needed short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) or combination ICS-SABA — Maintenance medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA is an alternative approach if MART is not possible, or if a patient's asthma is stable with good adherence and no exacerbations on their current therapy; patients uncontrolled or with frequent exacerbations on low-dose ICS-LABA may benefit from maintenance medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA if MART is not available, and before prescribing a regimen with SABA reliever, clinicians should consider whether the patient is likely to be adherent with their ICS-containing treatment, as otherwise they will be at higher risk of exacerbations; occasionally, high-dose ICS-LABA may be needed. For adults aged ≥ 18 years, in a sub-population taking maintenance medium-dose ICS-LABA or high-dose ICS, there was no significant increase in time to first severe exacerbation with as-needed budesonide-salbutamol 100/200 mcg metered dose (80/90 mcg delivered dose) versus as-needed salbutamol 100/200 mcg metered dose (80/90 mcg delivered dose): hazard ratio 0.81; CI 0.61–1.07. There are no head-to-head comparisons between this regimen and ICS-formoterol MART; ICS-SABA is not recommended for regular use and its use as the reliever in Steps 3–5 requires different maintenance and reliever inhalers, making this regimen more complex than GINA Track 1. Practice points include that a maximum number of 6 as-needed doses (each 2 puffs of 100/100 mcg budesonide-salbutamol [80/90 mcg delivered dose]) can be taken in a day and that it is essential to educate patients about the different purpose of their maintenance and reliever inhalers and to train them in correct inhaler technique with both devices if they are different.

Adjustable maintenance and reliever therapy (AMD) with ICS–LABA — Dynamic-dosing step-up strategies using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) have been studied, and multiple recent studies have consistently demonstrated efficacy of AMD in the yellow zone; this AMD strategy has become standard of care in many countries in Europe and Canada, but studies used doses that exceeded FDA approval (up to 3 times the recommended dose) and the Turbuhaler device, whereas in the United States these medications are available as metered dose inhalers and there is an FDA boxed warning regarding the LABA component. One controlled trial compared fixed fluticasone/salmeterol dosing (250 and 50 μg twice daily) versus AMD with budesonide/formoterol (400 and 12 μg twice daily); after a run‑in, patients in the budesonide–formoterol arm halved their dose and then adjusted puffs per day based on nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication use, and changes in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) of asthma: a critical appraisal [^950c3fc3]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Evaluating outcomes and action planning

The prescription of the SMART strategy does not obviate the need to monitor and adjust maintenance medications, nor does it obviate the need for action plans that would permit early self-treatment of severe exacerbations requiring prednisone or equivalent. However, it is unclear from the literature on SMART which treatment outcomes best identify when the treatment should be modified. By protocol, patients employing SMART therapy are allowed to use additional budesonide/formoterol inhaler up to eight puffs per day to relieve symptoms. Presumably, if as-needed doses are needed persistently, the treatment is deemed inadequate and the maintenance adjusted. However, the exact level and duration of as-needed use at which dosage adjustments should be made are not known. In the study by Vogelmeier et al, two different maintenance doses of budesonide/formoterol were permitted but the protocol for dosage adjustment was not specified and appears to have been at the discretion of the investigators.

All studies with SMART have been conducted in patients with uncontrolled asthma. The potential benefits in partially controlled asthma have not been assessed, and it seems unlikely that there would be any benefits of this regimen in controlled patients who will use as-needed bronchodilator infrequently or not at all. Indeed, this highlights the conundrum posed by the SMART strategy; it is defined by the use of as-needed medication but the frequent use of as-needed medication is inconsistent with our current definitions of control.

Asthma management — patient counseling for single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) with ICS-formoterol should include that clinicians should inform individuals and caregivers the major demonstrated benefits are reductions in asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits and in use of systemic corticosteroids; studies found no difference in documented harms between this therapy and daily ICS-LABA; studies showed that combination ICS-formoterol reduces exposure to corticosteroids, suggesting the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid-associated harms; and this recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals because of cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance.

2. Starting therapy with a high, FDA‐unapproved dose of ICS to treat mild persistent "asthma".

The starting dose of the ICS FP was 110 µg/puff, two puffs twice daily (440 µg/day), which is both FDA‐unapproved and high in the guidelines. Guidelines recommend using low FDA‐approved ICS doses to start the treatment of mild persistent asthma in children. Low, FDA‐approved ICS doses have not been shown to suppress adrenal function. Therefore, if guidelines had been followed, a low, FDA‐approved ICS dose that does not cause adrenal failure would have been started.

3. Failure to reduce the ICS dose when "asthma" is controlled.

The NIH and GINA guidelines both guidelines recommend stepping down ICS doses if asthma is controlled for 3 months. Based on ACT scores, the patient's "asthma" was well‐controlled for 18 months. If guidelines had been followed, the high FDA‐unapproved starting dose of ICS would have been reduced to an FDA‐approved low dose that is unlikely to cause adrenal failure.

Evidence-Based Interventions
- Promote evidence-based asthma medical management described in the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelinespdf iconexternal icon.
- Promote strategies that help people access and continue to use asthma medications and devices.
- Expand access to intensive self-management education for people whose asthma is not well controlled with guidelines-based medical management alone.
- Make it easier for people with asthma to have home visits by licensed professionals or qualified lay health workers, if their asthma is not under control with medication and education. Home visits help people with asthma learn how to manage asthma and reduce triggers at home. What You Can Do to Control Asthma Healthcare Providers
- Follow NAEPP Guidelines for medical management of asthma, such as assessing asthma severity, regularly monitoring asthma control, and prescribing inhaled corticosteroid when appropriate.

Health care providers who follow NAEPP guidelines have seen decreases of up to:

- 45% in asthma related ED visits,
- 56% in asthma-related hospitalizations.
- 19% in asthma-related outpatient visits, and
- 59% in asthma symptom days.
- Investigate and consider using available CPT codes to support your or your team's delivery of asthma self-management education.
- Refer patients to asthma-related home visit programs available through local community organizations or patients' health insurance plans.
- Share pharmacy claims data with health care providers to identify patients who frequently use rescue inhalers and do not adhere to controller medication regimens.
- Let patients get asthma devices from pharmacies instead of durable medical equipment facilities.
- Employ certified asthma educators or trained lay health workers for asthma disease management programs.

Access to Asthma Medication and Devices A study reviewed pharmacy claims data from more than 2, 000 patients enrolled in a health maintenance organization. This review showed patients with above-average copays were less likely to fill their first-time prescriptions for asthma medications within 30 days of the prescription date.
3. Access to Asthma Medication and Devices A study reviewed interventions designed to improve healthcare providers' adherence to asthma treatment guidelines. The review showed prescriptions for controller medications could be increased by supporting healthcare provider decision-making, providing performance data to healthcare providers about their quality of care, and targeting how pharmacists' provide care.

10 Asthma Home Visits A review found that providing clinical decision-making support for healthcare providers or clinical pharmacy support could help increase healthcare providers' provision of asthma self-management education to patients. 11.

SECTION V: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF LAMAs FOR ASTHMA

Background

LAMAs comprise a pharmacologic class of long-acting bronchodilators. The role of LAMAs in the management of asthma was not addressed in Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. Since that report's publication in 2007, several trials have investigated LAMAs as controller therapy for individuals with asthma.

The Expert Panel examined the harms and benefits of LAMAs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma and addressed three key questions. The Expert Panel did not examine the role of LAMA treatment in children aged 6 to 11 years because the key questions and systematic reviews did not address this age group. With the exception of one study that examined the LAMA umeclidinium, the RCTs reviewed by the Expert Panel used tiotropium bromide as the LAMA. At the time this report was written, tiotropium bromide (Respimat) was the only formulation of LAMA with US FDA approval for asthma treatment. The majority of LAMA studies used a comparative efficacy design, and not an effectiveness design, but the key questions were about effectiveness. Therefore, the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings is not well understood. Table V provides an overview of the key questions and recommendations on LAMAs.

Definitions of terms used in this section

In this section, "controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. The term "ICS-LABA" indicates therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually (and preferably) in a single inhaler.

Question 5.1

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA compared with other controller therapy as add-on therapy to ICSs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Question 5.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA as add-on therapy to ICS controller therapy compared with placebo or increased ICS dose in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Recommendation 14: In individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against adding LAMA to ICS compared to adding LABA to ICS.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

Recommendation 15: If LABA is not used, in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends adding LAMA to ICS controller therapy compared to continuing the same dose of ICS alone.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^2697c2c6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the reviewed studies, the indication for increasing the ICS dose was decreased peak flow and/or increased symptoms. When increased, the ICS dose was doubled, quadrupled, or quintupled. –

Rationale and discussion

In children aged 4 to 11 years, the intervention did not significantly reduce exacerbations or improve asthma quality of life in one studyin the systematic review report. The intervention's potential to suppress growth in a more recent studyand the lack of demonstrated efficacy of the intervention in either of the reviewed articles led to the Expert Panel's recommendation against this intervention in this age group.

In individuals aged 12 years and older, the intervention as implemented also did not significantly reduce exacerbations in three studies – in the evidence summary, but the certainty of evidence is low. The more recent study by McKeever et alshowed modest but significant reductions in time to severe exacerbation and rate of ICS use in individuals whose action plan included a quadrupling of the ICS dose. However, unlike the studies in the AHRQ systematic review report, this study did not include a placebo group or use blinding, and the baseline adherence rate was low (42%−50%). The adherence rate in the McKeever et al study might be more similar to the adherence rates in routine clinical practice, whereas adherence rates in the RCTs – were probably higher than in most real-world settings.

Thus, the Expert Panel believes that this recommendation applies most specifically to individuals who are likely to adhere to their daily ICS regimen. An increase in the ICS dose might be a reasonable strategy to include in the action plans of individuals whose adherence rates are less certain. How to assess adherence or the threshold for adequate adherence for this recommendation cannot be determined from the reviewed studies. Based on the study of McKeever et alin individuals aged 12 years and older described in the previous paragraph, the ICS dose could be quadrupled in the short-term in individuals aged 16 years and older in response to an increased need for reliever therapy, greater interference of asthma with sleep, or a peak flow of less than 80% of the individual's normal level. The potential discrepancy between the efficacy and effectiveness studies described above and the overall low certainty of evidence led to a conditional recommendation for this age group as well.

### Treatment patterns among adult patients with asthma… [^df92d5aa]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Results Among patients with moderate or severe asthma, 16% of users of inhaled β-agonists reported overuse, and 64% of users of inhaled corticosteroids reported underuse. Our definitions of underuse and overuse were based on national and international guidelines. 2, 4 Contemporary guideline-directed therapy emphasized use of inhaled β-agonists no more than 4 times daily and the use of a steady, moderate dose of ICSs adjusted as needed to achieve symptom control. We defined overuse of β-agonist MDIs as self-reported use of more than 8 puffs per day on days that patients used the medication. The reference group for analysis was patients who used β-agonist MDIs, but reported using 8 or fewer puffs per day. Underuse of ICSs was defined either as use on 4 or fewer days per week, or 4 or fewer puffs per day during the previous 4 weeks.

The comparison group was patients using the ICSs on 5 or more days per week or 5 or more puffs per day. Analyses of underuse of ICSs were confined to patients with moderate or severe asthma to ensure a study population for whom the guidelines clearly recommend ICS use. Asthma symptom questions were based on the symptom types and frequencies used by NAEPP2 and international4 asthma guidelines and included cough, sputum, chest tightness, wheezy or whistling sound in the chest, and shortness of breath. Use of ICSs was assessed for days of use within a week and daily dose. β-Agonist MDI use was quantified as puffs per day on days of use. This type of differential misclassification would tend to attenuate rather than exaggerate any differences we have shown.

Assessment of response and additional bronchodilator treatment — severe exacerbation in children: Children with a severe asthma exacerbation must be observed for at least 1 hour after initiation of treatment; if symptoms persist after initial bronchodilator, a further 2–6 puffs of salbutamol may be given 20 minutes after the first dose and repeated at 20-minute intervals for an hour, consider adding 1–2 puffs of ipratropium, and failure to respond at 1 hour or earlier deterioration should prompt admission to hospital with addition of nebulized ipratropium and a short course of oral corticosteroids. If symptoms have improved by 1 hour but recur within 3–4 hours, the child may be given more frequent doses of bronchodilator (2–3 puffs each hour) and oral corticosteroids should be given, and children who fail to respond to 10 puffs of inhaled SABA within a 3–4 hour period should be referred immediately to hospital. If symptoms resolve rapidly after initial bronchodilator and do not recur for 1–2 hours, no further treatment may be required; further SABA may be given as needed up to every 3–4 hours (up to a total of 10 puffs/24 hours), and if symptoms persist beyond 1 day, inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids are indicated.

The usual dose for MART with budesonide-formoterol is 200/6 mcg metered dose (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose) and for beclometasone-formoterol is 100/6 mcg metered dose (delivered dose 84.6/5 mcg for pMDI and 81.9/5 mcg for DPI), and for Step 4 each is prescribed as two inhalations twice-daily plus one inhalation whenever needed for symptom relief. As in Step 3, the maximum recommended total dose of budesonide-formoterol in a single day (total of maintenance-and-reliever doses) gives 72 mcg metered dose (54 mcg delivered dose) of formoterol; based on this evidence, GINA suggests the same maximum total dose should also apply for MART with beclometasone-formoterol (maximum total 12 inhalations, total metered dose 72 mcg), and most patients need far fewer doses than this.

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management recommendations… [^741f8255]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma.
- Controller therapy should be shifted to once-daily administration if symptoms are not controlled with as-needed therapy, minimizing the ICS dose when possible. From the AFP Editors Asthma is a serious global health problem. The latest update to the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines includes significant changes to treatment recommendations, especially a recommendation against using a short-acting beta 2 agonists such as albuterol as sole therapy. STEP 1 Step 1 options are for those with symptoms less than twice per month and no risk factors for exacerbations.

An inhaled low-dose ICS/formoterol combination used as needed is the preferred treatment in adults and adolescents. The guideline also strongly discourages the use of long-acting bronchodilators without an ICS because of increased risk of exacerbation. If the ICS/formoterol combination is not available or affordable, a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA is recommended. Options for children six to 11 years of age include using a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA or a daily low-dose ICS with a SABA as needed. When symptoms are infrequent, adherence to daily therapy is often poor. STEP 3 Options in adults and adolescents include low-dose ICS/long-acting beta 2-agonist as daily treatment with a SABA as needed, or low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily treatment and as needed. In children six to 11 years of age, either a medium-dose ICS or a low-dose ICS/LABA combination should be used as a controller, with a SABA as needed.

Editor's Note: Two changes in these guidelines are based on studies cited in the AFP article "Top POEMs of 2018 Consistent with the Principles of the Choosing Wisely Campaign". These trials demonstrated that as-needed use of budesonide/formoterol combination was as effective as a daily ICS for mild asthma in adults.

Rationale and discussion

Because the only SMART studied has included formoterol, the Expert Panel's recommendation favors the use of ICS-LABA combinations containing formoterol rather than those that contain ICS-salmeterol. Daily ICS-salmeterol remains an appropriate therapeutic option for individuals with moderate to severe persistent asthma, but the reviewed data suggest that the use of ICS-formoterol for maintenance and reliever therapy has superior efficacy, ease of use (because it is administered in a single inhaler rather than two separate inhalers), and perhaps safety as a result of reduced corticosteroid exposure. Other LABAs, including newer agents with a rapid onset, may be effective and safe to use for both maintenance and reliever therapy, but their efficacy and safety will need to be demonstrated in clinical studies. The number of studies available and the consistency of the evidence led the Expert Panel to make a strong recommendation to use ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler as both daily controller and reliever therapy.

Data were insufficient to compare ICS-formoterol as SMART with same-dose ICS for daily controller therapy along with SABA for quick-relief therapy in individuals aged 4 years and older. However, multiple studies have demonstrated that adding any LABA to the same ICS dose is more effective than ICS therapy alone. Thus, the lack of comparisons data on ICS-formoterol as SMART versus same-dose ICS and SABA for quick-relief therapy is of minimal clinical importance.

Recommendation 13: In individuals aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared to higher-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy.

Conditional recommendation, high certainty of evidence

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^24680d4f]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding a short course of oral corticosteroids (40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults/adolescents; 0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days for children) for severe exacerbations, such as peak expiratory flow or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted, or if not responding to above treatment over 2–3 days. Prefer morning dosing after first dose to minimize insomnia. Advise patients about potential adverse effects. Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for < 2 weeks.

Asthma guideline — SMART candidate selection and counseling indicates that no patient characteristics exclude consideration of this option in individuals aged 4 years and older with asthma; the studies demonstrating reduced exacerbations enrolled individuals with a severe exacerbation in the prior year and such individuals are particularly good candidates for SMART to reduce exacerbations; SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled on alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy; the recommended alternate therapy of maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy does not need to be changed if it is providing adequate control, but patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on such therapy should receive the preferred SMART if possible before moving to a higher step of therapy; clinicians should inform individuals and caregivers that studies consistently showed reductions in asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits or systemic corticosteroids, improvement in asthma control and quality of life in some studies, no differences in harms versus ICS or ICS-LABA in individuals aged 12 years and older, and that reductions in exposure to oral corticosteroids and to ICS treatment in most studies suggest the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid-associated harms; in children aged 4 to 11 years, there may be a lower risk of growth suppression among those taking SMART versus daily higher-dose ICS treatment; this recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals for reasons such as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance.

Making decisions about asthma treatment — Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response in both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side-effects), and of patient preferences. For population-level decisions about asthma medications, the 'preferred' regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best treatments for most patients based on evidence about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with emphasis on symptom burden and exacerbation risk, and for Steps 1–5 there are different preferred population-level recommendations for adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, and children 5 years and younger, with Step 5 also differing by inflammatory phenotype (Type 2 or non-Type 2). For individual patients, shared decision-making about treatment should also consider characteristics, phenotype or environmental exposures that predict risk or response, together with the patient's goals or concerns and practical issues (inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient). Optimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy and non-pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their multiple associated adverse effects.

Ages 5–11 years asthma stepwise management — preferred controller/reliever options escalate from daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA), to daily and PRN combination low-dose ICS–formoterol, then daily and PRN combination medium-dose ICS–formoterol, followed by daily high-dose ICS–long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) with PRN SABA, and finally daily high-dose ICS–LABA + oral systemic corticosteroid with PRN SABA. Assess control and actions include to first check adherence, inhaler technique, environmental factors, and comorbid conditions; step up if needed and reassess in 2–6 weeks; step down if possible if asthma is well controlled for at least 3 consecutive months; and consult with an asthma specialist if Step 4 or higher is required, considering consultation at Step 3. For adjuncts, Steps 2–4 conditionally recommend the use of subcutaneous immunotherapy as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy in individuals ≥ 5 years of age whose asthma is controlled at the initiation, build up, and maintenance phases of immunotherapy; consider Omalizumab, noting that Omalizumab is the only asthma biologic currently FDA-approved for this age range, and the FDA issued a Boxed Warning for montelukast in March 2020.

### BTS / NICE / SIGN joint guideline on asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024)-summary of recommendations [^483587a8]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-acting beta 2 agonist

A long-acting medicine that acts on beta-receptors in the airway to relax airway smooth muscle and relieve symptoms of asthma.

Long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist

A long-acting medicine that acts on muscarinic receptors in the airway to relax airway smooth muscle and relieve symptoms of asthma.

Maintenance and reliever therapy (MART)

A form of combined ICS plus formoterol treatment in which a single inhaler containing ICS and formoterol is used for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as needed. The terms low-dose MART and moderate-dose MART refer to the dosage of the maintenance component of MART. People using MART do not normally need a SABA.

Peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability

PEF is a measure of the maximum speed of expiration, generally expressed in litres per minute. PEF variability is a measure of the extent to which this varies over time and can be expressed numerically as amplitude percentage mean. This is calculated by subtracting the lowest value measured each day from the highest value on the same day, and averaging this over the number of days on which PEF is measured

Skin prick testing

A test that measures the allergic response of an individual to certain specific allergens when a very small amount of the specific allergen is introduced into the skin (usually the inner forearm).

Specialist in asthma care

A healthcare professional with higher training in respiratory medicine and proficiency in the management of asthma. In the context of this guideline, this requires both the relevant expertise and access to the resources that enable delivery of the diagnostic and management pathways described in the recommendations.

Uncontrolled asthma

A term used when asthma is having an impact on a person's lifestyle, or is restricting their normal activities, because of symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. Uncontrolled asthma can include one or both of: any asthma exacerbation needing treatment with oral corticosteroids frequent regular symptoms such as: needing a reliever inhaler three or more days per week, or having one or more nights per week when asthma causes night-time waking.

These can be quantified by questionnaires such as the Asthma Control Questionnaire or Asthma Control test.

Future research opportunities

The Expert Panel identified the following topics that would benefit from additional research:
Differences by race and ethnicity in benefits and risks of the ICS recommendations
Cost-effectiveness of the ICS recommendations
Effects on growth of short ICS courses starting at the onset of an apparent respiratory tract infection in children aged 0 to 4 years who have recurrent wheezing triggered only by such infections
Optimal short-course ICS regimen to use — on the basis of efficacy, effectiveness, and safety — at the onset of an apparent respiratory tract infection in children aged 0 to 4 years whose recurrent wheezing is triggered by respiratory tract infections
Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of a short ICS course starting at the onset of an apparent respiratory tract infection compared with daily ICS treatment in children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections
Daily low-dose ICS treatment with SABA for quick relief versus as-needed ICS plus SABA administered concomitantly in children aged 4 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma
Optimal dose of albuterol and ICS used for as-needed concomitant therapy in individuals with mild persistent asthma
Effectiveness and safety of other rapid-onset LABAs in combination medications used for both daily controller and quick-relief therapy
Combination ICS-formoterol as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared with higher-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy in children aged 4 to 11 years

Other recommended types of research included the following:
Confirmation of the efficacy data supporting the ICS recommendations using additional real-world effectiveness studies in clearly defined populations using clearly defined treatment regimens
Additional studies powered as equivalence studies to confirm the finding that daily low-dose ICS therapy with SABA for quick relief and concomitant as-needed ICS therapy plus SABA lead to similar outcomes in individuals with mild persistent asthma
Real-world studies that monitor growth in children and adherence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of quadrupling the ICS dose in individuals with mild to moderate persistent asthma taking daily ICS controller therapy who experience early signs of loss of asthma control

- **steps 1–2, as-needed-only ICS-formoterol as usual treatment**: Use 1 inhalation of ICS-formoterol, such as budesonide-formoterol 200/6 mcg or beclometasone dipropionate-formoterol 100/6 mcg, whenever needed for symptom relief, with a maximum 12 inhalations in any 24-hour period

- steps 3–5, maintenance and reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol as usual treatment: Continue usual maintenance dose of ICS-formoterol. For symptom relief, use 1 inhalation of ICS-formoterol whenever needed, with a maximum total 12 inhalations in any 24-hour period (as-needed plus maintenance doses).

Considerations for starting treatment with low-dose maintenance-and-reliever therapy — by consensus, we suggest starting with Step 3 MART instead of as-needed-only ICS-formoterol (Steps 1–2) when specific clinical features are present. There is no specific evidence to guide this decision, but by consensus, we suggest starting with Step 3 MART (if permitted by local regulators) if the patient has symptoms most days or is waking at night due to asthma more than once a week (to rapidly reduce symptom burden), or if they are currently smoking, have impaired perception of bronchoconstriction (e.g. low initial lung function but few symptoms), a recent severe exacerbation or a history of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation, have severe airway hyperresponsiveness, or are currently exposed to a seasonal allergic trigger.

### Mometasone furoate (Asmanex HFA) [^4e546803]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2	Recommended Dosage

Administer ASMANEX HFA as two inhalations twice daily every day (morning and evening) by the orally inhaled route. Shake well prior to each inhalation. If symptoms arise between doses, use an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist for immediate relief. The maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after beginning treatment. Individual patients may experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.

Adult and Adolescent Patients Aged 12 Years and Older

For patients 12 years of age and older, the dosage is either 2 inhalations twice daily of ASMANEX HFA 100 mcg or 200 mcg. The starting dosage is based on previous asthma therapy and disease severity, including considerations of the patients' current control of asthma symptoms and risk of future exacerbations. The recommended starting dosage for patients 12 years of age and older who are not on an inhaled corticosteroid is ASMANEX HFA 100 mcg, 2 inhalations twice daily. It is recommended that patients currently receiving chronic oral corticosteroid therapy (e.g., prednisone) begin with ASMANEX HFA 200 mcg (2 inhalations twice daily). For patients who do not respond adequately to the initial dosage after 2 weeks of therapy, increasing the dosage may provide additional asthma control. The maximum daily recommended dose is two inhalations of ASMANEX HFA 200 mcg twice daily (maximum of 800 mcg a day).

After asthma stability has been achieved, it may be desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects.

If a dosage regimen of ASMANEX HFA fails to provide adequate control of asthma, re-evaluate the therapeutic regimen and consider additional therapeutic options, e.g., replacing the current strength of ASMANEX HFA with a higher strength, initiating an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist combination product, or initiating oral corticosteroids.

Pediatric Patients Aged 5 to Less Than 12 Years

For patients aged 5 to less than 12 years, the dosage is 2 inhalations of ASMANEX HFA 50 mcg twice daily. The maximum daily dosage is 200 mcg.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and one important outcome (rescue medication use) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 9 is in EtD Table XIII in Appendix B.

Three RCTs with high certainty of evidence, compared SABA alone to intermittent ICS with SABA for quick relief. This treatment resulted in a 33% relative risk (RR) reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Two of these three trials assessed growth but found different effects on this outcome. Ducharme et alfound a 5% lower gain in height and weight in study participants receiving intermittent fluticasone (750 μg twice daily at onset of a respiratory tract infection for up to 10 days) than in participants receiving a placebo. The authors noted a significant correlation between the cumulative dose of fluticasone and changes in height. In contrast, Bacharier et aldid not find an effect on linear growth of budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily for 7 days) in comparison with placebo in children with an "identified respiratory tract illness". Whether these differences in growth effects were due to differences in drugs, doses, duration of treatment, or other factors is not clear.

Rationale and discussion

The main comparator for which data are available is SABA-only therapy. The demonstrated efficacy but conflicting data regarding the effect of a short course of a daily ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy on growth led the Expert Panel to develop a conditional recommendation for this therapy starting at the on set of an apparent respiratory tract infection for children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing. Although one study that compared short ICS courses with regular daily ICS treatment showed no differences in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids with moderate certainty of evidence, the Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison because this study was not adequately powered to demonstrate equivalence. No studies produced robust data on comparisons of intermittent ICS use with no treatment or a nonpharmacologic therapy.

Question 4.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of intermittent ICS compared to ICS controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

Recommendation 10: In individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends either daily low-dose ICS and as needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly.

Budesonide-formoterol reliever therapy (SMART) — comparative evidence is summarized as follows. In participants aged 12 years and older, daily budesonide-formoterol (640/18 μg) plus SMART was compared with daily fluticasone-salmeterol (1000/100 μg) plus SABA, and daily budesonide-formoterol (320/9 μg) plus SMART was compared with either daily budesonide-formoterol (640/18 μg) or daily fluticasone-salmeterol (500/100 μg) plus SABA. These trials showed significant reductions in exacerbations with SMART, but the studies found no differences between groups in asthma control or quality of life; SMART also resulted in statistically significant reductions in corticosteroid use but had no significant effect on asthma quality of life or asthma control, and as a result the recommendation was conditional. Data were insufficient to make a recommendation regarding whether SMART is superior to daily higher-dose ICS-LABA with SABA for quick-relief therapy in children aged 4 to 11 years. The systematic review also identified five open-label, real-world trials comparing daily budesonide-formoterol (160–320/4.5–9 μg) plus SMART with conventional best practice (total N = 5056), and in general the real-world studies confirmed the results from the RCTs that used SMART.

### Use of beclomethasone dipropionate as rescue treatment for children with mild persistent asthma (TREXA): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^909d1873]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Daily inhaled corticosteroids are an effective treatment for mild persistent asthma, but some children have exacerbations even with good day-to-day control, and many discontinue treatment after becoming asymptomatic. We assessed the effectiveness of an inhaled corticosteroid (beclomethasone dipropionate) used as rescue treatment.

Methods

In this 44-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial we enrolled children and adolescents with mild persistent asthma aged 5–18 years from five clinical centres in the USA. A computer-generated randomisation sequence, stratified by clinical centre and age group, was used to randomly assign participants to one of four treatment groups: twice daily beclomethasone with beclomethasone plus albuterol as rescue (combined group); twice daily beclomethasone with placebo plus albuterol as rescue (daily beclomethasone group); twice daily placebo with beclomethasone plus albuterol as rescue (rescue beclomethasone group); and twice daily placebo with placebo plus albuterol as rescue (placebo group). Twice daily beclomethasone treatment was one puff of beclomethasone (40 μg per puff) or placebo given in the morning and evening. Rescue beclomethasone treatment was two puffs of beclomethasone or placebo for each two puffs of albuterol (180 μg) needed for symptom relief. The primary outcome was time to first exacerbation that required oral corticosteroids. A secondary outcome measured linear growth. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00394329.

Results

843 children and adolescents were enrolled into this trial, of whom 288 were assigned to one of four treatment groups; combined (n = 71), daily beclomethasone (n = 72), rescue beclomethasone (n = 71), and placebo (n = 74)-555 individuals were excluded during the run-in, according to predefined criteria. Compared with the placebo group (49%, 95% CI 37–61), the frequency of exacerbations was lower in the daily (28%, 18–40, p = 0.03), combined (31%, 21–43, p = 0.07), and rescue (35%, 24–47, p = 0.07) groups. Frequency of treatment failure was 23% (95% CI 14–43) in the placebo group, compared with 5.6% (1.6–14) in the combined (p = 0.012), 2.8% (0–10) in the daily (p = 0.009), and 8.5% (2–15) in the rescue (p = 0.024) groups. Compared with the placebo group, linear growth was 1.1 cm (SD 0.3) less in the combined and daily arms (p < 0.0001), but not the rescue group (p = 0.26). Only two individuals had severe adverse events; one in the daily beclomethasone group had viral meningitis and one in the combined group had bronchitis.

Interpretation

Children with mild persistent asthma should not be treated with rescue albuterol alone and the most effective treatment to prevent exacerbations is daily inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids as rescue medication with albuterol might be an effective step-down strategy for children with well controlled, mild asthma because it is more effective at reducing exacerbations than is use of rescue albuterol alone. Use of daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment and related side-effects such as growth impairment can therefore be avoided.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^e390be0f]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Track 2 (alternative) Step 2 for adults and adolescents — low-dose maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA — Regular daily low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA was standard of care for mild asthma for the past 30 years, and most guidelines recommended its use only for patients with asthma symptoms more than twice a week. Most studies of daily low-dose ICS have included patients with symptoms between 3–7 days a week. There is a large body of evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies showing that the risks of severe exacerbations, hospitalizations and mortality are substantially reduced with regular low-dose ICS; symptoms and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction are also reduced, and severe exacerbations have also been reduced with low-dose ICS even in patients with symptoms 0–1 days a week. Clinicians should be aware that adherence with maintenance ICS in the community is extremely low.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment, stepping up, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to step up treatment with the following adjustment options when asthma remains uncontrolled despite good adherence and inhaler technique:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Day-to-day adjustment using an anti-inflammatory reliever|- Adjusting the number of as-needed doses of ICS-formoterol from day to day according to symptoms (by the patient), if the reliever inhaler is budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol (with or without maintenance ICS-formoterol)|
|Short-term step up (for 1–2 weeks)|- Increasing the dose of maintenance ICS for 1–2 weeks (by the patient according to the written asthma action plan or by the healthcare provider), for example, during viral infections or seasonal allergen exposure|
|Sustained step up (for at least 2–3 months)|- Increasing the low dose of maintenance ICS to medium when the symptoms are confirmed to be due to asthma, inhaler technique and adherence are satisfactory, and modifiable risk factors such as smoking have been addressed. Reduce the dose to the previous level if there is no response after 2–3 months, and consider offering alternative treatments or referring to a specialist center.|

### Asthma control among treated US asthma patients in practice fusion's electronic medical record research database [^e87e217f]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Determination of a patient's GINA Step required calculation of ICS and ICS/LABA daily doses. The Practice Fusion prescription data includes fields that were generated using MedEx, a natural language processing system which extracts medication information from clinical notes. There are three MedEx-derived fields that were used for calculation of ICS daily dose: (1) frequency (e.g. once per day); (2) dose amount (e.g. '2' in '2 puffs'); (3) dose unit ('puff' in '2 puffs'). For missing values of frequency, dose, or dose amount, we imputed values from the mode across each National Drug Code. We converted all ICS strength to micrograms (mcg) prior to calculating ICS daily dose. ICS daily dose was calculated as: (Frequency)*(Dose amount)*(Strength). Finally, the ICS and ICS/LABA dosage levels required for GINA Step calculation were defined for each medication based on generic names or ingredients (Supplementary Table 2).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^da3e4e19]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

### Asthma update: part II. medical management [^b38775cf]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recently updated its guidelines for the management of asthma. An evidence-based approach was used to examine several key issues regarding appropriate medical therapy for patients with asthma. The updated guidelines have clarified these issues and should alter the way physicians prescribe asthma medications. Chronic inhaled corticosteroid use is safe in adults and children, and inhaled corticosteroids are recommended as first-line therapy in adults and children with persistent asthma, even if the disease is mild. Other medications, such as cromolyn, theophylline, and leukotriene modifiers, now are considered alternative treatments and should have a more limited role in the management of persistent asthma. The addition of a long-acting beta2 agonist to an inhaled corticosteroid is superior to all other combinations as well as to higher dosages of inhaled corticosteroids alone. Combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2 agonist is the preferred treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe asthma. Antibiotic therapy offers no additional benefit in patients with asthma exacerbations.

### Towards tailored and targeted adherence assessment to optimise asthma management [^ffffb9c3]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Managing non-adherence in asthma: not simply one-size fits-all

Most of the erratic non-adherent patients could be helped by straightforward interventions such as simplification of the dosing regimen, electronic reminders, or the advice to link the intake of medication to a daily habit. In contrast, patients that are intelligent non-adherent do not need any reminders, but may be more likely to benefit from a process of shared decision making and motivational interviewing. Finally, unwitting non-adherent patients are expected to benefit from extra education. For this purpose, self-management and written action plans have been widely recommended in international and many national guidelines. The effectiveness of these plans has been proven; however, uptake of written action plans is still suboptimal. In addition, there is room for improvement of the specific elements impacting effectiveness of these plans, especially regarding suitability in patients with limited literacy. Patients with poor inhalation technique would be helped by more information and training to enhance their skills regarding inhaler use. Thereby it should be mentioned that training and education on inhalation technique have to be provided by well-trained healthcare professionals. Notably, some studies suggest that there is ample room for improvement regarding medical personnel's knowledge on inhalation devices.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting, SABAs, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that delivery of short-acting β-agonists via a pressurized-metered dose inhaler and spacer or a dry-powdered inhaler leads to a similar improvement in lung function as delivery via nebulizer,
although the most cost-effective route of delivery is pressurized-metered dose inhaler and spacer.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: management strategies [^d60d0322]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment, stepping up, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate single maintenance and reliever therapy with an ICS-LABA to reduce the risk of exacerbations in patients aged ≥ 12 years with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. Consider initiating single maintenance and reliever therapy in pediatric patients aged ≥ 4 years with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^ba7dc490]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Randomised trial comparing as-needed versus regular treatment with formoterol in patients with persistent asthma [^a3f93dcd]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the equivalent efficacy of inhaled formoterol in asthmatic patients, either given as-needed or on a regular twice-daily schedule.

Methods

Randomised, open 12-week study in patients with mild to moderate asthma not adequately controlled with inhaled glucocorticosteroids alone. Patients received inhaled formoterol as needed or on a regular schedule (2x2 puffs/day with 6 microg formoterol per puff). Patients in the twice-daily formoterol group could use salbutamol as a rescue medication. The primary endpoint was the number of patients with asthma exacerbations in each group.

Results

Thirty-nine centres randomised 359 patients. The number of patients with asthma exacerbations showed neither a clinically relevant nor a statistically significant difference between groups: formoterol as-needed: 3.95% (7 of 177); twice daily: 3.45% (6 of 174). Patients in the formoterol as-needed group used significantly less formoterol (-1.5 puffs per day; P < 0.0001). Including the saved rescue medication (up to one puff per day), total beta-2 agonist use in the formoterol as-needed group decreased by approximately 2–2.5 puffs per day. Both formoterol treatment schedules were well tolerated. Musculoskeletal pain and tremor were less frequent in the formoterol as-needed group: headaches were slightly more frequent.

Conclusion

Formoterol given as needed and without additional beta-2 agonist, and formoterol given on a regular basis twice daily, supplemented by salbutamol as a rescue medication, appeared equally effective in this clinical study. Drug consumption was markedly lower in the former group.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^364987da]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment tracks for adults and adolescents — Track 1, in which the reliever is low-dose ICS-formoterol, is the preferred approach recommended by GINA; when a patient at any step has asthma symptoms they use low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed for relief, and in Steps 3–5 they also take ICS-formoterol as regular daily treatment; this approach is preferred because it reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with using a SABA reliever, with similar symptom control, and because of the simplicity of needing only a single medication across treatment Steps 1–4; medications and doses for Track 1 include the maximum recommended total formoterol (with ICS) dose in any day for each formulation, and GINA suggests that the same maximum total daily dose should apply for beclometasone-formoterol. Track 2, in which the reliever is an ICS-SABA or SABA, is an alternative if Track 1 is not possible or if a patient is stable with good adherence and no exacerbations in the past year; in Step 1 the patient takes a SABA and a low-dose ICS together for symptom relief (in combination if available, or with the ICS taken immediately after the SABA), and in Steps 2–5 the reliever is a SABA or combination ICS-SABA; before considering a SABA reliever, consider whether the patient is likely to be adherent with their ICS-containing treatment, as otherwise they would be at higher risk of exacerbations.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, more specifically with respect to ICSs and SABAs, NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend to consider initiating either daily low-dose ICS and as-needed short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy or as-needed ICS and short-acting β-agonist concomitantly in ≥ 12 years old patients with mild persistent asthma.
