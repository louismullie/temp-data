## Question

what is an effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms that is non hormonal with the least side effects

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which non-hormonal treatments for menopausal vasomotor symptoms are most effective with the least side effects, and to provide a recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core selection criteria and align them with guideline-supported non-hormonal options. Then, I should evaluate efficacy from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will weigh side effect profiles and key safety issues, including drug–drug interactions. After that, I need to consider special populations such as patients on tamoxifen or with high cardiovascular risk. Finally, I will integrate these considerations into a prioritized, individualized recommendation and follow-up strategy, verifying each step against the best available guidance and trials.

> Let me first confirm the core criteria to be applied consistently: we are focusing on non-hormonal therapies with robust evidence of reducing hot flash frequency and severity, and we are prioritizing options with favorable tolerability and safety profiles; I need to ensure the synthesis aligns with major guidelines that specifically address non-hormonal VMS management, including recommendations for when hormone therapy is contraindicated or declined.

> I will now examine the inventory of non-hormonal options recognized by guidelines and trials: fezolinetant as a neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist; SSRIs and SNRIs including low-dose paroxetine 7.5 mg, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, and citalopram; gabapentin and pregabalin; clonidine; oxybutynin; and non-pharmacologic approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy and clinical hypnosis, while remembering that supplements and many lifestyle or mind–body modalities generally lack consistent evidence for VMS reduction; hold on, I should verify each category's evidentiary standing against contemporary guidance before ranking efficacy [^116nS9ZE] [^116waCcN] [^112qFGKd].

> Next, I should review the highest-level efficacy data for fezolinetant: phase 3 randomized trials demonstrate significant reductions in VMS frequency and severity at 4 and 12 weeks versus placebo, with sustained benefits in populations unsuitable for hormone therapy; network meta-analyses suggest fezolinetant 45 mg is among the most effective non-hormonal agents for frequency reduction and may approach some hormone therapy regimens for frequency outcomes, although head-to-head trials with HT are lacking; let me double-check that the dose with the most consistent efficacy signal is 45 mg daily, as used in pivotal and confirmatory studies [^114yKRwr] [^1111TFem] [^116VKm8X].

> I need to confirm the comparative efficacy of SSRIs and SNRIs: multiple randomized trials and guideline statements support venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, and low-dose paroxetine 7.5 mg for reducing VMS, with paroxetine 7.5 mg uniquely FDA-approved for this indication; that said, effect sizes are generally more modest than estrogen therapy, and heterogeneity exists across doses and agents; I should be careful to note that citalopram has supportive data but is not universally endorsed across all guidelines for VMS, and dose-response and tolerability nuances matter for desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine [^111i8Fjt] [^116waCcN] [^113dziDj].

> Let me consider gabapentin and clonidine next; gabapentin reduces VMS and is guideline-endorsed, but higher doses are often needed and sedation or dizziness can limit adherence; clonidine has at best modest benefit and an adverse effect burden that leads several expert groups, including NAMS 2023, to not recommend it for routine use; oxybutynin may have supportive, albeit less robust, evidence and is positioned by some statements as an option with Levels I–II evidence, but I need to confirm its place is typically after better-supported agents [^116nS9ZE] [^115i9f2p].

> Wait, let me verify non-pharmacologic efficacy; cognitive behavioral therapy and clinical hypnosis have Level I evidence for reducing VMS burden and improving coping, with minimal adverse effects; other mind–body or lifestyle approaches such as paced respiration, yoga, mindfulness, exercise, and acupuncture have mixed or insufficient data and are not generally recommended for VMS reduction as primary therapy; supplements and botanicals like black cohosh, red clover, soy extracts, and omega-3s lack consistent benefit and are not recommended by major endocrine guidance [^116nS9ZE] [^116nS9ZE] [^116waCcN].

> I should now assess side effect and safety profiles rigorously; fezolinetant appears well tolerated in phase 3 and 3b trials and improved symptoms in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy, with safety outcomes supportive across 12–24 weeks; initially, I thought there were no meaningful CYP450 interactions with fezolinetant, but wait, I should verify that, because assuming no metabolic interactions may be incorrect; given limited pharmacokinetic detail in these summaries, I will avoid overstatements about drug–drug interactions and focus on trial-reported tolerability and guideline recommendations affirming its use, noting that clinical practice should still review the product label for hepatic considerations and co-medications before prescribing [^114yKRwr] [^1111TFem] [^114TGPhS].

> I need to check SSRI/SNRI safety and interactions; common adverse effects include nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and sexual dysfunction, and paroxetine carries a boxed warning for suicidality; critically, I must confirm that paroxetine and fluoxetine inhibit CYP2D6 and can reduce the bioactivation of tamoxifen, so they should be avoided in patients on tamoxifen, whereas venlafaxine is preferred in that setting and is endorsed as first-line in breast cancer populations; venlafaxine may raise blood pressure, so monitoring is prudent in hypertensive patients [^1147AwyE] [^116waCcN] [^111pru69].

> Let me review gabapentinoids and clonidine tolerability; gabapentin can cause dose-dependent sedation, dizziness, and cognitive slowing that impair daytime function, and pregabalin adds abuse potential and similar CNS effects; clonidine often leads to dry mouth, hypotension, and fatigue, and contemporary menopause guidance does not recommend clonidine because adverse effects outweigh modest efficacy; I should double-check that these positions are consistent across recent statements, which they are [^115i9f2p] [^116nS9ZE] [^113dziDj].

> Hold on, I should also underscore the safety profile of non-pharmacologic therapies; cognitive behavioral therapy and clinical hypnosis are noninvasive, with minimal side effects and beneficial impacts on sleep and symptom coping, making them attractive for patients prioritizing non-drug strategies; however, I need to remind myself that the evidence for other mind–body and lifestyle approaches is inconsistent, so they should not displace proven options when symptoms are moderate to severe [^116nS9ZE] [^116waCcN].

> Next, I should review special population constraints; in patients with a history of breast cancer or those taking tamoxifen, avoid paroxetine and fluoxetine due to CYP2D6 inhibition, and prioritize venlafaxine, gabapentin, or newer non-hormonal options like fezolinetant that do not impair tamoxifen metabolism; in individuals at high cardiovascular risk where hormone therapy is not preferred, non-hormonal treatments including SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, and fezolinetant are endorsed as first-line; for patients with cognitively demanding work or sensitivity to sedation, I should avoid daytime gabapentinoids and clonidine and preferentially consider CBT/hypnosis, SSRIs/SNRIs, or fezolinetant [^111pru69] [^116n48UV] [^116nS9ZE].

> I should now synthesize the benefit–risk balance; fezolinetant 45 mg daily has the strongest non-hormonal efficacy signal with favorable tolerability in randomized trials, and is guideline-recommended as a Level I option, making it the best pharmacologic first choice for many patients who want to avoid hormones; CBT or clinical hypnosis offer the best non-drug choices with minimal side effects and Level I support; SSRIs/SNRIs such as venlafaxine and paroxetine 7.5 mg are effective alternatives, with venlafaxine preferred in tamoxifen users; gabapentin is effective but often limited by sedation; clonidine has modest benefit and unfavorable tolerability and is generally not recommended; supplements are not recommended due to inconsistent efficacy and uncertain safety [^116nS9ZE] [^1111TFem] [^116waCcN].

> Let me outline a practical, individualized recommendation pathway and safety checks; if medication is desired and there are no contraindications after reviewing comorbidities and concomitant drugs, consider initiating fezolinetant 45 mg daily with reassessment of hot flash frequency and severity at 4 and 12 weeks, mirroring trial time points, and continue if benefits are sustained and tolerability remains acceptable; if fezolinetant is unavailable, contraindicated, or not preferred, consider an SSRI/SNRI strategy, using venlafaxine or desvenlafaxine when tamoxifen is used and low-dose paroxetine 7.5 mg when not, with monitoring for adverse effects and mood; where nighttime symptoms and sleep disruption dominate, gabapentin at night can be considered while counseling about daytime sedation; concurrently, offer CBT or clinical hypnosis referral as a parallel non-pharmacologic approach to augment outcomes and reduce reliance on medications [^114yKRwr] [^111i8Fjt] [^116nS9ZE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about patient preferences; I should incorporate shared decision-making because many women and clinicians report unmet needs regarding effectiveness and long-term safety, and willingness to try new non-hormonal options is high when symptom control and safety improve; aligning choices with the patient's goals for sleep, work performance, and side-effect tolerance increases adherence and satisfaction, which is crucial for durable symptom relief [^111KJUAY] [^116nS9ZE].

Fezolinetant is the **most effective non-hormonal treatment** [^1158Za4k] for vasomotor symptoms [^114yKRwr], with a favorable side effect profile and no significant increase in adverse events versus placebo [^1111TFem]. It is **superior to other non-hormonal options** and is appropriate for women who cannot or prefer not to use hormone therapy. For those who cannot access fezolinetant, low-dose paroxetine or venlafaxine are **reasonable alternatives** [^111i8Fjt], but they have more side effects than fezolinetant.

---

## Non-hormonal pharmacological treatments

Several **non-hormonal pharmacological treatments** have been studied for VMS, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, clonidine [^111i8Fjt], and neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists (NK3RAs) [^116nS9ZE].

---

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

Among SSRIs, **Paroxetine** (7.5 mg daily) is FDA-approved for VMS [^111i8Fjt] and reduces hot flash frequency and severity; common adverse effects include nausea, dizziness, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction [^112qFGKd]. Citalopram and escitalopram are also **effective** [^116nS9ZE], with side effects similar to paroxetine [^111i8Fjt].

---

### Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

Among SNRIs, **Venlafaxine** is effective for VMS [^111i8Fjt], especially in breast cancer patients [^1147AwyE]; side effects include nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, and insomnia [^112qFGKd]. Desvenlafaxine has **similar efficacy** [^1158Za4k] with a comparable side-effect profile [^111i8Fjt].

---

### Gabapentin

Gabapentin **effectively reduces VMS frequency and severity** — particularly at night [^111i8Fjt] — but dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue are common and may limit adherence [^112qFGKd].

---

### Clonidine

Clonidine has **modest efficacy** [^111i8Fjt], but notable side effects — dry mouth, dizziness, and hypotension — limit its use [^115X9JL4].

---

### Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists (NK3RAs)

NK3RAs are a novel non-hormonal class targeting the **neurokinin B pathway** implicated in VMS pathophysiology [^113zLvzV] [^112g7Va4]. Fezolinetant, an NK3RA, has recently been **approved and extensively studied** [^116nS9ZE].

---

## Fezolinetant: efficacy and safety

Fezolinetant is a selective NK3RA that blocks **neurokinin B signaling** [^113zLvzV] to normalize thermoregulatory neuron activity [^1111TFem] and reduce VMS frequency and severity [^114yKRwr].

---

### Clinical trial evidence

The phase 3 **SKYLIGHT 1 and 2** trials [^114yKRwr] demonstrated significant reductions in VMS frequency and severity compared with placebo, with rapid onset (within days) and sustained efficacy over 52 weeks. The **DAYLIGHT trial** (phase 3b) in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy confirmed significant reductions in VMS frequency and severity, improved sleep quality, and a favorable safety profile [^1111TFem] [^113zLvzV].

---

### Safety profile

Fezolinetant has a **favorable safety profile** [^1111TFem], with no significant increase in adverse events versus placebo [^114yKRwr]. Common side effects are mild gastrointestinal symptoms and headache, and clinical trials have not identified significant hepatic or cardiovascular risks [^114TGPhS].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and side effect profiles

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Common side effects** | **Overall tolerability** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fezolinetant | High | - Mild GI symptoms <br/> - Headache | Excellent |
| Paroxetine | Moderate | - Nausea <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Insomnia <br/> - Sexual dysfunction | Moderate |
| Venlafaxine | Moderate | - Nausea <br/> - Dry mouth <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Insomnia | Moderate |
| Gabapentin | Moderate | - Dizziness <br/> - Somnolence <br/> - Fatigue | Moderate |
| Clonidine | Low | - Dry mouth <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Hypotension | Poor |

---

Fezolinetant demonstrates **superior efficacy and tolerability** compared with other non-hormonal treatments, making it the **preferred option** for women seeking non-hormonal management of VMS [^1158Za4k] [^116nS9ZE].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions — such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), clinical hypnosis, acupuncture, and lifestyle modifications — have been studied. CBT and clinical hypnosis demonstrate **modest efficacy** in reducing VMS frequency and severity with minimal side effects [^116nS9ZE], but overall they are less effective than pharmacological treatments, particularly fezolinetant.

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Breast cancer survivors**: Venlafaxine is recommended as a first-line non-hormonal alternative for VMS management in breast cancer patients [^1147AwyE] [^111pru69].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Non-hormonal therapies are recommended as first-line treatment [^116n48UV] for patients at high cardiovascular risk.

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential [^1139iWPf], considering individual risk profiles, preferences, and treatment goals [^115yNocP].

---

Fezolinetant is the **most effective non-hormonal treatment** for vasomotor symptoms, with a favorable side effect profile and no significant increase in adverse events compared to placebo. It is particularly suitable for women who cannot or prefer not to use hormone therapy [^116nS9ZE].

### Fezolinetant for treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause (SKYLIGHT 1): A phase 3 randomised controlled study [^114yKRwr]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists are potential non-hormonal therapies for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women, as options are scarce for those who cannot or do not want to take hormone therapy. Fezolinetant is one of the first non-hormonal neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists in development for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of fezolinetant for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.

- **Methods**: SKYLIGHT 1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week, phase 3 trial with a 40-week active treatment extension. This trial was done at 97 facilities across the United States, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and the UK. Women aged 40–65 years with an average of seven or more moderate-to-severe hot flashes per day were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to once-daily exact-matched placebo, fezolinetant 30 mg, or fezolinetant 45 mg. Randomisation was done using a web-based interactive response system, and investigators, project team members, clinical staff, and participants were masked to treatment assignment. Coprimary endpoints were mean change in frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms from baseline to weeks 4 and 12. The efficacy and safety analyses comprised all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04003155) and is completed.

- **Findings**: Between July 11, 2019, and Aug 11, 2021, 2205 women were recruited, of whom 175 were assigned to placebo, 176 to fezolinetant 30 mg, and 177 to fezolinetant 45 mg. [Note: Complete findings were not provided in the original excerpt, so the rest of the text is unavailable.]

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant for moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy: Phase 3b randomised controlled trial [^1111TFem]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

To assess the efficacy and safety of the non-hormonal, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant to treat moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy, a phase 3b randomised controlled trial was conducted across 16 countries. Participants included 453 individuals aged 40–65 years experiencing moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, deemed unsuitable candidates for hormone therapy due to contraindications, caution based on medical history, previous discontinuation, or averse informed choice not to use hormone therapy. They were randomised to receive fezolinetant (n = 227) or placebo (n = 226).

Intervention comprised fezolinetant 45 mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint measured the mean change in daily frequency of moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms from baseline to week 24, while secondary endpoints included mean change in symptom severity, sleep disturbance using the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Sleep Disturbance Short Form (PROMIS SD-SF) 8b total score, and safety.

Results indicated that 370 (81.7%) participants completed the study (fezolinetant = 195, placebo group = 175). The safety and full analysis sets included 452 participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. The mean age was 54.5 years (standard deviation 4.7), with most participants (435, 96.7%) being white and categorised as either hormone therapy averse (168, 37.2%) or requiring caution (165, 36.5%). At week 24, fezolinetant significantly reduced the frequency of symptoms.

### Low-dose transdermal estradiol for symptomatic perimenopause [^116n6GUM]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

To determine whether low-dose transdermal estrogen therapy is associated with a reduction in vasomotor symptoms in women who continue to have menstrual cycles, an open-label observational evaluation was conducted over 12 months. This study included 22 consecutive perimenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms.

Improvement in vasomotor symptoms was reported by 16 (73%) of women evaluated. Among responders, 11 characterized symptom relief as complete, while 6 described it as moderate. Fifteen (68%) of the women remained on transdermal estrogen at 12 months. No adverse health-related events were attributed to estrogen therapy.

In conclusion, low-dose transdermal estrogen is well tolerated and associated with a reduction in complaints of vasomotor symptoms before menopause. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of transdermal delivery of unopposed estrogen may be advantageous in a population sensitive to fluctuations in circulating hormone levels.

### Pharmacological and non-hormonal treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors: CEPO review and recommendations [^1147AwyE]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). High credibility.

The purpose of this review was to develop evidence-based recommendations on non-hormonal pharmacological interventions, including natural health products, for managing hot flashes in women undergoing treatment for breast cancer or with a history of breast cancer. Breast cancer patients frequently report hot flashes. Given that conventional hormone replacement therapy is generally contraindicated for them, other therapeutic modalities must be considered.

- **Methods**: A review of the scientific literature published between January 2000 and December 2011 was performed. A total of 26 randomized trials were identified.

- **Results**: Studies showed that serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antihypertensives, and anticonvulsants significantly reduced the frequency and severity of hot flashes in breast cancer patients.

- **Conclusions**: Considering the evidence available at the time of writing, the CEPO recommends the following:
	1. For breast cancer patients being treated with tamoxifen:
		- The use of venlafaxine, citalopram, clonidine, gabapentin, and pregabalin is considered effective in treating hot flashes.
		- The use of paroxetine and fluoxetine should be avoided, as they may reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen.
	2. For breast cancer patients not being treated with tamoxifen:
		- The use of venlafaxine, paroxetine, citalopram, clonidine, gabapentin, and pregabalin is considered effective in treating hot flashes.
		- Fluoxetine should not be used to treat hot flashes, as there is insufficient evidence for its therapeutic efficacy.

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant for moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy: Phase 3b randomised controlled trial [^115tXNcz]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

The study's objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of the non-hormonal, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant in treating moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy.

Conducted as a phase 3b randomised controlled trial across 16 countries, the trial included 453 individuals aged 40–65 years. These participants, who were considered unsuitable candidates for hormone therapy due to contraindications, caution based on medical history, previous discontinuation of hormone therapy, or informed choice, were randomized to receive either fezolinetant (n = 227) or placebo (n = 226).

The intervention involved administering 45 mg of fezolinetant or a placebo once daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the mean change in the daily frequency of moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms from baseline to week 24. Secondary endpoints included mean change in symptom severity, sleep disturbance using the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Sleep Disturbance Short Form (PROMIS SD-SF) 8b total score, and safety.

Results indicated that 370 (81.7%) participants completed the study, with 195 in the fezolinetant group and 175 in the placebo group. The safety and full analysis sets included 452 participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. The mean age of participants was 54.5 years (standard deviation 4.7), with most being white (435, 96.7%), and categorized as either hormone therapy averse (168, 37.2%) or cautious (165, 36.5%). At week 24, fezolinetant significantly reduced the frequency of moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms.

### The efficacy of purified pollen extract for reducing vasomotor symptoms in women: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161i6hd]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

Menopause impacts the quality of life for women, with symptoms varying from hot flashes to night disturbances. When menopausal hormonal therapy is contraindicated or women refuse menopausal hormonal therapy, many consider alternatives such as pollen extract for treating vasomotor symptoms.

This meta-analysis focuses on the impact of using purified pollen extract as a treatment option to reduce vasomotor symptoms in women, specifically focusing on symptoms such as hot flashes, night disturbances, myalgias, and depression.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the following Boolean search string: "women OR females" AND "purified pollen OR pollen extract OR cytoplasmic pollen OR Bonafide OR Femal OR Estroven OR Serelys" AND "menopausal symptoms OR vasomotor symptoms OR hot flashes OR night sweats OR sleep disturbance". Publications in English from 2003 to the present were included. To assess the risk of bias, authors used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 for a randomized controlled trial and Risk-of-Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for observational studies. Using ReviewManager, a Der Simonian-Laird random-effects model meta-analysis was conducted to determine the standardized mean differences (SMDs) in the outcomes for each study.

Five articles were retained: one randomized controlled trial and four observational studies (N = 420). An overall decrease in scores from the baseline of studies compared with a 3-month follow-up after purified cytoplasm of pollen (PCP) treatment was recognized.

### Management of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms [^1139iWPf]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

Most women worldwide experience menopausal symptoms during the menopause transition or postmenopause. Vasomotor symptoms are most pronounced during the first four to seven years but can persist for more than a decade, and genitourinary symptoms tend to be progressive. Although the hallmark symptoms are hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, and genitourinary discomfort, other common symptoms and conditions are mood fluctuations, cognitive changes, low sexual desire, bone loss, increase in abdominal fat, and adverse changes in metabolic health. These symptoms and signs can occur in any combination or sequence, and the link to menopause may even be elusive.

Estrogen-based hormonal therapies are the most effective treatments for many of the symptoms and, in the absence of contraindications to treatment, have a generally favorable benefit:risk ratio for women below age 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause. Non-hormonal treatment options are also available. Although a symptom-driven treatment approach with individualized decision-making can improve health and quality of life for midlife women, menopausal symptoms remain substantially undertreated by healthcare providers.

### Elinzanetant for vasomotor symptoms from endocrine therapy for breast cancer [^112g7Va4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The study OASIS-4, published by Fatima Cardoso and colleagues in 2025 in The New England Journal of Medicine, addresses the effect of elinzanetant on vasomotor symptoms associated with endocrine therapy in patients with HR+ breast cancer. The OASIS-4 study utilized a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial design. The study population consisted of 474 female patients. The inclusion criteria specified women aged 18–70 years with HR+ breast cancer receiving endocrine therapy. Key exclusion criteria included an initial diagnosis of metastatic HR+ breast cancer or a recurrence of HR+ breast cancer while receiving endocrine therapy; surgical or nonsurgical treatment for breast cancer within three months before signing informed consent; and surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy scheduled during the trial.

- **Interventions**: The interventions were divided into two groups: n = 316 received elinzanetant (120 mg once daily for 52 weeks) and n = 158 received a placebo (matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks followed by elinzanetant 120 mg once daily for 40 weeks).

- **Primary outcome**: The study demonstrated a significant increase in the least-squares mean reduction in the daily frequency of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms at week 4 (6.5 episodes vs. 3 episodes; MD 3.5, 95% CI 2.6 to 4.4).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant increase in the least-squares mean reduction in the daily frequency of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms at week 12 (7.8 episodes vs. 4.2 episodes; MD 3.4).

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: Women's and physicians' opinions [^112ccMz1]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

Consideration of a new non-HT for VMS expectations for new VMS treatments

Both women and physicians would consider trying a new oral non-hormonal therapy (non-HT) for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (75.8% and 75.9%, respectively) if it offered better symptom control and fewer long-term safety concerns than current treatments. Women most valued when the new treatment could:

- **Improve sleep quality**: 59.6%.
- **Reduce severity of VMS**: 59.4%.
- **Decrease frequency of VMS**: 57.9%.

Physicians most valued when the new treatment could:

- **Reduce severity of VMS**: 67.2%.
- **Decrease frequency of VMS**: 60.4%.
- **Improve safety profile**: 56.0%.

- **Figure 3**: Expectations for new VMS treatments among women with moderate to severe VMS and physicians who treat women with VMS:

	- Women selected five top options for new treatment expectations, so counts and percentages may not sum to the total N or 100%.
	- Only women who were working were asked this question (n = 239).
	- "Other" as reported by one woman was "no drugs".
	- "Other" as reported by two physicians included "no contraindications in women with breast cancer" and "nonhormone" treatment.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of low-dose hormone therapy in managing menopausal symptoms [^1148hZgH]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Use of the lowest clinically effective dose of postmenopausal hormone therapy aligns with recommendations and good clinical practice. Although accumulating evidence demonstrates the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose hormone therapy, data about their use are limited by a lack of long-term randomized studies. This review evaluates evidence on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these preparations and their role in menopausal management.

### The effect of transdermal estrogen patch use on cardiovascular outcomes: A systematic review [^114nnnff]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms are the most commonly reported menopausal symptoms. Hormone therapy has been widely used to relieve postmenopausal symptoms. With studies suggesting an increased risk of cardiovascular events and breast cancer with oral hormone therapy use, there has been reluctance to use it. The transdermal estrogen patch provides relief from menopausal symptoms; however, there are limited data on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes while on the transdermal estrogen patch.

- **Methods**: An extensive search in Cochrane and PubMed databases was conducted up to February 2016. The selection criteria included healthy, peri-, and postmenopausal women between the ages of 50 and 79 who should have received transdermal estrogen therapy. The relationship between estrogen patch use and cardiovascular outcomes was analyzed. Six articles met the criteria and were included.

- **Results**: We found some evidence suggestive of protective cardiovascular effects with transdermal estrogen therapy, with a decrease in the risk of stroke and no increase in the risk of coronary heart disease, death, or myocardial infarction.

- **Discussion**: This is one of the first systematic reviews addressing the association of transdermal estrogen patch use on cardiovascular outcomes. We found some evidence suggestive of a possible protective cardiovascular effect with transdermal estrogen therapy. Further randomized controlled studies are needed with a longer duration of follow-up to study the cardiovascular effects of transdermal estrogen patches.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: Women's and physicians' opinions [^111KJUAY]. Menopause (2024). High credibility.

Across all individual MS-TSQ items, physicians reported higher levels of satisfaction for HTs than for non-HTs or OTC therapies. Specifically, the percentage of physicians who responded with "extremely satisfied" or "satisfied" to the "overall satisfaction" question ranged from 88.3% to 91.0% for HTs, 34.4% to 61.5% for non-HTs, and 24.5% to 36.0% for OTC therapies. Detailed results for individual MS-TSQ items for physicians can be found in supplemental digital content tables S4, S5, and S6.

- **Unmet needs**: The most commonly reported VMS treatment need among women and physicians was the improvement of hot flashes and night sweats. Women most often reported "lack of effectiveness" (41.1%) and "lack of improvement in quality of life" (26.7%) as features of treatments that do not meet their expectations. In contrast, physicians reported "long-term safety concerns" (56.5%), "lack of effectiveness", and "not covered by insurance" (both 44.0%) as not meeting their expectations.

Figure: Unmet needs among women with moderate to severe VMS and among physicians who treat women with VMS.

This figure illustrates multiple responses, so counts and percentages may not sum to the total N or 100%. It included concerns such as insufficient control of hot flashes and/or night sweats, and other issues like "patches irritate sensitive skin", "not much improvement to sex life or libido", and difficulties for individuals unable to take hormones due to breast cancer. One notable concern for physicians is the side effects, such as weight gain.

### Nonpharmacological therapies for the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms in breast cancer survivors [^111TzyZf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Breast cancer affects millions of women worldwide, and for many, therapy results in treatment-induced menopause. Menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors are often more severe, frequent, and of greater duration compared with natural menopause. Hot flushes and night sweats pose a significant burden for many women, with limited therapeutic options as menopausal hormone therapy is contraindicated. Guidelines recommend non-hormonal pharmacological agents, including clonidine, gabapentin, and some antidepressants. However, some women may be reluctant to use medications due to concerns about side effects. The aim of this narrative review was to appraise recent evidence for nonpharmacological treatments for vasomotor symptoms in breast cancer survivors, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, hypnosis, yoga, mindfulness, acupuncture, and lifestyle changes.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted. Studies were included if they were randomized and involved breast cancer survivors and nonpharmacological treatments for menopausal vasomotor symptoms.

- **Results**: Twelve studies met the criteria, and three studies of exercise in healthy menopausal women were included. Cognitive-behavioral therapy reduces menopausal symptoms and perceived impact of hot flushes and night sweats in breast cancer survivors and is cost-effective. The efficacy of hypnosis as a treatment for menopausal vasomotor symptoms in women with breast cancer is supported by two randomized controlled trials. Yoga and acupuncture may reduce vasomotor symptom frequency and/or burden. Studies of exercise as an intervention are continuing to be evaluated.

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant for moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy: phase 3b randomised controlled trial [^113zLvzV]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

Fezolinetant, an oral, non-hormonal, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist, is a treatment option for moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms, and it is approved in many countries, including the US, Europe, and Australia, at a dose of 45 mg once daily. Fezolinetant blocks neurokinin B signalling, normalising kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin neuron activity in the thermoregulatory centre of the brain to reduce the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms. Fezolinetant was shown to be efficacious and well tolerated for treating moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in phase 3 studies SKYLIGHT 1 and SKYLIGHT 2, which both included a 12-week placebo-controlled period followed by active treatment extension to 52 weeks.

To further investigate the clinical benefits of fezolinetant for the treatment of moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms, we performed a phase 3b trial (DAYLIGHT), which included a 24-week placebo-controlled period and enrolled a population considered unsuitable for hormone therapy.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for menopause, and more specifically with respect to alternative medicine, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend counseling females seeking relief from vasomotor symptoms with over-the-counter or complementary medicine therapies. They highlight the lack of consistent evidence for the benefit of botanicals, black cohosh, omega-3 fatty acids, red clover, vitamin E, and mind/body alternatives. These include anxiety control, acupuncture, paced breathing, and hypnosis.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: Women's and physicians' opinions [^112PEDUP]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

Menopause refers to the cessation of ovarian function and 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea, with the typical age at onset between 49 and 52 years (median age is 51 years). Demographic and environmental factors, such as race, ethnicity, and personal lifestyle, can, however, modify the age at onset.

Over approximately two years (range: 1–3 years), hormonal fluctuations and changes in the menstrual pattern occur. During this time, women may experience a variety of symptoms, including disturbances in sleep, cognition, sexual functioning, and vulvovaginal, psychological, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Primarily characterized by hot flashes and night sweats, VMS affect up to 80% of women during menopause and may persist for up to 7 to 10 years. Previous studies have linked VMS to reductions in health-related quality of life and economic burden on women. VMS have also been associated with negative effects on women's quality of life, including poor self-reported sleep, fatigue, anxiety, and depression, resulting in social isolation and embarrassment, disrupted relationships, reduced work productivity, and an inability to carry out day-to-day activities.

Women have sought relief from VMS using hormone therapies (HTs), nonhormone therapies (non-HTs), and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments. HTs, which include estrogen, estrogen derivatives, and combination therapies with estrogen, have been the gold standard for women experiencing VMS. Progestogens, a general category that includes synthetic progestins and progesterone, are commonly coadministered with estrogen.

### Q-122 as a novel, non-hormonal, oral treatment for vasomotor symptoms in women taking tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor after breast cancer: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115Sg9W7]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats, are experienced by more than two-thirds of women with breast cancer taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy. Safe and effective treatments are lacking. Q-122 is a novel, non-hormonal compound that has shown promise for reducing vasomotor symptoms by modulation of oestrogen-responsive neurons in the hypothalamus. The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of Q-122 in women with breast cancer who are taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy and experiencing vasomotor symptoms.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept, phase 2 trial at 18 sites in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Eligible participants were women aged 18–70 years, taking a stable dose of tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor following breast cancer and experiencing at least 50 self-reported moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per week. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web response system to receive oral Q-122 100 mg or an identical placebo, twice daily for 28 days. Randomisation was stratified by BMI (≤ 30 kg/m² or > 30 kg/m²) and use of any of the following: a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, gabapentin, or pregabalin. Q-122 and placebo capsules were identical in appearance and labeled containers were identical. During the double-blind treatment and analysis phases, the participants, investigators, clinical research organisation staff, and sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean percentage of…

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: Women's and physicians' opinions [^117MSxWY]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

For women, treatment satisfaction was similarly low across all treatment classes. Physicians were more satisfied with hormone therapy (HT) and less satisfied with non-HT and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments. Women were primarily concerned with lack of effectiveness, while physicians were primarily concerned with long-term safety. Given the overall dissatisfaction with treatments among all participants, the majority of women and physicians would consider switching to a potential non-HT treatment that addresses their concerns. The results of this study highlight an unmet need among women and physicians for access to safer and more effective treatments for vasomotor symptoms (VMS).

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of The North American Menopause Society [^116nS9ZE]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

To update the evidence-based Nonhormonal Management of Menopause-Associated Vasomotor Symptoms: 2015 Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society, an advisory panel of clinicians and research experts in women's health reviewed and evaluated the literature published since the 2015 statement. Topics were divided into five sections for ease of review: lifestyle; mind-body techniques; prescription therapies; dietary supplements; and acupuncture, other treatments, and technologies.

The panel assessed the most available literature to determine whether to recommend or not recommend use, based on these levels of evidence:

- **Level I**: Good and consistent scientific evidence
- **Level II**: Limited or inconsistent scientific evidence
- **Level III**: Consensus and expert opinion

The evidence-based review of the literature resulted in several nonhormonal options for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms.

- **Recommended**:
	- **With Level I evidence**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, clinical hypnosis, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, fezolinetant
	- **With Levels I-II evidence**: Oxybutynin
	- **With Levels II-III evidence**: Weight loss, stellate ganglion block

- **Not recommended**:
	- **With Level I evidence**: Paced respiration
	- **With Levels I-II evidence**: Supplements/herbal remedies
	- **Other treatments**:
		- **Lifestyle techniques**: Cooling techniques, avoiding triggers, exercise
		- **Mind-body techniques**: Yoga, mindfulness-based intervention, relaxation
		- **Medications and substances**: Suvorexant, cannabidiol
		- **Dietary**: Soy foods and soy extracts, soy metabolite equol, wild yam

### Assessing risks and benefits of nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^115i9f2p]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), which include hot flushes and night sweats, are the most common menopausal complaints for which women seek treatment. Several therapies can be considered to help manage these complaints. The objective of this review is to assess the risks and benefits of available and emerging therapeutic options for the management of menopausal VMS.

- **Methods**: A review of the literature was conducted based on relevant publications identified through a PubMed search for clinical trials of agents used in the treatment of VMS.

- **Results**: Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment available; however, there will always be a need for nonhormonal options. Evidence does not support the efficacy of alternative or over-the-counter products, such as phytoestrogens and black cohosh, and their long-term safety is largely unknown. There is evidence supporting the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for VMS management from clinical trials of paroxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine. Gabapentin appears to be effective, but the doses required may cause poor tolerability and reduced patient adherence. Data also suggest that clonidine has a modest effect at the expense of considerable adverse effects.

- **Conclusions**: Choosing an appropriate treatment approach for the management of VMS requires careful assessment of the risk-benefit ratio of each alternative, as well as individual patient preference.

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^113fDms3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

- **Measures of treatment effect**: For continuous data, we will calculate the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups where all studies report the outcome in the same way (e.g. HDL cholesterol). If the same outcome is reported on different scales (e.g. quality of life), we will calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD). We will reverse the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We plan to treat ordinal data as continuous data and will present the 95% confidence interval (CI) for all outcomes.

- **Dichotomous data**: For dichotomous (or categorical) data, we will use the number of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate the Mantel‐Haenszel (M‐H) risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI.

- **Combining groups**: If a study presents two groups receiving two versions of the same intervention (e.g. two different doses), we will combine the effect measures to avoid loss of information and increase the precision of the effect measure.

- **Data availability**: In cases where studies do not report data in sufficient detail for the calculation of mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs), we will contact the corresponding author of the study to request the required data (e.g. the mean score for each group, associated standard deviation of the mean for each group, and the number of people in each group). If standard deviations (SDs) are not presented in the study reports and cannot be obtained from the study authors, we will estimate the SD of other related variables, for example, standard errors (SEs), CIs, and P (probability) values.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of fezolinetant with hormone and nonhormone therapies for treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause [^111VDPBM]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

Reduction in VMS severity was analyzed using data from six publications of comparators that employed similar definitions and calculations of severity score as those used in the two SKYLIGHT trials. Of the nine treatment regimens included in the network, tibolone 2.5 mg was the only hormone therapy (HT) regimen. Non-HT regimens included desvenlafaxine 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg, as well as gabapentin ER 1800 mg, in addition to fezolinetant 30 mg and 45 mg. Placebo comprised the ninth regimen. A high degree of heterogeneity was observed for pairwise comparisons of placebo versus desvenlafaxine 150 mg in two trials (Q statistic = 4.47 [1 df], P = 0.034; I² = 78% [95% CI = 0.02–0.95]) and desvenlafaxine 100 mg versus desvenlafaxine 150 mg in two trials (Q statistic = 7.89 [1 df], P = 0.005; I² = 87% [95% CI = 0.51–0.97]).

In pairwise treatment comparisons, fezolinetant 45 mg was significantly less effective at reducing VMS severity than tibolone 2.5 mg and significantly more effective at reducing VMS severity than desvenlafaxine 50 mg and placebo in the fixed-effect model. Both fezolinetant doses and all comparator regimens, except desvenlafaxine 50 mg, significantly reduced VMS severity compared with placebo.

- **Change from baseline**: In severity of moderate to severe VMS versus placebo and fezolinetant 45 mg at 12 weeks, there was a high degree of heterogeneity among trials comparing desvenlafaxine 150 mg with either placebo (in two trials) or desvenlafaxine 100 mg (in two trials).

### ESHRE guideline: Endometriosis [^115aFrpe]. Human reproduction open (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for endometriosis, particularly in postmenopausal patients, the ESHRE 2022 guidelines recommend avoiding estrogen-only regimens for treating vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal patients with a history of endometriosis. These regimens may be associated with a higher risk of malignant transformation.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of fezolinetant with hormone and nonhormone therapies for treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause [^112n4BAr]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

Fezolinetant is a selective neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist that blocks neurokinin B binding on kisspeptin-neurokinin B-dynorphin neurons, thereby directly moderating neuronal activity in the thermoregulatory center and suppressing vasomotor symptoms (VMS).

- **Potential clinical value**: The absence of direct comparisons of fezolinetant with hormone therapy (HT) and other non-HT regimens limits understanding of the efficacy of fezolinetant relative to treatments. Such trials remain of interest, either as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or real-world evidence generation, which would provide robust data and valuable insights. In the meantime, evidence from a network meta-analysis (NMA) such as this one can provide valuable information to aid healthcare providers and patients in clinical decision making. The indirect evidence suggests that the effect of fezolinetant on VMS frequency is not significantly different from that of any HT regimen studied. The data also suggest that fezolinetant represents the most effective non-HT option for women who have contraindications for HT or wish not to use HT for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause.

### Bioidentical hormones for women with vasomotor symptoms [^1152kigv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Various hormone therapies (HT) are available to treat menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Bioidentical hormones are chemically identical to those produced by the human body, and several types are well-tested and available on prescription. Many women have opted for bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) on the assumption that it is safer than other forms of HT. We evaluated the evidence.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of bioidentical hormones compared to placebo or non-bioidentical hormones for the relief of vasomotor symptoms.

- **Search methods**: In July 2015, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), registers of ongoing trials, and the reference lists of articles retrieved.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) versus placebo or non-bioidentical hormones.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcome was vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats). We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria (GRADE).

- **Main results**: We included 23 RCTs (5,779 participants). Most studies (20/23) included only women with moderate to severe hot flushes. All studies compared unopposed 17 beta-estradiol (beta-estradiol) versus placebo or conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). None of the studies reported night sweats as a separate outcome.

### Managing menopausal symptoms: Common questions and answers [^116waCcN]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Menopausal symptoms are widespread and significantly impact quality of life. Common symptoms of menopause include vasomotor issues, such as hot flashes and night sweats, and genitourinary problems, such as vulvovaginal irritation, dryness, dyspareunia, and urinary problems. Women may also experience changes in sexual function, mood, and sleep.

Estrogen-containing hormone therapy is an effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms. Nonhormonal medications for vasomotor symptoms include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentin. It is important to note that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should not be administered to women taking tamoxifen.

- **Cognitive behavior therapy**: Effective for the short-term reduction of vasomotor symptoms and associated sleep disturbances.
- **Clinical hypnosis**: Effective in the short term for vasomotor symptoms.
Data are lacking to support the effectiveness of other nonpharmacologic treatments, such as herbal or botanical supplements, exercise, and acupuncture.

Hormone-free vaginal moisturizers are noninferior to estrogen-based therapies for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Other treatment options for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with menopause include ospemifene and intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone.

Management of menopausal symptoms should involve shared decision-making that is informed by the best available evidence and individual risks and preferences.

### Global cross-sectional survey of women with vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause: Prevalence and quality of life burden [^115ZhfxK]. Menopause (2021). Low credibility.

The majority of women in the study adopted lifestyle changes such as keeping cool, resting, relaxing, wearing loose clothing, and increasing their level of exercise. Of these, 75% were in Europe, 76% in the US, and 53% in Japan. Over half of the women who made lifestyle changes reported some improvement in hot flashes and night sweats. However, between 38% in Europe and 46% in Japan reported no change in symptoms.

Additionally, 45% of participants in Europe, 43% in the US, and 27% in Japan used over-the-counter products to cope with menopause-related symptoms. Among these, 45% in Europe, 52% in the US, and 49% in Japan reported no change in symptoms, while 35% in Europe, 30% in the US, and 34% in Japan reported slight improvements.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of fezolinetant with hormone and nonhormone therapies for treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause [^116VKm8X]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

In the absence of head-to-head clinical trial data, this network meta-analysis (NMA) of phase 3 and 4 randomized, controlled trials provides a suitable option to assess the efficacy of fezolinetant compared with other prescribed hormone therapies (HT) and non-hormone therapies (non-HT). Such analyses are of particular significance whenever a first-in-class alternative treatment option becomes available. Although data on estrogen therapy (ET), estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT), or conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene (CE/BZA) regimens were not evaluable for reducing vasomotor symptoms (VMS) severity, fezolinetant 45 mg and approved regimens of those treatments did not differ significantly in reducing VMS frequency. Tibolone 2.5 mg, an HT regimen widely available outside of the United States, may be more effective than fezolinetant 45 mg in reducing severity but not frequency of moderate to severe VMS.

Based on indirect comparisons in the NMA, fezolinetant 45 mg once daily was significantly more effective in reducing the frequency of moderate to severe VMS than available non-HT options. For reduction in VMS severity, fezolinetant 45 mg was significantly more effective than desvenlafaxine 50 mg but not higher doses of desvenlafaxine or gabapentin ER 1800 mg.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116n48UV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, and specifically with respect to the management of cardiovascular risks, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of non-hormonal therapies, rather than hormone therapy, as first-line treatment for bothersome vasomotor symptoms in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Health related quality of life after combined hormone replacement therapy: Randomised controlled trial [^115KrovM]. BMJ (2008). High credibility.

The results of the WISDOM trial are clinically relevant for doctors treating postmenopausal women with symptoms including vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance, and aching joints and muscles. When women start combined HRT many years after menopause, they must balance the risk of increased cardiac events, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer against possible benefits on health-related quality of life. They must also consider possible early side effects of combined HRT, such as breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, and uterine bleeding, which usually resolve with time or dose titration. These side effects are common hyperoestrogenic symptoms and might reflect the fixed-dose regimen in this trial, which was relatively high for women aged over 60.

These results should be interpreted with caution, as the presence of statistical significance does not imply clinical significance. Differences between treatments for most of the health-related quality-of-life measures in this study were small, except for improvements related to vasomotor symptoms, and most measures were not affected by combined HRT. Conversely, because WISDOM and previous randomised controlled trials, such as the Women's Health Initiative and the Heart and Oestrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), included women well past menopause who were mainly asymptomatic, the results of these trials are likely to underestimate the positive effects of combined HRT on health-related quality of life for women with symptoms.

### Vasomotor symptoms in menopause: Physiologic condition and central nervous system approaches to treatment [^116RTwcZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

The decline in concentrations of gonadal hormones during menopause gives rise to a range of physiologic and psychologic changes that may impact a woman's health and quality of life significantly. Most notable among these are vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) and mood and sleep disturbances.

This article reviews the physiologic condition underlying menopausal vasomotor symptoms and centrally active, nonhormonal therapies that have demonstrated efficacy for their treatment. Despite the emergence of a range of nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms, a need still exists for safe and effective therapeutic options that directly target the underlying thermoregulatory mechanisms for women who want treatment but prefer to avoid hormone therapy or for whom hormone therapy is contraindicated.

The availability of centrally active therapies for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, with risks and benefits clearly defined by results from well-designed clinical trials, has the potential to allay safety concerns that are associated with the treatment of these common symptoms.

### What happens after menopause? (WHAM): A prospective controlled study of vasomotor symptoms and menopause-related quality of life 24 months after premenopausal risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) [^1172AqLm]. Gynecologic Oncology (2024). High credibility.

To measure vasomotor symptoms and menopause-related quality of life up to 24 months after RRSO, and the effects of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), a prospective observational study was conducted. The study included 104 premenopausal women at elevated risk of ovarian cancer planning RRSO and age-matched comparators (n = 102) who retained their ovaries. Vasomotor symptoms and quality of life were measured using the Menopause-specific QoL Intervention (MENQOL-I) scale. Changes in quality of life were examined using a population-averaged linear regression model. The study was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12615000082505.

At 24 months after RRSO, the prevalence of vasomotor symptoms increased from 6% at baseline to 59%, and night sweats increased from 21% to 39%. There was a clinically and statistically significant difference of 1.14 points in the MENQOL score (95% CI 0.71, 1.57, p < 0.001) in the change from baseline to 24 months in vasomotor symptoms between the RRSO and comparison groups. Following RRSO, 61% of participants started MHT, with most (79%) initiating it within 3 months. At 24 months, 54% of MHT users reported vasomotor symptoms, with approximately half (52%) categorizing these as "mild". Among non-MHT users, 88% reported vasomotor symptoms at 24 months, with 72% classifying them as "mild". Menopause-related quality of life decreased after RRSO but remained stable in comparators, with higher quality of life scores in MHT users compared to non-users.

Vasomotor symptoms peaked by 3 months after RRSO and remained stable over 24 months. MHT was found to mitigate, but not fully resolve, these symptoms.

### A cost-effectiveness evaluation of two continuous-combined hormone therapies for the management of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms [^113ffXg5]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

After the release of the results of the Women's Health Initiative, an emerging consensus suggests that continuous-combined hormone therapy (CCHT) should be limited to short-term management of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms. This raises the important question of the economic value, if any, of short-term CCHT for this indication. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing a 1-year treatment course with 1 mg of norethindrone acetate/5 microg of ethinyl estradiol (1/5 NA/EE) or 0.625 mg/day of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone (0.625/2.5 CEE/MPA) compared with no therapy for the management of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms.

- **Design**: A literature-based Markov model was developed to compare these three options' cost and quality-of-life (QOL) benefits. The impact of therapy on vasomotor symptoms and breakthrough bleeding/spotting on the direct costs of care and QOL were considered.

- **Results**: Compared with no therapy, CCHTs resulted in net increases in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained (0.110 for 1/5 NA/NE vs. 0.104 for 0.625/2.5 CEE/MPA). Net costs (versus no therapy) were $167 lower for 1/5 NA/NE compared with 0.625/2.5 CEE/MPA. Cost per QALY gained (compared with no therapy) were $6,200 and $8,200, respectively. Cost-effectiveness was most favorable for individuals with more severe symptoms who were less bothered by breakthrough bleeding/spotting.

- **Conclusions**: A short-term course of CCHT for the sole purpose of managing moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms is cost-effective; however, 1/5 NA/NE seemed to be more favorable.

### A review of transdermal nonpatch estrogen therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms [^116kZt3P]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

During the transition into menopause, women may experience a wide range of symptoms that negatively impact quality of life. The vasomotor symptoms (VMS) of hot flushes and night sweats are common and vary widely in frequency and severity. The treatment of menopause-associated VMS is a frequently encountered clinical challenge, with the goal of tailoring treatment for each individual woman's needs.

Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal VMS. Guidelines suggest prescribing estrogen therapy at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time. Transdermal estrogen therapy has dominated the menopause prescribing practice in Europe for decades. However, in the United States, oral estrogen therapy is most commonly prescribed.

Transdermal estrogen therapy can be prescribed at considerably lower doses than oral therapy yet has similar efficacy on the symptoms of menopause. Emerging research demonstrates transdermal estrogen, particularly 17beta-estradiol, may have the potential for fewer health risks than oral estrogen therapy. This review article discusses the spectrum of menopausal symptoms, addresses prevailing issues in the treatment of menopause, elaborates on the risks and benefits of oral and transdermal hormone therapies, and focuses on five nonpatch transdermal estradiol therapies currently available in the United States.

### Vasomotor symptom relief versus unwanted effects: Role of estrogen dosage [^114CM9dE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Recent clinical trials show that low-dose estrogen reduces the number of moderate to severe vasomotor episodes by 65%. This reduction is about midway between the 35% to 40% reduction observed with placebo and the 75% to 80% reduction observed with standard dosage. Compared with standard dosages whose effects are substantial by 4 weeks, relief with lower dosages is not maximal until 8 to 12 weeks. Women using lower dosages of estrogen experience 50% lower rates of irregular bleeding or breast tenderness compared with individuals taking standard dosages. Despite several lower dosage hormone therapy (HT) formulations being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and brought to market, their uptake by healthcare providers has been slow.

Most women who have continued HT after reports of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) were published take estrogen at the standard dosage; only a minority of these individuals report receiving guidance about switching to a lower dosage. The purpose of this review is to summarize the clinical trial data showing, on one hand, effects of various dosages of estrogen on vasomotor symptoms and, on the other hand, the effects of these same doses on troublesome adverse events, particularly vaginal bleeding or breast tenderness. It is time to reconsider the estrogen dosage recommendation on the basis of symptom benefit versus symptom nuisance. Furthermore, healthcare providers need to learn how and when to prescribe lower dosages of HT to optimize patient acceptance and continuation.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: Women's and physicians' opinions [^111iud8D]. Menopause (2024). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: Guided by the insights gleaned from the qualitative interviews, women's and physicians' questionnaires were able to obtain valuable insight into their respective perspectives on treatment options for vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Only half of the women were satisfied with treatments, with degrees of satisfaction similar across treatment classes, whereas physicians were generally satisfied with hormone therapy (HT) and dissatisfied with non-HT and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments.

	- Interestingly, the most common therapies used by women and prescribed by physicians were oral hormone monotherapy (HT), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (non-HT), and black cohosh (OTC). However, treatments with the highest satisfaction for both groups were different. For HT, the satisfaction was highest for oral hormone combination therapy. For non-HT and OTC treatments, women's satisfaction was highest for oxybutynin and dong quai, respectively, whereas physicians' satisfaction was highest for serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and herbal estrogen, respectively.

### Estrogen with and without progestin: Benefits and risks of short-term use [^115Q79XV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Estrogen therapy has been well established as an effective treatment for the relief of vasomotor symptoms. In light of recent evidence from large randomized trials showing serious risks associated with the use of estrogen treatment, recommendations for hormone therapy emphasize using the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. The purpose of this review is to examine what has been learned from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Hormone Trials and other studies about the short-term risks and benefits of estrogen use. Additionally, it examines whether short-term risks differ for women most likely to use hormone treatment, including individuals with vasomotor symptoms; women in their 50s; and women, with and without intact ovaries, who have had a hysterectomy.

During the first 1 to 2 years of use of conjugated equine estrogens alone (E-alone) or combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (E + P), women experience an elevated risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The magnitude of risk is greater for E + P than for E-alone. Fracture risk is not reduced with 1 to 2 years of use, but a fracture benefit is seen within 5 years of use. The increased risk of breast cancer does not appear until after 4 to 5 years of E + P use and was not increased with E-alone use.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of fezolinetant with hormone and nonhormone therapies for treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause [^1158Za4k]. Menopause (2024). High credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), consisting of hot flashes (also called hot flushes) and/or night sweats, affect a majority of women 40 to 64 years of age worldwide. Estrogen-based hormone therapy (HT) has historically been the standard of care for treatment of VMS due to menopause, particularly for women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause. It is, however, contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, high-grade advanced-stage endometrial cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, or venous thromboembolism. In addition, many women who are eligible for HT elect not to use it because they believe that VMS will resolve on their own or because of concerns regarding the long-term safety of HT, such as the increased risk of breast cancer, stroke, and pulmonary embolism with combined estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT).

Paroxetine 7.5 mg, a low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is approved in the United States for treatment of VMS due to menopause. Other nonhormone therapies (non-HTs) including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, and clonidine are used off-label in clinical practice. Although head-to-head trials are lacking, these non-HTs are generally perceived to have more modest efficacy than HTs, as well as adverse effects that include drowsiness/somnolence, dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, and (uncommonly) suicidal thoughts/behaviors.

Fezolinetant is a nonhormone neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist that was approved in 2023 by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of VMS due to menopause.

### Treatment of vasomotor symptoms [^115yNocP]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) related to the menopausal transition affect the majority of women and contribute to a significant quality of life burden. Incidence, duration, severity, and report of symptoms vary by race, ethnicity, and coexisting health conditions. The pathophysiology of VMS is not fully understood and is likely multifactorial, involving changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis during the menopausal transition.

Treatment approaches include lifestyle modifications and hormonal and non-hormonal therapies, including integrative and complementary medicine approaches. Systemic hormone therapy with estrogen is the most effective treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that treatment with SSRIs, SNRIs, and gabapentin is effective for many women who want to avoid hormone therapy. A shared decision approach to treatment involves consideration of risks with treatment options and discussion of patient priorities.

### Management of menopausal symptoms [^1163783f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Most menopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms, with bothersome symptoms often lasting longer than one decade. Hormone therapy (HT) represents the most effective treatment for these symptoms, with oral and transdermal estrogen formulations having comparable efficacy. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative and other recent randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of combination estrogen-progestin and estrogen-alone therapy. Absolute risks observed with HT tended to be small, especially in younger women, and neither regimen increased all-cause mortality rates.

Given the lower rates of adverse events on HT among women close to menopause onset and at lower baseline risk of cardiovascular disease, risk stratification and personalized risk assessment appear to represent a sound strategy for optimizing the benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. Systemic HT should not be arbitrarily stopped at age 65 years; instead, treatment duration should be individualized based on patients' risk profiles and personal preferences.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause represents a common condition that adversely affects the quality of life of many menopausal women. Without treatment, symptoms worsen over time. Low-dose vaginal estrogen represents a highly effective treatment for this condition. Because custom-compounded hormones have not been tested for efficacy or safety, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HT is preferred. A low-dose formulation of paroxetine mesylate currently represents the only nonhormonal medication FDA-approved to treat vasomotor symptoms.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115X9JL4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, particularly for vasomotor symptoms, the 2015 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend considering a trial of clonidine — if not contraindicated — for moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms in patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate SSRIs, SNRIs, gabapentin, or pregabalin.

### Oestrogen replacement in postmenopausal women [^1116A9rU]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal symptoms can disrupt a woman's personal and social life. Vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats, are the most common and can be treated very effectively with oestrogen-based hormone therapy. The decision to use oestrogen therapy, often termed hormone therapy (HT) or hormone replacement therapy, involves balancing the potential benefits against the potential risks.

Most agree that short-term oestrogen therapy, using the lowest effective dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate-to-severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health. Whilst effective and safe in most instances, HT is not suitable for all women or for all menopause-related symptoms, especially when alternatives are available. The role of HRT in chronic disease prevention is also discussed.

### Compounded non-FDA-approved menopausal hormone therapy prescriptions have increased: Results of a pharmacy survey [^113KpZb8]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT; see Table 1 for glossary of abbreviations), consisting of estrogen with or without a progestogen, is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats). It is often prescribed for other menopause-related issues, such as sleep disturbances, mood improvements, and quality of life enhancement; for osteoporosis prevention; and for relief of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which encompasses vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA).

Publications from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), however, reported health risks associated with MHT. As a consequence, women and providers became apprehensive about MHT, and its usage declined dramatically after 2002. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the use of any oral MHT among women aged at least 40 years declined from 22.4% in 1999 to 2002, to 11.9% in 2003 to 2004, and reached a low of 4.7% in 2009 to 2010. Data from the past decade showed a 61% decrease in prescriptions for MHT, from 93 to 36 million. Pharmacy claims data also confirm a marked decline in prescriptions written immediately after the publication of the WHI findings, with one estimate indicating a 68% decline in overall MHT prescriptions between 2001 and 2008, and another citing up to an 85% decline for estrogen–progestins between 2001 and 2005. The decline of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved MHT has slowly abated, with a very slight upturn between 2005 and 2010.

### Exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms [^11659ZDc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that many perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women will experience menopause symptoms, with hot flushes being the most common. Symptoms caused by fluctuating levels of estrogen may be alleviated by hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, there has been a marked global decline in its use due to concerns about the risks and benefits of HRT. Consequently, many women are now seeking alternatives. As large numbers of women are choosing not to take HRT, it is increasingly important to identify evidence-based lifestyle modification interventions that have the potential to reduce vasomotor menopausal symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effectiveness of any type of exercise intervention in the management of vasomotor menopausal symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

- **Search strategy**: Searches of the following electronic bibliographic databases were performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialized Trials Register; Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) (Wiley Internet interface), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CINAHL (Ovid), and SPORT Discus. Searches included dates up until March 16–24, 2010.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs in which any type of exercise intervention was compared to no treatment/control or other treatments in the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal/postmenopausal women.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Six studies were deemed eligible for inclusion.

### Lessons learned from the Women's Health Initiative trials of menopausal hormone therapy [^111kJRoE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). High credibility.

We re-evaluate the Women's Health Initiative findings and their implications for clinical practice. Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) was effective for relief of vasomotor symptoms, and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) tended to be reduced in women close to menopause compared with the increased risk in women more distant from menopause. In recently menopausal women, short-term absolute risks of stroke and venous thromboembolism were small. Estrogen plus progestin therapy, but not estrogen therapy, increased the risk of breast cancer with a suggestion of greater risk when initiated close to the menopause.

Menopausal HT increased the risk of CHD in women more than 20 years distant from menopause, particularly in women with vasomotor symptoms. It remains unknown whether the suggestive benefit for CHD in younger women will translate into benefits or harms if menopausal HT is continued into older ages. Based on Women's Health Initiative data, the use of menopausal HT for fewer than 5 years is a reasonable option for the relief of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.

The risks seen with estrogen plus progestin therapy suggest careful periodic reassessment of the ongoing therapy needs for women taking estrogen plus progestin therapy. The more favorable profile of estrogen therapy allows for individualized management with respect to duration of use when symptoms persist. For both estrogen therapy and estrogen plus progestin therapy, the baseline risk profile of the individual woman needs to be taken into account. Menopausal HT is not suitable for long-term prevention of CHD.

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant for moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy: Phase 3b randomised controlled trial [^113dziDj]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

Contraindications to hormone therapy in daily practice are important. Individuals may require counseling from their doctor or other healthcare professionals, and risk factors can complicate the treatment decision-making process. In addition to having contraindications, many individuals are cautious about or would prefer not to use hormone therapy, despite being suitable candidates for treatment. Reasons for not wanting to use treatment can include worries about side effects or long-term risks of treatment or acceptance that menopause is a transitory, self-limiting condition that does not require treatment.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved low-dose paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as the only non-hormonal alternative, which offers modest relief of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and carries a black box warning for suicidal thoughts and behavior and other side effects. Alternative non-hormonal drug options include other SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, which are prescribed for up to one-fifth of women with vasomotor symptoms. The α-adrenergic agonist clonidine and neuromodulators such as gabapentin and pregabalin are also non-hormonal options for treating vasomotor symptoms, although they are not globally approved for such management.

- **Recommendations by professional societies**:
	- The Menopause Society does not recommend clonidine owing to adverse events or pregabalin because of the potential for misuse as a schedule V controlled substance. Gabapentin includes black box warnings for rare suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Nutraceutical options are available.

### Lifestyle factors: Are they related to vasomotor symptoms and do they modify the effectiveness or side effects of hormone therapy [^1113WQji]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews and summarizes published literature to address the following questions: (1) Are lifestyle factors (alcohol use, cigarette exposure, and physical activity) and body mass index (BMI) related to the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women? (2) Do lifestyle factors or BMI modify the effectiveness or side effects of menopausal hormone therapy (HT)?

Information was culled from a nonstructured review of English-language literature. Low levels of alcohol consumption (≤ 1 drink per day for women) do not have a measurable effect on the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms; whether greater amounts of alcohol intake would promote vasomotor symptoms cannot be addressed by available literature.

Most published studies report that active cigarette smoking is positively associated with vasomotor symptoms. However, a large study found that passive (but not active) smoking (i.e. secondhand smoke exposure) was related to vasomotor symptoms. Studies at the time of writing do not support a relation between physical activity and vasomotor symptoms. However, rates of vasomotor symptom reporting were low in these studies, potentially limiting the ability to detect an effect of physical activity.

Greater BMI is a risk factor for more vasomotor symptom reporting. The scarcity of data directly addressing whether lifestyle factors or BMI modify the effects of HT precludes a substantive response to this question at present. Available literature suggests that smoking and greater body weight are risk factors for vasomotor symptoms.

### Retrospective text and qualitative analyses of patient experience and management of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: Voices from the PatientsLikeMe community [^114cztii]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

Several therapeutic options are available for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Hormone therapy (HT) can provide relief and, for many years, has been known as the most effective treatment. However, hesitance remains over the safety of HT after the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) halted a trial in 2002, concluding that the evidence of risks such as breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and blood clots with HT outweighed the benefits. Since then, questions about the WHI trial design have refuted those conclusions of increased risks associated with HT for newly menopausal women. The Menopause Society (TMS), formerly The North American Menopause Society (NAMS), currently states that the benefit-risk ratio of HT is favorable for women aged 60 years and younger and within 10 years of menopause onset.

- **Non-hormonal treatment options**: Non-HT options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and newly approved fezolinetant, a neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist.
- **Alternative treatments**: Additionally, alternative options to prescription medications include lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet, natural products, homeopathy, acupuncture, reflexology, hypnosis, cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation techniques. Reported evidence of effectiveness for clinical hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy is rated "good and consistent". However, research on the efficacy of other alternative options is limited.

Many women suffer from untreated symptoms of menopause; they do not report their symptoms to healthcare providers or do not seek treatment for various reasons.
