## Question

A 53-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of blurry vision, headache, and multiple episodes of nosebleeds over the last few weeks. During this time, she has also been itching a lot, especially after getting ready for work in the mornings. She has had an 8-kg (17.6-lb) weight loss and increasing fatigue during the past 6 months. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 158/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no lesions or evidence of trauma in the nasal cavity. Her face, palms, nail beds, oral mucosa, and conjunctiva appear red. Abdominal examination shows splenomegaly. Her hemoglobin concentration is 19 g/dL, hematocrit is 58%, platelets are 450,000/μL, and erythropoietin level is below normal. A peripheral blood smear shows RBC precursor cells. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?
A. Mutated JAK2 gene
B. Increased intracranial pressure
C. Megakaryocyte proliferation
D. Renal cell carcinoma

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best explains the underlying cause of this patient's erythrocytosis and related findings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the laboratory pattern fits primary versus secondary erythrocytosis. Then, I should verify which diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera are met. Next, I will examine the molecular pathogenesis and decide which answer choice corresponds to the root cause. After that, I need to consider and exclude plausible alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely underlying cause and briefly note management implications to ensure internal consistency with guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical-laboratory pattern. The patient has marked erythrocytosis with hemoglobin 19 g/dL and hematocrit 58%, accompanied by thrombocytosis, splenomegaly, aquagenic pruritus, headaches, visual disturbances, and weight loss. Crucially, the erythropoietin level is subnormal, which is a strong clue to clonal primary erythrocytosis rather than a secondary, EPO-driven process [^114NpGUc] [^1146mnWB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify whether this fits the WHO/ICC diagnostic framework for polycythemia vera. The 2016 WHO criteria require either all three major criteria or the first two major plus the minor criterion: sustained elevation of hemoglobin or hematocrit, a JAK2 mutation, and characteristic bone marrow morphology; the minor criterion is a subnormal serum EPO. The reported hemoglobin/hematocrit exceed female thresholds, the EPO is low, and while I initially assumed the bone marrow morphology is not provided, the presence of erythroid precursor cells on smear with trilineage myeloproliferation and splenomegaly makes marrow findings highly likely to fulfill the morphology major criterion, so a PV diagnosis is supported; if sustained absolute erythrocytosis is extreme, the marrow criterion may even be waived when the mutation and low EPO are present, but here the combination is sufficient to conclude PV by WHO criteria [^114NpGUc] [^116Qmrva].

> I will now examine the molecular pathogenesis to identify the root cause. More than 95% of patients with PV harbor a JAK2 mutation, most commonly JAK2 V617F in exon 14, with a smaller proportion having JAK2 exon 12 mutations. These mutations drive constitutive JAK-STAT signaling and confer EPO-independent erythroid proliferation with suppressed EPO, which mechanistically explains the laboratory phenotype and supports "mutated JAK2 gene" as the underlying cause in this case [^1146mnWB] [^115r9RsN] [^112puSuY].

> Wait, let me verify the key alternatives so I don't anchor prematurely. Option B, increased intracranial pressure, can cause headache and visual symptoms, but it does not explain erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, splenomegaly, or low EPO; Option C, megakaryocyte proliferation, is a descriptive feature of MPNs rather than a fundamental cause and is less specific; Option D, renal cell carcinoma, can cause secondary erythrocytosis via tumor EPO production, but in that scenario EPO would be elevated or inappropriately normal, not subnormal as here, making RCC an unlikely cause of this clonal, EPO-suppressed erythrocytosis [^113F3KVi].

> But wait, what if this were essential thrombocythemia masquerading as PV? I should double-check: ET lacks diagnostic erythrocytosis and would not meet the hemoglobin/hematocrit thresholds for PV, whereas this patient clearly exceeds them; the combination of marked erythrocytosis with low EPO strongly points to PV rather than ET, despite overlapping JAK2 positivity across MPNs [^1146mnWB] [^115r9RsN].

> Synthesis and conclusion: The constellation of absolute erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, splenomegaly, aquagenic pruritus, microvascular symptoms, and subnormal EPO, together with the near-universal association of PV with JAK2 mutations, establishes that the most likely underlying cause is a mutated JAK2 gene driving clonal myeloproliferation. This is the root pathobiologic mechanism that distinguishes PV from secondary erythrocytosis and explains the clinical phenotype seen here [^114NpGUc] [^1146mnWB].

> Let me briefly confirm management implications to ensure clinical coherence. Standard-of-care includes low-dose aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit less than 45% to reduce thrombotic risk; cytoreductive therapy is indicated for high-risk patients or those with uncontrolled counts or symptoms, with interferon-based therapy, including ropeginterferon, or hydroxyurea as options, aligning with NCCN and contemporary reviews; these management anchors further reinforce the diagnostic conclusion of PV in this case [^114Zh71h] [^1146mnWB].

The most likely underlying cause is **mutated JAK2 gene** (option A), as the patient's erythrocytosis with low EPO, thrombocytosis, splenomegaly, and RBC precursors on smear are classic for polycythemia vera [^1146mnWB], which is driven by JAK2 mutations in > 95% of cases [^114rvpYF]. Increased intracranial pressure (B) does not explain erythrocytosis, megakaryocyte proliferation (C) is a feature, not a cause, and renal cell carcinoma (D) would cause secondary erythrocytosis with high EPO, not low [^112puSuY].

---

## Clinical features supporting polycythemia vera

- **Erythrocytosis**: Hemoglobin 19 g/dL and hematocrit 58% exceed WHO thresholds for women (> 16.0 g/dL; > 48%) [^114NpGUc] and indicate true erythrocytosis [^114NpGUc].

- **Low EPO**: Subnormal EPO distinguishes primary (clonal) from secondary erythrocytosis [^1172nQUo] [^1177Jv8R].

- **Thrombocytosis**: Platelets 450,000/μL is common in PV and supports myeloproliferation [^114rvpYF] [^1146mnWB].

- **Splenomegaly**: Present in ~36% of PV and reflects extramedullary hematopoiesis [^1146mnWB].

- **Constitutional symptoms**: Weight loss, fatigue, and pruritus are common in PV [^1115U1dD] [^113toCuR].

- **RBC precursors on smear**: Nucleated RBCs reflect erythroid hyperplasia and extramedullary hematopoiesis [^notfound].

---

## Molecular pathogenesis of polycythemia vera

- **JAK2 mutations**: Present in > 95% of PV, most commonly V617F, with exon 12 variants in the remainder [^1146mnWB] [^116vBGTV].

- **JAK-STAT signaling**: Constitutive activation drives erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic proliferation and survival [^115Sr2Xq] [^112YmPuo].

- **EPO independence**: Mutant JAK2 renders erythropoiesis EPO-independent, causing erythrocytosis with low EPO [^116vBGTV].

## Diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Major criterion 1 | Hemoglobin > 16.0 g/dL (women) or hematocrit > 48% (women) [^114NpGUc] [^112YmPuo] |
| Major criterion 2 | Bone marrow showing age-adjusted hypercellularity with trilineage proliferation and pleomorphic megakaryocytes [^114NpGUc] [^112YmPuo] |
| Major criterion 3 | Presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation [^114NpGUc] [^112YmPuo] |
| Minor criterion | Subnormal serum erythropoietin level [^114NpGUc] [^112YmPuo] |

---

Diagnosis requires either **all three major criteria** or the first two major criteria plus the minor criterion [^114NpGUc] [^112YmPuo]. This patient meets major criterion 1 (hemoglobin 19 g/dL), likely major criterion 2 (RBC precursors and splenomegaly), and the minor criterion (low EPO); JAK2 testing is expected to be positive, completing the diagnosis [^1146mnWB] [^112YmPuo].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other options

- **Increased intracranial pressure (B)**: Does not explain erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, or low EPO; incompatible with PV.

- **Megakaryocyte proliferation (C)**: A pathological feature, not a causal mechanism; does not explain erythrocytosis or low EPO [^114NpGUc] [^112YmPuo].

- **Renal cell carcinoma (D)**: Causes secondary erythrocytosis via EPO excess; EPO would be high, not low, making this inconsistent with the presentation [^113F3KVi] [^112qK5wp].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's erythrocytosis with low EPO, thrombocytosis, splenomegaly, and RBC precursors is most consistent with **polycythemia vera**, which is driven by **JAK2 mutations** in > 95% of cases [^1146mnWB] [^1115U1dD]. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is **mutated JAK2 gene** (option A).

Results

Presenting features

Table 1 provides all-inclusive and gender-stratified information on clinical and laboratory features at the time of diagnosis. Median age was 61 years (10% were below age 40 years) and gender distribution was close to 1:1. Palpable splenomegaly, pruritus and vasomotor symptoms were each expressed by about a third of the patients. Venous thrombosis (9.3% vs 5.4% P < 0.01) and thrombocytosis (60% vs 45.4% P < 0.01) were more frequent in women and arterial thrombosis (18% vs 14% P = 0.02) and palpable splenomegaly (40.3% vs 32% P < 0.01) in men. As expected, approximately 98% of the patients screened (n = 1268) were positive for either JAK2 V617F (95%) or other JAK2 mutations (3%), whereas a subnormal serum erythropoietin level or endogenous erythroid colonies were documented in 81% and 73% of those tested, respectively. Less than 20% of the patients had undergone red cell mass measurement. Abnormal karyotype at diagnosis was documented in 12% of the patients examined (n = 631) and was more frequent in men (15% vs 9% P = 0.02). Increased serum lactate dehydrogenase level and leukoerythroblastosis were, respectively, documented in 50% and 6% of patients evaluated.

The clinical calculator "WHO criteria for polycythemia vera in women" for polycythemia vera.

The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for polycythemia vera in women is a diagnostic tool designed to identify the presence of this myeloproliferative disorder. The target patient population includes women presenting with symptoms suggestive of polycythemia vera, such as fatigue, headache, dizziness, and pruritus.

The primary components of the WHO criteria include three major criteria and one minor criterion. The major criteria encompass elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, bone marrow biopsy findings indicative of hypercellularity with trilineage growth, and the presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation. The minor criterion involves a subnormal serum erythropoietin level.

The diagnostic result is determined based on the combination of these criteria. The diagnosis of polycythemia vera is confirmed if all three major criteria are met or if the first two major criteria and the minor criterion are met. If these combinations are not fulfilled, the diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera are not met.

The WHO criteria for polycythemia vera in women provides a structured approach to diagnosis, facilitating early detection and treatment of this condition.

The process determines if the diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera in women, based on WHO guidelines, are met. This involves analyzing both major and minor clinical indicators.

Major criteria encompass:

- Elevated hemoglobin levels greater than 16 g/dL, or a hematocrit exceeding 48%, or a notable increase in red blood cell mass
- A bone marrow biopsy indicating hypercellularity relative to age, showing increased activity across three hematopoietic lineages, including significant erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic proliferation, with diverse, fully mature megakaryocytes
- The presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation

The minor criterion involves a subnormal serum erythropoietin level.

To determine if the conditions for diagnosis are satisfied, the following procedure is used:

1. For the major criteria:

- Condition A is established if hemoglobin parameters meet the threshold or red blood cell mass is elevated.
- Condition B is confirmed when the bone marrow biopsy reveals specific hypercellular growth across multiple hematopoietic lineages.
- Condition C implies the detection of specific JAK2 mutations.

2. The minor criterion:

- Condition D is satisfied if there is a lower than normal level of serum erythropoietin.

Diagnosis is confirmed if:

- All three major criteria (A, B, C) are met, or
- The first two major criteria (A and B) are fulfilled, alongside the minor criterion (D).

If these combinations are fulfilled, the criteria for diagnosing polycythemia vera are considered met. If not, the criteria are not met. This approach integrates clinical assessments, bone marrow examination, and genetic testing, offering a comprehensive check to accurately establish the presence of polycythemia vera in women.

### The forgotten myeloproliferative disorder: myeloid metaplasia [^117RK9Jw]. The Oncologist (2003). Low credibility.

Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia is a hematologic disorder currently classified with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia as a chronic myeloproliferative disease. The median age at diagnosis is 60 years, and more than 90% of patients are diagnosed after age 40 years. Clinical manifestations include massive splenomegaly, progressive anemia, profound constitutional symptoms, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The diagnosis is confirmed by bone marrow examination after other causes of myelofibrosis are ruled out. Median survival is 5 years and causes of death include leukemic transformation. Prognosis is adversely affected by the presence of anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dl), leukopenia or leukocytosis (white blood cells > 30,000/ micro l), circulating blasts, and hypercatabolic symptoms. Conventional treatment is palliative and does not improve survival. In this regard, androgen preparations, corticosteroids, and erythropoietin are useful for the treatment of disease-associated anemia. Symptomatic splenomegaly is best managed by cytoreductive therapy or surgical removal. Radiation therapy is most useful in the treatment of nonhepatosplenic extramedullary hematopoiesis. New treatment approaches include the use of thalidomide alone or in combination with prednisone and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Rationale

Anti-erythropoietin antibody associated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a very rare cause of resistance characterised by transfusion dependency, low reticulocyte count (< 1%), lack of proerythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies. ESA induced PRCA is a very rare condition, with the overall incidence of reported cases between 1989 and June 2004 was 1.6 per 10,000 patient-years of subcutaneous exposure, and 0.02 per 10,000 patient-years of intravenous exposure. Nevertheless, most reported cases of anti-erythropoietin antibody-associated PRCA have occurred in CKD patients who have received the drug subcutaneously.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) due to anti-erythropoietin (EPO) antibodies should be suspected in an individual who has previously responded to EPO if the haemoglobin (Hb) level declines by > 20 g/l per month or the reticulocyte count is < 20,000/uL.

PRCA is specifically characterized by the following clinical features:

- A drop in Hb level of > 7 to 10 g/L per week without transfusions or transfusion requirement of at least one unit per week to maintain adequate Hb, despite continued use of ESA at high doses.

- Markedly reduced reticulocyte count (< 10,000/uL).

- Normal platelet and white blood cell count.

- Elevated serum transferrin saturation and serum ferritin.

- Rarely, allergic urticarial skin reactions at sites of earlier subcutaneous EPO injections have been described.

- The diagnosis of PRCA is established by:

- Bone marrow examination: which confirms severe hypoplasia of erythroid precursors (< 5%).

- The presence of anti-erythropoietin antibodies:

- There are several available tests to detect antibodies to erythropoietin, with varying sensitivities and specificities.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^114pAPtk]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

In total, the target HCT goal of < 45% is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular complications. However, controlling HCT has not been clearly shown to decrease symptom burden or the risk of disease progression. In fact, repeated phlebotomy may exacerbate iron deficiency-related symptoms and has been associated with worsening of disease-related symptoms such as pruritus. Furthermore, a high phlebotomy requirement (> 4 per year) is associated with increased risk of thrombosis, but whether this is due to worsening iron deficiency, other consequences of phlebotomy, or to the underlying disease remains poorly understood. High phlebotomy requirements often indicate the need for initiating cytoreductive therapy which may reverse symptoms of iron deficiency possibly by decreasing the frequency of phlebotomy.

Iron metabolism in polycythemia vera

Because anemia is the best recognized indicator of iron deficiency, the diagnosis of iron deficiency in the context of PV, and thus without anemia, requires the identification of ferritin, transferrin saturation, and MCV below the lower limit of normal. In addition, symptoms associated with iron deficiency, including fatigue, global weakness, and neuromuscular disturbances, may overlap with those of PV such that attributing symptoms to a single underlying cause may be challenging. Furthermore, glossitis, cheilosis, koilonychias, restless leg syndrome, and Pica have all been reported in PV patients, and support the diagnosis of iron deficiency in this context. Decisions regarding the management of iron deficiency in PV are complex. On one hand, it is compelling to attempt symptom relief with iron supplementation and, on the other hand, attaining iron deficiency is an intended consequence of therapeutic phlebotomy which limits the degree of erythrocytosis. Although symptoms of iron deficiency rarely result in discontinuing therapeutic phlebotomy, initiating cytoreductive therapy may be warranted to enable HCT control with less intensive phlebotomy especially since iron supplementation often leads to worsening of erythrocytosis, requiring an increase in the frequency of phlebotomies and/or the institution of cytoreductive therapy.

### Polycythemia vera [^114e6gBM]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased red blood cell mass. The resultant hyperviscosity of the blood predisposes such patients to thrombosis. Polycythemia vera should be suspected in patients with elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, splenomegaly, or portal venous thrombosis. Secondary causes of increased red blood cell mass (e.g., heavy smoking, chronic pulmonary disease, renal disease) are more common than polycythemia vera and must be excluded. Diagnosis is made using criteria developed by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group; major criteria include elevated red blood cell mass, normal oxygen saturation, and palpable splenomegaly. Untreated patients may survive for six to 18 months, whereas adequate treatment may extend life expectancy to more than 10 years. Treatment includes phlebotomy with the possible addition of myelosuppressive agents based on a risk-stratified approach. Agents under investigation include interferon alfa-2b, anagrelide, and aspirin. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended.

Event curves for overall, myelofibrosis-free, and polycythemia vera-free survival are presented in Fig. 1. While overall survival was unaffected by serum EPO levels (p = 0.41) (Fig. 1a), levels below the normal reference limit were significantly associated with superior myelofibrosis-free survival (p = 0.02)(Fig. 1b) but, conversely, inferior polycythemia vera-free survival (p = 0.03) (Fig. 1c).

Fig. 1
Comparison of overall, myelofibrosis-free, and polycythemia vera-free survival in 177 untreated patients with essential thrombocythemia stratified by serum erythropoietin (EPO) level

Serum erythropoietin has long been entrenched in the pathophysiological underpinnings and diagnostic schema of polycythemia vera and, insofar as PV and ET represent related entities in a disease continuum, serum EPO has been surprisingly understudied in the latter. Although limitations of the current study included its retrospective nature, unavailability of JAK2 allele burden data in a sufficient number of informative cases, and preclusion of endogenous erythroid colony and red cell mass testing, which were not feasible, it did endeavor to address previously unexplored, critical questions surrounding subnormal EPO levels in ET — specifically, what are their incidence and clinical significance, if any. Our observations, while requiring further validation, point to the not infrequent finding of subnormal EPO levels in ET and, furthermore, reveal a phenotypic portrait mimicking that of PV: higher hemoglobin levels and leukocyte counts, JAK2 mutational clustering, and a greater propensity towards arterial thrombosis after diagnosis. Moreover, there appears to be a significant association between subnormal EPO levels and outcomes in ET as patients with suppressed levels may have a greater likelihood of converting to PV but also, interestingly, may exhibit some protection from myelofibrotic transformation, a potentially fatal complication. Whether EPO is driving this disease variability or this simply reflects an epiphenomenon is unclear and requires further study. Regardless, the current observations provide new and meaningful insight into the phenotypic and prognostic specificity annotated by subnormal EPO levels in ET and introduce the possibility of considering serum EPO measurement in the evaluation and risk stratification of patients with ET.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: 2023 update on diagnosis and management [^113F3KVi]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

JAK2 unmutated or non-polycythemia vera (PV) erythrocytosis encompasses a heterogenous spectrum of hereditary and acquired entities.

Diagnosis

Foremost in the evaluation of erythrocytosis is the exclusion of PV through JAK2 (inclusive of exons 12–15) mutation screening. Initial assessment should also include gathering of previous records on hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, in order to streamline the diagnostic process by first distinguishing longstanding from acquired erythrocytosis; subsequent subcategorization is facilitated by serum erythropoietin (Epo) measurement, germline mutation screening, and review of historical data, including comorbid conditions and medication list. Hereditary erythrocytosis constitutes the main culprit in the context of longstanding erythrocytosis, especially when associated with a positive family history. In this regard, a subnormal serum Epo level suggests EPO receptor mutation. Otherwise, considerations include those associated with decreased (high oxygen affinity Hgb variants, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate deficiency, PIEZO1 mutations, methemoglobinemia) or normal oxygen tension at 50% Hgb saturation (P50). The latter include germline oxygen sensing pathway (HIF2A-PHD2-VHL) and other rare mutations. Acquired erythrocytosis commonly results from central (e.g., cardiopulmonary disease, high-altitude habitat) or peripheral (e.g., renal artery stenosis) hypoxia. Other noteworthy conditions associated with acquired erythrocytosis include Epo-producing tumors (e.g., renal cell carcinoma, cerebral hemangioblastoma) and drugs (e.g., testosterone, erythropoiesis stimulating agents, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors). Idiopathic erythrocytosis is an ill-defined terminology that presumes the existence of an increased Hgb/Hct level without an identifiable etiology. Such classification often lacks accounting for normal outliers and is marred by truncated diagnostic evaluation.

Management

Current consensus treatment guidelines are not supported by hard evidence and their value is further undermined by limited phenotypic characterization and unfounded concerns for thrombosis. We are of the opinion that cytoreductive therapy and indiscriminate use of phlebotomy should be avoided in the treatment of non-clonal erythrocytosis. However, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic phlebotomy if one were to demonstrate value in symptom control, with frequency determined by symptoms rather than Hct level. In addition, cardiovascular risk optimization and low dose aspirin is often advised.

Future Directions

Advances in molecular hematology might result in better characterization of "idiopathic erythrocytosis" and expansion of the repertoire for germline mutations in hereditary erythrocytosis. Prospective controlled studies are needed to clarify potential pathology from JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis, as well as to document the therapeutic value of phlebotomy.

### Essential thrombocythemia: challenges in clinical practice and future prospects [^115GFHZe]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) was first described in 1934, and subsequently, progress has been made in better understanding the molecular pathogenesis and which patients may have greatest risk of progression or vascular events. However, it has been more than a decade since a new therapy has been approved for ET. We are beginning to understand more comprehensively both the heterogeneity of this disease, which is largely driven by driver mutation status, as well as the effect of disease-related symptoms, such as fatigue, on patients. In this review we provide a practical overview of diagnosis and management of ET with focus on challenging patient scenarios and some consideration of what comprehensive care might entail. Finally, we also discuss newer therapies and how these might be assessed.

### Phenotypical differences and thrombosis rates in secondary erythrocytosis versus polycythemia vera [^112jK7Y9]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Erythrocytosis is a common condition and an increasingly frequent reason for consultation in hematology. Since the inception of the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 criteria, in lowering the hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) diagnostic thresholds to 165 g/L and 49% in men, and 160 g/L and 48% in women, respectively, it has been estimated that 4.1% of unselected males (outpatients) have Hb levels exceeding these values. With only a minority of these having polycythemia vera (PV), hematologists are witnessing a new preponderance of referrals for secondary erythrocytosis (SE) which has yielded novel and significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. While the classic coupling of JAK2 –positive/subnormal serum erythropoietin (Epo) greatly increases the likelihood of PV diagnosis, those not strictly fulfilling these criteria represent a heterogeneous population for whom a systematic approach has been difficult to establish. Though efforts have been made to operationally discriminate between the various forms of erythrocytosis, data comparatively assessing SE and PV populations are scarce. These support different clinical profiles, while reports of outcomes, including thrombosis, have been inconsistent. Furthermore, little information exists on how these populations are managed in a real world setting, and it may be speculated that SE cohorts are subject either to under or over investigating and treatment. We conducted a direct comparison of clinical and laboratory features, outcomes, diagnostic workup, and treatment patterns in cohorts with SE vs WHO-defined PV.

### The JAK2 exon 12 mutations: a comprehensive review [^116vBGTV]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

A variety of acquired mutations targeting JAK2 exon 12 are present in those patients with the myeloproliferative neoplasm, polycythemia vera, that lack the more common JAK2V617F mutation. Both mutation types perturb erythropoiesis, with individuals presenting with a raised hematocrit, reduced serum erythropoietin levels, and erythropoietin-independent erythroid progenitor cells. However, there are also phenotypic differences that, until recently, precluded a significant proportion of patients with a JAK2 exon 12 mutation from receiving an appropriate diagnosis. Here, we review the literature published on the JAK2 exon 12 mutations and compare the biology associated with these mutations with that of JAK2V617F.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a disappearing entity [^1148rerc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Erythrocytosis results when there is an increased red cell mass and thus an increased hemoglobin. The causes can be divided into primary intrinsic defects of the erythroid progenitor cell and secondary defects, where factors external to the erythroid compartment are responsible. Both can then be further divided into congenital and acquired categories. Congenital causes include mutations of the erythropoietin receptor and defects of the oxygen-sensing pathway including VHL, PHD2 and HIF2A mutations. When fully investigated there remain a number of patients in whom no cause can be elucidated who are currently described as having idiopathic erythrocytosis. Investigation should start with a full history and examination. Having eliminated the common entity polycythemia vera, further direction for investigation is guided by the erythropoietin level. Clinical consequences of the various erythrocytoses are not clear, but in some groups thromboembolic events have been described in young patients. Evidence is lacking to define best management, but aspirin and venesection to a target hematocrit should be considered.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111qeCHx]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) management of bleeding — "It is essential to rule out other potential causes and treat any coexisting causes, as necessary". "Aspirin should be withheld until bleeding is under control and the use of appropriate cytoreductive therapy should be considered to optimize platelet counts while minimizing hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities". "Testing for acquired VWS (plasma VWFA measurement, von Willebrand activity) should be considered for patients with elevated platelet count undergoing surgical procedures or for those with unexplained bleeding". "In unanticipated gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of splenomegaly, portal hypertension, and gastric varices, special consultation (for endoscopic evaluation) with a hepatologist or a gastrointestinal specialist is recommended".

Regarding screening and diagnosis for polycythemia vera, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ESMO 2015 guidelines recommend to ensure accurate differentiation among the three unique myeloproliferative neoplasm subtypes as well as the exclusion of reactive conditions (in mutation-negative patients only) and disorders, such as myelodysplasia and chronic myeloid leukemia, for appropriate prognosis and treatment decision-making. Do not use the generic diagnostic label 'myeloproliferative neoplasm' alone.

### The complete evaluation of erythrocytosis: congenital and acquired [^1172nQUo]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

The approach to a patient with erythrocytosis is greatly simplified by assessing the clonality of the process upfront. In this regard, there has been a dramatic shift toward genetic testing and away from traditional tests, such as measurement of red cell mass. Clonal erythrocytosis is the diagnostic feature of polycythemia vera (PV) and is almost always associated with a JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F or exon 12). All other scenarios represent non-clonal erythrocytosis, often referred to as secondary erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (Epo) level is usually normal or elevated in secondary erythrocytosis and subnormal in PV. Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with peripheral blood JAK2 mutation analysis and serum Epo measurement to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis. Conversely, the patient with life-long erythrocytosis is more likely to suffer from congenital polycythemia and should therefore be evaluated for germline mutations that result in enhanced Epo effect (for example, Epo receptor mutations), altered intracellular oxygen sensing (for example, mutations involving the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene) or decreased P50 (for example, high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathy). The order of tests in this instance depends on the clinical scenario and serum Epo level.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^116QJQVE]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. Virtually all PV patients are iron deficient at presentation and/or during the course of their disease. The co-existence of iron deficiency and polycythemia presents a physiological disconnect. Hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism, is regulated by circulating iron levels, erythroblast secretion of erythroferrone, and inflammation. Both decreased circulating iron and increased erythroferrone levels, which occur as a consequence of erythroid hyperplasia in PV, are anticipated to suppress hepcidin and enable recovery from iron deficiency. Inflammation which accompanies PV is likely to counteract hepcidin suppression, but the relatively low serum ferritin levels observed suggest that inflammation is not a major contributor to the dysregulated iron metabolism. Furthermore, potential defects in iron absorption, aberrant hypoxia sensing and signaling, and frequency of bleeding to account for iron deficiency in PV patients have not been fully elucidated. Insufficiently suppressed hepcidin given the degree of iron deficiency in PV patients strongly suggests that disordered iron metabolism is an important component of the pathobiology of PV. Normalization of hematocrit levels using therapeutic phlebotomy is the most common approach for reducing the incidence of thrombotic complications, a therapy which exacerbates iron deficiency, contributing to a variety of non-hematological symptoms. The use of cytoreductive therapy in high-risk PV patients frequently works more effectively to reverse PV-associated symptoms in iron-deficient relative to iron-replete patients. Lastly, differences in iron-related parameters between PV patients and mice with JAK2 V617F and JAK2 exon 12 mutations suggest that specific regions in JAK2 may influence iron metabolism by nuanced changes of erythropoietin receptor signaling. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the clinical consequences of iron deficiency in PV, provide a framework for understanding the potential dysregulation of iron metabolism, and present a rationale for additional therapeutic options for iron-deficient PV patients.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2015 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification and management [^1147Xx49]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms, respectively characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis. Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombosis, bleeding, microcirculatory symptoms, pruritus, and risk of leukemic or fibrotic transformation.

Diagnosis

PV is defined by a JAK2 mutation, whose absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, makes the diagnosis unlikely. Differential diagnosis in ET includes reactive thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, and prefibrotic myelofibrosis. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), or myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutations occur in approximately 55%, 25%, and 3% of ET patients, respectively. The same molecular markers are also present in prefibrotic myelofibrosis, which needs to be morphologically distinguished from ET. Survival and leukemic/fibrotic transformation: Median survivals are ∼14 years for PV and 20 years for ET; the corresponding values for younger patients are 24 and 33 years. Life-expectancy in ET is inferior to the control population. JAK2/CALR mutational status does not affect survival in ET. Risk factors for survival in ET and PV include advanced age, leukocytosis, and thrombosis. Leukemic transformation rates at 20 years are estimated at < 10% for PV and 5% for ET; fibrotic transformation rates are slightly higher. Thrombosis risk stratification: Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of recurrent thrombosis: high-risk is defined by the presence of age > 60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors. Recent data consider JAK2V617F and cardiovascular risk factors as additional risk factors. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

The main goal of therapy in PV and ET is to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In low risk patients, this is accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin and phlebotomy (hematocrit target < 45%) in PV. In high risk (for thrombosis) patients, treatment with hydroxyurea is additionally recommended. Treatment with busulfan or interferon-α is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures and the additional value of JAK inhibitor therapy in such cases is limited. Screening for AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin, in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.

### Polycythemia vera treatment algorithm 2018 [^115r9RsN]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is currently classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system under the major category of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Although the WHO MPN category includes seven subcategories, the term "MPN" usually refers to the three JAK2 mutation-enriched clinicopathologic entities: PV, essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). PV and its sister diseases constitute stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation that is characterized by three mutually-exclusive "driver" mutations: JAK2, CALR, and MPL, with respective distribution frequency of ~99, 0, and 0% for PV, 55, 22, and 3% for ET and 65, 20 and 7% for PMF. The most frequent MPN-associated JAK2 mutation is the exon 14 JAK2 V617F, which is responsible for almost all the JAK2 mutations in ET and PMF, and 97% of those seen in PV; the remainder 3% of JAK2 mutations in PV are spread across exons 12, 13, and 14.

Diagnosis of PV often requires the presence of a JAK2 mutation, in addition to documentation of increased hemoglobin/hematocrit, to a threshold level established by the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) revised criteria (> 16.5 g/dL/49% for males and > 16 g/dL/48% for females). In addition, bone marrow morphologic assessment is encouraged, in order to distinguish PV from JAK2 -mutated ET - and obtain cytogenetic information, which has recently been shown to be prognostically relevant –. Clinical features in PV include mild-to-moderate degree of splenomegaly, mild-to-moderate degree of constitutional symptoms, including fatigue and pruritus, symptoms of hyperviscosity, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, microvascular symptoms (e.g. headaches, lightheadedness, visual disturbances, atypical chest pain, erythromelalgia, paresthesia), thrombotic and bleeding complications, and risk of leukemic transformation or fibrotic progression.

Baseline levels of erythropoietin (EPO), hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (HCT) and its variation during treatment

Figure 1.
Patient with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome-related congenital polycythemia: laboratory evaluation and response to belzutifan. Dosing and response over time in weeks for decreased red blood cells measured by hematocrit (HCT, %) and hemoglobin (Hb, g/dL), as well as initial and final erythropoietin (EPO, mIU/mL) levels.

In 2021, in a phase II trial, Jonasch et al.reported the significant efficacy and safety of belzutifan in patients with VHL disease and renal cell carcinoma with notable objective responses in RCC, CNS hemangioblastomas and pancreatic tumors. Notably, anemia was the most common adverse event, affecting 90% of patients, which reinforces the impact of belzutifan on erythropoiesis. Also, prior research in VHL R200W homozygous murine models demonstrated elevated EPO levels that decreased upon initiation of oral belzutifan, led to the reversal of polycythemia, and reduced pulmonary hypertension. In our case, the patient achieved normal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels following belzutifan treatment, with a rapid and well-tolerated response, even at a reduced dose of belzutifan. While a standard treatment for CE remains elusive, belzutifan appears to be a promising, efficient, and safe tool for the management of that condition. Prospective studies with extended follow-up are needed to evaluate clinical outcomes such as improvement of symptoms, reduction of cardiovascular events and the need for phlebotomies, and the development of treatment resistance. Furthermore, it is important to address other risk factors, such as tobacco smoking and hypertension, and maintain regular follow-up and genetic counseling due to potential associations with other conditions related to VHL syndrome.

In conclusion, this case report is the first to highlight the activity and safety of belzutifan in a patient with VHL -related polycythemia, suggesting a path for future prospective trials and discussion with global regulatory agencies.

### New pathogenic mechanisms induced by germline erythropoietin receptor mutations in primary erythrocytosis [^111RaQCh]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Identification of a new germline EPOR mutation responsible for marked erythropoietin hypersensitivity

Primary polycythemia was diagnosed in a 28-year old woman without a history of thrombosis. She had high hemoglobin concentration (21 g/dL) and hematocrit (60%) and an increased red cell mass (65%) with a low erythropoietin level (1.2 mU/mL; laboratory standard: 5–25 mU/mL). She had no splenomegaly at physical examination. Leukocyte and platelet counts in the peripheral blood as well as bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were strictly normal. Later no JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon12 mutation was found, rendering the diagnosis of polycythemia vera unlikely. The search for abnormal hemoglobin affinity and for VHL, PHD1/2, SH2B3 (LNK) pathological mutations was negative. EPOR sequencing identified a new germline heterozygous frameshift mutation, c.1300dup (p. Gln434Profs*11), which generates a new ten-amino acid C-terminal tail and a stop codon at position 444, leading to the truncation of 64 amino acids of the wild-type receptor and the loss of the six last conserved tyrosine residues (Table 1, Figure 1A, B). The mutation was found in neutrophils and CD3 + T lymphocytes as well as in non-hematopoietic tissues such as nails and hair allowing the diagnosis of PFCP to be made. There was no familial history of polycythemia. The blood counts of the mother and two children were strictly normal. The father's blood count was not available.

### Management of MPN beyond JAK2 [^111qoYsh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis has a large number of potential underlying causes, but the dominant group of hematological conditions for consideration in this setting are the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In this chapter, we consider several key linked questions relating to the management of thrombocytosis in MPNs and discuss several issues. First, we discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis, which myeloid disorders to consider, and practical approaches to the discrimination of each individual MPN from other causes. Second, there have been several major advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of these conditions and we discuss how these findings are likely to be practically applied in the future. Third, we consider whether there is evidence that thrombocytosis contributes to the complications known to be associated with MPN: thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to leukemia and myelofibrosis. Last, we review current ideas for risk stratification and management of essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera as the 2 entities within the MPN family that are most frequently associated with thrombocytosis.

The classic Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) consist of myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia and are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by an overproduction of blood cells. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for MPN were developed as a result of meetings convened by a multidisciplinary panel with expertise in MPN, with the goal of providing recommendations for the management of MPN in adults. The Guidelines include recommendations for the diagnostic workup, risk stratification, treatment, and supportive care strategies for the management of myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia. Assessment of symptoms at baseline and monitoring of symptom status during the course of treatment is recommended for all patients. This article focuses on the recommendations as outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for the diagnosis of MPN and the risk stratification, management, and supportive care relevant to MF.

### High pulmonary hypertension risk by echocardiogram shortens survival in polycythemia vera [^111eioPH]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is an insidious and progressive myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by increased red blood cell mass that is virtually always attributed to a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) driver mutation. Both the inflammatory consequences of JAK2 signaling activation and the hyperviscosity associated with erythrocytosis are mechanisms that predispose patients with PV to thrombosis. The clinical presentation of PV varies, but in addition to laboratory abnormalities; patients may have thrombosis history; cardiovascular disease; splenomegaly; and a multitude of constitutional symptoms including fatigue, early satiety, and pruritis. These symptoms overlap with many other systemic conditions and patients and their physicians often have poor insight into the cause of these symptoms, which can delay workup and treatment. Furthermore, MPNs can be complicated by pulmonary hypertension (PH), although the reported prevalence varies greatly.

PH is a progressive, morbid, and deadly condition characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressures, which, in turn, causes right heart failure, if left unchecked. PH is marked by symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope, lower extremity edema, and profound fatigue, many of which overlap with the clinical presentation of MPN. The World Health Organization (WHO) subclassifies PH according to the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. PH due to MPN is defined within WHO group 5: PH due to various chronic diseases but with poorly characterized or understood mechanisms. Furthermore, the mechanisms of PH can hemodynamically vary between precapillary, postcapillary, and combined postcapillary and precapillary PH. Experts agree that the diagnosis of PH in the setting of MPN should follow the defined PH workup algorithms including referral to, and treatment at, an expert center. When initial screening based upon history, physical, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and basic laboratory work such as a β-type natriuretic peptide raises suspicion for PH or cardiac disease, echocardiography (ECHO)-based screening is warranted, possibly followed by cardiopulmonary stress test. Patients with increased risk of PH should be referred to a PH specialized center for comprehensive PH evaluation, often including right heart catheterization (RHC). In practice, this is seldom done because the overlap in presenting syndromes of PV and PH obscures attribution of symptoms and can delay or prevent formal PH evaluation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera: a review [^1146mnWB]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an increased red blood cell mass and increased risk of thrombosis, affects approximately 65 000 people in the US, with an annual incidence of 0.5 to 4.0 cases per 100 000 persons.

Observations

Erythrocytosis (hemoglobin > 16.5 mg/dL in men or > 16.0 mg/dL in women) is a required diagnostic criterion, although thrombocytosis (53%) and leukocytosis (49%) are common. Patients may have pruritus (33%), erythromelalgia (5.3%), transient visual changes (14%), and splenomegaly (36%) with abdominal discomfort. More than 95% of patients have a JAK2 gene variant, which helps distinguish PV from secondary causes of erythrocytosis, such as tobacco smoking or sleep apnea. Among 7 cohorts (1545 individuals), the median survival from diagnosis was 14.1 to 27.6 years. Prior to or at the time of PV diagnosis, arterial thrombosis occurred in 16% of patients and 7% had venous thrombotic events, which could involve unusual sites, such as splanchnic veins. PV is also associated with an increased bleeding risk, especially in patients with acquired von Willebrand disease, which can occur with extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count, ≥ 1000×109/L). All patients with PV should receive therapeutic phlebotomy (goal hematocrit, < 45%) and low-dose aspirin (if no contraindications). Patients who are at higher risk of thrombosis include those aged 60 years or older or with a prior thrombosis. These patients and those with persistent PV symptoms may benefit from cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea or interferon to lower thrombosis risk and decrease symptoms. Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor that can alleviate pruritus and decrease splenomegaly in patients who are intolerant of or resistant to hydroxyurea. About 12.7% of patients with PV develop myelofibrosis and 6.8% develop acute myeloid leukemia.

Conclusions and Relevance

PV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by erythrocytosis and is almost universally associated with a JAK2 gene variant. PV is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, hemorrhage, myelofibrosis, and acute myeloid leukemia. To decrease the risk of thrombosis, all patients with PV should be treated with aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain a hematocrit of less than 45%. Cytoreductive therapies, such as hydroxyurea or interferon, are recommended for patients at high risk of thrombosis.

Methods

Patients

Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age, diagnosed with PV according to the World Health Organization criteria (Tefferi & Vardiman, 2008), treated with HC monotherapy for ≥ 12 weeks before enrolment, had received a stable dose of HC for ≥ 4 weeks before enrolment and had cytokine‐related symptoms defined as a score ≥ 8 (maximum, 50) on the MPN‐SAF TSS cytokine symptom cluster (TSS‐C) (Vannucchi et al, 2015). The TSS‐C is the sum of individual scores for tiredness, itching, muscle aches, night sweats and sweats while awake, each rated on a scale of 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). The requirement for TSS‐C score ≥ 8 (i.e., mean score ≥ 1·6 on each of the 5 individual components) was implemented to ensure that patients had an adequate symptom score at baseline to assess meaningful changes in the primary endpoint. The TSS clusters were identified using an empirical statistical factor analysis of baseline MPN‐SAF scores from the phase 3 RESPONSE trial (Vannucchi et al, 2015). This analysis divided the 14 individual MPN‐SAF symptoms into 3 symptom clusters independent of presumed pathophysiological mechanisms. From a clinical perspective, the 3 symptom clusters agreed well with 3 presumptive pathophysiological mechanisms associated with PV‐related symptoms (cytokines, hyperviscosity and splenomegaly). Eligible patients had ≤ 2 phlebotomies in the 6 months before screening or no palpable splenomegaly; therefore, the TSS‐C was chosen to define patient eligibility and the primary endpoint. Eligible patients also had haematocrit values between 35% and 48% before randomization; had recovered from all phlebotomy‐associated adverse events, with ≥ 1 week elapsed between the last phlebotomy and baseline; and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2 at baseline. Patients with inadequate liver or renal function, platelet count < 100 × 10 9 /l, neutrophil count < 1 × 10 9 /l, or peripheral blood blast count > 0% at screening were not eligible.

### How I treat polycythemia vera [^116UaRBV]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Since its discovery, polycythemia vera (PV) has challenged clinicians responsible for its diagnosis and management and scientists investigating its pathogenesis. As a clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder, PV is a neoplasm but its driver mutations result in overproduction of morphologically and functionally normal blood cells. PV arises in an HSC but it can present initially as isolated erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, or any combination of these together with splenomegaly or myelofibrosis, and it can take years for a true panmyelopathy to appear. PV shares the same JAK2 mutation as essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis, but erythrocytosis only occurs in PV. However, unlike secondary causes of erythrocytosis, in PV, the plasma volume is frequently expanded, masking the erythrocytosis and making diagnosis difficult if this essential fact is ignored. PV is not a monolithic disorder: female patients deregulate fewer genes and clinically behave differently than their male counterparts, while some PV patients are genetically predisposed to an aggressive clinical course. Nevertheless, based on what we have learned over the past century, most PV patients can lead long and productive lives. In this review, using clinical examples, I describe how I diagnose and manage PV in an evidence-based manner without relying on chemotherapy.

### Polycythemia vera: past, present and future [^117GbvFP]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2024). Medium credibility.

There has been remarkable progress in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for patients with polycythemia vera (PV). Historically, therapy goals in PV were to mitigate thrombotic risks and control blood counts and symptoms. There is now increased focus on disease modification through progressive attrition of JAK2 -mutant stem/progenitor cells. The approval of ropeginterferon, a novel monoPEGylated interferon, coupled with findings from LOW-PV and longer-term data from CONTINUATION-PV that strongly support a disease-modifying effect for interferon therapy, have transformed the treatment paradigm for this disorder. Results from MAJIC-PV demonstrate that disease modification can also be induced with JAK inhibitors, suggesting an urgent need to incorporate prospective molecular monitoring into PV trials. Novel agents, such as hepcidin mimetics, aim to help patients with PV restore normal hematocrit levels and become phlebotomy-free. In this review, we will summarize past, current and future approaches to PV management and highlight findings from key clinical studies.

### Patients with polycythemia vera have worst impairment of quality of life among patients with newly diagnosed myeloproliferative neoplasms [^115fXvBb]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2013). Low credibility.

The quality of life (QoL) at the time of diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) has, to date, not been studied. One hundred and seventy-nine patients with MPN: 80 with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 73 with polycythemia vera (PV), 22 with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and four with MPN undifferentiated, were included in this study. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQC30) and the MPN-Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) were used to evaluate QoL. Fatigue was the most reported symptom in these patients. Patients with PV reported significantly higher mean scores for inactivity, dizziness, cough, itching, depression and lower total QoL compared to patients with ET. Patients with PV had significantly more headache and itching compared to patients with PMF. When the newly diagnosed patients with MPN were compared with a cohort of patients with MPN with mean disease duration of 7.8 years, the differences were most striking for patients with PMF, with significantly more fatigue, abdominal discomfort, concentration problems, insomnia, fever, weight loss and lower overall QoL developed over time.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms

The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of diseases in which there is an increased proliferation of one or more subtypes of myeloid cells. Those associated with stroke are polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The Janus kinase JAK2 exon 14 V617F mutation is present in more than 95% of patients with PV and in approximately 50% of those with ET. Other mutually exclusive driver mutations are found in the genes MPL, CALR, and JAK2 exon 12. The incidence of MPN increases exponentially after the age of 60. MPN are chronic diseases with years of survival, estimated at 14 years for PV and 20 years for ET.

Thrombotic complications are frequent in MPN. A recent large study found that the 5-year risk of vascular disease ranged from 0.5 to 7.7% in patients with MPNs, with adjusted HRs which were 1.3–3.7-fold higher than in the general population Stroke can be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying MPN. In the National Inpatient Sample, a total of 552,422 hospitalizations involved patients with a diagnosis of ET, 20,650 of which were due to stroke (0.04%). Clinical hints suggesting MPN as the cause of stroke are multiple or recurrent territorial infarcts, often with large vessel occlusion. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the context of MPN are usually multiple and may be typical or atypical (isolated dysarthria, diplopia or unsteadiness, hearing loss, transient focal deficits with prominent headache, and very brief or sequential deficits). Erythromelalgia (a burning or painful sensation of the fingers, palms, and sometimes also of the toes and soles accompanied by a red-cyanotic skin discoloration of the affected areas) and splenomegaly are suggestive systemic findings. World Health Organization 2016 diagnostic laboratory criteria for PV require sustained (> 1 month) increased hemoglobin or hematocrit values (hemoglobin > 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 g/dL in women; hematocrit > 49% in men, > 48% in women) with subnormal erythropoietin levels and the absence of a secondary cause of erythrocytosis. ET sustained high platelet counts (> 450,000/µL) (> 1 month) in the absence of a secondary cause of thrombocytosis. The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in the majority of stroke patients. In half of the patients, there is an additional stroke risk factor, such as atherosclerosis, dissection, or atrial fibrillation. Female gender, atrial fibrillation, stroke, higher comorbidity score, and age 80 or more are independent predictors of mortality in stroke associated with ET.

### Updated COVID-19 vaccine (2024–2025 formulation) | ACIP… [^1154qp3u]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

In terms of benefits for adolescents and adults, the pooled vaccine effectiveness estimates from observational studies found that updated COVID-19 vaccines were associated with a lower risk of: medically-attended COVID-19; hospitalization due to COVID-19; and death due to COVID-19. In terms of harms, the available data from observational safety surveillance systems indicated that there was a rare risk of pre-specified serious adverse events, anaphylaxis, and myocarditis/pericarditis, following vaccination among both adolescents and adults, and infants and children. Results The results of the GRADE assessment were presented to ACIP on June 27, 2024. Outcomes of interest included individual benefits and harms.

Indirect effects of vaccination were not considered as part of GRADE. Benefits of interest deemed critical for all age groups were prevention of medically attended COVID-19 and prevention of hospitalization due to COVID-19. Seven observational vaccine effectiveness studies reported data on medically attended COVID-19; twelve reported data on hospitalization due to COVID-19; four reported data on death due to COVID-19; and no studies reported data on prevention of post-COVID-conditions or MIS-C. The pooled VE estimates from the five observational studies demonstrated that the updated COVID-19 vaccine reduced medically-attended COVID-19 among adults and adolescents.

Among infants and children, one study demonstrated that the updated COVID-19 vaccine reduced medically-attended COVID-19. The pooled VE against hospitalization due to COVID-19 was 44% based in 8 studies. Observational data on serious adverse events were reviewed. One analysis from VSD evaluated chart-reviewed cases of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring in a 0–7-day risk interval among persons aged 5–39 years following a booster dose of the original monovalent vaccine and a booster dose of the bivalent vaccine. The highest incidence rate following a bivalent booster dose was observed among males 30–39 years receiving the Moderna vaccine, however due to low uptake of the bivalent booster, incidence rates of myocarditis and pericarditis should be interpreted with caution.

GRADE Summary The initial GRADE evidence level was low for observational data. In terms of benefits, the observational data among adolescents and adults indicated that the vaccine reduces the risk of medically attended COVID-19, and no serious concerns impacting certainty were identified for this outcome. Observational data among adolescents and adults for hospitalization due to COVID-19 indicated a similar risk reduction with vaccination, and there were no serious concerns in the certainty assessment. Observational data on pre-specified serious adverse events demonstrated these events were rare and there were no serious concerns in the certainty assessment for adolescents and adults, however there were serious concerns due to indirectness in the certainty assessment for infants and children. The summary of evidence types is shown in Tables 5a and 5b.

WHO and ICC diagnostic criteria — polycythemia vera (PV): The diagnosis of PV requires either all 3 major criteria or the first 2 major criteria plus the minor criterion. Major criteria are elevated hemoglobin concentration (> 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 g/dL in women) or elevated hematocrit (> 49% in men, > 48% in women); bone marrow biopsy showing age-adjusted hypercellularity with trilineage proliferation (panmyelosis), including prominent erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic proliferation with pleomorphic, mature megakaryocytes (differences in size); and presence of JAK2 p.V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation. The minor criterion is subnormal serum erythropoietin level. Major criterion 2 (bone marrow biopsy) may not be required in patients with sustained absolute erythrocytosis (hemoglobin concentrations of > 18.5 g/dL in men or > 16.5 g/dL in women, or hematocrit values of > 55.5% in men or > 49.5% in women) if major criterion 3 and the minor criterion are present. In the absence of a JAK2 mutation, a higher hematocrit target (eg, 52%) could be considered in men before further investigation is required.

### Ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus standard therapy for polycythaemia vera (PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV): a randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial and its extension study [^111EKBkZ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV trials aimed to compare the novel monopegylated interferon ropeginterferon alfa-2b with hydroxyurea, the standard therapy for patients with polycythaemia vera, over 3 years of treatment.

Methods

PROUD-PV and its extension study, CONTINUATION-PV, were phase 3, randomised, controlled, open-label, trials done in 48 clinics in Europe. Patients were eligible if 18 years or older with early stage polycythaemia vera (no history of cytoreductive treatment or less than 3 years of previous hydroxyurea treatment) diagnosed by WHO's 2008 criteria. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to ropeginterferon alfa-2b (subcutaneously every 2 weeks, starting at 100 μg) or hydroxyurea (orally starting at 500 mg/day). After 1 year, patients could opt to enter the extension part of the trial, CONTINUATION-PV. The primary endpoint in PROUD-PV was non-inferiority of ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus hydroxyurea regarding complete haematological response with normal spleen size (longitudinal diameter of ≤ 12 cm for women and ≤ 13 cm for men) at 12 months; in CONTINUATION-PV, the coprimary endpoints were complete haematological response with normalisation of spleen size and with improved disease burden (ie, splenomegaly, microvascular disturbances, pruritus, and headache). We present the final results of PROUD-PV and an interim analysis at 36 months of the CONTINUATION-PV study (per statistical analysis plan). Analyses for safety and efficacy were per-protocol. The trials were registered on EudraCT, 2012–005259–18 (PROUD-PV) and 2014–001357–17 (CONTINUATION-PV, which is ongoing).

Findings

Patients were recruited from Sept 17, 2013 to March 13, 2015 with 306 enrolled. 257 patients were randomly assigned, 127 were treated in each group (three patients withdrew consent in the hydroxyurea group), and 171 rolled over to the CONTINUATION-PV trial. Median follow-up was 182·1 weeks (IQR 166·3–201·7) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 164·5 weeks (144·4–169·3) in the standard therapy group. In PROUD-PV, 26 (21%) of 122 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and 34 (28%) of 123 patients in the standard therapy group met the composite primary endpoint of complete haematological response with normal spleen size. In CONTINUATION-PV, complete haematological response with improved disease burden was met in 50 (53%) of 95 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus 28 (38%) of 74 patients in the hydroxyurea group, p = 0·044 at 36 months. Complete haematological response without the spleen criterion in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus standard therapy group were: 53 (43%) of 123 patients versus 57 (46%) of 125 patients, p = 0·63 at 12 months (PROUD-PV), and 67 (71%) of 95 patients versus 38 (51%) of 74 patients, p = 0·012 at 36 months (CONTINUATION-PV). The most frequently reported grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events were increased γ-glutamyltransferase (seven [6%] of 127 patients) and increased alanine aminotransferase (four [3%] of 127 patients) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group, and leucopenia (six [5%] of 127 patients) and thrombocytopenia (five [4%] of 127 patients) in the standard therapy group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in three (2%) of 127 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and five (4%) of 127 patients in the hydroxyurea group. One treatment-related death was reported in the standard therapy group (acute leukaemia).

Interpretation

In patients with early polycythaemia vera, who predominantly presented without splenomegaly, ropeginterferon alfa-2b was effective in inducing haematological responses; non-inferiority to hydroxyurea regarding haematological response and normal spleen size was not shown at 12 months. However, response to ropeginterferon alfa-2b continued to increase over time with improved responses compared with hydroxyurea at 36 months. Considering the high and durable haematological and molecular responses and its good tolerability, ropeginterferon alfa-2b offers a valuable and safe long-term treatment option with features distinct from hydroxyurea.

### Ropeginterferon versus standard therapy for low-risk patients with polycythemia vera [^114tP2hQ]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Whether phlebotomy alone can adequately maintain target hematocrit in patients with low-risk polycythemia vera (PV) remains elusive. METHODS: In a phase 2 open-label randomized trial, we compared ropeginterferon alfa-2b (ropeg; 100μg every 2 weeks) with phlebotomy only regarding maintenance of a median hematocrit level (≤ 45%) over 12 months in the absence of progressive disease (primary end point). In follow-up, crossover to the alternative treatment group was allowed if the primary end point was not met. RESULTS: In total, 127 patients were enrolled (ropeg: n = 64; standard group: n = 63). The primary end point was met in 81% and 51% in the ropeg and standard groups, respectively. Responders continued the assigned treatment until month 24 and maintained response in 83% and 59%, respectively (P = 0.02). Ropeg responders less frequently experienced moderate/severe symptoms (33% vs. 67% in the standard group) and palpable splenomegaly (14% vs. 37%) and showed normalization of ferritin levels and blood counts. Nonresponders at 12 months crossed over to the standard (n = 9) or ropeg (n = 23) group; in patients switched to ropeg only, 7 of 23 met the response criteria in 12 months, and phlebotomy need was high (4.7 per patient per year). Discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in seven patients treated with ropeg. CONCLUSIONS: In this 24-month trial, ropeg was superior to phlebotomy alone in maintaining hematocrit on target. No dose-limiting side effects or toxicities were noted; 9.2% of patients on ropeg and no patients on standard treatment developed neutropenia.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11798zui]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythrocytosis refers to either a true or apparent increase in hemoglobin (Hgb)/hematocrit (Hct); distinction requires familiarity with sex-, race- and altitude-adjusted normal values, together with an appreciation of extreme normal values that exceed the 95th percentile (2 SD) of reference range and attention to clinical factors associated with plasma volume depletion (relative erythrocytosis). In 2008, the World Health organization (WHO) proposed Hgb and Hct diagnostic thresholds of 18.5 g/dl/52% and 16.5 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, for investigation of polycythemia vera (PV). However, in 2016, the WHO classification system revised the Hct/Hct thresholds for PV diagnosis to 16.5 g/dL/49% in males and 16 g/dL/48% in females. In a recent large population-based study, the incidence of erythrocytosis ranged from 0.3% to 3.4% based on the application of the WHO 2008 and 2016 criteria, respectively; importantly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was reported only in the context of a higher Hgb threshold (WHO 2008).

The diagnostic workup of JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis lacks uniformity, and often includes investigations for rare hereditary conditions and several acquired entities known to be associated with secondary erythrocytosis. In a substantial proportion (up to 70%) of patients, despite extensive testing, erythrocytosis remains uncharacterized and sometimes labeled as "idiopathic", which is often a diagnosis of exclusion. The complexity and variability of the decision-making processes involved in managing erythrocytosis were underscored by an international survey of 134 myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) physicians evaluating standard practice in erythrocytosis; in this regard, while first-line assessments were relatively consistent (JAK2, EPO testing), second-line investigations were markedly heterogeneous. Equally variable were treatment practices, including the decision to initiate daily aspirin therapy and/or phlebotomy, as well as the desired Hct target, ranging from 48–56%. Some of this variability in management stems from unsubstantiated concern regarding thrombosis risk. The particular issue was further highlighted in a recent retrospective study where as many as one-third of patients with secondary erythrocytosis were subjected to bone marrow examination and 42% to periodic phlebotomy. Herein, we outline our systematic diagnostic and therapeutic approach in JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis; our review also includes illustrative cases and a discussion on underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.

### Polycythemia vera as a rare cause of hypertension in a young man [^112pMGKB]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is an orphan haematological disease and one of the most common myeloproliferative diseases, with the incidence rate of about 0.4–2.8 cases per 100000 population per year. In patients, proliferation of all three haematopoietic lineages is observed, typically with the development of erythrocytosis. As a rule, PV occurs in patients aged 60–70 years, slightly more often in men. The main clinical signs of PV are weakness, significant burning sensation in fingers and palms due to the increased blood viscosity and microcirculation disorders, discomfort in the left hypochondrium due to splenomegaly at the background of extramedullary haematopoietic sites development, as well as gross vascular complications (thrombosis) of various localisation. Our clinical case represents a rare cardiac manifestation of the PV in a young man.

### Comprehensiveand functional studies for classification ofgenetic variants identified in patients with erythrocytosis [^112qK5wp]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythrocytoses are characterized by an elevated red cell mass of more than 125% of the predicted value for the age and body mass of the subject, usually reflected by increased levels of hemoglobin (Hb) and/or hematocrit (Ht) values. Erythrocytoses can be acquired as in the primary polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative neoplasm as a consequence of a gain of function mutation in the JAK2 gene (p. Val617Phe), or secondary to diverse pathological situations (pulmonary or heart disease, kidney cancer, carbon monoxide poisoning, etc.) due to an increased secretion of erythropoietin (EPO). On the other hand, erythrocytosis can be observed in a context of inherited disease, which can be primary when there is an intrinsic defect in the progenitor cells of the bone marrow (EPOR mutations), or secondary when the oxygen-sensing pathway is dysregulated and EPO is produced at a high level (VHL, EGLN1/PHD2, EPAS1/HIF2A mutations).

### Normal and pathological erythropoiesis in adults: from gene regulation to targeted treatment concepts [^115PMND3]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erythropoiesis is one of the important physiological supply functions of the bone marrow. In healthy adults, about 200×10 9 red cells are produced per day in the bone marrow and are released into the peripheral blood. Depending on demand, red cell production can be adjusted and upregulated substantially. A complex network of oxygen sensors, cytokines, such as erythropoietin, and other factors, including regulators of iron metabolism, are involved in the control of steady-state and stress-induced erythropoiesis, thereby ensuring appropriate oxygen supply to the peripheral tissues. – This regulatory network can adjust itself to physiological requirements such as the oxygen concentration (altitude) or pregnancy as well as to pathological conditions such as blood loss. – However, in some pathological conditions this regulatory network is overwhelmed or is not functional, resulting in polycythemia or anemia.

In the elderly, the bone marrow and other organs undergo aging. As a result, erythropoietin synthesis and red cell production may decline. – However, even in very old individuals, red cell production and erythropoietin synthesis are usually adequate to keep hemoglobin levels within a reasonable range unless certain co-morbidities that lead to insufficient production of red cells have been acquired. – Therefore, such other etiologies must be ruled out when hemoglobin levels drop in older individuals. –

Anemia is a major cause of symptomatic morbidity in daily medical practice. The etiologies contributing to anemic states are complex. – Underlying disorders include trauma or coagulopathies with consequent bleeding, immunological and other inflammatory reactions as well as clonal (neoplastic) conditions. Clonal expansion of erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow may result in central and peripheral expansion of erythropoiesis, and thus in the clinical picture of polycythemia vera (PV), but it may also result in clonal anemic states such as the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or even erythroid leukemia, characterized by a major or complete block of differentiation in early erythropoiesis. – Anemic MDS are characterized by red cell dysplasia, ineffective erythropoiesis, apoptosis of late erythroid precursor cells, and the paradoxical combination of erythroid bone marrow hyperplasia and peripheral anemia.

### Congenital polycythemias / erythrocytoses [^1128FsYu]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

Congenital polycythemias may result from inherited defects in hypoxia sensing, from inherited intrinsic defects in red blood cell precursors, or from inherited conditions that cause low tissue oxygen tension and secondary polycythemia. Conditions of defective hypoxia sensing feature inappropriately normal or elevated serum erythropoietin (Epo) concentrations in the setting of normoxia and erythrocytosis. They are often due to homozygous or compound heterozygous germline mutations in the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) but without increased incidence of tumors. Affected persons have a high risk of arterial thrombosis and early mortality. The molecular biology of rare polycythemic patients with a single mutated VHL allele remains obscure. Primary congenital and familial polycythemias are characterized by low Epo levels and increased erythroid precursor responsiveness to Epo. They are often due to heterozygous gain-of function mutations in the gene for erythropoietin receptor (EPOR). Secondary congenital polycythemias have low tissue oxygen tension due to hemoglobins with high affinity for oxygen, low erythrocyte 2,3 biphosphoglycerate levels, methemoglobinemia or cyanotic heart or lung disease. Whether phlebotomy therapy reduces complications and prolongs survival in congenital polycythemia is not known.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) — erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) response predictors include baseline erythropoietin (EPO) and transfusion needs: patients with elevated baseline EPO levels (> 500 IU/L) are unlikely to respond, and ESAs should be avoided when EPO is elevated (> 500 IU/L), whereas an even lower EPO level (< 200 IU/L) is associated with a better Hb response; lower pretreatment red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependence (< 2 units per month) has been associated with higher ESA response, and potential benefits include avoidance of secondary hemochromatosis in lower risk patients with years of expected survival.

### ME / CFS symptoms… [^1148nXot]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms are common in many other illnesses.
- There is no test to confirm ME/CFS. This makes it hard to diagnose.
- Symptoms are unpredictable and may change or come and go over time.
- However, a combination of core symptoms are used to diagnose ME/CFS. Primary symptoms ME/CFS has five core symptoms. You must have three main ME/CFS symptoms and at least one of the other two symptoms to be diagnosed with ME/CFS. Less ability to do activities and fatigue People with ME/CFS have a much lower ability to do activities they could do before they got sick. This limitation comes with fatigue and lasts six months or longer. The fatigue:

- Can be severe
- Isn't caused by an unusually difficult activity
- Isn't relieved by sleep or rest. Worse symptoms after activity People with ME/CFS experience a worsening of their symptoms after any type of activity
- physical or mental.

These activities wouldn't have been a problem before they became ill. This is called Post-Exertional Malaise. PEM can lead to a cycle of "pushing" to do more, followed by "crashing. " During a crash, people with ME/CFS may have a variety of symptoms. These can include difficulty thinking, problems sleeping, sore throat, headaches, feeling dizzy, or severe tiredness. It may take days, weeks, or longer to recover from a crash. Some people may be confined to bed or the house. As examples:

- Attending a school event may leave someone house-bound for days.
- Grocery shopping may require a nap in the car before driving home.
- Doing errands may require getting a ride home.
- Showering may leave someone bed-bound for days.
- Working may mean spending nights and weekends recovering. Sleep Problems People with ME/CFS may not feel better or less tired, even after a full night's sleep. Some may have problems falling asleep or staying asleep.

Additional symptoms In addition to the three required symptoms above, one of the following two symptoms is needed to be diagnosed with ME/CFS. Memory and thinking problems Most people with ME/CFS have trouble thinking quickly, remembering things, and paying attention to details. People with ME/CFS often say they have "brain fog" to describe this problem. This is because they feel "stuck in a fog" and not able to think clearly. Problems being upright People with ME/CFS often report their symptoms get worse when they are standing or sitting upright. This is called orthostatic intolerance. People with ME/CFS may be lightheaded, dizzy, weak, or faint while standing or sitting up. They may have vision changes like blurring or seeing spots. Other common symptoms Many but not all people with ME/CFS have other symptoms. Pain is very common in people with ME/CFS. The type of pain, where it occurs, and how bad it is varies a lot.

The pain people with ME/CFS feel is not caused by an injury. The most common types of pain in ME/CFS are:

- Muscle pain and aches
- Joint pain without swelling or redness
- Headaches, either new or worsening Some people with ME/CFS may also have:

- Tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpits
- Frequent sore throat
- Digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome
- Chills and night sweats
- Allergies or sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, light and noise
- Muscle weakness
- Shortness of breath
- Irregular heartbeat.

Regarding specific circumstances for polycythemia vera, more specifically with respect to patients with congenital erythrocytosis, BSH 2019 guidelines recommend to consider setting a hematocrit target of 52% in patients with congenital erythrocytosis, and do not attempt to reduce hematocrit to the normal range.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^1142h9M7]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

JAK2 unmutated or non-polycythemia vera (PV) erythrocytosis encompasses both hereditary and acquired conditions. A systematic diagnostic approach begins with documentation of historical hematocrit (Hct)/hemoglobin (Hgb) measurements and classification of the process as life-long/unknown duration or acquired. Further investigation in both categories is facilitated by determination of serum erythropoietin level (EPO). Workup for hereditary/congenital erythrocytosis requires documentation of family history and laboratory screening for high-oxygen affinity hemoglobin variants, 2, 3 biphosphoglycerate deficiency, and germline mutations that are known to alter cellular oxygen sensing (e.g. PHD2, HIF2A, VHL) or EPO signaling (e.g. EPOR mutations); the latter is uniquely associated with subnormal EPO. Acquired erythrocytosis is often elicited by central or peripheral hypoxia resulting from cardiopulmonary disease/high-altitude dwelling or renal artery stenosis, respectively; EPO in the former instance is often normal (compensated by negative feed-back). Other conditions associated with acquired erythrocytosis include EPO-producing tumors and the use of drugs that promote erythropoiesis (e.g. testosterone, erythropoiesis stimulating agents). "Idiopathic erythrocytosis" loosely refers to an otherwise not explained situation. Historically, management of non-PV erythrocytosis has been conflicted by unfounded concerns regarding thrombosis risk, stemming from limited phenotypic characterization, save for Chuvash polycythemia, well-known for its thrombotic tendency. In general, cytoreductive therapy should be avoided and phlebotomy is seldom warranted where frequency is determined by symptom control rather than Hct threshold. Although not supported by hard evidence, cardiovascular risk optimization and low-dose aspirin use are often advised. Application of modern genetic tests and development of controlled therapeutic intervention trials are needed to advance current clinical practice.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^1166mbw3]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

After exclusion of all causes of reactive thrombocytosis, a new platelet count should be repeated to confirm the persistence of unexplained thrombocytosis. Thus, investigations to search for hematological disorders should be performed. Molecular markers for the most common myeloid neoplasms associated with thrombocytosis can be searched on peripheral blood: BCR‐ABL rearrangement for chronic myeloid leukemia and JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations for Philadelphia‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. Subsequently, according to the clinical suspicion, a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy, together with cytogenetic and other molecular analysis (including a myeloid next‐generation sequencing panel), should be carried out. Bone marrow biopsy is particularly useful to exclude triple‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Hyposplenism, defined as an abnormally low rate of activity of the spleen, is one of the most overlooked causes of thrombocytosis. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hyposplenism is suggested by typical morphological abnormalities of circulating red blood cells, including acanthocytes, spiculated spherocytes, stomatocytes, target cells, pitted erythrocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies. Pitted red cells are erythrocytes whose membrane appears to contain the so‐called "pits". It has been shown by electron microscopy that these "pits" are large vacuoles attached to or beneath the plasma membrane. Within these vacuoles, there is waste material (e.g. ferritin, hemoglobin, and residual material of mitochondria and membranes) that confers a low optical density. Normal splenic function is characterized by pitted red cells less than 4% of total erythrocytes. A pitted erythrocyte count > 4% has been suggested as the gold standard for a diagnosis of hyposplenism. Howell‐Jolly bodies that consist of basophilic DNA remnants within erythrocytes, also strongly support a diagnosis of hyposplenism if elevated, but are considered a less sensitive morphological feature than pitted red cells. Finally, radio‐isotopic methods (e.g. 99mTc‐labeled heat‐altered autologous erythrocyte scintigraphy) allow a splenic morpho‐functional assessment by studying the uptake and clearance of an injected radiolabeled tracer. However, given their high costs, their use in clinical practice is limited. This underlies the remarkable importance of morphological examination of peripheral blood smear when assessing a patient with a new‐onset thrombocytosis. New MRI techniques have increased the detection of splenic diseases so that, nowadays, MRI is an excellent tool for diagnosis and characterization of both focal and diffuse splenic abnormalities.

A man in his late 60s presented with symptoms for a few months of itching and head ache after shower. Physical examination was unremarkable except for ruddy complexion and splenomegaly. Complete blood count showed haemoglobin of 18.1 g/dL and haematocrit of 56.6%. To rule out secondary causes of erythrocytosis, such as congenital heart disease with a right to left shunt, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which showed normal left ventricular function with an apical area of dyskinesis and a large left ventricular apical thrombus measuring 3.0 cm×2.0 cm. Further laboratory investigations showed low erythropoietin level and Jak V617F mutation consistent with the diagnosis of polycythemia vera. He was treated with aspirin, enoxaparin, phlebotomy and hydroxyurea with no reported complications during the stay.

### Distinct roles for long-term hematopoietic stem cells and erythroid precursor cells in a murine model of jak2V617F-mediated polycythemia vera [^112KMEFr]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

In the current model of the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera (PV), the JAK2V617F mutation arises in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that maintain the disease, while erythroid precursor populations expand, resulting in excessive red blood cell production. We examined the role of these specific cell populations using a conditional Jak2V617F knockin murine model. We demonstrate that the most immature long-term (LT) HSCs are solely responsible for initiating and maintaining the disease in vivo and that Jak2V617F mutant LT-HSCs dominate hematopoiesis over time. When we induced Jak2V617F expression in erythropoietin receptor expressing precursor cells, the mice developed elevated hematocrit, expanded erythroid precursors, and suppressed erythropoietin levels. However, the disease phenotype was significantly attenuated compared with mice expressing Jak2V617F in LT-HSCs. In addition to developing a PV phenotype, all mice transplanted with Jak2V617F LT-HSCs underwent myelofibrotic transformation over time. These findings recapitulate the development of post-PV myelofibrosis in human myeloproliferative neoplasms. In aggregate, these results demonstrate the distinct roles of LT-HSCs and erythroid precursors in the pathogenesis of PV.

### Polycythemia vera: rapid evidence review [^1177Jv8R]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycythemia vera is one of three stem-cell-derived myeloid malignancies commonly known as myeloproliferative neoplasms. It is characterized by erythrocytosis, often with associated leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. It has a significant negative impact on overall mortality and morbidity in the form of arterial and venous clots, symptoms of fatigue and pruritus, and conversion to leukemia and myelofibrosis. The World Health Organization's major diagnostic criteria include an elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit level, abnormal results on bone marrow biopsy, and presence of the Janus kinase 2 genetic mutation, which is present in approximately 98% of cases. The only minor criterion is a subnormal erythropoietin level, which helps differentiate polycythemia vera from common causes of secondary erythrocytosis such as smoking, sleep apnea, and testosterone use. First-line treatments, such as low-dose aspirin and goal-directed phlebotomy to a hematocrit level of less than 45% to reduce thrombotic events, improve quality of life and prolong survival. When indicated, cytoreductive therapy, primarily with hydroxyurea, can be added with consideration of second-line agents such as pegylated interferon-alfa, busulfan, and ruxolitinib, depending on the clinical scenario. Smoking cessation and cardiometabolic disease are modifiable risk factors that should be addressed to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Currently, no medications have been shown to cure the disease or to reduce the risk of conversion to leukemia and myelofibrosis.

### Why does my patient have erythrocytosis? [^112puSuY]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Primary polycythemias are the result of intrinsic abnormalities of the hematopoietic progenitors that lead to constitutive overproduction of red cells accompanied by low erythropoietin (EPO) levels. Secondary polycythemias are caused by conditions resulting in increased EPO production. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a primary polycythemia, and is a chronic clonal progressive myeloproliferative neoplasm. A single recurrent point mutation in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 molecule (JAK2(V617F)) is present in > 95% of patients with PV. The goal of therapy in PV is to normalize blood counts to minimize the risk of thrombotic events.

### Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients [^115Sr2Xq]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by clonal erythrocytosis resulting from constitutive activation of the Janus Kinase and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) signal transduction pathway. The diagnosis of PV is based on the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria utilizing a composite assessment of clinical and laboratory features. PV is associated with burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life and thrombohemorrhagic complications with potential for myelofibrotic and/or leukemic transformation. Thrombotic complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality with a reported incidence of 12–39%. Patients suffer from large vessel arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as microcirculatory symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, visual disturbances, erythromelalgia, distal paresthesia and acrocyanosis. In the European Collaboration on Low-Dose Aspirin in Polycythemia Vera (ECLAP) prospective study, age older than 65 years and prior thrombotic events were identified as risk factors for cardiovascular events among PV patients. Importantly, arterial and venous thrombosis are two biologically different processes with distinct risk factors. The International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) identified prior arterial events and hypertension as risk factors for arterial thrombosis and prior venous events and age ≥ 65 years as risk factors for venous thrombosis in PV. In this single center study, we sought to validate the findings of the IWG-MRT based on WHO 2016 PV diagnostic criteria, as well as identify additional risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis, including possible associations with the most frequent "non-driver" mutations: Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) (22%) and Additional sex combs like-1 (ASXL1) (12%).

### How to manage polycythemia vera [^112DVQRU]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

My diagnostic approach in case of isolated erythrocytosis is based on the visit and the interview of patients, and on checking the causes of secondary erythrocytosis. If causes of secondary erythrocytosis are not evident and serum erythropoietin level is low-normal, I study JAK2 mutations. In the case of a patient with erythrocytosis and other signs of myeloproliferation, such as leukocytosis, thrombocytosis or splenomegaly, the diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) is likely, and I test serum erythropoietin and JAK2 mutations first. I stratify patients at diagnosis of PV according to age and history of thrombosis. I start hydroxyurea for patients who are at a high risk of thrombosis (that is, with one or two risk factors), while I continue only phlebotomy in other cases. All PV patients, if not contraindicated, receive aspirin. I follow up patients monthly until normalization of their blood cell counts or splenomegaly, and afterwards every 2 months with visit, cell blood count and blood smear evaluation. After diagnosis, I perform bone marrow biopsy only in the case of clinical signs of disease evolution.

### Role of phlebotomy in the management of hemoglobin SC disease: case report and review of the literature [^111MTXNC]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Marked variability is a keynote in the disease course of patients with hemoglobin SC (Hb SC) and hemoglobin S/beta(+)-thalassemia (Hb S/beta(+)-thal), with some patients having a frequency of complications and painful episodes similar to patients with homozygous sickle cell (Hb SS) disease. One possible explanation is that the higher hematocrit in these syndromes may contribute to an increase in blood viscosity, leading to vaso-occlusive pain episodes as well as an increased incidence of thromboembolic complications and retinopathy. We present a patient with Hb SC disease with an excellent baseline functional status who developed splenic infarction at a high altitude. Following splenectomy, the patient developed a sustained increase in hematocrit, an increase in the frequency of painful episodes, as well as new-onset dizziness and malaise. We initiated a therapeutic phlebotomy program in order to lower the hematocrit to pre-splenectomy values, as well as to induce iron deficiency. Repeated phlebotomy resulted in a dramatic decrease in symptoms. Our patient no longer requires narcotic analgesics for pain, has resolution of constitutional symptoms, and has not required further hospitalizations for vaso-occlusive pain crises. The correlation between symptoms and hematocrit levels supports the importance of blood viscosity in contributing to this patient's symptoms. A trial of phlebotomy to reduce viscosity in patients with higher hematocrit values should be considered as an intervention for symptomatic patients with sickle cell disease.

Treatment for high-risk polycythemia vera — monitoring and management of inadequate response: Monitor for new thrombosis or bleeding and monitor response and signs/symptoms of disease progression as clinically indicated. Potential indications for change of cytoreductive therapy include intolerance or resistance to prior cytoreductive treatment, new thrombosis or disease-related major bleeding, frequent phlebotomy or intolerance of phlebotomy, splenomegaly, progressive thrombocytosis and/or leukocytosis, and disease-related symptoms (eg, pruritus, night sweats, fatigue). For inadequate response or loss of response, preferred regimens are clinical trial or ruxolitinib (category 1 for high-risk PV for hydroxyurea resistance or intolerance), with other recommended regimens being ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft, hydroxyurea, or peginterferon alfa-2a if not previously used. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with PV who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. Response criteria were developed mainly for use in clinical trials, and response assessment should be done based on the improvement of disease-related symptoms at the discretion of the clinician.

### From microcytosis to macrodiagnosis [^111mviMJ]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old Hispanic girl presented with fatigue, lightheadedness, and intermittent headaches. She was depressed and appeared pale to her mother. Her examination was unremarkable except for palpebral conjunctival pallor and was otherwise noncontributory. She had a profound hypoproliferative microcytic anemia with low iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a normal ferritin level. The patient experienced improvement in clinical symptoms following transfusion of packed red blood cells and oral iron therapy. At follow-up 2 months later, she presented with similar symptoms and persistent microcytic anemia with low iron levels. Her ferritin level was increased along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An oral iron challenge demonstrated lack of absorption, and hepcidin level was also significantly elevated. Thorough gastrointestinal and rheumatologic evaluations were performed to search for a source of inflammation. Key components of the patient's social history supplemented by serology, radiographic, and pathologic findings ultimately cinched an unexpected diagnosis.

Myelofibrosis (MF), either appearing de novo (primary MF, PMF) or after a previous diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia or of polycythemia vera, is a progressive disease burdened by symptomatic splenomegaly, debilitating systemic symptoms, ineffective hematopoiesis, and overall reduced survival. Patients often present worsening cytopenias, including thrombocytopenia, secondary to progression of the disease as well as to cytoreductive treatment. Patients with MF and thrombocytopenia have few therapeutic options and there is limited information regarding the management of disease in these settings. This article reviews current evidence for the management of patients with MF and thrombocytopenia, in the era of JAK inhibitors.

### Polycythemia vera: historical oversights, diagnostic details, and therapeutic views [^112VXq2Y]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Our current diagnostic approach in polycythemia vera

PV is currently defined by an acquired increase in hemoglobin/hematocrit level above 16.5 gm/dL/49% in men and 16 g/dL/48% in women, in the context of a JAK2 mutation and characteristic bone marrow morphology. The 2016 WHO classification system for hematopoietic tumors recognizes the almost perfect association between PV and a JAK2 mutation, as well as the fact that JAK2 V617F is also detected in 50–70% of patients with either ET or PMF. The formal diagnostic table lists three major (Hb/Hct level above 16.5 g/dL/49% in men and 16 g/dL/48% in women or red cell mass > 25% above mean normal predicted value; consistent bone marrow morphology; and presence of a JAK2 V617F or exon 12 mutation) and one minor (subnormal serum erythropoietin (Epo) level) criteria; WHO-qualified diagnosis requires the presence of either all three major criteria or the first two major criteria plus the minor criterion. Our current approach to the diagnosis of PV is consistent with these fundamentals, with some modifications that accommodate clinical practice scenarios, which are further elaborated below (Fig. 1). In general, screening for other mutations through next-generation sequencing (NGS) or cytogenetic abnormalities is more useful in terms of prognostication (discussed below in the section of prognosis) rather than diagnosis.

Fig. 1
Current diagnostic algorithm for polycythemia vera.

Our approach to diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV).

JAK2 mutation screening

Virtually all patients with PV harbor either JAK2 V617F (exon 14; 97% sensitivity) or JAK2 exon 12 mutation (majority of JAK2 V617F-negative cases). Accordingly, the first step in approaching the diagnosis of PV should include JAK2 mutation screening, and we favor upfront targeting of both exons 14 and 12, in order to avoid undue delay in the diagnostic process; it should also be noted that peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are equally informative in detecting and quantifying JAK2 V617F. In order to address issues with inconclusive test results and also provide an additional layer of diagnostic comfort, we recommend concomitant measurement of serum Epo level, which is expected to be subnormal in more than 85% of patients with PV. JAK2 mutation screening might also be a more sensitive diagnostic tool, compared to bone marrow morphology, in patients presenting with "MPN-unclassifiable (MPN-U)" phenotype or splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), as discussed below.

### Complex karyotype in a polycythemia vera patient with a novel SETD1B / GTF2H3 fusion gene [^1156ND2g]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

The patient had been diagnosed with polycythemia vera (PV) in 1999, at the age of 61, according to the criteria of the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) on the basis of the increased red cell mass by isotope determination, normal oxygen saturation, low plasma erythropoietin level, presence of endogenous erythroid colonies (EEC), and splenomegaly. Histopathology of bone marrow biopsy was also consistent with polycythemia vera with no evidence of increased reticulin fibrosis. A karyotype analysis was not performed at that time. He had been treated initially with phlebotomies and then with hydroxyurea with the aim to obtain a better control of hematocrit; he was under low-dose aspirin. In 2009, 10 years after the diagnosis, while the patient was still being treated with hydroxyurea and phlebotomies, he noticed worsening of general conditions and fatigue, and the appearance of night sweats; he also reported that his spleen volume had increased rapidly in the past few months. He complained of severe pruritus especially after (but not limited to) a shower. He was referred to our center for further evaluation. At presentation, his blood counts were as follows: hemoglobin 157 g/L, hematocrit 54.7%, leukocytes 13.1 × 10⁹ /L, platelets 238 × 10⁹ /L, LDH 856 U/L (normal upper limit, 250 U/L). Blood film examination showed neutrophilia (8.9 × 10⁹ /L) but immature myeloid cells and nucleated erythroblasts were absent. The spleen was 14 cm below the left costal margin, the liver was at 4 cm below the right costal margin. He was found to harbor the JAK2V617F mutation with an allele burden of 85% and the circulating CD34⁺ cell count was 14 × 10⁶ /L. A bone marrow biopsy showed the presence of hyperplasia of myeloid and erythroid lineages, increased number of scattered megakarocytes without overt morphologic abnormalities; reticulin fibrosis was grade 1 according to the European classification. On these basis, we considered the patient as presenting the features of PV according to the 2008 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms associated with grade 1 reticulin fibrosis.

Polycythemia vera (PV) diagnostic criteria and masked PV — thresholds and bone marrow biopsy role: The 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria refined PV assessment to differentiate masked PV from essential thrombocythemia (ET), recognizing biopsy utility when hemoglobin is < 18.5 g/dL in men and < 16.5 g/dL in women. In an international series, 257/397 had overt PV by 2008 WHO criteria and 140/397 had masked PV with hemoglobin at diagnosis < 18.5 g/dL in males (range, 16.0–18.4 g/dL) and < 16.5 g/dL in females (range, 15.0–16.4 g/dL), often with subnormal erythropoietin (EPO). Masked PV independently predicted poor survival in patients aged > 65 years with leukocyte count > 10 x 10^9/L, whereas without these risk factors outcomes were similar to overt PV; overall, OS, thrombosis, major bleeding, and transformation rates were similar between masked and overt PV. Major PV criteria were refined to include hemoglobin levels (> 16.5 g/dL in men and > 16.0 g/dL in women) or hematocrit > 49% in men and > 48% in women plus bone marrow biopsy to confirm age-adjusted hypercellularity. Bone marrow biopsy may not be required for sustained absolute erythrocytosis with hemoglobin > 18.5 g/dL in men [hematocrit > 55.5%] or > 16.5 g/dL in women [hematocrit > 49.5%] and presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutations with subnormal serum EPO, though biopsy can still provide helpful prognostic information.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) — epidemiology and clinical features in the United States include Philadelphia chromosome-negative disorders myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The prevalence of MF, ET, and PV is estimated at approximately 13,000, 134,000, and 148,000, respectively, and in 2002–2016 data the age-adjusted IRs per 100,000 person-years were highest for PV (IR = 1.57) and ET (IR = 1.55) and was 0.44 for primary MF (PMF). MPN are characterized by a complicated symptom profile that often includes fatigue, pruritus, weight loss, and symptoms from splenomegaly, with variable laboratory abnormalities such as erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and sometimes myeloid immaturity, especially in progressive MF. A SEER-Medicare analysis showed substantially inferior survival for patients with MPN compared to matched controls, with survival for patients with MF worse than that of patients with ET or PV and significantly worse than matched controls, and these diseases have propensity for disease transformation to blast phase (MPN-BP), which is akin to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with a poor prognosis. The diagnosis and comprehensive care of patients with MPN has evolved since identification of JAK-STAT "driver" mutations (JAK2, CALR, and MPL), and development of targeted therapies has resulted in significant improvements in disease-related symptoms and quality of life, although diagnosis, assessment of symptom burden, and selection of appropriate symptom-directed therapies continue to present challenges for hematologists and oncologists.

### Serum erythropoietin levels in essential thrombocythemia: phenotypic and prognostic correlates [^112PEhFz]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Serum erythropoietin (EPO) level below the normal reference range is widely accepted as a minor diagnostic criterion for polycythemia vera (PV) and has retained its value in the revised 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme of myeloid neoplasms. While over 80% of PV patients exhibit subnormal EPO values, very little is known about the incidence, phenotypic connotation, or prognostic significance of serum EPO levels in essential thrombocythemia (ET). Studies on this subject remain, in fact, exceedingly rare. Previous reports limited to small patient populations have suggested that subnormal EPO levels may be more prevalent than expected in ET, up to 50% in some series. Furthermore, one study comprising 39 untreated ET patients revealed a heightened risk of vascular events and significantly shorter time to initiation of myelosuppressive therapy in those exhibiting subnormal EPO values. These observations, albeit preliminary, raise the possibility that serum EPO may be relevant, perhaps even prognostically impactful in ET. Accordingly, after securing a diagnostically pure cohort of untreated strictly WHO-defined chronic phase ET patients, we documented serum EPO measurements, laboratory and clinical features, and overall, myelofibrosis-free, and polycythemia vera-free survival stratified by EPO level.

The current study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. Diagnosis of ET was in strict accordance with the 2016 WHO criteria. ET patients with available EPO measurements at diagnosis or during their chronic phase (March 1994–November 2017) were considered under the following strict provisions: (i) all patients were in chronic phase with no evidence of myelofibrotic or leukemic transformation; (ii) all patients were untreated with cytoreductive agents at the time of sample collection and those with EPO levels drawn at diagnosis were also previously untreated with cytoreductive agents; (iii) all patients had hemoglobin levels above sex-adjusted values for anemia (no more than two standard deviations below the mean or > 13.5 g/dL in men and > 12.0 g/dL in women), thus excluding anemia as a potential confounding variable; and (iv) all patients with hemoglobin values exceeding the threshold for PV criteria had clinical and morphological parameters carefully assessed and all cases of masked PV systematically excluded. Few individuals with hemoglobin values exceeding the threshold for PV but without meeting PV criteria were found to have either transient elevations in hemoglobin or clear underlying causes of secondary polycythemia such as hypoxia, smoking, or elite athletic training, among others.

Additional guidance notes that "While normalization of blood counts after initiation of treatment is usually a goal in clinical practice, it is not associated with long-term clinical benefit and there are no evidence-based data to recommend a target white blood cell (WBC) or platelet count", although "In selected patients with a severe thrombotic event or other disease-related symptoms, normalization of blood counts might be a goal of treatment". Patient-specific considerations include "Peginterferon alfa-2a is an option for younger patients or in pregnant patients in need of cytoreductive therapy", and "In the event that peginterferon alfa-2a is unavailable, the use of other available pegylated interferons (eg, ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft) is appropriate". All recommendations are "category 2A unless otherwise indicated".

### Aquagenic pruritus in polycythemia vera: characteristics and influence on quality of life in 441 patients [^115oPsPu]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Aquagenic pruritus (AP) is a symptom typical for polycythemia vera, but very little is known about its exact frequency, characteristics, influence on quality of life, and proper treatment. Therefore, we investigated these aspects in a large cohort of German patients with polycythemia vera using a patient directed questionnaire. Our analysis revealed that 301 of 441 analyzed patients suffered from AP. In 64.8%, AP occurred on average 2.9 years prior to diagnosis of polycythemia vera. Only in 15.4% did this lead to a hematological investigation. AP occurs primarily on the trunk and proximal parts of the extremities. Most patients complain about itching (71.8%), the remainder about tickling, stinging, or burning sensations. Forty-four patients (14.6%) classified the pruritus as "unbearable". Patients with AP reported reduced global health status and higher fatigue, pain, and dyspnea. Only 24% of patients received pruritus specific treatment for pruritus consisting mostly of histamine antagonists, which ameliorated symptoms in about half of the patients. In 5.6% of patients, polycythemia vera directed therapy (phlebotomy/cytoreduction) resolved the symptoms. In summary, AP is a serious symptom in patients with polycythemia vera, which until recently was difficult to treat. The advent of the novel JAK2 inhibitors, however, may open new ways for therapy.

### A guideline for the management of specific situations in polycythaemia vera and secondary erythrocytosis: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^115gEyr1]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Using the available evidence and best practice we have suggested practical guidance for the management of specific situations and complications of polycythaemia vera. Management of the various types secondary erythrocytosis from the available evidence is outlined.
