## Question

When is aldactone indicated in heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when Aldactone (spironolactone) is indicated in heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the heart failure phenotype, specifically HFrEF versus HFpEF. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline recommendations for each phenotype. Next, I will review dosing, titration, and safety monitoring, including renal function and potassium thresholds. After that, I need to check special populations and scenarios like acute heart failure, post-MI, and CKD. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable indication framework and note any controversies or evolving evidence that might modify practice.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its class. Aldactone is spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that blocks aldosterone, providing antifibrotic, antiremodeling, and potassium-sparing effects in heart failure, and it is typically layered on top of guideline-directed medical therapy rather than used as monotherapy [^113qPHpN] [^117X5UBu].

> Now, I should define the clinical context by phenotype. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — benefits differ by ejection fraction. In HFrEF, MRAs are foundational; in HFpEF, evidence is mixed and recommendations are weaker, so I need to keep that distinction front and center as I proceed [^111RKLXp] [^115Y3qHa].

> For HFrEF, I will now examine the evidence base. The pivotal RALES trial in NYHA III–IV HFrEF with LVEF ≤ 35% showed a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 35% reduction in HF hospitalizations with spironolactone 25 mg/day, with benefits maintained across subgroups and with careful monitoring, which establishes a strong indication in symptomatic HFrEF [^111Txyh4] [^112KYf83]. Wait, let me verify the extension to milder symptoms — EMPHASIS-HF in NYHA II HFrEF confirmed benefit with eplerenone, supporting MRA use across NYHA II–IV when safety criteria are met, and contemporary guidelines endorse MRAs for HFrEF with NYHA II–IV symptoms if eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, with close lab monitoring [^111RKLXp] [^114ykgDS].

> For HFpEF, I should double-check the signal. TOPCAT did not show a significant reduction in the primary composite outcome overall, but HF hospitalizations were reduced, and there was a regional heterogeneity with benefit in the Americas but not in Russia/Georgia, likely reflecting adherence and drug exposure issues; thus, a modest, selective benefit is plausible in appropriately chosen patients [^112RMVNt] [^113sQxRC]. Let me reconsider the magnitude — meta-analytic and guideline summaries suggest a modest reduction in HF hospitalizations without clear mortality benefit, so if used, it should be in symptomatic HFpEF with careful selection and monitoring, aligning with a Class IIb recommendation in some pathways [^115Y3qHa] [^113sQxRC].

> Next, I should review dosing and titration. Standard initiation is 25 mg once daily, with consideration of 25 mg every other day if eGFR is 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m² or if there is concern for hyperkalemia; after about 4–8 weeks, if tolerated and potassium remains < 5.0–5.5 mEq/L, uptitration to 50 mg daily is reasonable, with a mean achieved dose around 26 mg in trials [^1142HZjA] [^117YJcLQ]. Hold on, I should verify safety thresholds — discontinue or reduce dose if potassium rises to 5.5 mEq/L or higher, and avoid initiation if potassium is ≥ 5.0 mEq/L or eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111RKLXp] [^116HAUpi].

> I need to ensure I specify monitoring. Check potassium and renal function about 3 days and 1 week after initiation, again at 4 weeks, and then periodically; more frequent checks are warranted after dose changes, during intercurrent illness, or if interacting drugs are added, and potassium supplements should generally be stopped when starting spironolactone to mitigate hyperkalemia risk [^115EgLFb] [^116HAUpi]. But wait, what if the patient is on an ARNI — does that change risk? Observational and trial data suggest hyperkalemia risk may be lower with ARNI than with ACEi/ARB, though vigilance remains essential and is guideline-recommended [^116HAUpi].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. In acute heart failure, high-dose spironolactone has not improved decongestion or short-term outcomes in RCTs, so routine initiation during hospitalization is not supported; however, if the patient meets chronic HFrEF criteria and can be safely monitored, starting low-dose spironolactone before discharge may be reasonable in select cases, balancing risk and follow-up capacity [^112Rhmx3] [^115Ebf5o]. In post-MI patients with LV dysfunction, eplerenone has mortality benefit, and while spironolactone is mechanistically similar, the clearest evidence is with eplerenone in that setting, so agent selection may favor eplerenone post-MI when indicated [^113mHhH7]. In CKD, I should confirm that eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² is a contraindication to initiation; if CKD progresses, dose reduction or discontinuation is prudent, and although potassium binders can facilitate MRA continuation, their routine use solely to enable spironolactone is not firmly evidence-based in HF populations yet [^111RKLXp] [^116HAUpi].

> I should also review real-world safety signals to avoid overconfidence. After RALES, population data showed increased hyperkalemia hospitalizations and deaths when spironolactone was broadly prescribed without strict selection and monitoring, underscoring the need to adhere to eGFR and potassium thresholds and to follow lab schedules rigorously [^117VGAYY] [^115jxk7d]. Hold on, I should verify that this risk is modifiable — yes, with appropriate patient selection and monitoring, the absolute risk of serious hyperkalemia is low, and the net clinical benefit remains favorable in eligible HFrEF patients [^116HAUpi] [^113Toagh].

> Let me synthesize the indication framework. Aldactone is indicated for patients with symptomatic HFrEF (NYHA II–IV) who have eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, with the intent to reduce mortality and HF hospitalizations; it is also reasonable to consider in selected symptomatic HFpEF patients, particularly those with prior HF hospitalization or elevated natriuretic peptides, recognizing the modest magnitude of benefit and the need for close monitoring, and aligning with a selective, IIb-level approach in guidelines and expert pathways [^111RKLXp] [^115Y3qHa] [^113sQxRC]. I should confirm that this is consistent with contemporary guidance — yes, current ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines prioritize MRAs as foundational in HFrEF and allow cautious, evidence-informed use in HFpEF with explicit safety criteria and follow-up plans [^111RKLXp] [^114ykgDS].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical steps are clear. Before prescribing, check baseline potassium and creatinine/eGFR, review concomitant drugs that raise potassium or interact with spironolactone, counsel on sick-day rules and avoidance of NSAIDs, and arrange timely lab follow-up; if potassium approaches 5.5 mEq/L or eGFR declines meaningfully, adjust dose or hold therapy, and consider alternatives or adjuncts as clinically indicated, including potassium binders in select cases with close supervision [^116HAUpi] [^111j2vUr]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with both safety and efficacy — yes, this approach mirrors trial protocols and guideline monitoring cadence and balances the robust HFrEF benefits against manageable hyperkalemia and renal risks when properly implemented [^111hHJFw] [^111RKLXp].

Aldactone (spironolactone) is indicated for **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** [^111RKLXp] with NYHA class II–IV symptoms [^114ykgDS] to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, provided eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L [^116HAUpi]. It is **not routinely indicated for HFpEF** [^115Y3qHa], though a modest reduction in HF hospitalizations may be seen in selected patients [^112RMVNt]; use is guided by clinical judgment and close monitoring [^113sQxRC]. Avoid initiation if eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L, and monitor potassium and renal function closely after initiation [^116HAUpi].

## Indications in heart failure

### Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)

- **Indication**: Strongly recommended for patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II–IV symptoms [^111RKLXp] to reduce morbidity and mortality [^114ykgDS].
- **Evidence**: RALES showed a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 35% reduction in HF hospitalizations [^111Txyh4] [^112KYf83].
- **Prerequisites**: eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L [^111RKLXp]; monitor potassium and renal function at initiation and periodically [^116HAUpi].

---

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)

- **Indication**: Not routinely recommended; consider in selected symptomatic patients [^115Y3qHa], particularly with elevated natriuretic peptides or prior HF hospitalization [^113sQxVc].
- **Evidence**: TOPCAT showed no significant reduction in the primary composite outcome [^112RMVNt] but a modest reduction in HF hospitalizations, mainly in the Americas cohort [^113sQxVc].
- **Guideline stance**: ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 gives a weak recommendation (IIb) for selected HFpEF patients [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Heart failure phenotype** | **Guideline recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| HFrEF (NYHA II–IV) | Strongly recommended | Class I, Level A [^notfound] |
| HFpEF | Conditionally recommended in selected patients | Class IIb, Level B [^notfound] |

---

## Contraindications and precautions

- **Contraindications**: eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L, Addison's disease, severe hepatic impairment.
- **Precautions**: Close monitoring of potassium and renal function is essential, especially with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or NSAIDs [^116HAUpi] [^111j2vUr].
- **Hyperkalemia risk**: Higher in CKD, elderly, diabetics, and with interacting drugs; monitor frequently [^117VGAYY] [^1163x5ad].

---

## Practical clinical considerations

- **Dosing**: Start 12.5–25 mg daily; titrate to 25–50 mg if tolerated [^1142HZjA] [^117YJcLQ].
- **Monitoring**: Check potassium and renal function within 3 days, at 1 week, and periodically thereafter [^115EgLFb].
- **Patient selection**: Use in HFrEF with persistent symptoms despite ACEi/ARB and beta-blocker therapy; consider in HFpEF with elevated natriuretic peptides or recurrent hospitalizations [^111RKLXp] [^113sQxVc].

---

Aldactone is **indicated for HFrEF** [^111RKLXp] with NYHA II–IV symptoms to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, provided renal function and potassium are adequate [^114ykgDS]. It is **not routinely indicated for HFpEF** [^115Y3qHa], though selected patients may benefit from reduced HF hospitalizations; use is individualized with close monitoring [^113sQxVc].

### Spironolactone [^1122EY4m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Heart Failure

Spironolactone is indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

Spironolactone is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.

1.2 Hypertension

Spironolactone is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Complications of inappropriate use of spironolactone in heart failure: when an old medicine spirals out of new guidelines [^116ZNvtH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to investigate the appropriateness and complications of the use of spironolactone for heart failure (HF) in clinical practice.

Background

Spironolactone was reported by one prospective randomized trial to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV HF. With this report (Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study [RALES] trial), we noted a marked increase in widespread use of spironolactone in patients with HF. Long-term outcome data with respect to safety and utilization of this medication in HF are not available.

Methods

To investigate the use of spironolactone for HF in a clinical setting, we analyzed the application of the RALES trial protocol to the care of 104 patients, whom we identified as being started on spironolactone for HF after prerelease of the RALES trial.

Results

We found broader use, less intensive follow-up, and increased complications with spironolactone treatment compared with the RALES trial. Cardiologists provided more appropriate care than did primary care providers.

Conclusions

These data suggest that spironolactone is being used widely in HF without consideration of the NYHA class and ejection fraction, and without optimization of background treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Clinical follow-up does not adhere to the RALES trial guidelines, resulting in higher complications. We conclude that long-term studies with further safety and efficacy data are needed.

### Spironolactone [^112gH5nD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1663 patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone or placebo. 87% of patients were white, 7% black, 2% Asian. 73% were male and median age was 67. The median ejection fraction was 26%. 70% were NYHA class III and 29% class IV. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 55%, and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 28%, of hypertension in 24%, and of diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

At baseline 100% of patients were taking loop diuretic and 95% were taking an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

The primary endpoint for Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was time to all-cause mortality. Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was terminated early because of significant mortality benefit demonstrated during a planned interim analysis. Compared to placebo, spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (defined as worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonist trial evidence — spironolactone and eplerenone — shows that in a "large-scale, long-term trial", adding low-dose spironolactone "starting at 12.5 mg daily" to ACEI therapy for NYHA class IV or class III (recently hospitalized) heart failure reduced mortality "from 46% to 35% (30% relative risk reduction) over 2 years", with a "35% reduction in HF hospitalization"; trial creatinine entry limits were "below 2.0 mg per dL" (pilot) and "below 2.5 mg per dL" (main). In myocardial infarction patients with "LVEF less than or equal to 40%" and HF or diabetes "within 14 days of MI", eplerenone decreased mortality "from 13.6% to 11.8% at 1 year", while hyperkalemia occurred in "5.5%" vs "3.9%" overall and "up to 10.1% versus 4.6%" when creatinine clearance was "less than 50 mL per min".

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111RKLXp]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter. In this population, MRA therapy provides high economic value. In patients taking MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at < 5.5 mEq/L, MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. MRAs show consistent improvement in all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD in HFrEF, and eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L are contraindications to MRA initiation.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of aldosterone antagonists — patient selection and renal function–based dosing — emphasizes that some who meet trial criteria "may need to be excluded" in practice for recent renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia, particularly with insulin-requiring diabetes. In the elderly, "estimated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min should trigger a reduction of the initial dose of spironolactone to 12.5 mg daily or of eplerenone to 25 mg daily", and "aldosterone antagonists should not be given when creatinine is less than 30 mL per minute". Patients "chronically requiring high doses of diuretics without potassium replacement should be evaluated closely".

### Selection of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for patients with hypertension or heart failure [^113Wuxta]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated morbidity and mortality benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in patients with heart failure. These studies have used either spironolactone or eplerenone as the MRA. It is generally believed that these two agents have the same effects, and the data from studies using one drug could be extrapolated for the other. National and international guidelines do not generally discriminate between spironolactone and eplerenone, but strongly recommend using an MRA for patients with heart failure due to LV systolic dysfunction and post-infarct LV systolic dysfunction. There are no major clinical trials directly comparing the efficacy of these two drugs. This article aims to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of spironolactone and eplerenone, and to analyse the available data for their cardiovascular indications and adverse effects. We have also addressed the role of special circumstances including co-morbidities, concomitant drug therapy, cost, and licensing restrictions in choosing an appropriate MRA for a particular patient, thus combining an evidence-based approach with personalized medicine.

### Efficacy and safety of spironolactone in acute heart failure: the ATHENA-HF randomized clinical trial [^112Rhmx3]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Persistent congestion is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (AHF). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists administered at high doses may relieve congestion, overcome diuretic resistance, and mitigate the effects of adverse neurohormonal activation in AHF.

Objective

To assess the effect of high-dose spironolactone and usual care on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels compared with usual care alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind and placebo (or low-dose)-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 22 US acute care hospitals among patients with AHF who were previously receiving no or low-dose (12.5 mg or 25 mg daily) spironolactone and had NT-proBNP levels of 1000 pg/mL or more or B-type natriuretic peptide levels of 250 pg/mL or more, regardless of ejection fraction.

Interventions

High-dose spironolactone (100 mg) vs placebo or 25 mg spironolactone (usual care) daily for 96 hours.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the change in NT-proBNP levels from baseline to 96 hours. Secondary end points included the clinical congestion score, dyspnea assessment, net urine output, and net weight change. Safety end points included hyperkalemia and changes in renal function.

Results

A total of 360 patients were randomized, of whom the median age was 65 years, 129 (36%) were women, 200 (55.5%) were white, 151 (42%) were black, 8 (2%) were Hispanic or Latino, 9 (2.5%) were of other race/ethnicity, and the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 34%. Baseline median (interquartile range) NT-proBNP levels were 4601 (2697–9596) pg/mL among the group treated with high-dose spironolactone and 3753 (1968–7633) pg/mL among the group who received usual care. There was no significant difference in the log NT-proBNP reduction between the 2 groups (-0.55 [95% CI, -0.92 to -0.18] with high-dose spironolactone and -0.49 [95% CI, -0.98 to -0.14] with usual care, P = 0.57). None of the secondary end point or day-30 all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization rate differed between the 2 groups. The changes in serum potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. were similar between the 2 groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Adding treatment with high-dose spironolactone to usual care for patients with AHF for 96 hours was well tolerated but did not improve the primary or secondary efficacy end points.

Trial Registration

clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02235077.

Heart failure — risks of aldosterone antagonists: The major risk of aldosterone antagonists is hyperkalemia due to inhibition of potassium excretion, with incidence reported to be as high as 24% in one series in which half of hyperkalemic subjects had potassium levels in excess of 6 mEq per liter; in contrast, the large trial reported 2% but a preceding pilot trial observed 13% with a 25-mg dose and 20% with a 50-mg dose. After publication of trial results, a population-based analysis in Ontario of more than 30 000 patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) after a hospitalization for heart failure found spironolactone prescriptions more than tripled, with hospitalization for hyperkalemia increasing from 2.4 to 11 patients per thousand and associated mortality increasing from 0.3 to 2 per thousand. These observations lead to a strong recommendation for caution in the selection and monitoring of patients to be given aldosterone antagonists.

For the management of edema and sodium retention when the patient is only partially responsive to, or is intolerant of, other therapeutic measures;
The treatment of diuretic-induced hypokalemia in patients with congestive heart failure when other measures are considered inappropriate;
The treatment of patients with congestive heart failure taking digitalis when other therapies are considered inadequate or inappropriate.

Cirrhosis of the liver accompanied by edema and/or ascites:

Aldosterone levels may be exceptionally high in this condition. Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for maintenance therapy together with bed rest and the restriction of fluid and sodium.

The nephrotic syndrome:

For nephrotic patients when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics do not provide an adequate response.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone) to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II-IV symptoms if the eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L. Obtain careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and closely monitor thereafter to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency.

In patients with chronic heart failure, spironolactone added to conventional treatment may lead to serious and, occasionally, fatal hyperkalaemia. In some cases this seems to happen because spironolactone causes diarrhoea. Four cases involving men with New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure are presented. As these cases revealed, close monitoring of blood chemistry is mandatory after starting spironolactone, and patients should be advised to stop spironolactone immediately if diarrhoea develops.

14.1 Heart Failure

The Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was a placebo controlled, double-blind study of the effect of spironolactone on mortality in patients with highly symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. To be eligible to participate patients had to have an ejection fraction of ≤ 35%, NYHA class III-IV symptoms, and a history of NYHA class IV symptoms within the last 6 months before enrollment. Patients with a baseline serum creatinine of > 2.5 mg/dL or a recent increase of 25% or with a baseline serum potassium of > 5.0 mEq/L were excluded.

Follow-up visits and laboratory measurements (including serum potassium and creatinine) were performed every four weeks for the first 12 weeks, then every 3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

The initial dose of spironolactone was 25 mg once daily. Patients who were intolerant of the initial dosage regimen had their dose decreased to one 25 mg tablet every other day at one to four weeks. Patients who were tolerant of one tablet daily at 8 weeks may have had their dose increased to 50 mg daily at the discretion of the investigator. The mean daily dose at study end for patients randomized to spironolactone was 26 mg.

Mineralocorticoid antagonists in HFpEF — MRAs significantly improve measures of diastolic function in individuals with HFpEF, and spironolactone may reduce the risk of hospitalizations for HF in specific subsets of individuals with HFpEF; however, appropriate monitoring of potassium and kidney function are warranted to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia and worsening kidney function. In TOPCAT, 3,445 individuals with HF and LVEF ≥ 45% were randomized to spironolactone (15–45 mg daily) or placebo; the initially published results did not show a significant benefit in the primary composite outcome (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.77–1.04), although there was a significant reduction in hospitalization for HF (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69–0.99).

### The effect of spironolactone use on heart failure mortality: a population-based study [^116LLLeQ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Spironolactone use for heart failure (HF) has increased dramatically after the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study trial; yet, few studies have examined its real-world impact. We aimed to determine the population effect of spironolactone use on mortality in HF patients discharged from hospital.

Methods and Results

All patients discharged alive between October 1997 and December 2001 in Nova Scotia, Canada, with a primary diagnosis of HF were enrolled in the Improving Cardiovascular Outcomes Study. Two year, all-cause mortality was the primary end point. A total of 7816 patients were identified, of whom 644 (8%) were discharged home on spironolactone. After adjusting for differences in clinical covariates, spironolactone use did not emerge as an independent predictor of long-term survival (OR 0.97, P = 0.80). When only the subgroup of patients enrolled in a HF clinic were included (n = 990), spironolactone use was associated with reduced rates of all-cause mortality at 2 years (OR 0.52, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Although spironolactone use was not associated with improved long-term survival in the general HF population, it was associated with improved long-term survival in patients enrolled in HF clinics. These data highlight the challenges of knowledge translation from a clinical trial into practice.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses (2.3).
Edema: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses (2.4).
Primary hyperaldosteronism: Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient (2.5).

2.1	General Considerations

ALDACTONE can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2	Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m², initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m², consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3	Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4	Treatment of Edema

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The recommended initial daily dosage is 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

2.5	Treatment of Primary Hyperaldosteronism

Administer ALDACTONE in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, ALDACTONE can be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Spironolactone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112RMVNt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study TOPCAT was published by Pitt B and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the TOPCAT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF? In the TOPCAT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TOPCAT study, the population was: 3445 patients (1775 female, 1670 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HFpEF. The key exclusion criteria were severe systemic illness with a life expectancy of < 3 years, severe renal dysfunction, and specific coexisting conditions, medications, or acute events. In the TOPCAT study, the interventions were: n = 1722 spironolactone (15–45 mg/day) n = 1723 placebo (matching placebo). In the TOPCAT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF (18.6% vs. 20.4%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04). In the TOPCAT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for HF (12% vs. 14.2%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (9.3% vs. 10.2%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12) No significant difference in aborted cardiac arrest (0.2% vs. 0.3%; HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.5). In the TOPCAT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, serum creatinine level ≥ 3.0 mmg/dL, or dialysis. significant difference in hyperkalemia (18.7% vs. 9.1%) and hypokalemia (16.2% vs. 22.9%). In the TOPCAT study, the conclusion was: in patients with HFpEF, spironolactone was not superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonists — initiation and monitoring: Spironolactone should be initiated at a dose of 12.5 to 25 mg daily, or occasionally on alternate days, and eplerenone was used at 25 mg per day, increasing to 50 mg daily. Potassium supplementation is generally stopped after initiation, patients should be counseled to avoid high potassium-containing foods, and patients should be cautioned to avoid the addition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. Potassium levels and renal function should be rechecked within 3 days and again at 1 week after initiation; subsequent monitoring should occur at least monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter, with any addition or increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) triggering a new cycle of monitoring. In view of hyperkalemia risk, the Writing Committee recommends that the routine triple combination of ACEIs, ARBs, and an aldosterone antagonist be avoided. The development of potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mEq per liter should generally trigger discontinuation or dose reduction of the aldosterone antagonist, and patients should be instructed specifically to stop the aldosterone antagonist during an episode of diarrhea or while loop diuretic therapy is interrupted.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: integrating evidence into clinical practice [^117X5UBu]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve survival and reduce morbidity in patients with heart failure, reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF), and mild-to-severe symptoms, and in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. These clinical benefits are observed in addition to those of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers. The morbidity and mortality benefits of MRAs may be mediated by several proposed actions, including antifibrotic mechanisms that slow heart failure progression, prevent or reverse cardiac remodelling, or reduce arrhythmogenesis. Both eplerenone and spironolactone have demonstrated survival benefits in individual clinical trials. Pharmacologic differences exist between the drugs, which may be relevant for therapeutic decision making in individual patients. Although serious hyperkalaemia events were reported in the major MRA clinical trials, these risks can be mitigated through appropriate patient selection, dose selection, patient education, monitoring, and follow-up. When used appropriately, MRAs significantly improve outcomes across the spectrum of patients with HF-REF.

### Effectiveness and safety of early treatment with spironolactone for new-onset acute heart failure [^114A4mdp]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The effectiveness and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in acute heart failure (HF) is uncertain. We sought to describe the prescription of spironolactone during acute HF and whether early treatment is effective and safe in a real-world setting.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult (≥ 18 years) nonpregnant patients hospitalized with new-onset HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, defined by ejection fraction ≤ 40%) within 15 Kaiser Permanente Southern California medical centers between 2016 and 2021. Early treatment was defined by spironolactone prescription at discharge. The primary effectiveness outcome was a composite of HF readmission or all-cause mortality at 180 days. Safety outcomes were hypotension and hyperkalemia at 90 days.

Results

Among 2318 HFrEF patients, 368 (15.9%) were treated with spironolactone at discharge. After 1:2 propensity score matching, 354 early treatment and 708 delayed/no treatment patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 63 (IQR: 52–74) years; 61.6% were male, and 38.6% were White. By 90 days, ~20% had crossed over in the two groups. Early treatment was not associated with the composite outcome at 180 days (HR [95% CI]: 0.81 [0.56–1.17]), but a trend towards benefit by 365 days that did not reach statistical significance (0.78 [0.58–1.06]). Early treatment was also associated with hyperkalemia (subdistribution HR [95% CI]: 2.33 [1.30–4.18]) but not hypotension (0.93 [0.51–1.72]).

Conclusions

Early treatment with spironolactone at discharge for new-onset HFrEF in a real-world setting did not reduce the risk of HF readmission or mortality in the first year after discharge. The risk of hyperkalemia was increased.

### Aldosterone receptor antagonists in cardiovascular disease: a review of the recent literature and insight into potential future indications [^111s7U1t]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials demonstrate the efficacy of aldosterone receptor antagonists (spironolactone and eplerenone) as a useful pharmacologic intervention specifically in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV heart failure, in patients with an ejection fraction < 40% after myocardial infarction, and most recently in patients with mildly symptomatic heart failure. However, aldosterone receptor antagonists may be beneficial in a broader patient population. Aldosterone receptor antagonists can potentially serve as an antiarrhythmic pharmacologic agent for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, an anti-ischemic medication in coronary artery disease through prevention of myocardial fibrosis and vascular damage, and as an agent in people with asymptomatic and mild heart failure (NYHA classes I and II) and diastolic heart failure. However, many clinicians remain reluctant to prescribe this highly efficacious pharmacologic therapy for a variety of reasons, including concerns about polypharmacy and hyperkalemia. Recent observational analysis demonstrates that less than one-third of eligible patients hospitalized with heart failure actually received aldosterone antagonist therapy. This article will review the current and potential future uses of aldosterone receptor antagonists across the entire spectrum of cardiovascular disease. The authors have no funding, financial relationships, or conflicts of interest to disclose.

The study RALES was published by Pitt B and colleagues in 1999 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the RALES study, the trial question was: what is the role of spironolactone in patients with severe HF and a LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi? In the RALES study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the RALES study, the population was: 1663 patients (446 female, 1217 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe HF and an LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi. The key exclusion criteria were congenital heart disease, unstable angina, primary hepatic failure, active cancer, or any life-threatening disease (other than HF), or heart transplantation. In the RALES study, the interventions were: n = 822 spironolactone (25 mg daily) n = 841 placebo (matching placebo daily). In the RALES study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death at 24 months (35% vs. 46%; RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.82). In the RALES study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in frequency of hospitalization for worsening HF (26% vs. 35%; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.77) Significant increase in gynecomastia or breast pain (10% vs. 1%; RR 10, 95% CI 4.07 to 15.93). In the RALES study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious hyperkalemia. significant differences in gynecomastia or breast pain (10% vs. 1%, p < 0.001). In the RALES study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe HF and an LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi, spironolactone was superior to placebo with respect to death at 24 months.

### Effectiveness and safety of spironolactone for systolic heart failure [^117Gvevq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Aldosterone receptor antagonists have been shown in randomized trials to reduce morbidity and mortality in adults with symptomatic systolic heart failure. We studied the effectiveness and safety of spironolactone in adults with newly diagnosed systolic heart failure in clinical practice. We identified all adults with newly diagnosed heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction of < 40%, and no previous spironolactone use from 2006 to 2008 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We excluded patients with baseline serum creatinine level of > 2.5 mg/dl or a serum potassium level of > 5.0 mEq/L. We used Cox regression with time-varying covariates to evaluate the independent association between spironolactone use and death, hospitalization, severe hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. Among 2,538 eligible patients with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 521 patients (22%) initiated spironolactone, which was not associated with risk of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.08) or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.93, confidence interval 0.60 to 1.44). Crude rates of severe hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury during spironolactone use were similar to that seen in clinical trials. Spironolactone was independently associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of hyperkalemia but not with acute kidney injury. Within a diverse community-based cohort with incident systolic heart failure, use of spironolactone was not independently associated with risks of hospitalization or death. Our findings suggest that the benefits of spironolactone in clinical practice may be reduced compared with other guideline-recommended medications.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — diuretic therapy management and risks: Electrolyte imbalances should be treated aggressively and the diuresis continued, and if hypotension or azotemia occurs the physician may elect to slow the rapidity of diuresis, but diuresis should nevertheless be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated, even if this strategy results in mild or moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Once fluid retention has resolved, treatment with the diuretic should be maintained to prevent the recurrence of volume overload, with dose adjustment often accomplished by having patients record their weight each day and make changes in their diuretic dosage if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Patients may become unresponsive to high doses if they consume large amounts of dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block the effects of diuretics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo- oxygenase-2 inhibitors), or have a significant impairment of renal function or perfusion, but diuretic resistance can generally be overcome by the intravenous administration of diuretics (including the use of continuous infusions), the use of 2 or more diuretics in combination (e.g., furosemide and metolazone), or the use of diuretics together with drugs that increase renal blood flow (e.g., positive inotropic agents). Diuretics can cause the depletion of potassium and magnesium and can predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis therapy, and the risk of electrolyte depletion is markedly enhanced when 2 diuretics are used in combination; concomitant administration of ACEIs alone or in combination with potassium-retaining agents (such as spironolactone) can prevent electrolyte depletion in most patients with HF who are taking a loop diuretic, and when these drugs are prescribed, long-term oral potassium supplementation is generally not needed and may be deleterious. Excessive use of diuretics can decrease blood pressure and impair renal function and exercise tolerance; if there are no signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia are likely to be related to volume depletion and may resolve after a reduction in diuretic dose, whereas the signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia, are likely to reflect worsening HF and a decline in effective peripheral perfusion, which is an ominous clinical scenario and necessitates considering the measures discussed under Stage D HF.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116HAUpi]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spans trials enrolling patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, ≤ 40%, and ≤ 30%. For spironolactone and eplerenone, the starting dose is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 50 mg daily orally after a month; for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 31 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m², dosing should be reduced by half, and regular checks of serum potassium and renal function are advised approximately 1 week, then 4 weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or intensifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical instability. Safety concerns include when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and when MRA is initiated at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued ≥ 5.5 mEq/L; in trials, clinically significant hyperkalemia events were < 10% in EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF. Coadministration of MRA with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) mildly increases hyperkalemia risk, hyperkalemia risk was lower with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic heart failure but not different in decompensated heart failure when compared with ACEi, diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic therapy interruption should be a consideration for temporarily holding the MRA, and the efficacy of potassium binders (for example, patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to facilitate continuation of MRA is uncertain.

### Eplerenone for hypertension [^116c6gYm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eplerenone is an aldosterone receptor blocker that is chemically derived from spironolactone. In Canada, it is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to reduce mortality for heart failure patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II systolic chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It is also used as adjunctive therapy for patients with heart failure following myocardial infarction. Additionally, it is indicated for the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension for patients who cannot be treated adequately with other agents. It is important to determine the clinical impact of all antihypertensive medications, including aldosterone antagonists, to support their continued use in essential hypertension. No previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effect of eplerenone on cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and magnitude of blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of eplerenone monotherapy versus placebo for primary hypertension in adults. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular events (fatal or non fatal strokes), adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 3 March 2016. We handsearched references from retrieved studies to identify any studies missed in the initial search. We also searched for unpublished data by contacting the corresponding authors of the included studies and pharmaceutical companies involved in conducting studies on eplerenone monotherapy in primary hypertension. The search had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomized placebo-controlled trials studying adult patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies in people with secondary or gestational hypertension and studies where participants were receiving multiple antihypertensives.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. A fourth independent review author resolved discrepancies or disagreements. We performed data extraction and synthesis using a standardized format on Covidence. We conducted data analysis using Review Manager 5.

Main Results

A total of 1437 adult patients participated in the five randomized parallel group studies, with treatment durations ranging from 8 to 16 weeks. The daily doses of eplerenone ranged from 25 mg to 400 mg daily. Meta-analysis of these studies showed a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 9.21 mmHg (95% CI -11.08 to -7.34; I² = 58%) and a reduction of diastolic pressure of 4.18 mmHg (95% CI -5.03 to -3.33; I² = 0%) (moderate quality evidence). There may be a dose response effect for eplerenone in the reduction in systolic blood pressure at doses of 400 mg/day. However, this finding is uncertain, as it is based on a single included study with low quality evidence. Overall there does not appear to be a clinically important dose response in lowering systolic or diastolic blood pressure at eplerenone doses of 50 mg to 400 mg daily. There did not appear to be any differences in the number of patients who withdrew due to adverse events or the number of patients with at least one adverse event in the eplerenone group compared to placebo. However, only three of the five included studies reported adverse events. Most of the included studies were of moderate quality, as we judged multiple domains as being at unclear risk in the 'Risk of bias' assessment.

Authors' Conclusions

Eplerenone 50 to 200 mg/day lowers blood pressure in people with primary hypertension by 9.21 mmHg systolic and 4.18 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo, with no difference of effect between doses of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. A dose of 25 mg/day did not produce a statistically significant reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure and there is insufficient evidence for doses above 200 mg/day. There is currently no available evidence to determine the effect of eplerenone on clinically meaningful outcomes such as mortality or morbidity in hypertensive patients. The evidence available on side effects is insufficient and of low quality, which makes it impossible to draw conclusions about potential harm associated with eplerenone treatment in hypertensive patients.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — spironolactone (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist): In TOPCAT, the composite of death, aborted cardiac death, and HF hospitalization showed a small, non-significant reduction (HR, 0.89), while HF hospitalization was reduced (HR, 0.83) and hyperkalemia and creatinine increases were more common; efficacy was observed in the Americas (HR 0.83) but not Russia-Georgia (HR 1.10). Analyses suggest potential benefit in appropriately selected symptomatic HFpEF patients meeting LVEF ≥ 45%, elevated BNP or HF admission within 1 year, eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL, and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and follow-up; post hoc analysis suggested greater efficacy at the lower end of the LVEF spectrum.

### Usefulness of spironolactone in a specialized heart failure clinic [^112yFFjx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Several case series published after the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) have focused on the adverse effects of spironolactone when prescribed to participants not in a trial and the appropriateness of these prescribing practices; however, there is a paucity of data on potential benefits in patients not in a trial. Therefore, we examined data from a prospective cohort study of 1,037 patients with heart failure seen at the University of Alberta Heart Function Clinic. Median age was 69 years, 66% were men, 75% had systolic dysfunction, and mean ejection fraction was 33%. Only 40% of the 136 patients prescribed spironolactone had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms, and < 25% fulfilled all of the RALES eligibility criteria. Mean daily dose of spironolactone was 23.9 mg; 25% of patients had spironolactone withdrawn after initiation, mostly due to increases in potassium and/or creatinine (9%), gynecomastia (5%), or dehydration/hyponatremia (6%). Only 1 of our spironolactone-treated patients developed serum potassium > 6 mmol/L. Cox's proportional hazards analysis confirmed the association between use of spironolactone and increased survival rate (relative risk 0.09, 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.39), even though 78% of our patients did not fulfill the RALES eligibility criteria. Thus, although the complication rate was higher, the benefits of spironolactone seen in RALES extended to participants not in a trial who were treated with similar doses and followed closely in a clinic specializing in heart failure.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on clinical assessment, management, and trajectory of patients hospitalized with heart Failure focused update: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115Ebf5o]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

SGLT inhibitors and MRAs during HF hospitalization — SGLT inhibitors are "now recommended in all outpatients with HF", and "newer evidence indicates that they enhance decongestion during hospitalization". Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists "are recommended to decrease hospitalizations and mortality for outpatients with HFrEF and serum creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL in men and ≤ 2.0 mg/dL in women with stable potassium handling and anticipated access to frequent monitoring of electrolytes after discharge", but "no specific benefit has been demonstrated from initiation during hospitalization". In a randomized blinded trial, "100 mg of spironolactone compared to 0 to 25 mg spironolactone for 96 hours after admission did not increase acute diuresis, relieve clinical congestion, or decrease natriuretic peptide levels in hospital, but was shown to be safe in the hospital setting, where it can be initiated early in the absence of contraindications". Early initiation of other classes is also supported, as beta-blockers and RAS inhibitors were "shown in early studies to improve outcomes when initiated during hospitalization", and after stabilization "sacubitril/valsartan further decreased natriuretic peptide levels compared with enalapril during 8 to 12 weeks, with a trend for early reductions in hospitalization and mortality".

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonist therapy — hyperkalemia risk minimization: Impaired renal function is a risk factor for hyperkalemia during treatment with aldosterone antagonists, and risk increases when serum creatinine exceeds 1.6 mg per dL; in patients in whom creatinine may not reflect filtration, determination that glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance exceeds 30 mL per min is recommended. Aldosterone antagonists should not be administered to patients with baseline serum potassium in excess of 5.0 mEq per liter. An initial dose of spironolactone 12.5 mg or eplerenone 25 mg is recommended, with possible increase to spironolactone 25 mg or eplerenone 50 mg as appropriate. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with concomitant higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (captopril greater than or equal to 75 mg daily; enalapril or lisinopril greater than or equal to 10 mg daily); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be avoided, and potassium supplements should be discontinued or reduced. Close monitoring is required: potassium levels and renal function should be checked in 3 days and at 1 week after initiation of therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 months, and diarrhea or other causes of dehydration should be addressed emergently. Although trial entry allowed creatinine greater than 2.5 mg per dL, in 1 trial 95% of patients had creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg per dL, indicating most studied patients had better renal function than the entry limit.

### Appropriateness of spironolactone prescribing in heart failure patients: a population-based study [^115jxk7d]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) established the safety and benefit of spironolactone for heart failure (HF) patients with systolic dysfunction. However, recent data have raised concerns regarding hyperkalemia secondary to spironolactone use and suggest it occurs more commonly in routine practice.

Methods and Results

We explored factors potentially associated with hyperkalemia from spironolactone therapy in a population-based cohort of 9165 HF patients hospitalized in Ontario, Canada, between 1999 and 2001. Compared with patients enrolled in RALES, community-based patients were older (mean age 75 years versus 65 years, P < .001) and were more likely to be female (50% versus 27%, P < .001). Of the 1502 patients that were prescribed spironolactone at discharge, 18% had elevated serum potassium levels (> 5 mmol/L) during hospitalization and 23% were discharged on concurrent potassium supplements. Although only 8% of patients had serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, many patients had stage III (53.1%), stage IV (12.8%), or stage V (3.9%) chronic renal insufficiency according to glomerular filtration rate.

Conclusion

Spironolactone was often prescribed to inappropriate HF candidates because of the presence of relative or absolute contraindications. These findings highlight the need for more careful patient selection when prescribing spironolactone to minimize potential life-threatening hyperkalemia.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^115yovp1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

### Spironolactone and resistant hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114EU3pK]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recent evidence suggests that the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone should be the preferred fourth-line antihypertensive treatment in resistant hypertension (RHTN). Whether spironolactone improves blood pressure (BP) control in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and RHTN is unknown.

Methods

We identified patients with RHTN, defined as baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 140 and 160 mm Hg on 3 or more medications, in the Americas cohort of the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist trial, in which patients with HFpEF were randomized to spironolactone vs. placebo. We evaluated the effects of spironolactone vs. placebo on BP reduction in this group and related this to the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for heart failure.

Results

We identified 403 participants in the Americas with RHTN. Compared to people without RHTN, those with RHTN were more frequently women, non-White, diabetics, with a higher left ventricular ejection fraction and body mass index, and a lower hemoglobin concentration. In the RHTN group, spironolactone resulted in a decrease of SBP: -6.1 (-8.9, -3.3); P < 0.001 and diastolic BP: -2.9 (-4.6, -1.2); P = 0.001 mm Hg during the first 8 months. BP became controlled after 4 weeks in 63% of patients receiving spironolactone vs. 46% receiving placebo (P = 0.003), with similar responses at 8 weeks, 4 and 8 months. Patients with RHTN derived similar overall benefit from spironolactone on the primary outcomes as those without.

Conclusions

In HFpEF patients with RHTN, spironolactone lowered BP substantially and was associated with similar benefit as those without RHTN.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^111kz9M1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1 	Heart Failure

The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) was a placebo controlled, double-blind study of the effect of spironolactone on mortality in patients with highly symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. To be eligible to participate patients had to have an ejection fraction of ≤ 35%, NYHA class III–IV symptoms, and a history of NYHA class IV symptoms within the last 6 months before enrollment. Patients with a baseline serum creatinine of > 2.5 mg/dL or a recent increase of 25% or with a baseline serum potassium of > 5.0 mEq/L were excluded.

Follow-up visits and laboratory measurements (including serum potassium and creatinine) were performed every four weeks for the first 12 weeks, then every 3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

The initial dose of spironolactone was 25 mg once daily. Patients who were intolerant of the initial dosage regimen had their dose decreased to one 25 mg tablet every other day at one to four weeks. Patients who were tolerant of one tablet daily at 8 weeks may have had their dose increased to 50 mg daily at the discretion of the investigator. The mean daily dose at study end for patients randomized to spironolactone was 26 mg.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): rationale and design [^112Qh78D]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

‐intervention, study visits and follow‐up

Patients are randomized 1:1 to open‐label MRA (either spironolactone or eplerenone) plus usual care versus usual care alone. Patients randomized to MRA receive a prescription to be filled and paid for out of pocket. (In both Sweden and the US, spironolactone can be obtained for approximately 10 US cents per day. In Sweden, patients pay out‐of‐pocket for prescription medications up to an annual maximum of approximately 250 Euro, after which additional medication costs are covered by the government). Spironolactone is more potent than eplerenone, but the initial dose in guidelines and clinical practice is generally 25 mg/day for both drugs and is the dose recommended in SPIRRIT‐HFpEF. A dose of 25 mg every other day or 25 mg, half tablet every day, may be prescribed at investigator discretion for patients judged to be at higher risk of hyperkalaemia or kidney dysfunction. Patients who at baseline are known not to tolerate spironolactone due to gynecomastia or who prefer eplerenone will be prescribed eplerenone. Eplerenone is relatively inexpensive, although more expensive than spironolactone. Spironolactone (or eplerenone) is recommended to be increased to a target dose of 50 mg daily if tolerated.

Most previous RRCTs in Sweden have involved one‐time interventions (i.e. not chronic therapy) without the need for monitoring during follow‐up. Spironolactone is familiar to all clinicians but is associated with a risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening kidney function. Therefore, there are no required in‐person follow‐up visits in the trial, but potassium and eGFR are measured for all patients in both groups at local laboratories at weeks 1, 4, 26, and 52 after randomization, at end of study, 7–14 days after any dose changes, and as needed at the discretion of the investigator. Local sites order blood tests, instruct patients to have blood drawn at their local clinic, and these laboratory results are then available to investigators in Sweden from regional electronic health records, and in the US laboratory data are acquired from site investigators from individual testing sites and/or the electronic medical record. After obtaining the laboratory result, the investigator or study coordinator has telephone contact with the patient and provides instruction on continued treatment and records any events, laboratory values, and treatment decisions in a separate case report form.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^112KYf83]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1663 patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone or placebo. 87% of patients were white, 7% black, 2% Asian. 73% were male and median age was 67. The median ejection fraction was 26%. 70% were NYHA class III and 29% class IV. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 55%, and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 28%, of hypertension in 24%, and of diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

At baseline 100% of patients were taking loop diuretic and 95% were taking an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

The primary endpoint for RALES was time to all-cause mortality. RALES was terminated early because of significant mortality benefit demonstrated during a planned interim analysis. Compared to placebo, spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (defined as worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).

The survival curves by treatment group are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Survival by Treatment Group in RALES

Mortality hazard ratios for some subgroups are shown in Figure 2. The favorable effect of spironolactone on mortality appeared similar for both genders and all age groups except patients younger than 55. There were too few non-whites in RALES to evaluate if the effects differ by race. Spironolactone's benefit appeared greater in patients with low baseline serum potassium levels and less in patients with ejection fractions < 0.2. These subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously.

### Incidence, predictors, and outcomes related to hypo-and hyperkalemia in patients with severe heart failure treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist [^113Toagh]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure but can cause hyperkalemia, which contributes to reduced use of these drugs. Hypokalemia also leads to worse outcomes in patients with heart failure and may be attenuated by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Methods and Results

We assessed incidence and predictors of hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) and hypokalemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/L) and the relationship to outcomes in 1663 patients with class III or IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% randomized to treatment with spironolactone 25 mg or placebo in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) trial. All-cause mortality rates and the influence of potassium levels on the effectiveness of spironolactone were assessed in a landmark analysis and in relation to time-varying potassium levels. After 1 month, mean potassium levels increased in the spironolactone group but not in the placebo group (4.54 ± 0.49 versus 4.28 ± 0.50 mmol/L; P < 0.001) and remained elevated during the trial. Although the extremes of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia at 4 weeks were associated with increased risk of mortality in both treatment arms, participants in the spironolactone arm had lower mortality rates at all potassium levels throughout the duration of the trial. The treatment benefit of spironolactone was maintained at least until potassium exceeded 5.5 mmol/L.

Conclusions

With appropriate surveillance of potassium and creatinine, the use of spironolactone was associated with less hypokalemia and improved survival in patients with severe heart failure even in the setting of moderate hyperkalemia.

### Potassium binders for patients with heart failure? The real enlightenment of the DIAMOND trial [^111bwiFw]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The RALES and EMPHASIS-HF trials

The RALES trial studied patients with severe HFrEF not generally receiving beta-blockers, who were randomized to spironolactone 25 mg/day or placebo for a mean of 24 months. In a pilot trial, doses from 12.5 mg/day to 75 mg/day had produced meaningful decreases in natriuretic peptides, with minimal incremental effect but more hyperkalaemia at doses > 25 mg/day. Accordingly, 25 mg/day was designated as the target dose for spironolactone in RALES, and it is the target dose in clinical practice. In RALES, 50 mg/day could be prescribed if, after 8 weeks, patients experienced progression of heart failure without hyperkalaemia. However, up-titration did not occur in most patients; the mean dose was 26 mg/day. At this dose, spironolactone reduced all-cause mortality by 30% and hospitalizations for heart failure by 35%. A serum potassium concentration ≥ 5.5 mmol/L was seen in 5.5% of the placebo group, in 13.5% taking 25 mg/day, and in 41% taking 50 mg daily. Serious hyperkalaemia was observed in 1–2% of patients.

The EMPHASIS-HF trial enrolled patients with mild HFrEF treated with beta-blockers, who received eplerenone 25 mg/day or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by 50 mg/day for a mean of 21 months, if they had preserved renal function. The doses were halved in those with chronic kidney disease. There is a 2:1 to 4:1 ratio between pharmacodynamically equivalent doses of eplerenone and spironolactone. Eplerenone reduced all-cause mortality by 24% and hospitalizations for heart failure by 42%. A serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mmol/L was reported in 7.2% and 11.8% of the placebo and eplerenone groups, respectively. A serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L was noted in ∼2%.

### Under-utilization of evidence-based drug treatment in patients with heart failure is only partially explained by dissimilarity to patients enrolled in landmark trials: a report from the euro heart survey on heart failure [^116gHj8i]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Surveys on heart failure management suggest under-utilization of life-saving evidence-based treatment. Evidence-based medicine and clinical guidelines are based on the results of randomized controlled trials. Therefore, we investigated how patients who fulfilled the enrolment criteria of randomized trials were treated in real life.

Methods and Results

We selected three large placebo-controlled trials of patients with chronic heart failure, in which ACE-inhibitors (ACE-Is), beta-blockers, and spironolactone proved to be safe and effective. The major enrolment criteria of trials were identified and applied to patients enrolled in the Euro Heart Survey on Heart Failure to identify the proportion of patients eligible for treatment and also treated appropriately. Of the 10 701 patients who were enrolled in the Euro Heart Survey on Heart Failure, only a small percentage (13%) would have qualified for participation in at least one of the selected trials. Patients who fulfilled enrolment criteria of the identified trials were more likely to be treated with ACE-Is (83% of SOLVD-eligible patients), beta-blockers (54% of MERIT-HF-eligible patients), and aldosterone antagonists (43% of RALES-eligible patients) than trial-ineligible patients. Almost half of SOLVD-eligible patients who were treated with ACE-Is received the target dose as recommended in the guidelines, but only < 10% of MERIT-HF eligible patients who were treated with beta-blockers received the target dose.

Conclusion

ACE-Is are widely utilized but given in lower doses than proven effective in clinical trials. beta-Blockers are underused and given in lower doses to patients who fulfil the enrolment criteria of relevant landmark trials.

### Spironolactone reduces the risk of death in veterans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^11731xsS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large observational study using real‐world electronic health record data in a well‐curated national patient cohort with HFpEF, we demonstrate a significantly reduced mortality rate in HFpEF treated with spironolactone and extend the results of the TOPCAT study demonstrating benefit in a real‐world population.

Real‐world data can confirm the benefits observed in a clinical trial on a larger scale. For example, the largest meta‐analyses assessing death and hospitalization outcomes included no more than 3 trials and 2000 spironolactone users, while our study had 3690 HFpEF spironolactone users. However, generating real‐world evidence from real‐world data requires surmounting many confounders and selection biases that are less prevalent in a randomized clinical trial; we addressed these issues using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights and performing multiple sensitivity analyses with varied censoring times. To account for the lag period between initiation of spironolactone and beneficial effects observed in TOPCAT and RALES, we did not attribute events to either treatment group during the 1‐year adherence period. Similarly, given that over half of spironolactone users stopped use before the end of follow‐up and to minimize misclassification of treatment effects after discontinuation of spironolactone, we performed multiple sensitivity analyses extending the follow‐up period beyond discontinuation for varying lengths and demonstrated a gradual decline in effect with increased follow‐up time. Additionally, analyses distinguishing spironolactone initiation before and after diagnosis demonstrated minimal difference in effect and hence justified combining prevalent and new users. The significant improvement in survival seen in our study at variance with past trials and meta‐analyses, could be due to the sicker population, higher mortality rate, and longer follow‐up period in our real‐world study compared with prior trials. Cumulatively, our analyses using orthogonal approaches to reduce confounding indicated a benefit of spironolactone in a real‐world HFpEF population.

### Is spironolactone safe for dialysis patients? [^117RQVdb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Spironolactone is useful in heart failure, but is not given to dialysis patients for fear of hyperkalaemia. This study evaluated the safety of spironolactone administration in haemodialysis patients.

Methods

Fifteen haemodialysis outpatients with mean serum potassium < 5.6 mEq/l over the preceding 4 months were treated with spironolactone 25 mg daily for 28 days. Serum potassium was measured before every haemodialysis during the study. Aldosterone and renin were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Patients were monitored for side effects. Data were examined with a paired t-test, with patients serving as their own controls and P < 0.05 considered significant. A sample size of 14 was required to achieve a power of 0.8 and a P = 0.05 to detect a potassium difference of 0.5 ± 0.6 mEq/l. All patients were analysed as intention-to-treat.

Results

The mean potassium level was 4.6 ± 0.6 mEq/l at baseline and 4.9 ± 0.9 mEq/l at study completion (P = 0.14). Thirteen patients completed the trial with no potassium levels > 6.0 mEq/l. Four patients had potassium levels between 5.5 and 6.0 mEq/l. One patient was withdrawn at day 20 after developing hyperkalaemia (7.6 mEq/l). Another patient was withdrawn at day 25 after missing a dialysis treatment. There were no differences in either baseline or 28 day aldosterone or renin levels (16.8 ± 28.8 vs 11.7 ± 6.1 ng/dl and 3.5 ± 3.9 vs 3.5 ± 3.5 ng/ml/h, respectively). Infrequent side effects included dry mouth, nosebleed, pruritus, gynecomastia and diarrhoea. No significant leukopenia or anaemia was noted.

Conclusions

Spironolactone may be considered as a treatment option for selected chronic haemodialysis patients with heart disease.

### Association of spironolactone use with all-cause mortality in heart failure: a propensity scored cohort study [^114LKuak]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In 3 randomized controlled trials in heart failure (HF), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduced mortality. The net benefit from randomized controlled trials may not be generalizable, and eplerenone was, but spironolactone was not, studied in mild HF. We tested the hypothesis that spironolactone is associated with reduced mortality also in a broad unselected contemporary population with HF and reduced ejection fraction, in particular New York Heart Association (NYHA) I-II.

Methods and Results

We prospectively studied 18 852 patients (age 71 ± 12 years; 28% women) with NYHA I-IV and ejection fraction < 40% who were registered in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry between 2000 and 2012 and who were (n = 6551) or were not (n = 12 301) treated with spironolactone. We derived propensity scores for spironolactone treatment based on 41 covariates. We assessed survival by Cox regression with adjustment for propensity scores and with matching based on propensity score. We performed sensitivity and residual confounding analyses and analyzed the NYHA I-II and III-IV subgroups separately. One-year survival was 83% versus 84% in treated versus untreated patients (log rank P < 0.001). After adjustment for propensity scores, the hazard ratio for spironolactone was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.11; P = 0.054). Spironolactone interacted with NYHA (P < 0.001). In the NYHA I-II subgroup, after adjustment for propensity scores, the hazard ratio for spironolactone was 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.21; P = 0.019).

Conclusions

In an unselected contemporary population of HF with reduced ejection fraction, spironolactone was not associated with reduced mortality. The net benefits of spironolactone may be lower outside the clinical trial setting and in milder HF.

### Life-threatening hyperkalemia: a complication of spironolactone for heart failure in a patient with renal insufficiency [^111niG78]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Implications

Serum potassium concentration should be measured immediately before operation to detect hyperkalemia in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone. Renal insufficiency, advanced age, potassium supplementation, decompensated congestive heart failure, and a spironolactone dose larger than 25 mg/d increase the risk of hyperkalemia as a consequence of spironolactone therapy.

The ATHENA-HF (Aldosterone Targeted Neurohormonal Combined with Natriuresis Therapy in Heart Failure) clinical trial found no improvements in natriuretic peptide levels or clinical congestion when spironolactone 100 mg/day for 96 hours was used in addition to usual treatment for acute heart failure.

Methods

We performed a post hoc analysis of ATHENA-HF to determine whether spironolactone treatment induced any detectable pharmacodynamic effects and whether patients with potentially greater aldosterone activity experienced additional decongestion. Trial subjects previously treated with spironolactone were excluded. We first examined for changes in renal potassium handling. Using the baseline serum potassium level as a surrogate marker of spironolactone activity, we then divided each treatment arm into tertiles of baseline serum potassium and explored for differences in laboratory and clinical congestion outcomes.

Results

Among spironolactone-naïve patients, the change in serum potassium did not differ after 24 hours or 48 hours but was significantly greater with spironolactone treatment compared to placebo at 72 hours (0.23 ± 0.55 vs 0.03 ± 0.60 mEq/L; P = 0.042) and 96 hours (0.32 ± 0.51 vs 0.13 ± 0.72 mEq/L; P = 0.046). Potassium supplementation was similar at treatment start and at 24 hours, but spironolactone-treated patients required substantially less potassium replacement at 48 hours (24% vs 36%; P = 0.048), 72 hours (21% vs 37%; P = 0.013), and 96 hours (11% vs 38%; P < 0.001). When the treatment arms were divided into tertiles of baseline serum potassium, there were no differences in the 96-hour log N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, net fluid loss, urine output, or dyspnea relief in any of the potassium groups, with no effect modification by treatment exposure.

Conclusions

Spironolactone 100 mg/day for 96 hours in patients receiving intravenous loop diuresis for acute heart failure has no clear added decongestive ability but does meaningfully limit potassium wasting.

### Carospir [^112Nf47L]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1663 patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone or placebo. 87% of patients were white, 7% black, and 2% Asian. 73% were male and median age was 67. The median ejection fraction was 26%. 70% were NYHA class III and 29% class IV. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 55%, and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 28%, of hypertension in 24%, and of diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

At baseline, 100% of patients were taking loop diuretic and 95% were taking an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

The primary endpoint for RALES was time to all-cause mortality. RALES was terminated early because of significant mortality benefit demonstrated during a planned interim analysis. Compared to placebo, spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (defined as worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).

The survival curves by treatment group are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Survival by Treatment Group in RALES

Mortality hazard ratios for subgroups were studied. The favorable effect of spironolactone on mortality appeared similar for both genders and all age groups except patients younger than 55. There were too few non-whites in RALES to evaluate if the effects differ by race. Spironolactone's benefit appeared greater in patients with low baseline serum potassium levels and less in patients with ejection fractions < 0.2. These subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure: an individual patient level meta-analysis [^11591dF5]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) reduce hospitalisations and death in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but the benefit in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is unclear. We evaluated the effect of MRAs in four trials that enrolled patients with heart failure across the range of ejection fraction.

Methods

This is a prespecified, individual patient level meta-analysis of the RALES (spironolactone) and EMPHASIS-HF (eplerenone) trials, which enrolled patients with HFrEF, and of the TOPCAT (spironolactone) and FINEARTS-HF (finerenone) trials, which enrolled patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF. The primary outcome of this meta-analysis was a composite of time to first hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death. We also estimated the effect of MRAs on components of this composite, total (first or repeat) heart failure hospitalisations (with and without cardiovascular deaths), and all-cause death. Safety outcomes were also assessed, including serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum potassium, and systolic blood pressure. An interaction between trials and treatment was tested to examine the heterogeneity of effect in these populations. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024541487.

Findings

13846 patients were included in the four trials. MRAs reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalisation (hazard ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.72–0.83]). There was a statistically significant interaction by trials and treatment (p for interaction = 0.0012) due to the greater efficacy in HFrEF (0.66 [0.59–0.73]) compared with HFmrEF or HFpEF (0.87 [0.79–0.95]). We observed significant reductions in heart failure hospitalisation in the HFrEF trials (0.63 [0.55–0.72]) and the HFmrEF or HFpEF trials (0.82 [0.74–0.91]). The same pattern was observed for total heart failure hospitalisations with or without cardiovascular death. Cardiovascular death was reduced in the HFrEF trials (0.72 [0.63–0.82]) but not in the HFmrEF or HFpEF trials (0.92 [0.80–1.05]). All-cause death was also reduced in the HFrEF trials (0.73 [0.65–0.83]) but not in the HFmrEF or HFpEF trials (0.94 [0.85–1.03]). With an MRA, the risk of hyperkalaemia was doubled compared with placebo (odds ratio 2.27 [95% CI 2.02–2.56]), but the incidence of serious hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L) was low (2.9% vs 1.4%); the risk of hypokalaemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/L) was halved (0.51 [0.45–0.57]; 7% vs 14%).

Interpretation

Steroidal MRAs reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalisation in patients with HFrEF and non-steroidal MRAs reduce this risk in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): rationale and design [^1156CLXw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in heart failure with preserved and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF/HFmrEF) have not been established. Conventional randomized controlled trials are complex and expensive. The Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT‐HFpEF) is a unique pragmatic registry‐based randomized controlled trial.

Methods

SPIRRIT‐HFpEF is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded endpoint trial conducted on platforms in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) and the United States (US) Trial Innovation Network. Patients with HFpEF/HFmrEF are randomized 1:1 to spironolactone (or eplerenone) in addition to usual care, versus usual care alone. The primary outcome is total number of cardiovascular deaths and hospitalizations for heart failure. Outcomes are collected from Swedish administrative complete coverage registries and a US call centre and subsequently adjudicated. Simple eligibility criteria were based on data available in SwedeHF: heart failure as outpatient or at discharge from hospital, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%, N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide > 300 ng/L (in sinus rhythm) or > 750 ng/L (in atrial fibrillation), with pre‐specified adjustment for elevated body mass index, and chronic loop diuretic use. Power and sample size assessments were based on an event‐driven design allowing enrolment over approximately 6 years, and application of hazard ratios from the TOPCAT trial, Americas subset. The final sample size is expected to be approximately 2400 patients.

Conclusion

SPIRRIT‐HFpEF will be informative on the effectiveness of generic MRAs in HFpEF and HFmrEF, and on the feasibility of conducting pragmatic and registry‐based trials in heart failure and other chronic conditions.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs): Spironolactone showed heterogeneity by region, with benefit in North America (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69–0.98) and no benefit in Russia/Georgia (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.79–1.51), and evidence demonstrated undetectable canrenone in a larger proportion in Russia than the United States and Canada (30% vs 3%; P < 0.001), confirming regional variation in reported versus actual use; within the TOPCAT trial, benefit was most evident in the lower tertile of natriuretic peptides — B-type natriuretic peptide < 166 pg/mL and NT-proBNP < 682 pg/mL — among those with an LVEF < 60% and in women, with reductions in events similar across LVEF strata, and although MRAs have not improved quality of life or exercise tolerance, most individuals with HFpEF will still benefit from MRAs to provide balanced diuresis, control hypertension, and reduce HF hospitalizations.

### Race influences the safety and efficacy of spironolactone in severe heart failure [^114Wh3L6]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of hyperkalemia caused by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may vary by race, but whether race influences efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure (HF) is unknown.

Methods and Results

We assessed hyperkalemia and outcomes in African Americans (AAs; n = 120) and non-AAs (n = 1543; white 93%) with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV HF and left ventricular dysfunction who were randomized to spironolactone, titrated to 25 or 50 mg daily or placebo, in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES). AA participants were significantly younger, less likely to have an ischemic HF pathogenesis, more likely to be NYHA functional class IV, and more likely to have a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate and heart rate, less hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or history of myocardial infarction compared with non-AA participants. Potassium increased with spironolactone in non-AAs (4.29 ± 0.5–4.55 ± 0.49 mmol/L) but not in AAs (4.32 ± 0.54–4.31 ± 0.49 mmol/L; race by treatment interaction, P = 0.03) during the first month and remained higher throughout the trial. Compared with AAs, non-AAs were more likely to attain maximal spironolactone dose (13.9% versus 5.8%; P = 0.04) and had higher rates of hyperkalemia (potassium > 5.5 mmol/L; 9.7% versus 4.2%; P < 0.046), as well as lower rates of hypokalemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/L; 5.6% versus 17.9%; P < 0.001). After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics and achieved study drug dose, spironolactone reduced the combined end point of death or hospitalization for HF in non-AAs (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.73) but not in AAs (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.67–1.71; P value for interaction = 0.032).

Conclusions

AAs with HF exhibited less hyperkalemia and more hypokalemia with spironolactone compared with non-AAs and seemed to derive less clinical benefit. These hypothesis-generating findings suggest that safety and efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may differ by race.

### Spironolactone use at discharge was associated with improved survival in hospitalized patients with systolic heart failure [^112qerda]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The RALES trial demonstrated that spironolactone improved the prognosis of patients with heart failure (HF). However, it is unknown whether the discharge use of spironolactone is associated with better long-term outcomes among hospitalized systolic HF patients in routine clinical practice. We examined the effects of spironolactone use at discharge on mortality and rehospitalization by comparing with outcomes in patients who did not receive spironolactone.

Methods

The JCARE-CARD studied prospectively the characteristics and treatments in a broad sample of patients hospitalized with worsening HF and the outcomes were followed with an average of 2.2 years of follow-up.

Results

A total of 946 patients had HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (< 40%), among whom spironolactone was prescribed at discharge in 435 patients (46%), but not in 511 patients (54%). The mean age was 66.3 years and 72.2% were male. Etiology was ischemic in 39.7% and mean LVEF was 27.1%. After adjustment for covariates, discharge use of spironolactone was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.612, P = 0.020) and cardiac death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.524, P = 0.013).

Conclusions

Among patients with HF hospitalized for systolic dysfunction, spironolactone use at the time of discharge was associated with long-term survival benefit. These findings provide further support for the idea that spironolactone may be useful in patients hospitalized with HF and reduced LVEF.

### Barriers to adoption of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with heart failure: a mixed-methods study [^114QU53n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The management of heart failure (HF) poses a tremendous burden on patients, caregivers, and the health system. HF accounts for nearly 1 million annual hospitalizations in the United States 1 and > 3 million physician office visits. 2 With expected improvements in survival and the aging of the population, experts project that by 2030, 1 in every 33 US citizens will have a diagnosis of HF. 3 Consequently, it is imperative that cost‐effective and high‐value therapies are optimally implemented.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), most commonly spironolactone, are a class of drugs shown in randomized clinical trials to markedly reduce mortality, hospitalization, and sudden death in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction. 4, 5, 6 Prior studies, however, found that adoption of MRAs 7, 8, 9 was poor in outpatients with HF and in HF patients after hospitalization. In a national sample of > 12 000 patients hospitalized for HF who were candidates for an MRA, only one‐third received a prescription at discharge. Similarly, safety monitoring for hyperkalemia, a common adverse event of MRAs, is inadequate. In a sample of 122 US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals and > 175 000 patients with a diagnosis of HF, the hospital‐level average for patients receiving potassium monitoring within 14 days after initiation of an MRA was 37%. 10 Despite recognition of this gap, there is a dearth of empirical evidence regarding the reasons for low utilization and poor safety monitoring of MRAs. We used a mixed‐methods design to describe barriers to MRA use from the perspective of front‐line prescribing clinicians.

### Spironolactone reduces the risk of death in veterans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113KwGeT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone is a potassium‐sparing diuretic and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, which has been used to treat a wide range of conditions including cirrhosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, and hypertension. As demonstrated by the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial, spironolactone is an effective treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction. Given the success in HF with reduced ejection fraction and that spironolactone decreases the interstitial fibrotic process that is common in HFpEF, multiple clinical trials have investigated whether spironolactone also effectively treats HFpEF, with only a few that evaluated death and all‐cause hospitalization outcomes. Though findings varied across studies, and many lacked significant results, meta‐analysis pooling data suggest that spironolactone improves diastolic function and reduces blood pressure in HFpEF but had minimal effect on death and hospitalization outcomes. The largest trial thus far, the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial), also did not show a benefit on the primary composite outcome, although spironolactone did significantly reduce HF hospitalizations. Furthermore, wide regional variations may have contributed to the lack of a significant effect on the primary composite outcome in TOPCAT, because stratification by region demonstrated significant outcome improvements in the Americas but not in Russia and Georgiaand potential issues with adherence in Russia and Georgia. Additional trials, SPIRRIT‐HFPEF (Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) and SPIRIT‐HF (Spironolactone in the Treatment of Heart Failure), are currently underway to further assess the efficacy of spironolactone in HFpEF.

Based on the results of the TOPCAT trial, current guidelines include a IIb level of evidence recommendation for spironolactone in HFpEF. We conducted the current study to further investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone on death and hospitalization outcomes in a real‐world setting using national electronic health record data, to generate real‐world evidence for the effectiveness of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism in HFpEF.

### Effects of spironolactone on exercise blood pressure in patients at increased risk of developing heart failure: report from the HOMAGE trial [^115R4X3w]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Among the aforementioned trials, QoL was either not reported or did not change. However, in the EPHESUS study (39% women; mean age, 64 years), 6632 patients with reduced LVEF (HFrEF) following myocardial infarction were randomized to placebo or eplerenone (25–50 mg/day) and followed up for 16 months on average. Using the Swiss insurance system as reference, eplerenone was cost-effective in reducing mortality and increasing QoL. Compared to eplerenone, the affinity of spironolactone for androgen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors is 10²–10³ higher, potentially explaining why eplerenone increased QoL in EPHESUS, but not in the current study or other trials of spironolactone. In a trial set up to investigated whether treatment with spironolactone might be meaningful in the prevention of HF, community-dwelling subjects aged ≥ 65 years old, with at least one non-ischemic HF risk factor (hypertension, type-2 diabetes, or obesity) were randomized to echocardiography-guided therapy or usual care. LV dysfunction resolved more frequently with spironolactone than in untreated patients. However, the study was underpowered to determine whether screening-guided spironolactone therapy reduced incident HF because spironolactone was frequently discontinued due to the too strict renal function criteria.

### Safety of spironolactone use in ambulatory heart failure patients [^115NtECE]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Since the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES), the use of spironolactone is recommended in systolic heart failure (HF) patients that have been in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV. There is limited information on the use, side effects, and withdrawal rate of spironolactone in routine clinical practice.

Hypothesis

Side effects related to spironolactone use are more common than reported in clinical trials.

Methods

Patients who had moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) under optimized medical therapy were included. We introduced spironolactone in those with serum potassium (K+) ≤ 5 meq/L, and serum creatinine (Cr) ≤ 2.5 mg/dL. Spironolactone was withdrawn if serum K + ≥ 5.5 meq/L, serum Cr increased more than 30%- 50% of the baseline value, and/or if the patient had gynecomastia.

Results

We selected 134 patients followed in an HF clinic. In our sample, 56.7% of the patients (76 out of 134) were currently or had formerly been on spironolactone therapy. The rate of spironolactone withdrawal was 25% (19 out of 76). Reasons for suspension were hyperkalemia (17.1%), renal function deterioration (14.5%), gynecomastia (5.3% of males), and other reasons (1.3%).

Conclusion

Spironolactone side effects are common and are mostly related to effects on the angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Our results reinforce the need to closely monitor serum K+ and Cr levels in patients treated with spironolactone, as its side effects are more common than reported in clinical trials.

### Routine spironolactone in acute myocardial infarction [^116Awe3X]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study CLEAR (spironolactone) was published by Sanjit S Jolly and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the trial question was: what is the role of spironolactone in patients with myocardial infarction? In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the population was: 7062 patients (1438 female, 5624 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with myocardial infarction who had undergone PCI. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; pregnancy or lactation; SBP < 90 mmHg; active diarrhea; known allergy or contraindication to everolimus; unable to receive dual antiplatelet therapy; contraindication to spironolactone; cirrhosis or current severe hepatic disease. In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the interventions were: n = 3537 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg once daily) n = 3525 placebo (matching placebo). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or new or worsening HF (1.7/100 py vs. 2.1/100 py; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.21). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in first occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, new or worsening HF, or death from cardiovascular causes (7.9% vs. 8.3%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.81 to 1.13) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (3.2% vs. 3.3%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.27) No significant difference in new or worsening HF (1.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.16). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death from renal causes, dialysis, renal transplantation, or a sustained drop of at least 40% in the eGFR. significant difference in gynecomastia (2.3% vs. 0.5%). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the conclusion was: in patients with myocardial infarction who had undergone PCI, spironolactone was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or new or worsening HF.

### Patiromer use in patients with heart failure: lessons and clinical considerations from the DIAMOND trial [^11646Fin]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

The choice of target doses of the intervention in the DIAMOND trial was based on what was believed to be the best evidence for spironolactone and eplerenone. 2,3 In the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial, patients were started on spironolactone 25 mg/day with an option to down‐titrate to 25 mg every other day if there was an increase in serum potassium, or to up‐titrate to 50 mg/day after 8 weeks, if there were signs of worsening heart failure without hyperkaalemia. While the average dose of spironolactone was 26 mg/day, 50 mg/day dose was thought to be more effective based on the finding of a lower atrial natriuretic hormone levels in the RALES dose‐finding study. EMPHASIS‐HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure) used a starting dose of 25 mg/day with the option to up‐titrate to 50 mg/day. While many patients did not achieve this dose, this dosing strategy was chosen in line with the pivotal trials and a judgment based on higher doses not being assessed in earlier trials precisely due to risk of hyperkalaemia despite better surrogate improvement at higher doses. Thus, while not guideline‐recommended, using best judgement based on totality of evidence may be an option when designing trials.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^112gAvLM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The proposed approach is non‐judgmental, i.e. it does not designate any stratum as being 'optimal', 'acceptable' or 'adequate'. It does not make reference to a guideline, since there are numerous different guidelines throughout the world. The proposed approach also does not ask physicians to distinguish among all possible reasons for the prescribing of non‐target doses, since it is failure to follow a forced‐titration strategy that matters rather than the reasons for not following it.

Table 1 displays one possible approach to the definition of the three strata. Thresholds are proposed for the identification of patients who would reside in stratum I, stratum II, or stratum III. The table is presented only for purposes of illustration. The clinical community needs to debate and revise the proposed criteria and reach consensus as to the definitions of specific strata. However, the debate must start somewhere, and Table 1 represents a starting point.

Table 1
Proposed framework for characterizing the adherence of individual patients to trial‐based strategies for the prescribing of neurohormonal antagonists for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction

An advantage of the approach presented in the table is that it allows physicians to readily describe the degree to which an individual patient's treatment adheres to a trial‐proven strategy. Simple abbreviations could be used to refer to each drug class, i.e. RAS for ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers; BB for beta‐blockers; MRA for spironolactone or eplerenone; and ARNI for neprilysin inhibition. Accordingly, a patient receiving target doses of carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan and spironolactone might be described as BB1/ARNI1/MRA1. Conversely, a patient who is taking enalapril 5 mg twice daily and metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice daily but no mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or neprilysin inhibitor would be designated as RAS2/BB2/MRA3/ARNI3. Finally, a patient who is receiving sacubitril/valsartan, carvedilol and spironolactone at subtarget doses and was prescribed higher doses but shown to be intolerant despite a concerted effort would be designated as BB1/ARNI1/MRA1, since the patient received treatment in accordance with forced strategies used in the landmark trials.

### Spironolactone use and improved outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction with resistant hypertension [^111xVa5G]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design and Patients

We assessed the effects of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF with resistant hypertension using data from the TOPCAT study. 11 A detailed description of the study protocol, design, and patient characteristics has been reported previously. 6, 11, 12 Briefly, TOPCAT was an international, multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial. From August 10, 2006, to January 31, 2012, a total of 3445 patients were enrolled at 233 sites in 6 countries (the United States [n = 1151], Russia [n = 1066], Georgia [n = 612], Canada [n = 326], Brazil [n = 167], and Argentina [n = 123]). Participants were randomly assigned to receive spironolactone (n = 1722) or placebo (n = 1723). Patients aged ≥ 50 years were included if they had at least 1 symptom and 1 sign of heart failure from a prespecified list: a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45% measured at the local site by echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography, controlled systolic blood pressure (defined as < 140 mm Hg, or ≤ 160 mm Hg if the patient were taking ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications), and a serum potassium level < 5.0 mmol/L. Eligible patients had a history of heart failure hospitalization in the previous 12 months, or an elevated natriuretic peptide level in the 2 months before randomization (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide level ≥ 360 pg/mL or brain natriuretic peptide level ≥ 100 pg/mL). Patients were excluded if they had known infiltrative or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or known pericardial constriction; severe renal dysfunction (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min or serum creatinine level ≥ 2.5 mg/dL); known chronic hepatic disease (defined as aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels > 3.0 times the upper limit of the normal range); severe pulmonary disease, such as chronic pulmonary disease requiring home oxygen; severe systemic illness with life expectancy judged to be < 3 years; or had undergone a heart transplant. 6 The TOPCAT study previously reported that spironolactone use did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, aborted cardiac arrest, or heart failure hospitalization. 11 In our current study, we excluded patients with missing information regarding resistant hypertension (n = 4), which resulted in the final sample size of 3441 patients. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, while our use of TOPCAT data was approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This study did not require informed consent of study participants.

Resurrection of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Summary of key clinical trials in cardiac diseases

Despite preclinical data on BP lowering and cardiorenal protection, it was not until 1999 that the first seminal trial with spironolactone in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was published. Results of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES; N = 1663) showed that spironolactone (∼25 mg/day) reduced the risk of death by 30% vs. placebo [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60–0.82; P < 0.001) in patients with HFrEF New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III–IV [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35%). The effects were so robust that the trial was stopped prematurely for efficacy. Incidences of progressive HF and sudden death were reduced; HR for hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) was 0.65; and NYHA class improved. However, rates of breast pain and gynaecomastia increased (10% with spironolactone vs. 1% with placebo).

The major limitation of aldosterone blockade with spironolactone was hyperkalaemia. In 2004, a pharmacoepidemiological study noted an increased incidence of hyperkalaemia after the RALES publication; this also correlated with an increase in prescription of spironolactone. The increased incidence of hyperkalaemia was likely related to spironolactone use in patients who would have been excluded from RALES [i.e. those with low estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR)], and to the use of higher spironolactone doses than that used in RALES. A more judicious use of spironolactone and closer patient monitoring may reduce the occurrence of hyperkalaemia.

Eplerenone was subsequently developed as a more selective version of spironolactone, with another seminal trial to test its effects among myocardial infarction (MI) patients with an LVEF ≤ 40% and symptomatic HF. Results of the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS; N = 6642) showed that eplerenone was associated with a 15% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo and a 13% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular (CV) mortality or hospitalization due to CV causes compared with placebo.

### The adequacy of laboratory monitoring in patients treated with spironolactone for congestive heart failure [^1134Pu2R]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to determine the adequacy of monitoring patients receiving spironolactone as well as spironolactone's relationship to hyperkalemia.

Background

After the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) demonstrated a 30% mortality benefit for treating severe heart failure patients with spironolactone, acceptance of this drug was overwhelming. Hyperkalemia and worsening renal function were rare in RALES, but laboratory monitoring was frequent. In clinical practice, the incidence of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function and adequacy of follow-up is unknown.

Methods

We reviewed the monitoring of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients with spironolactone initiation after publication of RALES. All potassium and creatinine determinations at baseline and within three months following therapy initiation were assessed. Increased potassium was defined as any [K] ≥ 5.5 mEq/l and severe hyperkalemia as any [K] ≥ 6.0.

Results

A total of 840 patients had new prescriptions for spironolactone. Of these, 91% had baseline laboratory values, and 34% did not have any serum potassium or creatinine determined within three months. Patients seen in the cardiology clinic were more likely to have appropriate follow-up (p ≤ 0.001). Of 551 patients with follow-up laboratory values determined, 15% developed hyperkalemia and 6% developed severe hyperkalemia. Fifty-one patients (9%) developed renal dysfunction, of whom 25 developed hyperkalemia within three months. Hyperkalemia developed in 48 of 138 (35%) patients with baseline creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl and 12 of 19 (63%) with baseline creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl.

Conclusions

Many patients treated with spironolactone for CHF do not receive needed follow-up of potassium or creatinine concentrations, although hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction are common. Elevated baseline creatinine predicts patients at high risk. Physician education of the risks of spironolactone and the need for follow-up is essential.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114XnLoY]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Diuretics and hemodynamic monitoring in right-sided heart failure — If the central venous pressure (CVP) exceeds 8 to 12 mm Hg, the patient will likely benefit from decongestion, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring is very useful to help determine the optimal right atrial pressure (RAP) needed to maintain appropriate preload; it is reasonable to consider adding a thiazide diuretic to augment natriuresis with intravenous loop diuretics, aldosterone antagonists may help to maintain potassium homeostasis from potassium losses although a trial of high-versus low-dose spironolactone in acute heart failure did not lead to improved clinical outcomes, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can improve the hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis resulting from aggressive loop and thiazide diuretics; diuretics should not be held in a hypotensive patient who is clearly volume-overloaded, and hypotension requiring vasoconstrictors and persistent poor hemodynamics should prompt strong consideration for MCS.

### Adoption of spironolactone therapy for older patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the United States, 1998–2001 [^113zbDA8]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of spironolactone use in some patients with heart failure. We studied the adoption of spironolactone therapy after publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) in national cohorts of older patients hospitalized for heart failure.

Methods and Results

This is a study of serial cross-sectional samples of Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 65 years old discharged after hospitalization for the primary diagnosis of heart failure and with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The first sample was discharged before (April 1998 to March 1999, n = 9758) and the second sample after (July 2000 to June 2001, n = 9468) publication of RALES in September 1999. We assessed spironolactone prescriptions at hospital discharge in patient groups defined by enrollment criteria for the trial. Using multivariable logistic regression, we identified factors independently associated with prescriptions not meeting these criteria. Spironolactone use increased > 7-fold (3.0% to 21.3% P < 0.0001) after RALES. Of patients meeting enrollment criteria, 24.1% received spironolactone, as compared with 17.4% of those not meeting the criteria. Of all prescriptions after RALES, 30.9% were provided to patients not meeting enrollment criteria. Spironolactone was prescribed to 22.8% of patients with a serum potassium value ≥ 5.0 mmol/L, to 14.1% with a serum creatinine value ≥ 2.5 mg/dL, and to 17.3% with severe renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL.min(-1).1.73 m(-2)). In multivariable analyses, factors associated with prescriptions not meeting enrollment criteria included advanced age, noncardiovascular comorbidities, discharge to skilled nursing facilities, and care provided by physicians without board certification.

Conclusions

Spironolactone prescriptions increased markedly after the publication of RALES, and many treated patients were at risk for hyperkalemia. Simultaneously, many patients who might have benefited were not treated. These findings demonstrate the importance of balancing efforts to enhance use among appropriate patients and minimizing use in patients at risk for adverse events.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): rationale and design [^115aQodh]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

‐patients and rationale for inclusion and exclusion criteria

Patients eligible for SPIRRIT‐HFpEF are men and women aged ≥ 50 years who are enrolled in SwedeHF or encountered in the US at discharge from the hospital or as outpatients. In Sweden, patients are enrolled in SwedeHF and pre‐screened for SPIRRIT‐HFpEF in routine care, but provide written informed consent for participation in SPIRRIT‐HFpEF.

For the trial, inclusion criteria were initially a HF diagnosis based on signs and symptoms judged by the investigator, LVEF ≥ 40% on the most recent LVEF measurement (no time limit), and elevated NT‐proBNP at the most recent measurement (no time limit). To require pre‐randomization screening LVEF and NT‐proBNP would add complexity and reduce enrolment in this pragmatic trial. Potassium must be ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m². In contrast to LVEF and NT‐proBNP, eGFR and potassium must be recent (not older than 30 days), since initiating an MRA with unknown recent eGFR and potassium might expose patients to harm. A blinded interim analysis suggested lower than expected cumulative event rates. Therefore, in a protocol amendment, symptomatic HF (i.e. New York Heart Association class I not allowed) and regular loop diuretic use were added as additional required inclusion criteria. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 2, together with rationales for their selection. There are only few inclusion and exclusion criteria, in order to keep the trial pragmatic and the results generalizable. The overall rationale for these criteria is to plausibly ensure the presence of HF (e.g. NPs; adjusted for body mass index as shown in online supplementary Table S2) and HF severity commensurate with a reasonable risk of hospitalization for HF (e.g. need for loop diuretics), without requiring extensive corroborative information (e.g. SPIRRIT‐HFpEF does not require documented structural or functional heart disease) which may not be readily available, and without excluding too many patients, which could make the results less generalizable and recruitment of more than 2000 patients in only two countries less feasible.

4.2 Beta‐blocker

A patient‐level meta‐analysisof 18 637 patients that analyzed 11 randomized controlled trials of beta‐blocker therapy in HF was performed to evaluate the drug's benefit compared to placebo in prespecified subgroups, stratified by LVEF ranges. In patients with normal sinus rhythm, there was a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality in the LVEF 41%–49% subgroup (HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.24–0.97]), with a similar magnitude of treatment effect observed in subgroups with an LVEF < 40%. Importantly, there was no significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality observed in the LVEF ≥ 50% subgroup (HR, 1.77 [95% CI, 0.61–5.14]).

4.3 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist

The treatment of preserved cardiac function with aldosterone antagoniststudy enrolled 3444 patients from the Americas and Russia/Georgia with LVEF > 45% to assess the efficacy of spironolactone in HFpEF. The trial did not reveal a significant reduction in the composite outcome of HF hospitalizations, aborted cardiac death, and cardiovascular mortality compared to placebo (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.77–1.04]). There was also no significant reduction in first HF hospitalization or all‐cause mortality. However, a posthoc analysisof outcomes stratified according to LVEF ranges in subjects enrolled in the Americas reported a significant reduction in the composite primary outcome of HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality in the LVEF < 50% group of 197 patients (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.33–0.91]), compared to LVEF 50%–55% group of 289 patients (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.56–1.25]), LVEF 55%–59% group of 422 patients (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.60–1.21]) and LVEF > 60% group of 858 patients (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.69–1.15]). The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRIT‐HF)is an ongoing registry‐based trial evaluating the efficacy of spironolactone versus standard of care in patients with LVEF > 40% for a primary composite endpoint of HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality.

### Practical outpatient management of worsening chronic heart failure [^116MitHX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are seldom used in the acute setting, although their introduction at this phase should nonetheless be considered. Together with their direct inhibition of aldosterone and their potassium‐sparing effect, they can partially offset significant side‐effects of loop and thiazide diuretics. In addition, MRAs initiated in acute settings have been shown to have natriuretic effects. Since the action of the MRA spironolactone occurs 48–72 h after oral intake (Table 1), eplerenone or canrenoate potassium could be favoured in the setting of WHF. In the ATHENA‐HF trial, spironolactone use at 100 mg/day was deemed safe and did not result in hyperkalaemia or WRF (but did not improve outcome either possibly because of the short follow‐up and slow pharmacokinetics of spironolactone).

Finally, assessment of diuretic response is critical in routine practice. Clinical signs of decongestion, diuresis, weight loss and renal function have limited sensitivity for guiding diuretic therapy. Urinary sodium monitoring is a simple indicator of diuretic response that is associated with prognosis and has the potential of becoming a useful tool for routine practice guidance of diuretic therapy. Serial measurement of natriuretic peptide concentrations are commonly utilized in US institutions for monitoring trajectory of decongestion. Given the stability of N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), even home‐based phlebotomy with centralized measurement may be performed. The use of ultrasound, including serial assessment of lung B‐lines, inferior vena cava or jugular vein diameter, or intra‐renal venous flow have also shown potential to be useful in this setting and is currently under evaluation.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^114XDPEm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Do the benefits of foundational drugs depend on background therapy?

Assuming that there are four foundational pharmacological treatments for patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, it is important to ask if the efficacy of each treatment is influenced (favourably or unfavourably) by co‐administration of the other therapies. Are angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors effective only in patients receiving beta‐blockers? Are the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors evident only if patients are receiving mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists? It is understood that each drug class was tested in patients already receiving certain background therapy; however, the fact that background therapy was present does not imply that the background therapy was needed for the study medication to have demonstrated efficacy in a large‐scale trial.

It is therefore noteworthy that the totality of evidence from randomized controlled trials strongly indicates that background therapy does not influence the response to each of the foundational drug classes (Table 1). In general, for patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, beta‐blockers were tested in patients already receiving conventional inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system. However, in the post‐infarction setting, the converse was true, i.e. angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors were typically tested in patients already receiving beta‐blockers. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure following a myocardial infarction, beta‐blockers were shown to reduce mortality in trials with and without background therapy with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor. Furthermore, the first trial with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (RALES) tested spironolactone in patients who were largely not receiving a beta‐blocker, but the second trial of the drug class (EMPHASIS‐HF) tested eplerenone in a setting where most patients were receiving a beta‐blocker as background therapy; the benefits reported in the two trials were similar. Enalapril was effective in reducing mortality in a trial in which > 50% of the patients received spironolactone and in a trial where potassium‐sparing diuretics were prescribed to < 10%. In the large‐scale trials with sacubitril/valsartan and with SGLT2 inhibitors, the favourable effects of both drug treatments were similar whether patients were or were not receiving a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors were effective in reducing hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes (with a magnitude similar to that seen in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction), but most of the patients in these trials were not receiving spironolactone or eplerenone. Finally, in the two trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, background therapy with a neprilysin inhibitor did not minimize the benefits of treatment with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. Background therapy has influenced the effects of the study medication only when the treatments unequivocally interfered with the same pathophysiological pathway (i.e. angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and renin inhibitors).

### Potassium binders for patients with heart failure? The real enlightenment of the DIAMOND trial [^111hvMUG]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The terror of hyperkalaemia and the advent of new potassium binders

The results of these two trials established MRAs as foundational drugs for HFrEF. Yet, in clinical practice, only ∼15–30% of patients with heart failure receive an MRA, because of fears that serious hyperkalaemia is common and life-threatening. Juurlink et al. reported an excess of hyperkalaemia-associated hospitalizations and deaths following the publication of the RALES trial. This risk was attributed to the use of inappropriately high doses of spironolactone, the lack of serum potassium monitoring, and the use of potassium supplements in many patients. Trevisan et al.confirmed the risk of serious hyperkalaemia with spironolactone > 25 mg/day and reported that, at the first sign of hyperkalaemia, practitioners generally stopped spironolactone permanently — instead of reducing the dose, as was done in RALES and EMPHASIS-HF.

Potassium binders have been used to reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of potassium for decades, and agents with enhanced tolerability (e.g. patiromer) have been developed. Patiromer reduces the risk of hyperkalaemia in chronic kidney diseaseand, in the PEARL-HF trial, patients with HFrEF (enriched for the risk of hyperkalaemia) were randomized to patiromer or placebo to determine if treatment might enhance the tolerability of spironolactone 50 mg/day. After 4 weeks, patiromer-treated patients were more likely to be receiving 50 mg/day (91% vs. 74%), but the between-group difference was not striking. Nevertheless, the use of patiromer might allow more HFrEF patients to receive the highest doses of MRAs. If very high MRA doses are superior to lower doses in preventing major heart failure outcomes, patiromer might facilitate MRA-mediated decreases in death and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with prior hyperkalaemia.

### Influence of baseline and worsening renal function on efficacy of spironolactone in patients with severe heart failure: insights from RALES (randomized aldactone evaluation study) [^1175aXgb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated the influence of baseline and worsening renal function (WRF) on the efficacy of spironolactone in patients with severe heart failure (HF).

Background

Renal dysfunction or decline in renal function is a known predictor of adverse outcome in patients with HF, and treatment decisions are often on the basis of measures of renal function.

Methods

We used data from the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) in 1,658 patients with New York Heart Association functional class III or IV HF and an ejection fraction < 35%. Participants were randomized to spironolactone 25 mg, which could be titrated to 50 mg, or placebo daily. Renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) was estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Worsening renal function was defined as a 30% reduction in eGFR from baseline to 12 weeks post-randomization.

Results

Individuals with reduced baseline eGFR exhibited similar relative risk reductions in all-cause death and the combined endpoint of death or hospital stays for HF as those with a baseline eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and greater absolute risk reduction compared with those with a higher baseline eGFR (10.3% vs. 6.4%). Moreover, WRF (17% vs. 7% for spironolactone and placebo groups, p < 0.001) was associated with an increased adjusted risk of death in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 1.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 2.6) but not in those randomized to spironolactone (hazard ratio: 1.1, 95% confidence interval: 0.79 to 1.5, p interaction = 0.009). The risk of hyperkalemia and renal failure was higher in those with worse baseline renal function and those with WRF, particularly in the spironolactone arm, but the substantial net benefit of spironolactone therapy remained.

Conclusions

The absolute benefit of spironolactone was greatest in patients with reduced eGFR. Worsening renal function was associated with a negative prognosis, yet the mortality benefit of spironolactone was maintained.

### Spironolactone metabolite concentrations in decompensated heart failure: insights from the ATHENA-HF trial [^111J73ws]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

In Aldosterone Targeted Neurohormonal Combined with Natriuresis Therapy in Heart Failure (ATHENA-HF), high-dose spironolactone (100mg daily) did not improve efficacy endpoints over usual care [placebo or continued low-dose spironolactone (25mg daily) in patients already receiving spironolactone] in the treatment of acute heart failure (HF). We hypothesized that low concentrations of the long-acting active metabolites of spironolactone [canrenone and 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS)] in the high-dose group could have contributed to these neutral results.

Methods and Results

In patients randomized to high-dose spironolactone not previously treated with spironolactone (high-dose-naïve, n = 112), concentrations of canrenone and 7α-TMS increased at 48 and 96h compared to baseline, and between 48 and 96h (all P < 0.005), indicating that steady-state concentrations had not been reached by 48h. In patients previously on low-dose, high-dose spironolactone (high-dose-previous, n = 37), concentrations of canrenone increased at 48 and 96h compared to baseline (both P < 0.0005), with a marginal increase between 48 and 96h (P = 0.0507). At 48h, both high-dose groups had higher concentrations of both metabolites than the low-dose spironolactone group (P < 0.0001). Moreover, concentrations of both metabolites were higher in high-dose-previous vs. high-dose-naïve patients (P < 0.01), indicating that previous spironolactone use was significant, and that steady-state has not been reached in high-dose-naïve patients at 48h. We found limited and inconsistent evidence of correlation between metabolite concentrations and endpoints.

Conclusions

Lower-than-anticipated concentrations of spironolactone active metabolites were observed for at least 48h in the high-dose spironolactone group and may have contributed to the absence of pharmacological effects of spironolactone in the ATHENA-HF trial.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, blood pressure, and outcomes in heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1114zr2e]. JACC: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Details of trials included

The design, baseline findings, and primary results of the 2 trials have been reported previously in detail. Participants in each trial provided written informed consent. Briefly, the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) was an event-driven, double-blind, placebo-controlled mortality trial. Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes III-IV heart failure with a ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 35% were randomly assigned to receive placebo or spironolactone therapy. The starting dosage of the study drug was 25 mg of spironolactone once daily or matching placebo. After 8 weeks, the dosage could be increased to 50 mg daily if the patient still had symptoms of heart failure but did not have hyperkalemia.

The EMPHASIS-HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure) trial was an event-driven, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a composite morbidity-mortality outcome (cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization). Patients with NYHA functional class II heart failure with an LVEF of ≤ 35% were randomly assigned to placebo or eplerenone therapy. The starting dosage for the study drug was eplerenone 25 mg once daily or matching placebo. After 4 weeks, the dosage was increased to 50 mg once daily, unless there was hyperkalemia (or another intolerance).

Importantly, neither trial had a lower blood pressure exclusion criterion. The median follow-up in RALES was 24 months and 21 months in EMPHASIS-HF. In order to have an adequate number of patients (and events) in each baseline blood pressure category of interest (see below) and to cover the full spectrum of symptom severity (NYHA functional class II to IV), the RALES and EMPHASIS-HF databases were merged for analyses.

Baseline blood pressure categories and serial blood pressure assessments

Patients were divided into 5 baseline SBP categories: ≤ 105, > 105 to ≤ 115, > 115 to ≤ 125, > 125 to ≤ 135, and > 135 mm Hg, to ensure equally sized groups across the spectrum of blood pressure values. In RALES, SBP was measured at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 months and at 1, 5, and 9 months in EMPHASIS-HF. For the purpose of this analysis, the 5- and 6-month measurements were considered to have occurred at 6 months.

### Screening-guided spironolactone treatment of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction for heart failure prevention in at-risk patients [^112z96Dw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Subclinical left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is a prelude to symptomatic heart failure (HF). We hypothesised that screening-guided treatment with spironolactone would prevent incident HF in at-risk patients.

Methods and Results

We randomised asymptomatic, community-dwelling subjects aged ≥ 65years old, with at least one non-ischaemic HF risk factor (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus or obesity) to echocardiography-guided therapy or usual care. Spironolactone therapy was triggered by the detection of subclinical LVD (global longitudinal strain [GLS] ≤ 16%) or diastolic abnormalities (at least one of E/e' > 15, E/e' > 10 with left atrial enlargement [LAE] or impaired relaxation [E/A < 0.8, IR], LAE with IR), or borderline GLS (17%) with IR or borderline GLS with LAE. The primary outcome was incident HF at 24months. Secondary outcomes were change in 6-min walk test (6MWT) and change in left ventricular function. LVD was identified in 161 (46%) of 349 participants (age 70 [68–73] years, 201 [58%] women). The trial was stopped because of a 55% rate of spironolactone discontinuation, due primarily to decline in renal function. Incident HF developed in 11 (3.5%) of 310 participants completing follow-up, with no difference between usual care and intervention (4 [2.5%] vs. 7 [4.7%], p = 0.29), decline in 6MWT distance (p = 0.28), persistent or new LVD (p = 0.58), nor change in GLS with intervention (p = 0.15). A per-protocol analysis of 131 patients with baseline LVD and a follow-up echocardiogram, showed resolution of LVD with spironolactone therapy (59% vs. 33%, p = 0.01).

Conclusion

The study was underpowered to determine whether screening-guided spironolactone therapy reduced incident HF because spironolactone was frequently discontinued due to renal function criteria. However, LVD resolved in more patients treated with spironolactone than in untreated patients. Future trials should use less conservative renal criteria for spironolactone discontinuation.

### Detection and management of geographic disparities in the TOPCAT trial: lessons learned and derivative recommendations [^11255fXu]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial) was a multinational clinical trial of 3,445 heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients that enrolled in 233 sites in 6 countries in North America, Eastern Europe, and South America. Patients with a heart failure hospitalization in the last 12 months or an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide were randomized to the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone versus placebo. Sites in Russia and the Republic of Georgia provided the majority of early enrollment, primarily based on the hospitalization criterion because B-type natriuretic peptide levels were initially unavailable there. With the emergence of country-specific aggregate event rate data indicating lower rates in Eastern Europe and differences in patient characteristics there, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board recommended relatively increasing enrollment in North America plus other corrective measures. Although final enrollment reflected the increased contribution from North America, a plurality of the final cohort came from Russia and Georgia (49% vs. 43% in North America). B-type natriuretic peptide measurements from Russia and Georgia, available later in the trial, suggested no or a mild level of heart failure consistent with low event rates. The primary results showed no significant spironolactone treatment effect overall (primary endpoint hazard ratio [HR]: 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77 to 1.04), with a significant hazard ratio in North and South America (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.98; p = 0.026) but not in Russia and Georgia (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.51; interaction p = 0.12). This report describes the Data Safety and Monitoring Board's detection and management recommendations for regional differences in patient characteristics in TOPCAT and suggests methods of surveillance and corrective actions that may be useful for future trials.

Steroidal MRA

Nowadays, two steroidal MRA are in routine clinical use, spironolactone and eplerenone. Despite a similar binding mode to the MR, as so-called 'passive' antagonists, they reveal important differences in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties (Table 1). Spironolactone is a high-affinity ligand with lower MR selectivity, whereas eplerenone has a lower MR-affinity with higher selectivity (MR IC₅₀: spironolactone: 24nM and eplerenone: 990nM) (Table 1). Accordingly, eplerenone develops fewer sex steroid hormone receptor-mediated side effects such as gynecomastia due to unspecific binding when compared to spironolactone (Table 1). Eplerenone has a shorter plasma half-life than spironolactone, which is metabolized to active compounds, canrenone and 7alpha-thiomethylspironolactone (plasma half-life: spironolactone > 20 h and eplerenone 4–6 h) (Table 1). Steroidal MRA are now first-line therapy in patients with HFrEF. This recommendation is based on the positive results in previous randomized clinical trials including RALES, EPHESUS and EMPHASIS. Spironolactone was tested in 1.663 patients with HFrEF, NYHA stage III-IV, in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES). Spironolactone significantly reduced mortality and markedly lowered hospitalization rate for heart failure in RALES. The Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) demonstrated a significant reduction of total-/ cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization rate by eplerenone in 6.642 patients with myocardial infarction, LV-EF ≤ 40% and symptomatic heart failure. And in 2.737 patients with LV-EF ≤ 30% and NYHA stage II, eplerenone treatment induced a significant decline of all-cause and CV death, and hospitalization rate in the Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure (EMPHASIS). Regarding safety of steroidal MRA, one of the main side effects and thus often therapy-limiting, is hyperkalemia. Specifically, when combined with other blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system such as ACE-I, angiotensin receptor blockers or ARNIs, and in the presence of CKD the risk for hyperkalemia increases severalfold with steroidal MRA.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116iUXtJ]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy and lactation — heart failure medication counseling notes that in 2015 the FDA adopted the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule retiring categories A through X and providing a descriptive risk summary; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are associated with multiple second- and third-trimester fetal harms and are, therefore, strictly contraindicated, and there are no specific data for ARNI or ivabradine. For mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, spironolactone has dose-dependent feminization findings in animal offspring with limited data for eplerenone. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) medications considered acceptable during pregnancy within multidisciplinary shared decision-making include furosemide, beta blockers (most commonly metoprolol), hydralazine, and nitrates. Regarding lactation, breastfeeding may be associated with LV recovery; postpartum women who breastfeed can start ACEi (enalapril or captopril preferred), metoprolol remains the preferred beta blocker, and a medication safety resource is available via LactMed.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): rationale and design [^115oC6oQ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The SPIRRIT‐HFpEF trial is to our knowledge the first RRCT in HF and one of the first for a chronic condition and chronic intervention. The trial will address an important clinical question, the efficacy and safety of MRAs in routine practice for patients with HFpEF/HFmrEF. This trial also provides important insights for the future of pragmatic clinical trial design for patients with chronic conditions and interventions, using a registry to plan and conduct a trial and to facilitate recruitment.

Since the trial began before but continued during the COVID‐19 pandemic, it is difficult to draw conclusions on efficiency for enrolment and follow‐up. During the pandemic, staff were often reassigned and patients were recommended to avoid unnecessary contact with the healthcare system. However, the RRCT design afforded some flexibility in identifying patients remotely and allowing for trial follow‐up with limited in‐person contact. As such, the trial has been able to continue enrolment and follow‐up in 2020 and 2021 during the most challenging times of the pandemic, but at dramatically reduced rates.

While the RRCT design is unique and allows for efficient enrolment, we have still identified that enrolment remains limited by availability of study personnel. For example, in the US, enrolment occurred at traditional clinical sites with established clinical research teams for HF and many other conditions. In Sweden, a combination of sites, some with established clinical research teams, but other sites that participated primarily in clinical care and the SwedeHF registry were selected for the study. At many sites, study personnel were deployed to pandemic‐related duties, thereby limiting enrolment by reduced clinical research staff availability.

### Spironolactone [^111j2vUr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Drugs and Supplements Increasing Serum Potassium

Concomitant administration of spironolactone with potassium supplementation or drugs that can increase potassium may lead to severe hyperkalemia. In general, discontinue potassium supplementation in heart failure patients who start spironolactone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Check serum potassium levels when ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is altered in patients receiving spironolactone.

Examples of drugs that can increase potassium include:

ACE inhibitors
angiotensin receptor blockers
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
heparin and low molecular weight heparin
trimethoprim

7.2 Lithium

Like other diuretics, spironolactone reduces the renal clearance of lithium, thus increasing the risk of lithium toxicity. Monitor lithium levels periodically when spironolactone is coadministered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

In some patients, the administration of an NSAID can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effect of diuretics. Therefore, when spironolactone and NSAIDs are used concomitantly, monitor closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4 Digoxin

Spironolactone and its metabolites interfere with radioimmunoassays for digoxin and increase the apparent exposure to digoxin. It is unknown to what extent, if any, spironolactone may increase actual digoxin exposure. In patients taking concomitant digoxin, use an assay that does not interact with spironolactone.

7.5 Cholestyramine

Hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis has been reported in patients given spironolactone concurrently with cholestyramine.

7.6 Acetylsalicylic Acid

Acetylsalicylic acid may reduce the efficacy of spironolactone. Therefore, when spironolactone and acetylsalicylic acid are used concomitantly, spironolactone may need to be titrated to higher maintenance dose and the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.7 Abiraterone

Spironolactone binds to the androgen receptor and may increase prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in abiraterone-treated prostate cancer patients. Concomitant use of spironolactone and abiraterone is not recommended.

### Rates of hyperkalemia after publication of the randomized aldactone evaluation study [^117VGAYY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) demonstrated that spironolactone significantly improves outcomes in patients with severe heart failure. Use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is also indicated in these patients. However, life-threatening hyperkalemia can occur when these drugs are used together.

Methods

We conducted a population-based time-series analysis to examine trends in the rate of spironolactone prescriptions and the rate of hospitalization for hyperkalemia in ambulatory patients before and after the publication of RALES. We linked prescription-claims data and hospital-admission records for more than 1.3 million adults 66 years of age or older in Ontario, Canada, for the period from 1994 through 2001.

Results

Among patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had recently been hospitalized for heart failure, the spironolactone-prescription rate was 34 per 1000 patients in 1994, and it increased immediately after the publication of RALES, to 149 per 1000 patients by late 2001 (P < 0.001). The rate of hospitalization for hyperkalemia rose from 2.4 per 1000 patients in 1994 to 11.0 per 1000 patients in 2001 (P < 0.001), and the associated mortality rose from 0.3 per 1000 to 2.0 per 1000 patients (P < 0.001). As compared with expected numbers of events, there were 560 (95 percent confidence interval, 285 to 754) additional hyperkalemia-related hospitalizations and 73 (95 percent confidence interval, 27 to 120) additional hospital deaths during 2001 among older patients with heart failure who were treated with ACE inhibitors in Ontario. Publication of RALES was not associated with significant decreases in the rates of readmission for heart failure or death from all causes.

Conclusions

The publication of RALES was associated with abrupt increases in the rate of prescriptions for spironolactone and in hyperkalemia-associated morbidity and mortality. Closer laboratory monitoring and more judicious use of spironolactone may reduce the occurrence of this complication.

### The effect of spironolactone on cardiovascular function and markers of fibrosis in people at increased risk of developing heart failure: the heart' OMics' in AGEing (HOMAGE) randomized clinical trial [^112b4wyS]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial design and oversight

Heart 'OMics' in AGEing (HOMAGE) is a research consortium, based in Europe, investigating biomarkers for predicting incident heart failure in older people and bio-targets for interventions that might prevent it; assets include several large clinical databases and collections of biological material. The HOMAGE clinical trial was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) multi-centre trial, investigating the effects of MRA on markers of collagen metabolism and cardiovascular structure and function in people at increased risk of developing heart failure. The protocol and statistical analysis plan are available at. The trial was funded by the European Union 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (grant: 305507). The sponsor was ACS Biomarkers (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The European Drug Development Hub (EDDH) (Nancy, France) managed monitoring and data collection. The trial was approved by relevant ethics committees and regulatory bodies. Participants provided written, informed consent. An executive committee developed the protocol, oversaw trial conduct, and interpreted the results. A clinical endpoints committee adjudicated hospitalizations and deaths blind to assigned treatment. An independent data monitoring committee oversaw safety.

Trial population

People of either sex, aged ≥ 65 years (amended to ≥ 60 years) at increased risk of developing heart failure because they had, or were at high risk of, coronary disease were screened at hospital clinical research clinics. Those with a plasma amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 125–1000 ng/L or BNP 35–280 ng/L were eligible for randomization provided none of the exclusion criteria were met. This 'window' excluded people at low risk of developing heart failure and those with advanced disease requiring further investigation and treatment. The main exclusion criteria (Supplementary material online, Table S1) were an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L, LVEF < 45%, atrial fibrillation, a diagnosis of heart failure, or treatment with loop diuretics. Background therapy could include any conventional treatment except loop diuretics, MRA, or other potassium-sparing diuretics. Other treatments for concomitant conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or coronary disease, were permitted.

### New strategies and therapies for the prevention of heart failure in high-risk patients [^114fvunR]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

6.3 Biomarker‐based prevention

Two landmark trials that focused on biomarker‐based prevention of HF: the STOP‐HF (St. Vincent Screening to Prevent Heart Failure)and PONTIAC (NT‐proBNP selected prevention of cardiac events in a population of diabetic patients without a history of cardiac disease)led to a guideline‐based recommendation for natriuretic peptide‐based prevention. Both of these trials focused on screening with either BNP or NT‐proBNP to identify patients at risk for HF. Participants randomized to the intervention were then referred for intensive preventive therapies, such as up‐titration of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system antagonists and beta‐blockers, which led to lower risk of incident subclinical or clinical HF (systolic or diastolic). However, widespread implementation of BNP‐based screening continues to be limited given the cost and lack of clarity in which patients may benefit from biomarker testing. Alternative strategies include sequential biomarker testing with initial assessment of risk using multivariable risk prediction models that only require readily available clinical factors, such as the PCP‐HF. Among those at intermediate risk, biomarker‐based testing may improve reclassification. Future studies investigating the utility of combining risk factor‐based models with biomarker‐based models are needed.

6.4 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)

Despite the beneficial effects of aldosterone in normal physiologic regulation of body sodium, potassium, and water regulation, aldosterone can also negatively affect the heart, including inducing inflammation, stiffening of vessels, and stimulation of fibrosis in myocardium. Aldosterone may therefore play an important role in the pathogenesis of HF. As such, MRAs are associated with improved outcomes in patients with HFrEF. In the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial, although spironolactone did not effectively reduce risk of the composite outcome of adverse cardiovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of HF), it reduced the risk of HF hospitalization. Despite established benefits of MRAs in HF, there have been no large‐scale randomized control trials to study the effects of MRAs in primary prevention of HF.

### Utility of the cardiovascular physical examination and impact of spironolactone in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113HJkVx]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The prognostic value of physical examination, its relation to quality of life, and influence of therapy in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is not well known.

Methods and Results

We studied participants from the Americas with available physical examination (jugular venous distention, rales, and edema) at baseline in the TOPCAT trial (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist). The association of the number of signs of congestion with the primary outcome (cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization), its individual components, and all-cause mortality was assessed using time-updated, multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses. We evaluated whether spironolactone improved congestion at 4 months and whether improvement in congestion was related to quality of life as assessed by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary scores and to outcomes. Among 1644 participants, 22%, 54%, 20%, and 4% had 0, 1, 2, and 3 signs of congestion, respectively, at baseline. After multivariable adjustment, each additional increase in sign of congestion was associated with a 30% to 60% increased risk of each outcome (P < 0.001). Spironolactone reduced the total number of signs of congestion by -0.10 (P = 0.005) signs, jugular venous distention (odds ratio, 0.60; P = 0.01), and edema (odds ratio, 0.74; P = 0.006) at 4 months compared with placebo. Each reduction in sign of congestion was independently associated with a 4.0 (95% CI, 2.4–5.6) point improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score. When assessed simultaneously, time-updated, but not baseline congestion, predicted outcomes.

Conclusions

In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the physical exam provides independent prognostic value for adverse outcomes. Spironolactone improved congestion compared with placebo. Reducing congestion was independently associated with improved quality of life and outcomes and is a modifiable risk factor.

### Effect of spironolactone on 30-day death and heart failure rehospitalization (from the COACH study) [^112Prcns]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of spironolactone on 30-day outcomes in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and the association between treatment and outcomes stratified by biomarkers. We conducted a secondary analysis of the biomarker substudy of the multicenter COACH (Co-ordinating Study Evaluating Outcomes of Advising and Counseling in Heart Failure) trial involving 534 AHF patients for 30-day mortality and HF rehospitalizations. Spironolactone therapy was initiated and terminated at the discretion of the treating physician; 30-day outcomes were compared between patients who were treated with spironolactone and those who were not. Outcomes with spironolactone therapy were explored based on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, ST2, galectin-3, and creatinine levels. Spironolactone was prescribed to 297 (55.6%) patients at discharge (158 new and 139 continued). There were 19 deaths and 30 HF rehospitalizations among 46 patients by 30 days. Patients discharged on spironolactone had significantly less 30-day event (hazard ratio 0.538, p = 0.039) after adjustment for multiple risk factors. Initiation of spironolactone in patients who were not on spironolactone before admission was associated with a significant reduction in event rate (hazard ratio 0.362, p = 0.027). The survival benefit of spironolactone was more prominent in patient groups with elevations of creatinine, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, ST2, or galectin-3. In conclusion, AHF patients who received spironolactone during hospitalization had significantly fewer 30-day mortality and HF rehospitalizations, especially in high-risk patients.

### Adverse effects of aldosterone: beyond blood pressure [^1111bNgt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In HF with reduced ejection fraction, activation of the MR has been robustly proven as a pharmacologic target that can modify disease course. In the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial of patients with systolic HF with ejection fraction ≤ 35%, treatment with the steroidal MR antagonist spironolactone, on top of background contemporaneous HF therapy, resulted in a 30% reduction in all‐cause death (95% CI, 0.60–0.82) and a 35% reduction in HF hospitalization (95% CI, 0.54–0.77). Subsequent trials of the steroidal MR antagonist eplerenone similarly demonstrated a 24% (95% CI, 0.62–0.93) reduction in death and a 42% (95% CI, 0.47–0.70) reduction in HF hospitalization in patients with mild systolic HFand a 15% (95% CI, 0.75–0.96) reduction in all‐cause death and a 15% (0.74–0.99) reduction in HF hospitalization in patients with HF following acute myocardial infarction. In HF with preserved ejection fraction, the pathogenic role of MR activation and the benefits of MR antagonist therapy are less well established to date. However, in the Americas subset of the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial, treatment with the MR antagonist spironolactone resulted in an 18% (95% CI, 0.67–0.99) reduction in HF hospitalization in addition to a comparable reduction in the primary outcome.

### Prevention of cardiovascular events in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a comprehensive network meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled trials using reconstructed individual patient's data [^113JeXVe]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Before this study, there was limited evidence regarding the benefits of combining of steroidal and non-steroidal MRA, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs in patients with HFpEF. A previous cross-trial synthesis reported potential benefits of combining MRA (spironolactone), ARNIs, and SGLT2is among patients with LVEF between 40% and 65%. However, CV death was reduced only in the LVEF between 40% and 55% subgroups. Additionally, an additive network meta-analysis reported a minimal incremental benefits when BB were added to the combination of MRA (spironolactone), ARNI, and SGLT2i. The recent completion of the GLP-1 RA trials using semaglutideand the FINEARTS-HF trial evaluating finerenonehas expanded the therapeutic landscape for patients with heart failure and LVEF up to 40%. To date, the pooled data of four semaglutide trials now represents the largest dataset assessing GLP-1 RA effects in HFpEF, providing more precise estimates of treatment benefits. Findings from the FINEARTS-HF trial confirmed the efficacy of non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor blockade in this population. Unlike previous meta-analyses, we have included these new important findings, which is crucial for both clinical decisions making and practice guidelines.

The present study has several strengths. This is the first study to provide information about the effect of a combination of steroidal and non-steroidal MRAs, SGLT2is, and GLP-1 RAs in addition to standard care on heart failure events in patients with HFpEF. Second, we used reconstructed IPD with standardized treatment-effects estimation to account for patients baseline risk differences between patients due to variations in heart failure phenotyping across trials. The extracted data exactly matches that reported in the original publications, suggesting the robustness of our results (Appendix Figs. S5–S7). Third, the protocol for this study was developed a priori and registered in PROSPERO, and included a prospective definition of our research question, trial inclusion criteria (which were extended to include MRA data), primary and secondary endpoints, and a rigorous methodology. Four, inclusion of large trials (> 1000 patient-years of follow-up in each randomized group) increased the power of this study to detect rare events (e.g. CV death), and reduced the risk of publication bias due to small study effects. Five, the results of the sensitivity and main analyses were similar, suggesting the robustness of our conclusions.

### Association is not causation: treatment effects cannot be estimated from observational data in heart failure [^113KKVQX]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Why the non-randomized analyses of outcomes related to use of ACEI/ARB and beta-blockers in HFrEF were generally (but not absolutely) concordant with the RCTs, in contrast to the other treatments examined, is an interesting question. There may be less confounding by indication, i.e. ACEIs/ARBs and beta-blockers are recommended in essentially all patients with HFrEF, whereas digoxin and, at least until recently, MRAs were reserved for patients with more advanced HF. There may also have been particularly strong publication bias making it difficult to report studies suggesting that use of ACEIs/ARBs or beta-blockers is not associated with better outcomes (or even associated with worse outcomes). Of course, with both treatments there is also a strong selection bias whereby the sickest patients are least likely to be prescribed (and to tolerate) these therapies. The opposite consideration may apply to the non-randomized studies showing an association between treatments such as statins and lower mortality, with the possibility of other biases such as the 'healthy-user effect' not fully adjusted for.

Although our analyses show that the findings of non-randomized studies of the association between treatment use and outcomes are frequently inconsistent, they do not mean observational studies/registries are of no value. Registry-based analyses may be all that is available where randomized trials are not possible, such as in rare diseases or for rare outcomes. The latter forms the basis of pharmaco-epidemiological surveillance for rare adverse effects of drugs not identified in clinical trials. Non-randomized analyses may provide information on under-studied groups or subgroups excluded from clinical trials. However, the results of such analyses must be interpreted with caution, especially if the results of different analyses of this type conflict. Registries serve an important function in describing the use (or under-use) of evidence-based therapies in the 'real-world', often leading to initiatives to improve prescribing. Perhaps the greatest value of registries is the potential they offer to conduct more 'real-world' randomized trials, i.e. to randomize patients in a registry to treatment and follow their outcomes within the registry. This approach has been pioneered in a study of thrombus aspiration in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction using the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registryand a similar approach is now being used to conduct the Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF)in the Swedish HF Registry [NCT02901184].

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^115dKGKX]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study BARACK-D was published by F D Richard Hobbs and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the BARACK-D study, the trial question was: what is the role of spironolactone in patients with stage 3b CKD? In the BARACK-D study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BARACK-D study, the population was: 1372 patients (748 female, 624 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with stage 3b CKD. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; T1DM; terminal disease; chronic HF or known LV systolic dysfunction; recent myocardial infarction; active cancer with < 1 year life expectancy or in palliative care; alcohol or drug abuse. In the BARACK-D study, the interventions were: n = 677 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg once daily plus usual care) n = 695 usual care (usual care alone). In the BARACK-D study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, HF, TIA or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline at 3 year follow-up (16.7% vs. 16%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37). In the BARACK-D study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in CVD at 3 years (9.7% vs. 8.8%; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.61) No significant difference in death at 3 years (6.2% vs. 5.5%; HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.7) Significant decrease in eGFR at 3 years (41.7 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 42 mL/min/1.73 m²; TE -1.14, 95% CI -1.92 to -0.37). In the BARACK-D study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. significant differences in hyperkalemia (24.7% vs. 13.4%), hypotension (7.4% vs. 4.7%), adverse events (83.0% vs. 50.7%). In the BARACK-D study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with stage 3b CKD, spironolactone was not superior to usual care with respect to first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, HF, TIA or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline at 3 year follow-up.

### Detection and management of geographic disparities in the TOPCAT trial: lessons learned and derivative recommendations [^115S8d3z]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2016). Low credibility.

TOPCAT was a multinational clinical trial of 3,445 heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) patients that enrolled in 233 sites in six countries in North America, Eastern Europe and South America. Patients with a heart failure hospitalization in the last 12 months or an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) were randomized to the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone vs. placebo. Sites in Russia and the Republic of Georgia provided the majority of early enrollment, primarily based on the hospitalization criterion since BNP levels were initially unavailable there. With the emergence of country-specific aggregate event rate data indicating lower rates in Eastern Europe and differences in patient characteristics there, the DSMB recommended relatively increasing enrollment in North America plus other corrective measures. Although final enrollment reflected the increased contribution from North America, a plurality of the final cohort came from Russia and Georgia (49% vs. 43% in North America). BNP measurements from Russia and Georgia available later in the trial suggested no or a mild level of heart failure consistent with low event rates. The primary results showed no significant spironolactone treatment effect overall (primary endpoint hazard ratio 0.89 (0.77, 1.04)), with a significant hazard ratio in North and South America (0.82 (0.69, 0.98), p = 0.026) but not in Russia and Georgia (1.10 (0.79, 1.51), interaction p = 0.12). This report describes the DSMB's detection and management recommendations for regional differences in patient characteristics in TOPCAT, and suggests methods of surveillance and corrective actions that may be useful for future trials.
