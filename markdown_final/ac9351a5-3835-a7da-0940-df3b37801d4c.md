## Question

UTI is positive but heart rate has increased. So what's the next best action if she's already on antibiotics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next best action is when a patient with a confirmed urinary tract infection (UTI) develops an increased heart rate while already receiving antibiotics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this tachycardia signals progression to complicated UTI or urosepsis. Then, I should verify the adequacy of the current antibiotic regimen against culture results. Next, I will assess for alternative explanations for tachycardia and evaluate for complications that require source control. Finally, I will outline immediate actions, monitoring, and when to escalate care, aligning with guideline-based principles and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of a new-onset tachycardia in the context of a UTI. Tachycardia is a component of systemic inflammatory response and can herald progression to complicated UTI or sepsis; in older adults with UTI, tachycardia independently predicts adverse outcomes, so I should not dismiss it as trivial [^112Q4Adx]. Wait, let me verify the sepsis framework: Sepsis-3 defines sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction from a dysregulated host response, operationalized by an increase in SOFA score of 2 or more, or presumptive identification with qSOFA, so I need to check vitals, mental status, and labs to screen for organ dysfunction now [^1137mL9p] [^113FE4aW].

> Next, I should review the antibiotic regimen and its alignment with culture and susceptibility. I need to ensure the current drug covers the identified pathogen and achieves adequate levels in urine and, if relevant, blood and renal tissue; if the initial therapy was empiric, I should de-escalate to a narrower, active agent as soon as results return, and if the isolate is resistant, I must switch promptly to an effective agent and count the duration from the first day of effective therapy [^112bPvv4] [^116fXk2s]. Hold on, I should verify whether the current agent is appropriate for pyelonephritis or bacteremia; nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin are not appropriate for upper-tract disease, so if there is concern for pyelonephritis or systemic spread, I should change to an agent with appropriate tissue penetration and activity [^117H4oaD].

> I will now examine for alternative or contributing causes of tachycardia, because I need to ensure I am not anchoring on infection alone. Fever, dehydration, pain, anxiety, anemia, hypoxia, pulmonary embolism, cardiac ischemia, thyroid disease, and stimulant or withdrawal states can all elevate heart rate; I should check temperature, volume status, oxygen saturation, hemoglobin, and an ECG if ischemia is plausible, and I should correlate with the medication list for agents like beta-agonists or anticholinergics that can drive tachycardia. But wait, what if the patient is on a fluoroquinolone? I should confirm because ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin can prolong QT and precipitate arrhythmias, so if there are palpitations or irregular rhythms, I should obtain an ECG and reassess the antibiotic choice if QT risk is present.

> Next, I should review for complications that require source control or imaging. Let me consider obstructive uropathy, abscess, or prostatitis, especially in men with febrile UTI, because failure to drain or decompress can perpetuate sepsis despite antibiotics; if there is flank pain, a palpable prostate, or failure to improve, I should obtain renal ultrasound or CT and consider urology consultation for drainage or catheterization as indicated [^117Smpys] [^116wywDX]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing a retained foreign body or stone; in the right clinical context, imaging is warranted to exclude these treatable sources of ongoing infection [^117Smpys].

> I should double-check the need for blood cultures. In complicated UTI with systemic features, obtaining blood cultures before antibiotics is recommended when feasible, but if antibiotics have already started, I should still draw them if the patient is febrile, tachycardic, or hypotensive, because bacteremia changes management and duration considerations; in urosepsis, two sets of blood cultures are advised when infection is suspected, even though some data suggest low yield in certain populations [^114dEX5z] [^116fXk2s]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to skip cultures if already on therapy, but I should correct that: if systemic features are present, cultures can still guide de-escalation and duration, so I will obtain them now if not already done [^114dEX5z].

> Now, I need to ensure appropriate escalation and monitoring. If there are signs of sepsis or the patient is unstable, I should escalate to intravenous therapy, initiate sepsis bundles if indicated, and consider ICU transfer; if already on IV therapy and improving, I should still reassess vitals every 4–6 hours, obtain repeat urinalysis and cultures if there is no improvement in 48–72 hours, and add imaging if deterioration occurs [^116wywDX]. I should confirm that the total duration is counted from the first day of effective therapy; for complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, 7 days is often sufficient if the patient is improving, with shorter 5–7 day fluoroquinolone courses acceptable in selected cases, whereas bacteremic patients may be treated for 7 days if improving, and men with suspected prostatitis may benefit from 10–14 days [^117Smpys] [^116fXk2s] [^116wywDX].

> Let me reconsider the immediate next steps in plain language. First, I should stabilize: check ABCs, start or continue IV fluids if dehydrated, and ensure adequate perfusion. Second, I should verify the antibiotic match to culture and switch to an active, narrow agent if needed. Third, I should obtain blood cultures if febrile or tachycardic and send a repeat urinalysis and culture if not improving. Fourth, I should image the urinary tract if there is no improvement in 48–72 hours or if obstruction or abscess is suspected. Fifth, I should monitor closely for deterioration and be ready to escalate to broader IV therapy, vasopressors, or ICU care if sepsis evolves [^1137mL9p] [^117Smpys] [^116wywDX]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing a drug–drug interaction or allergy that could undermine therapy; reviewing the medication list and allergies is essential before changing agents [^115Xt1hM].

> In summary, a new tachycardia during UTI treatment is a red flag that warrants prompt reassessment for progression to complicated infection or sepsis, verification of antibiotic appropriateness, evaluation for alternative causes, and early consideration of source control. I need to ensure timely cultures, imaging when indicated, and close monitoring, adjusting therapy based on microbiology and clinical trajectory to prevent deterioration and reduce the risk of adverse outcomes [^1137mL9p] [^117Smpys] [^112Q4Adx].

The next best action is to **evaluate for sepsis or complications** [^1137mL9p] by checking vitals, mental status, and labs (CBC, BMP, lactate, and blood cultures), and to **confirm antibiotic coverage** against the cultured organism; if the organism is resistant or the regimen is inadequate, switch to an active agent promptly [^112bPvv4] [^111Hu8AB]. If the patient is unstable or has qSOFA ≥ 2, **escalate to IV therapy and sepsis care** [^1137mL9p]; if stable, monitor closely and adjust therapy based on culture results and clinical response [^111Hu8AB].

---

## Clinical significance of increased heart rate in UTI

An increased heart rate (tachycardia) in a patient with a UTI may indicate **progression to systemic infection** or sepsis, particularly if accompanied by fever, hypotension, altered mental status, or elevated lactate [^1137mL9p]. Tachycardia is a component of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with UTIs [^112Q4Adx].

---

## Immediate clinical assessment

### Vital signs and clinical status

Assess for **hypotension, fever, respiratory distress, and altered mental status** — features of sepsis or septic shock [^1137mL9p]. Use the **qSOFA criteria** (respiratory rate ≥ 22, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg) to screen for sepsis risk [^113FE4aW].

---

### Laboratory evaluation

- **CBC**: Evaluate for leukocytosis or leukopenia.
- **Basic metabolic panel (BMP)**: Assess renal function and electrolytes.
- **Lactate**: Elevated lactate (> 2 mmol/L) suggests tissue hypoperfusion and sepsis.
- **Blood cultures**: Obtain before antibiotics if not already done, especially if fever or systemic symptoms are present [^114dEX5z].

---

## Evaluation of antibiotic therapy

### Confirm antibiotic appropriateness

Review the **urine culture and sensitivity results** to ensure the current antibiotic covers the identified organism [^112bPvv4]. If the organism is **resistant** or the regimen is inadequate, switch to an active agent promptly [^111Hu8AB].

---

### Adjust antibiotic therapy based on culture results

If the initial empiric therapy is **inactive**, switch to an agent active against the cultured organism and complete a full course from the start of effective therapy [^111Hu8AB]. For **complicated UTI or pyelonephritis**, tailor therapy to culture results and consider shorter effective courses (5–7 days) if clinically improving [^117Smpys].

---

## Management of tachycardia and systemic symptoms

### Hemodynamic stabilization

Provide **intravenous fluids** for dehydration or hypotension, and initiate **sepsis protocols** if sepsis is suspected, including early antibiotics, source control, and supportive care [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor **vital signs frequently** and reassess clinical status at least every 4–6 hours. Repeat **labs** — including CBC, renal function, and lactate — if the patient fails to improve or deteriorates.

---

## Indications for escalation of care

Escalate care if any of the following occur:

- **Hypotension**: Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg.
- **Altered mental status**: New confusion or lethargy.
- **Respiratory distress**: Oxygen saturation < 90% or respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute.
- **Elevated lactate**: Persistent lactate > 2 mmol/L despite resuscitation.
- **Failure to improve**: No clinical improvement within 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy [^1156ixJC].

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to switching to oral therapy, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider transitioning to oral antibiotics in patients presenting with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis, and associated Gram-negative bacteremia who are initially treated with parenteral therapy, are clinically improving, can take oral medication, and have an effective oral option available, rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration.
Regard an antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients as effective if it achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and demonstrates activity against the causative pathogen.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

Self-treatment with antibiotics for recurrent UTI — Self-treatment can be paired with standing physician orders for urine culture before and possibly after treatment, but compared with continuous prophylaxis it is associated with a higher rate of infection (2.2 UTI per year vs 0.2 UTI per year). Self-treatment is an option for women with the ability to reliably recognize UTI symptoms and start antibiotics, those not suitable for long-term prophylaxis, or those who do not wish to take long-term therapy, and patients should contact their clinician if symptoms progress or fail to resolve within 48 hours. Fluoroquinolones are not preferred agents for self-treatment regimens, and we recommend use of other agents whenever possible.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1135gTkJ]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — pre-initiation step, postcoital and continuous strategies, efficacy, and duration: both the European Association of Urology and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommend ensuring a negative urine culture before starting prophylactic antibiotics; postcoital prophylaxis should be offered to women who have UTIs temporarily related to sexual intercourse, and these women will take a single dose of an antimicrobial agent immediately after intercourse; postcoital therapy decreased recurrence rates compared with placebo (0.3 vs 3.6 patient-years, P = 0.001) and was equally as efficacious as continuous daily therapy; with continuous prophylaxis, a patient takes a single, daily antibiotic dose, and compared with placebo, continuous prophylaxis decreases recurrences by up to 95%; the duration of these regimens ranges from 6 months to at least 2 years, with regimens extended to 5 years in some reports; a Cochrane review in nonpregnant women found that antibiotics given continuously for 6 to 12 months were considerably more effective than placebo in preventing rUTI (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.08–0.28); several studies have found that 50% to 60% of women become reinfected within 3 months of discontinuing prophylaxis; this document supports reevaluation of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis at 3 months, and antibiotic prophylaxis is rarely continued beyond 6 months, although it may have to be restarted if UTIs recur.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infections in the post-antibiotic era: a narrative review highlighting diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship [^114hHBBu]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As one of the most common indications for antimicrobial prescription in the community, the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is both complicated by, and a driver of, antimicrobial resistance.

Objectives

To highlight the key clinical decisions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in adult women, focusing on clinical effectiveness and both diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship as we approach the post-antimicrobial era.

Sources

Literature reviewed via directed PubMed searches and manual searching of the reference list for included studies to identify key references to respond to the objectives. A strict time limit was not applied. We prioritised recent publications, randomised trials, and systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) where available. Searches were limited to English language articles. A formal quality assessment was not performed; however, the strengths and limitations of each paper were reviewed by the authors throughout the preparation of this manuscript.

Content

We discuss the management of UTIs in ambulatory adult women, with particular focus on uncomplicated infections. We address the diagnosis of UTIs, including the following: definition and categorisation; bedside assessments and point-of-care tests; and the indications for, and use of, laboratory tests. We then discuss the treatment of UTIs, including the following: indications for treatment, antimicrobial sparing approaches, key considerations when selecting a specific antimicrobial agent, specific treatment scenarios, and duration of treatment. We finally outline emerging areas of interest in this field.

Implications

The steady increase in antimicrobial resistance among common uropathogens has had a substantial affect on the management of UTIs. Regarding both diagnosis and treatment, the clinician must consider both the patient (clinical effectiveness and adverse effects, including collateral damage) and the community more broadly (population-level antimicrobial selection pressure).

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric therapy — process to guide choice proposes a four-step approach that includes assessing severity of illness for initial prioritization, considering patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens to optimize coverage, evaluating other patient-specific considerations to reduce adverse events, and for patients with sepsis, consulting a relevant local antibiogram if available.

Severity of illness — initial prioritization of empiric antibiotic therapy states: For patients with suspected complicated UTI (including pyelonephritis), we suggest that the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy be initially guided by the severity of illness, specifically by whether the patient is in sepsis or not (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Sepsis is defined per the Sepsis-3 Task Force as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; patients can be identified by SOFA score increase of 2 points or more, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%, or presumptively identified with screening tools such as qSOFA or SIRS.

Methods

Anonymous patient data were recorded prospectively, by twice weekly chart review of all current inpatients, on a 48-bed tertiary urology unit. The baseline study was from November 2012 to June 2013. The postintervention study was from July 2013 to March 2014. Patients were included if they developed a new-onset SIRS, thought to be caused by infection, and were prescribed antibiotics for treatment of this episode. This inclusion criterion was chosen since these patients are at risk of sepsis and would meet our hospital and patient safety agency criteria for urgent administration of the 'sepsis 6' within 1 hour. Over the course of the second cycle, improvement initiatives were introduced sequentially over time, as we undertook continuous audit and identified other barriers to improvement that may need addressed.

Patients were excluded if they developed a new-onset SIRS while already receiving antibiotics. The SIRS criteria used were the presence of 2 or more of: heart rate > 90 beats per minute, white cell count > 12 or less than 4×10⁹/L, temperature > 38.0°C, respiratory rate (RR) > 20 breaths per minute. The time at which the patient developed a new-onset SIRS as recorded on the observation chart was designated time 0.

The primary outcome measure of this audit was median time to delivery of antibiotics from the time the patient developed a new-onset SIRS. This was chosen because it reflects many processes that we hoped to improve (figure 1). We also examined the rate of delivery of the sepsis six steps.

Patients from the baseline study were then split into two groups: those that received antibiotics faster than the median time (prompt), and those that received antibiotics slower than the median time (delayed). The groups were examined for factors associated with delay to administration of antibiotics including: time of day (8:00 to 18:00 hours vs out of hours); grade of reviewing doctor (FY1 doctor vs more senior); vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, RR); white cell count; SEWS; postoperative or non-operative patientand age. Other factors potentially associated with delay to administration of antibiotics were gathered through one to one and group discussions and multidisciplinary training sessions with junior doctors and nurses and fed into improvement initiatives.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) treatment principles — treatment options "can be stratified by whether complicating features, such as known abnormal genitourinary anatomy, immunosuppression, and chronic catheterization, are present", and "Antibiotic therapy is typically used to treat active infections and prevent future infections; the treatment regimen, route, and duration will vary based on the clinical situation and should be individualized for each patient"; strategies "can be divided into treatment of an acute episode (provider prescribed or self-treatment) or prophylaxis (to prevent further episodes)"; "Whenever possible, rUTI patients should have a culture sent before treatment", although "Empiric therapy can be initiated before urine culture results if clinically indicated (such as history of UTI-related sepsis or pyelonephritis)", and "Antibiotic choice should be tailored to the individual patient and pathogens, community and patient resistance patterns, costs, drug availability, patient allergies, and patient tolerance/ability to comply"; clinicians "should be familiar with the antibiotic-resistant patterns in their communities which is generally available via antibiograms through any clinical laboratory", and "Empiric regimens should be altered if necessary based on the urine culture results".

### New paradigms in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^111zyDyd]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) represent a large burden on the healthcare system. Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise.

Summary

The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goal of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^112uCnUB]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

All five management strategies for managing urinary tract infection in primary care achieved similar symptom control, and we found no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for laboratory testing. Antibiotic use targeted with dipstick testing with a delayed prescription as backup or empirical delayed prescription helped to reduce antibiotic use.

Potential limitations

Patients' diary records for acute illness are likely to be reliable, and supporting each strategy in a structured manner minimises any differential placebo effects. Type I error is possible for the subgroup analyses (which must be interpreted with caution), and type II error is unlikely (we had complete results in 277 (90%) patients so had more power than originally calculated). There was no evidence from auditing the use of envelopes, nor from the baseline tables, that randomisation was subverted. When there were modest differences between advice groups, we tested for confounding and found no evidence. In particular, although frequency symptoms were slightly (though not significantly) different at baseline between groups, controlling for baseline severity did not alter the inferences. The response to invitation, the mixed locations of practices, the range of demographics, and the similarity to observational cohortsshould make these results generalisable. There was group differentiation in dipstick use, midstream urine analysis, and the willingness of women to delay the use of antibiotics, but a detailed review of cases suggested that clinicians were likely to want to do a midstream urine test or document dipstick results in a few patients irrespective of initial antibiotic policy — sometimes because of patients' expectation (which might be expected to change over time as doctors' behaviour changes), sometimes for legitimate clinical reasons (such as uncertainty about development of complications), and occasionally because of an overly optimistic view of the accuracy of dipsticks (such as wanting adequate documentation, which might be misguided given the poor negative predictive values of dipsticks). Estimates of effect were little altered when these behaviours (that is, ordering midstream urine analysis or dipstick documentation) were included in the model, which suggests there was little confounding of results by such behaviours.

### Predictors of outcome in geriatric patients with urinary tract infections [^112Q4Adx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

A study was conducted to determine the prognosis of geriatric patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and identify clinical factors associated with adverse outcomes. This retrospective, cohort study identified elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) presenting to an academic, urban Emergency Department (ED) during a 16-week period with UTI, suggested by urinalysis and pertinent symptoms. There were 37 demographic and clinical variables analyzed as potential predictors of outcome. Morbidity was defined as in-hospital death, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, hospital length of stay (LOS) > 2 days, or hospital intravenous (i.v.) antibiotics > 2 days. Factors identified by univariate analysis were combined using multiple logistic regression to identify independent predictors of morbidity. There were 284 patients who met selection criteria. Thirteen patients (4.6%) died during hospitalization and 27 (9.5%) had ICU admission, 139 (48.9%) had LOS > 2 days, and 75 (26.4%) had i.v. antibiotics > 2 days. Multivariate analysis identified the following variables as independent predictors of adverse outcomes: mental status change, frequent UTIs, other nonurinary infections, abnormal temperature, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated BUN, hyperglycemia, elevated WBC, and relative neutrophilia. Regression models for adverse outcomes had sensitivities from 74.8% to 96.2% and specificities from 31.1% to 69.0%. In conclusion, this study defines high rates of morbidity for geriatric patients with UTIs and describes predictive variables that may help identify low-risk patients. These data may lay the foundation for determining specific guidelines for disposition of this high-risk patient population.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — antibiogram use: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis (including acute pyelonephritis), we make no specific recommendation about using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from cUTI (less than or equal to 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality, and routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

Patient considerations for selection of antimicrobial agent — renal function and nitrofurantoin use: Normal aging is associated with decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and creatinine clearance, which impacts renally cleared drugs, and patients with decreased glomerular filtration rate are more likely to experience treatment failure. Nitrofurantoin is ineffective in patients with a CrCl of less than 30 mL/min, though updated guidelines support its use when CrCl is < 60 mL/min but > 30 mL/min; the American Geriatrics Society 2015 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel decreased the CrCl threshold for nitrofurantoin from 60 to 30 mL/min based on 2 retrospective studies. Although more than 25% of individuals at least 65 years old have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min, changes in microbial agent or dose based on age alone are not recommended, and prescribers should be familiar with antibiotic clearance and renal dosing recommendations.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114xto5v]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

Outcome measures

Our outcome measures do not form part of our inclusion criteria; we will not exclude any studies based on its outcomes. If none of our critical or important outcomes are reported in an included study, we will contact the study authors to ask if they planned to measure any of these outcomes, whether any of the outcomes were measured, and whether any data are available and can be provided to us.

There are no established core outcome sets for this review question. A related outcome set for UTIs indicates that the presence and duration of symptoms might be important critical outcomes, but this outcome set pertains to treatment rather than prophylaxis. In the context of a biopsy, a UTI needs confirmation by urinalysis or urine culture. We therefore selected and prioritised the outcomes for this review based on clinical experience and consumer input. In the medical literature, we expect to find established MCIDs for some quality‐of‐life outcomes, but we are not aware of established MCIDs for any of our other critical and important outcomes. We therefore determined the MCIDs for these outcomes based on clinical experience.

Critical outcomes

Sepsis: systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection (SIRS defined as two or more of the following: temperature ≥ 38 °C or less than ≥ 36 °C; heart rate more than 90 beats/minute; respiratory rate more than 20 breaths/minute or respiratory alkalosis; white blood cell count more than 12,000/mm³ or immature forms more than 4000/mm³ or more than 10%) when encountered in the 7‐day postoperative period. We will also accept other definitions set by the investigators. We will use an absolute difference of 2% (20 per 1000) in sepsis rate as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID).
Adverse events (AEs): we will focus on AEs reported in the trial that can be assumed to be secondary to the intervention, including hospitalisation for complications of biopsy, emergency department visits, and any other patient‐reported local AEs encountered within a 30‐day period after the biopsy is performed. We will set an MCID of 5% absolute difference (50 per 1000) in the rates of AEs.
Urinary tract infection (UTI): we will evaluate post‐intervention UTI cases associated with clinical signs of UTI (dysuria, frequency, urgency) and confirmed by either urinalysis or urine culture in the 7‐day postoperative period. We will use an MCID of 5% (50 per 1000) absolute difference in the rates of UTIs.

Diagnostic stewardship — pretest probability and UTI ordering context — Pretest estimates of disease are based on the incidence of disease in specific populations and how risk factors or symptoms modify probability, and this estimation is challenging in patients with nonspecific symptoms. In elderly patients, urine cultures are often ordered for nonspecific symptoms such as failure to thrive or fatigue, and the incidence of urinary tract infections in elderly women is higher than the general population as is the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Adverse events for common urinary tract infection (UTI) antibiotics — Nitrofurantoin has reported adverse event rates of 5%–34% and should be avoided if CrCl < 30 mL/min, with pulmonary fibrosis and hepatotoxicity risk with long-term use. TMP-SMX has adverse event rates of 1.4%–38%, with hyperkalemia and AKI more likely with TMP-SMX use in patients taking ACE inhibitors and potassium supplements, and hemolysis can occur with G6PD deficiency. Fosfomycin has adverse event rates of 5.3%–8%, with half-life of single dose 30–40 h and serious adverse events rare. Ciprofloxacin has adverse event rates of 4%–28%, and risk of use outweighs benefit if an alternative is available; tendinopathy risk is increased if age > 60 y, with corticosteroid use, or prior heart, kidney, and lung transplant. β-Lactams have adverse event rates of 10%–27% and, compared with other UTI antimicrobials, typically have inferior efficacy and more adverse effects and are associated with higher risk of collateral damage including ESBL selection, multidrug-resistant S. aureus, and Clostridium difficile colitis.

Use of midstream urine analysis

There was no evidence that either using midstream urine analysis as an initial strategy to guide antibiotic prescribing or the use of midstream urine samples by doctors as part of their overall clinical management made any difference to ordering analysis during follow-up or other outcomes. As with antibiotic prescribing, as perceptions change among patients and doctors regarding the need for midstream urine analysis in clinical management of uncomplicated infections, use of laboratory resources for such an unnecessary investigation could be significantly reduced.

Conclusion

All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples, and patients who delay waiting for results of such analysis by more than 48 hours might have poor symptom control. Antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription help reduce antibiotic use.

### Phage therapy for urinary tract infections: progress and challenges ahead [^1168gWXy]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment is a growing public health concern owing to increasing antimicrobial resistance. Phage therapy, an alternative or adjunctive treatment to antibiotics, has the potential to address this challenge. However, clinical use of phage therapy is hindered by knowledge gaps and inconsistent reporting. The objective was to review the current state of phage therapy for UTIs and highlight research priorities that can optimize phage clinical efficacy.

Methods

Current literature on UTI phage therapy was examined, focusing on the lack of standardized phage susceptibility testing, phage characterization, and microbiological assessments during and after treatment.

Results

Critical areas requiring further investigation include appropriate phage dosing, optimal routes of administration, and the dynamics of phage–host and phage–patient interactions. The influence of the urinary microbiome, including endogenous phages, on treatment outcomes also needs to be better understood. Suggested data collection and reporting standards should be developed and implemented to improve clinical impact of studies examining phage therapy for UTI. Randomized clinical trials are needed to establish efficacy and determine the best practices for clinical use.

Conclusion

Phage therapy is a promising alternative to antibiotics for managing UTIs, especially in the face of rising antimicrobial resistance. To fully realize its potential, however, future research must focus on standardized protocols, dosing strategies, and the role of the urinary microbiome, with an emphasis on rigorously conducted clinical trials. These steps are essential for integrating phage therapy into mainstream UTI treatment regimens.

Short-course therapy for uncomplicated acute UTI — Three-day regimens of TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones have comparable effectiveness with 79%–100% and 85%–98% cure rates and are widely accepted when there are no complicating factors. These regimens are as effective for symptomatic relief as longer 5- to 10-day regimens and have improved compliance, decreased costs, and lower adverse reaction rates. The efficacy of 5 days of nitrofurantoin is comparable to 3 days of TMP-SMX, and five days of nitrofurantoin has better efficacy than a 3-day regimen.

### The optimal use of diagnostic testing in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis [^113i5848]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a common and costly disorder in women, and there is considerable variation in the diagnostic strategies currently used in clinical practice. Because the diagnosis of cystitis can be established in most patients using the history alone, the clinician's responsibility is to determine which patients require additional diagnostic testing. Patients with typical symptoms (i.e., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria), without risk factors for complicated infection or pyelonephritis, and without a history of vaginal discharge, have a very high probability of cystitis and are appropriate candidates for empiric treatment. It is more difficult, however, to rule out infection in patients with suspected cystitis. Because the prevalence of culture-proven infection is very high in women who present with ≥ 1 symptom, and because the treatment threshold for this condition is low, a urine culture is generally required to rule out infection in patients with atypical symptoms, even in the presence of a negative dipstick test. In population-based, before-and-after studies, use of diagnostic algorithms has been shown to significantly decrease the use of urinalysis, urine culture, and office visits while increasing the percentage of patients who receive recommended antibiotics. These strategies have substantially reduced the cost of managing cystitis without an increase in adverse events or a decrease in patient satisfaction. Randomized controlled trials are needed to more closely examine the outcomes, costs of care, and patient satisfaction from different diagnostic and management strategies.

Patient considerations for selection of antimicrobial agent — allergies and adverse reactions: Clinicians should review drug allergies and intolerances before prescribing antibiotics for a UTI and should not readminister an antibiotic in patients with previously severe reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome unless essential for survival; allergy desensitization may be considered for challenging resistance. Table guidance distinguishes side effect (undesirable pharmacological effect at recommended doses), adverse drug reaction (any noxious or unintended reaction to a drug administered in appropriate doses by the proper route, with infrequent examples including fever, vomiting, erythema, dermatitis, angioedema, seizures, pseudomembranous colitis), and allergy (immunologically mediated with specificity and recurrence on reexposure; Type I immediate hypersensitivity [IgE mediated], Type II cytotoxic reactions [IgG and IgM mediated], Type III immune complex reactions [IgG and IGM mediated], Type IV T cell–mediated reactions), with examples including anaphylaxis, drug-induced hemolytic anemia, post–streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and contact dermatitis; clinicians are advised to educate patients on these differences, and patients can be referred to an allergist for drug allergy testing, noting that recurrence risk of type I hypersensitivity reactions is substantial.

### Role of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infection management: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^114SJE14]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections and recurrent urinary tract infections pose substantial burdens on patients and healthcare systems. Testing and treatment strategies are increasingly important in the age of antibiotic resistance and stewardship.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of urinary tract infection testing and treatment strategies with a focus on antibiotic resistance.

Study Design

We designed a decision tree to model the following 4 strategies for managing urinary tract infections: (1) empirical antibiotics first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics if symptoms persist; (2) urine culture first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics; (3) urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist; and (4) symptomatic treatment first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist. To model both patient- and society-level concerns, we built 3 versions of this model with different outcome measures: quality-adjusted life-years, symptom-free days, and antibiotic courses given. Societal cost of antibiotic resistance was modeled for each course of antibiotics given. The probability of urinary tract infection and the level of antibiotic resistance were modeled from 0% to 100%. We also extended the model to account for patients requiring catheterization for urine specimen collection.

Results

In our model, the antibiotic resistance rate was based either on the local antibiotic resistance patterns for patients presenting with sporadic urinary tract infections or on rate of resistance from prior urine cultures for patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. With the base case assumption of 20% antibiotic resistance, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy and maximized symptom-free days. However, empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was below 6%, whereas symptomatic treatment was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was above 80%. To minimize antibiotic use, symptomatic treatment first was always the best strategy followed by urine culture first. Sensitivity analyses with other input parameters did not affect the cost-effectiveness results. When we extended the model to include an office visit for catheterized urine specimens, empirical antibiotics became the most cost-effective option.

Conclusion

We developed models for urinary tract infection management strategies that can be interpreted for patients initially presenting with urinary tract infections or those with recurrent urinary tract infections. Our results suggest that, in most cases, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics is the most cost-effective strategy and maximizes symptom-free days. Empirical antibiotics first should only be considered if the expected antibiotic resistance is very low. If antibiotic resistance is expected to be very high, symptomatic treatment is the best strategy and minimizes antibiotic use.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women: diagnosis and management [^111PCAzk]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections, presenting as dysuria or irritative voiding symptoms, are most commonly caused by reinfection with the original bacterial isolate in young, otherwise healthy women with no anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. Frequency of sexual intercourse is the strongest predictor of recurrent urinary tract infections in patients presenting with recurrent dysuria. In those who have comorbid conditions or other predisposing factors, recurrent complicated urinary tract infections represent a risk for ascending infection or urosepsis. Escherichia coli is the most common organism in all patient groups, but Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and other organisms are more common in patients with certain risk factors for complicated urinary tract infections. A positive urine culture with greater than 102 colony-forming units per mL is the standard for diagnosing urinary tract infections in symptomatic patients, although culture is often unnecessary for diagnosing typical symptomatic infection. Women with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections can be treated with continuous or postcoital prophylactic antibiotics; other treatment options include self-started antibiotics, cranberry products, and behavioral modification. Patients at risk of complicated urinary tract infections are best managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, urine culture to guide subsequent therapy, and renal imaging studies if structural abnormalities are suspected.

Use of resources

There was little difference between groups for further contacts recorded in the four weeks after consent (immediate antibiotics 6/58 (10%), midstream urine 9/52 (17%), dipstick 6/51 (12%) symptom score 8/64 (13%), delayed antibiotics 5/58 (9%); P = 0.79), nor use of midstream urine analysis over the next month (immediate antibiotics 3/58 (5%), midstream urine 3/52 (6%), dipstick 4/51 (8%), symptom score 5/64 (8%), delayed antibiotics 3/58 (5%) P = 0.95). The average follow-up was 575 days (range 35 to 968). During follow-up there was no overall difference in time to reconsultation, but there was non-significant evidence that repeat consultations might be reduced in the delayed group (table 2). As some data for time to first reconsultations were missing for Cox regression, we also used more complete data to assess whether reconsultation had occurred, controlling for time between randomisation and notes review: in the immediate antibiotics group 32/58 (55%) returned, and other groups reconsulted less: midstream urine odds ratio 0.65 (0.30 to 1.40); dipstick 0.87 (0.40 to 1.90); symptom score 0.57 (0.27 to 1.18); and delayed 0.44 (0.21 to 0.95). Patients who waited for at least 48 hours before using their prescription reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (0.36 to 0.89); P = 0.014). No major adverse events (major illness, admission to hospital, death) were reported for any group, and no significant differences in skin rash or thrush were reported.

### Development of quality indicators for the antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections: a first step to measure and improve care [^111GMWUv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriateness of antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) is important. The aim of this study was to develop a set of valid, reliable, and applicable indicators to assess the quality of antibiotic use in the treatment of hospitalized patients with complicated UTI.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of 13 experts reviewed and prioritized recommendations extracted from a recently developed evidence-based national guideline for the treatment of complicated UTI. The content validity was assessed in 2 consecutive rounds with an in-between discussion meeting. Next, we tested the feasibility, interobserver reliability, opportunity for improvement, and case-mix stability of the potential indicators for a data set of 341 inpatients and outpatients with complicated UTIs who were treated at the urology or internal medicine departments at 4 hospitals.

Results

The panel selected and prioritized 13 indicators. Four and 9 indicators were performed satisfactorily in the urology and internal medicine departments, as follows: performance of urine culture, prescription of treatment in accordance with guidelines, tailoring of treatment on the basis of culture results, and a switch to oral treatment when possible in the urology and internal medicine departments; and selective use of fluoroquinolones, administration of treatment for at least 10 days, prescription of treatment for men in accordance with guidelines, replacement of catheters in patients with UTI, and adaptation of the dosage on the basis of renal function in the internal medicine department.

Conclusion

A systemic evidence- and consensus-based approach was used to develop a set of valid quality indicators. Tests of the applicability of these indicators in practice in different settings is essential before they are used in quality-improvement strategies.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^112sj9Uy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Pyelonephritis in pregnancy — diagnosis should be suspected with fever of 38.0° C or higher plus urine studies suggesting UTI, with additional upper genitourinary symptoms supporting the diagnosis; initial management should be in the inpatient setting, using empiric antibiotics with adequate renal tissue penetration targeted to likely pathogens, adjusted based on culture and sensitivity, with parenteral antibiotics continued until the patient is clinically improving, and patients should complete a total of 14 days of antibiotic therapy; after treatment there is insufficient evidence to guide management, though clinicians may consider suppressive therapy for the remainder of the pregnancy, as for recurrent UTI.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^1143JJsA]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Single-dose antibiotic therapy fell into disfavor when it was observed that women had a high risk of recurrence within six weeks of the initial treatment. 14, 15 The risk was attributed to the failure of single-dose antibiotics to eradicate gram-negative bacteria from the rectum, the source or reservoir for ascending uropathogens. Unlike single-dose antibiotic therapy, a three-day regimen reduces rectal carriage of gram-negative bacteria and is not associated with a high recurrence rate. Thus, three-day regimens appear to offer the optimal combination of convenience, low cost and an efficacy comparable to that of seven-day or longer regimens but with fewer side effects. On the basis of cost and efficacy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the antibiotic of choice in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in young women.

The use of fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs should be discouraged, except in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or trimethoprim, who have a high frequency of antibiotic resistance because of recent antibiotic treatment or who reside in an area in which significant resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been noted. Patients who are too ill to take oral antibiotics or who are unable to take them should initially be treated with parenterally administered single agents, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a third-generation cephalosporin, aztreonam, a broad-spectrum penicillin, a quinolone or an aminoglycoside. The choice of antibiotic is largely empiric, but Gram staining of the urine may be helpful. Once these patients have improved clinically, they can be switched to oral therapy based on the results of culture and sensitivity studies.

Pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria should be treated with a three- to seven-day course of antibiotics, and the urine should subsequently be cultured to ensure cure and the avoidance of relapse. Symptomatic urinary tract infections complicate 1 to 2 percent of pregnancies, usually in women with persistent bacteriuria. 28, 29 Most pregnant women with pyelonephritis should be hospitalized. Initially, these patients should receive intravenous antibiotic therapy. They should complete a 14-day course of acute antibiotic therapy followed by nightly suppressive therapy until delivery. Recent studies have shown that selected pregnant women with pyelonephritis can be treated with either outpatient intramuscularly administered ceftriaxone or orally administered cephalexin.

Use of advice sheets

For each patient, a structured advice sheet was used, which supported the initial management according to the proposed strategy — as used successfully in previous studies from this group. This study's pragmatic design allowed for variation according to negotiation with patients, as would happen in practice. Thus, although clinicians negotiated initial antibiotic management based on the sheets, they were allowed to provide immediate antibiotics in situations where there were strong patient expectations. Conversely, provided the initial proposed management was the management indicated by the sheet, doctors and nurses had discretion to do a dipstick test or order a midstream urine test — either negotiated because of patient pressure or expectation or because of clinical perceptions of the requirement for adequate documentation of diagnosis. Health professionals were asked to document what they did in each case, and we used this information in the analysis to assess whether the results were confounded by such behaviour. We did an in-depth review of 38 case notes with the health professionals concerned in the largest recruiting practice to assess why midstream urines and dipsticks were used when not indicated by the advice sheets.

A research assistant independent of the trial team and blinded to study group reviewed notes to document use of midstream urine analysis, antibiotic prescription, and referrals.

### Stewardship prompts to improve antibiotic selection for urinary tract infection… [^111693Gr]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Interventions CPOE prompts recommending empiric standard-spectrum antibiotics in patients ordered to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics who have low estimated absolute risk of MDRO UTI, coupled with feedback and education. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy. Secondary outcomes included empiric vancomycin and antipseudomonal days of therapy. Safety outcomes included days to intensive care unit transfer and hospital length of stay. Outcomes were assessed using generalized linear mixed-effect models to assess differences between the baseline and intervention periods.

Conclusions and Relevance Compared with routine stewardship, CPOE prompts providing real-time recommendations for standard-spectrum antibiotics for patients with low MDRO risk coupled with feedback and education significantly reduced empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic use among noncritically ill adults admitted with UTI without changing hospital length of stay or days to ICU transfers. Antibiotic stewardship efforts for UTI have largely focused on diagnostic stewardship, shortening duration of therapy, and deescalating extended-spectrum to standard-spectrum antibiotics. 11–15 Few studies have addressed reducing unnecessary extended-spectrum antibiotic use among hospitalized patients with UTI before culture results return. 11 Clinician concern for MDRO drives initial selection of extended-spectrum antibiotics, though the majority can be managed with standard-spectrum antibiotics.

11, 16, 17 Successfully identifying patients with low risk for MDRO UTI could reduce empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic exposure. The antibiotic stewardship intervention used in this study resulted in a 17. 4% reduction in empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic use for noncritically ill patients hospitalized for UTI. In this trial, approximately 40% of patients hospitalized for UTI in the baseline period received empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting that this intervention could be a viable strategy to reduce extended-spectrum antibiotics in up to 200 000 adults hospitalized in the US who receive unnecessarily broad antibiotics for UTI annually. 1, 2, 30 Antipseudomonal antibiotics are the most commonly overused antibiotics in hospitalized patients with UTI and its use was reduced by one-fifth.

19 These reductions were accompanied by an increase in initial prescribing of standard-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting increased clinician comfort to avoid empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics. Notably, the reductions occurred without a change in the safety outcomes of ICU transfer and hospital length of stay and persisted.

Emergency physicians encounter urinary tract infections (UTIs) in a wide spectrum of disease severity and patient populations. The challenges of managing UTIs in an emergency department include limited history, lack of follow-up, and lack of culture and susceptibility results. Most patients do not require an extensive diagnostic evaluation and can be safely managed as outpatients with oral antibiotics. The diagnostic approach to and treatment of adults presenting to emergency departments with UTIs are reviewed.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^115tJ7Au]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Symptom control

The upper confidence intervals for the main outcome (frequency symptoms) suggest that alternative strategies are unlikely to result in poor symptom control (around 18% worsening for the midstream urine or delayed groups, and 2% in dipstick and symptom score groups). There was some evidence that if women waited more than 48 hour they reconsulted less but had poorer control of symptoms, particularly for the midstream urine group. The finding of worse symptoms in such patients is in agreement with evidence of the effect of antibiotics from observational studies and trials. Why the delayed group who waited a similar time did not have increased symptoms, however, is unclear. This might be a chance finding, but it might be because women in the midstream urine group find passively waiting for a laboratory result to be more distressing than being given the freedom to choose when to stop the delay according to their symptoms (the empirical delayed group). A previous study treated women negative for nitrite and leucocyte esterase with antibiotics and found symptomatic benefit, but as about a third of women who have negative results for all important dipstick tests (that is, not only nitrite and leucocyte but also blood) still have urinary tract infection based on rigorous laboratory confirmation, the finding of a benefit in women with negative dipstick resultsmight be expected. The poor negative predictive value of dipsticks suggests that the offer of some kind of antibiotic safety net — such as delayed prescribing — to women with negative dipstick results is reasonable.

Antibiotic use

A modest reduction in antibiotic use (20–25%) was achieved in all groups except the symptom score group. While these reductions are probably useful for public health, and the effect might plausibly increase with time as patient expectations change, the magnitude of the effect is in contrast to delayed antibiotic prescription among patients with respiratory infections. This is perhaps not surprising given that few respiratory infections are bacterial whereas most suspected urinary tract infections are (66% of the midstream urine group had confirmed infection, similar to the previous study). There was some evidence that delayed prescribing might reduce reconsultation as we hypothesised, but this was not significant, probably because of the relatively low power of this analysis.

AUA/SUFU — urinary tract infection guidance in NLUTD advises that in asymptomatic NLUTD patients, clinicians should not perform surveillance/screening urine testing, including urine culture (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C), and clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with NLUTD (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In NLUTD patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection, clinicians should obtain a urinalysis and urine culture (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In NLUTD patients with a febrile urinary tract infection, clinicians should order upper tract imaging if the patient does not respond appropriately to antibiotic therapy or the patient is moderate- or high-risk and is not up to date with routine upper tract imaging, regardless of their response to therapy (Clinical Principle). In NLUTD patients with a suspected urinary tract infection and an indwelling catheter, clinicians should obtain the urine culture specimen after changing the catheter and after allowing for urine accumulation while plugging the catheter, and urine should not be obtained from the extension tubing or collection bag (Clinical Principle). In NLUTD patients with recurrent urinary tract infections, clinicians should evaluate the upper and lower urinary tracts with imaging and cystoscopy (Clinical Principle), and in those with an unremarkable evaluation of the upper and lower urinary tract, clinicians may perform urodynamic evaluation (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In NLUTD patients who manage their bladder with an indwelling catheter, clinicians should not use daily antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infection (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B).

Q14. A 60-year-old patient with a history of CAD presents to the emergency department with chest pain and cough lasting for 2 days. The right-sided thoracic chest pain is persistent, moderate in intensity, non-radiating, and increases in intensity during inspiration. The last episode of chest pain started 8 h prior to admission and the patient is still mildly symptomatic in the emergency department. He is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination is unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG shows T-wave inversion in lead I and aVL, which were already noted in the ECG performed last year. The initial hs-cTn I Architect concentration is very low/undetectable at 2 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). The emergency department intern, a bright young physician who wants to become a cardiologist, challenges you by saying that 'it is obvious that the chest pain does not represent acute MI and no additional investigations or blood tests in this respect are needed'. Is she right?

Yes. NSTEMI, based on the delay between symptom onset and blood test, can be reliably ruled-out with a single very low level of hs-cTn T/I. In addition, unstable angina is extremely unlikely since prolonged ischaemia is expected to lead to some degree of cTn elevation. An alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia/bronchitis should be considered.

Q15. You are supervising the emergency department/chest pain unit (CPU) and see an 80-year-old patient with a history of CAD, prior MI, and hypertensive heart disease presenting with persistent moderate right-sided thoracic chest pain ongoing for 7 h that increases in intensity during exercise and inspiration. In addition, he has mild fever and an increasing productive cough over the last 3 days. He is haemodynamically stable and the initial physical examination reveals rales over the base of the right lung. ECG shows T-wave inversion in V3–V6, which were already noted on the ECG performed 3 years ago. A chest X-ray shows an infiltrate in the right lung suggestive of pneumonia. Your intern is about to order blood cultures (plus legionella and pneumococcus antigen in the urine) and prescribe antibiotics when the hs-cTn T level is reported from the laboratory as elevated. Your intern now asks you if the patient needs treatment for pneumonia, NSTEMI, or both.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^117A73ga]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

The detailed review and discussion of cases — where dipstick documentation and midstream urine analysis were not prompted by the advice sheets — confirmed that subversion of protocol had probably not occurred. The main reasons highlighted were: negotiation based on patient expectation, professional perception of the need for adequate documentation (dipstick results being regarded as useful even if management was not based on them), and occasionally clinical reasons (for example, a higher risk of complication was expected; a more definite initial diagnosis was required) were cited for unprompted investigations.

Symptoms

The average duration of symptoms rated as moderately bad or worse with immediate antibiotics was 3.5 days. Overall, there were no significant differences in symptom duration, severity of frequency symptoms, or severity of unwell symptoms between the antibiotic management strategies (table 2). The confidence intervals for symptom severity were all, with the exception of the midstream urine group, within the limit of SD 0.5 — the clinically important difference we specified a priori. The confidence intervals here are particularly helpful in showing that the estimates for the dipstick, symptom, and delayed antibiotics groups are unlikely to be 0.5 worse on the diary score — that is, unlikely to do harm — which is what clinicians need to know if they are considering changing from their current empirical treatment strategy. Those women who delayed antibiotics for 48 hours or more, however, were likely to have 37% longer duration of symptoms rated as moderately bad (incidence rate ratio 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.68), P < 0.001). The effect of delaying more than 48 hours predominantly applied to the midstream urine group (likelihood ratio test for interaction for the five groups P = 0.08; for midstream urine group v the other groups P = 0.02) (table 3). Women delayed longest in both the midstream urine and the delayed groups (the average day starting antibiotics was 1.19 for immediate antibiotics, 2.18 for midstream urine, 1.43 for dipstick testing, 1.40 for symptom score, and 2.21 for delayed antibiotics).

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^111s1hMw]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Example: Urinary tract infections in children present in ways which overlap with many other acute childhood illnesses. The diagnostic challenge is to identify children whose urine contains bacteria so that antibiotic therapy can be rationalised and kept to a safe minimum. Carrying out high quality microbiology on urine samples from all acutely unwell children is difficult and inefficient. Research seeks clinical prediction rules that select children with an increased probability of bacteriologically-positive infection for urine testing, using information including sociodemographics and urinary and non-urinary symptoms. The question is whether application of the prediction rule, plus targeted testing and treatment of identified bacteriologically-positive children, improves outcomes for those who are tested and does no harm to those who are not.

This example illustrates how a stratified process for diagnosis may support clinical decisions, including avoiding unnecessary investigation and treatment in patients with low disease probability. The usefulness of this process is defined by the prognosis of all children engaged in it.

Diagnostic research emphasises the need for evidence that new tests improve outcomes before adoption in practice. This can be done by linking advances in disease detection with existing evidence for treatment efficacy, or by demonstrating that the new test lowers costs or improves safety. However, it may be necessary to evaluate whether the new diagnostic process changes decision making, improves outcomes in persons classified with the disease, and avoids unnecessary treatment in persons without the disease. The justification for novelty in diagnostic practice is whether it improves patient prognosis. Evidence for this may be lacking.

Example: A new source of information about suspected coronary heart disease is cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Medical imaging is the fastest growing physician-ordered service in the US Medicare system. The most important indicator for cardiovascular imaging in Europe is suspected coronary artery disease and myocardial ischaemia. The safety of cardiovascular imaging and its potential to change the diagnosis are established, but whether its use improves patient outcomes has not been addressed, although trials are underway. Evidence is needed since "… as an imaging community we have failed to demonstrate the added value of cardiac imaging in terms of improved quality of care or improved outcomes".

This demand for prognostic evidence of improved outcomes when evaluating new diagnostic information poses substantial challenges of feasibility for the necessary research, especially for studies of long-term impact and cost; this is a limitation on the prognostic model. Information science, and its expanding reservoir of data linked to patient outcomes, will need to drive novel methods to address these questions such as modelling of long-term outcomes by combining data from cross-sectional diagnostic and short-term effectiveness studies.

### Effect of microbiology comment nudging on antibiotic use in asymptomatic bacteriuria: a before-and-after quasi-experimental study [^114fbnQk]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings suggest that implementation of the simple behavioral intervention of a microbiology comment nudge reduced 4 metrics: (1) antibiotic continuation beyond 72 hours, (2) antibiotics continued beyond 48 hours, (3) antibiotics prescribed at discharge, and (4) total antibiotic DOT. Although the absolute reductions in these end points was relatively small, implementing a comment nudge is a very low-cost, low-resource intervention. Our findings of reduced antibiotic utilization from a comment nudge echoes findings from similar studies. Specifically, a study by Daley et alevaluated withholding culture and susceptibility results and replacing the results with, "This POSITIVE urine culture may represent asymptomatic bacteriuria or urinary tract infection. If urinary tract infection is suspected clinically, please call the microbiology laboratory… for identification and susceptibility results" in patients with positive urine cultures. Furthermore, appropriate treatment increased with this intervention (80% vs 52.7%; P = 0.002). However, these researchers included patients with symptomatic UTI as well, whereas we evaluated specifically asymptomatic patients. Additionally, Leis et aldemonstrated that withholding positive urine culture results in noncatheterized inpatients led to reduced antimicrobial therapy (48% vs 12%; P = 0.002) when the following microbiology comment was added: "The majority of positive urine cultures from inpatients without an indwelling urinary catheter represent asymptomatic bacteriuria. If you strongly suspect that your patient has developed a urinary tract infection, please call the microbiology laboratory". Comparatively, we found a more modest decrease in antibiotic utilization than the aforementioned studies, which is likely explained by those studies involving withholding culture and susceptibility results unless providers contacted the microbiology department. Our results demonstrate that comment nudging may independently reduce antibiotic utilization in ASB without involving an extra step, albeit to a lesser extent.

Urine culture in living kidney donor candidates — Urine should be sent for culture from all donor candidates at evaluation, and ideally repeated close to the time of donation (eg, within the preceding 2 weeks), and acute symptomatic urinary tract infection is a reason to postpone donation. Detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not infrequent, especially in female donors, and a history of urinary tract infection in a donor candidate, particularly if there is a family history of reflux nephropathy, or in a male, requires detailed imaging of the kidneys (eg, assessment for cortical scarring). Any active bacterial or fungal infection in the donor should be treated and, ideally, resolved before donation and transplantation, and antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to the recipient if resolution of infection is not confirmed before donation, as a positive urine culture early after transplantation, even when asymptomatic, may be associated with increased risk of acute rejection in the recipient.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Cross-over data supporting long-term antibiotic treatment in patients with painful lower urinary tract symptoms, pyuria and negative urinalysis [^116vrr3E]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and symptoms of recurrent cystitis in patients with negative urinalysis present a worrying management problem. The treatment of painful lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is a significant challenge, and there are few quality data to guide clinicians. The evidence for oral or intravesical therapies for painful bladder symptoms is poor. Cystodistension and urethral dilation are also deployed without evidence to support their utility. Patients with recurrent, acute symptoms of cystitis and negative urinalysis are often exposed to multiple, short courses of antibiotics in primary care without evidence of benefit.

While there are published guidelines for managing acute and recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), there are none for patients who may be suffering a chronic form of the disease. Recently, we published data describing our experience treating women with chronic painful LUTS for a mean duration of 6 years prior to presentation to our clinic. These patients had been exposed to conventional therapies without a resolution of symptoms. Data were gathered from 624 patients over 10 years. Given microscopic pyuria and symptoms, we presumed an infectious cause even in the face of negative dipstick urinalysis and urine cultures, as these tests lack sensitivity and fail to detect infective organisms in bona fide disease. This previous report described the evolution of a simple management regimen using first-generation, narrow-spectrum, urinary antibiotics combined with methenamine hippurate, guided by symptom palliation and the resolution of pyuria. The study demonstrated that treatment was associated with symptomatic improvement and the resolution of biomarkers of infection. There were few treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and no significant increase in antibiotic-resistant isolates. These data are being employed to develop a randomised trial (RCT).

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^1156ixJC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis in pregnant individuals — recommended inpatient management, expected improvement timeline, and completion strategy are detailed. Given the associated risks, inpatient management is recommended for patients with acute pyelonephritis, with initial management including fluid hydration and initiation of intravenous antibiotics and antibiotic therapy started while awaiting urine culture results and tailored once microbiology results are available. The majority of patients (75–95%) have clinical improvement (defined as being afebrile for more than 24 hours and improvement of symptoms) within 48–72 hours after initiation of intravenous antibiotics; patients not showing clinical improvement within 72 hours should be further evaluated to ensure bacterial resistance is not present and undergo imaging to rule out other urinary tract pathology. After clinical improvement, patients should be transitioned to appropriate oral antibiotics based on culture sensitivity to complete a 14-day course of therapy; nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin are not appropriate oral agents to complete treatment for pyelonephritis, and urine culture should be obtained after completion of antibiotics to ensure no residual infection.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.
