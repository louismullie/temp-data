## Question

A 32-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after a motorcycle accident. He is hemodynamically stable but has significant pelvic pain and visible abrasions over the perineum. On initial assessment, there is blood at the urethral meatus and bruising around the perianal area. The trauma team suspects a pelvic fracture and possible rectal injury.

According to current WSES guidelines, what specific physical examinations and investigations should be performed to assess for rectal injury in this patient, and in what sequence?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the specific physical examinations and investigations that should be performed to assess for rectal injury in a hemodynamically stable 32-year-old male with suspected pelvic fracture and possible rectal injury, and in what sequence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the WSES-recommended sequence of rectal evaluation. Next, I will examine the details of the digital rectal exam and what constitutes a positive finding. After that, I need to check the indications and technique for rigid proctoscopy. Then, I should consider adjunct imaging and when it changes management. Finally, I will integrate associated injuries, especially urethral trauma, and summarize the algorithm with caveats and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability. High-energy blunt pelvic trauma with perineal abrasions, blood at the urethral meatus, and perianal bruising raises concern for both pelvic ring injury and associated rectal or urethral trauma; the incidence of anorectal lesions in pelvic fractures is reported between 18% and 64%, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and proceed with guideline-directed evaluation rather than relying on symptoms alone [^c13dbeb1] [^fb519f8e].

> Next, I should review the WSES-recommended sequence for rectal injury assessment. Wait, let me verify the exact wording: the WSES guideline states that in patients with high suspicion of rectal injuries, perineal and rectal digital examination should be performed, and if the rectal exam is positive, proctoscopy is recommended; this establishes a two-step sequence of DRE followed by rigid proctoscopy when indicated [^fb519f8e] [^3a108958].

> I will now examine the digital rectal examination elements I must document. I need to check for blood on the glove, mucosal lacerations, a non-palpable or abnormally positioned prostate suggesting posterior urethral disruption, rectal wall integrity, and any bony fragments palpable within the rectum; these findings increase the likelihood of rectal injury and should trigger proctoscopy, whereas a completely normal DRE does not exclude injury and should be interpreted cautiously [^c13dbeb1] [^47bcc00b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sensitivity. I initially thought DRE might reliably detect most rectal injuries, but I should double-check the evidence; contemporary reviews show DRE has poor sensitivity for gastrointestinal and urethral injuries in trauma, so a negative DRE cannot safely rule out a rectal wound, reinforcing the need for proctoscopy when suspicion remains high based on mechanism and external findings [^47bcc00b].

> Next, I should review the indication and technique for rigid proctoscopy. If the DRE is positive or if clinical suspicion remains high despite a negative DRE, rigid proctoscopy is recommended to directly visualize the rectal mucosa for lacerations, hematomas, or full-thickness defects; I need to ensure adequate analgesia or sedation if needed and avoid forceful advancement to prevent iatrogenic injury, documenting the distance from the anal verge and clock-face orientation of any lesion [^3a108958] [^c13dbeb1].

> Let me consider adjunct imaging and when it changes management. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is indicated in hemodynamically stable pelvic trauma to evaluate for hemorrhage and associated injuries, but it is not the primary modality to diagnose a rectal wall breach; however, CT may show indirect signs such as perirectal air, extraluminal contrast, or perirectal fat stranding that raise suspicion and support operative planning, so I should integrate CT findings with the anorectal exam rather than replace it [^ff1fd472] [^9d47de81].

> But wait, what if there is concomitant urethral injury. I need to ensure I do not violate the urethra by attempting Foley placement before ruling out urethral disruption; with blood at the meatus and pelvic fracture, retrograde urethrography is indicated prior to catheterization, and while evaluating the urethra, I should remember that up to 5% of urethral injuries have associated rectal injuries, so a careful rectal exam remains pertinent even when the urologic workup is prioritized [^161bb755] [^1adf9229].

> I should confirm the overall algorithm and documentation priorities. The WSES sequence is: perform a focused perineal inspection and digital rectal exam in all patients with high suspicion of rectal injury; if the DRE is positive or suspicion persists, proceed to rigid proctoscopy; use CT with IV contrast for global pelvic assessment and hemorrhage evaluation in stable patients, recognizing CT is not the definitive test for rectal mucosal injury; and throughout, document external perineal findings, DRE results, proctoscopic findings, and any decisions to defer based on hemodynamics or analgesia needs [^fb519f8e] [^3a108958] [^ff1fd472].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties and next steps. Given the limited sensitivity of DRE, a negative exam does not exclude injury; if the clinical picture remains concerning, I should advocate for proctoscopy or, if unavailable, consider operative exploration when other indications exist, while coordinating with urology for urethral evaluation and with surgery for potential diversion and repair decisions if a rectal injury is confirmed [^47bcc00b] [^1adf9229].

In a hemodynamically stable patient with suspected rectal injury from pelvic trauma, WSES recommends a **stepwise approach**: perform a focused perineal and digital rectal exam to assess for blood, lacerations, or bony fragments [^fb519f8e]; if positive or suspicion remains high, proceed to **rigid proctoscopy** for direct visualization of the rectal mucosa [^3a108958]. CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is indicated to evaluate associated injuries and pelvic hemorrhage, but it is not the primary modality for diagnosing rectal injury [^ff1fd472]. This sequence balances diagnostic yield, speed, and safety in the trauma setting.

---

## Indications for rectal injury assessment

Rectal injury should be suspected in patients with:

- **Perineal abrasions or lacerations**: Especially with blood at the urethral meatus or perianal bruising [^c13dbeb1].
- **Pelvic fracture patterns**: Particularly anteroposterior compression (APC) or vertical shear injuries [^1f6c4751].
- **Clinical signs**: Rectal bleeding, pain, or suspected foreign body penetration [^c13dbeb1].

---

## Recommended physical examinations

### Perineal examination

Inspect the perineum for **abrasions, lacerations, hematomas, or open wounds**, and assess the **anal sphincter tone** and integrity to identify sphincter injury [^c13dbeb1].

---

### Digital rectal examination (DRE)

Perform a **DRE** to evaluate for:

- **Blood on the glove**: Suggesting rectal mucosal injury [^c13dbeb1].
- **Lacerations or irregularities**: Indicating possible rectal wall injury [^c13dbeb1].
- **Bony fragments**: Palpable within the rectum, suggesting communication with pelvic fractures [^c13dbeb1].
- **Prostate position**: Non-palpable or high-riding prostate suggesting urethral injury [^1adf9229].

---

## Recommended investigations

### Rigid proctoscopy

Rigid proctoscopy is indicated when the **DRE is positive** or suspicion remains high despite a negative DRE [^3a108958]. It allows direct visualization of the rectal mucosa to identify lacerations, hematomas, or full-thickness injuries [^1f6c4751].

---

### Computed tomography (CT) scan

CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is recommended in hemodynamically stable patients to evaluate **associated injuries**, pelvic hemorrhage, and fracture patterns [^ff1fd472]. It is not the primary modality for diagnosing rectal injury but provides valuable information for overall management [^ff1fd472].

---

## Sequence of evaluation

The recommended sequence of evaluation is:

| **Step** | **Evaluation** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Perineal examination | All patients with suspected rectal injury |
| 2 | Digital rectal examination (DRE) | All patients with suspected rectal injury |
| 3 | Rigid proctoscopy | Positive DRE or high suspicion despite negative DRE |
| 4 | CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast | Hemodynamically stable patients to evaluate associated injuries and hemorrhage |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Patient discomfort**: DRE and proctoscopy may cause discomfort; consider analgesia or sedation if needed.
- **False negatives**: DRE may miss subtle injuries; maintain high suspicion if clinical signs persist [^47bcc00b].
- **Hemodynamic instability**: In unstable patients, prioritize hemorrhage control and resuscitation over detailed rectal evaluation [^e49e6993].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Perineal and digital rectal examinations**: Mandatory in patients with suspected rectal injury [^fb519f8e].
- **Rigid proctoscopy**: Recommended if DRE is positive or suspicion remains high [^3a108958].
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast**: Indicated in stable patients to evaluate associated injuries and hemorrhage [^ff1fd472].

---

The WSES recommends a **stepwise approach** to rectal injury assessment in pelvic trauma: perineal and digital rectal exams first, then rigid proctoscopy if indicated, and CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast in stable patients to evaluate associated injuries and hemorrhage [^fb519f8e] [^3a108958] [^ff1fd472]. This sequence ensures accurate diagnosis while prioritizing patient stability and safety.

Recommendations for diagnostic tools use in Pelvic Trauma

- The time between arrival in the Emergency Department and definitive bleeding control should be minimized to improve outcomes of patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures [Grade 2A].
- Serum lactate and base deficit represent sensitive diagnostic markers to estimate the extent of traumatic-haemorrhagic shock, and to monitor response to resuscitation [Grade 1B].
- The use of Pelvic X-ray and E-FAST in the Emergency Department is recommended in hemodynamic and mechanic unstable patients with pelvic trauma and allows to identify the injuries that require an early pelvic stabilization, an early angiography, and a rapid reductive maneuver, as well as laparotomy [Grade 1B].
- Patients with pelvic trauma associated to hemodynamic normality or stability should undergo further diagnostic workup with multi phasic CT-scan with intravenous contrast to exclude pelvic hemorrhage [Grade 1B].
- CT-scan with 3-Dimensional bones reconstructions reduces the tissue damage during invasive procedures, the risk of neurological disorders after surgical fixation, operative time, and irradiation and the required expertise [Grade 1B].
- Retrograde urethrogram or/and urethrocystogram with contrast CT-scan is recommended in presence of local perineal clinical hematoma and pelvic disruption at Pelvic X-ray [Grade 1B].
- Perineal and a rectal digital examination are mandatory in case of high suspicious of rectal injuries [Grade 1B].
- In case of a positive rectal examination, proctoscopy is recommended [Grade 1C].

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management of pelvic trauma. The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

Typically, the hospital admission is delayed, due to the embarrassment of these patients and their effort to remove the object at home ; furthermore, in up to 20% of cases, patients will not initially refer to the retained AFB as the chief complaint. Common complaints include rectal or abdominal pain, constipation or obstipation, bright red blood per rectum, or incontinence. Given these issues, a high index of suspicion is required to accurately diagnose this condition, as well as the utmost degree of professionalism. Initial evaluation should be based on the patient’s history and physical examination; physical examination should firstly assess for the presence of peritonitis and clinical signs such as tachycardia, fever, and hypotension that should not be underestimated. Digital rectal examination is a crucial part of physical examination and provides useful information on the position of the object and the extent of local injury; however, digital rectal examination should be performed carefully and possibly after the acquisition of an abdomen X-ray, to prevent accidental injury to the surgeon from sharp objects. All findings collected during physical examination should be accurately reported (external aspect of the perianal area, presence of abrasions or bruising, status of the anal sphincter) because are necessary to investigate an alleged sexual assault. When these first steps do not suggest the presence of a perforation, routine laboratory exams are unnecessary, except in those cases requiring extraction under spinal or general anesthesia.

As covered in the complicated RP section, in case of suspected bowel perforation, the request of CBC and the dosage of serum creatinine, and inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactates) is useful to assess the general status of the patient. Furthermore, serum toxicology is mandatory in cases of use or concealment of illicit drugs.

6.B - In patients with a suspected retained anorectal foreign body, which are the appropriate imaging investigations?

In patients with suspected retained anorectal foreign body, we recommend lateral and anteroposterior plain X-ray film of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to identify the foreign body position and determine its shape, size, and location and the possible presence of pneumoperitoneum (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 1B).

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of biochemical investigations in patients with suspected thrombosed or strangulated hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

In patients with suspected bleeding hemorrhoids, we suggest to collect a focused medical history and to perform a complete physical examination, including a digital rectal examination, to rule out other causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with suspected bleeding hemorrhoids, we suggest to check vital signs, to determine hemoglobin and hematocrit, and to assess coagulation to evaluate the severity of the bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C). In case of severe bleeding, we suggest blood typing and cross-matching (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

Notes on the use of the guidelines: aims, targets, and limitations

These guidelines aim to present state of the art on diagnosis and therapeutic options for optimal management of anorectal emergencies. The intent is to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on this specific topic, providing an up-to-date tool that can help during the decision-making process. For this reason, the guidelines are evidence-based and the grade of recommendation is provided to summarize the evidence available in the literature. The population considered in these guidelines consists of adult patients with suspected anorectal emergencies. The practice guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on the best available evidence and consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which should be determined after taking into account the working conditions of each single medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, the responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein and not with the consensus group.

### Predictors of bleeding from stable pelvic fractures (...) [^fd7012ac]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Flowchart showing our study patient population and the breakdown of the 3 groups. Figure 2. Pelvic computed tomographic scan of a 79-year-old woman receiving coumadin therapy who presented to the emergency department after a fall. Despite the fact that the plain pelvic radiographs did not identify any tissue, joint, or bone abnormalities, the pelvic computed tomographic scan with intravenous contrast showed a large right pelvic hematoma associated with a small superior pubic ramus fracture. © 2025 Major pelvic fractures after trauma are often associated with bleeding, intra-abdominal injuries, and death. 1 The overall mortality from pelvic fractures depends on the associated injuries and ranges from 5% to 14%. 2-4 Severe hemorrhage from the disrupted venous and arterial vessels near the fractured structures accounts for the early mortality, although a direct association between the pelvic bleeding and death is hard to draw if multiple injuries are present.

4, 5 Several predictors, including fracture type, patient age, hemodynamic parameters, and laboratory values, have been described to identify those patients who may benefit from early angiography and embolization. 6, 7. Stable pelvic fractures do not usually cause significant pelvic bleeding. Only case reports have been published on this issue. 8, 9 The objective of this study was to identify the rate and predictors of bleeding among patients with SPFs. Our hypothesis is that these uncommon scenarios can be predicted on the basis of simple indicators, resulting in close monitoring or early intervention. Patients with SPFs who were admitted to the level 1 academic trauma center at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, between January 1, 2002, and June 30, 2007, were retrospectively identified through our trauma registry. The SPFs were defined as fractures not requiring external or internal fixation.

Significant bleeding was defined as the need for blood transfusion and/or intervention for bleeding control within the first 24 hours after admission. Because of the retrospective nature of our study, we could not evaluate the vectors of force causing the pelvic fracture and thus used the Tile classification, which focuses on pelvic stability, to categorize the fractures. 10, 11 According to this classification, type A fractures are rotationally and vertically stable; type B fractures are vertically stable but rotationally unstable owing to an incomplete posterior arch disruption; and type C fractures are vertically and rotationally unstable owing to a complete posterior arch disruption. Three groups were defined: group A included patients without SigBleed; group B included patients with SigBleed of a nonpelvic cause; and group C included patients with SigBleed caused by the SPF.

The distinction between groups B and C was based on the presence of other injuries causing bleeding, such as a splenic or liver laceration or a large pelvic hematoma with extravasation on CT scans. There were 280 patients in group A, 90 in group B, and 21 in group C. A total of 310 patients had a Tile type A fracture and 20 had a Tile type B. Also, 61 patients had an isolated acetabular fracture. In 3 patients, the pelvic bleeding was the cause of, or a significant contributor to, their death. An 83-year-old patient with SPFs, lower-extremity fractures, and upper-extremity degloving injuries died 24 hours after receiving multiple blood transfusions. A 91-year-old patient with SPFs and a humerus fracture underwent angiography, but no extravasation was found, and she did not undergo embolization. On posttrauma day 8, she died of multiorgan failure related to the initial bleeding.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^a87f84bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Anorectal emergencies comprise a wide variety of diseases that share common symptoms, i.e. anorectal pain or bleeding and might require immediate management. While most of the underlying conditions do not need inpatient management, some of them could be life-threatening and need prompt recognition and treatment. It is well known that an incorrect diagnosis is frequent for anorectal diseases and that a delayed diagnosis is related to an impaired outcome. This paper aims to improve the knowledge and the awareness on this specific topic and to provide a useful tool for every physician dealing with anorectal emergencies.

The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the boards of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) to perform a systematic review of the available literature and to provide evidence-based statements with immediate practical application. All the statements were presented and discussed during the WSES-AAST-WJES Consensus Conference on Anorectal Emergencies, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES-AAST panel of experts was reached. We structured our work into seven main topics to cover the entire management of patients with anorectal emergencies and to provide an up-to-date, easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.

### Pelvic trauma: WSES classification and guidelines [^c13dbeb1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The high incidence of ano-rectal lesions (18–64%) requires careful study of the ano-rectal region. At first a perineal and a rectal digital examination to detect blood, rectal wall weakness and non-palpable prostate should be done. In case of positive rectal examination a rigid proctoscopy should be strongly considered.

Tile Classification and Young and Burgess Classification (Fig. 2) are the most commonly used classifications for pelvic ring injuries. These classifications are based on the direction of forces causing fracture and the associated instability of pelvis with four injury patterns: lateral compression, antero-posterior compression (external rotation), vertical shear, combined mechanism. The Young and Burgess classification is more beneficial for specialists, as a counterpart the second seems to be more easily remembered and applied.

Role of pelvic binder in hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures

- The application of non-invasive external pelvic compression is recommended as an early strategy to stabilize the pelvic ring and decrease the amount of pelvic haemorrhage in the early resuscitation phase. [Grade 1A]
- Pelvic binders are superior to sheet wrapping in the effectiveness of pelvic haemorrhage control [Grade 1C].
- Non-invasive external pelvic compression devices should be removed as soon as physiologically justifiable, and replaced by external pelvic fixation, or definitive pelvic stabilization, if indicated [Grade 1B].
- Pelvic binders should be positioned cautiously in pregnant women and elderly patients [Grade 2A].
- In a patient with pelvic binder whenever it’s possible, an early transfer from the spine board reduces significantly the skin pressure lesions [Grade 1A].

### Pelvic trauma: WSES classification and guidelines [^50c77538]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Complex pelvic injuries are among the most dangerous and deadly trauma related lesions. Different classification systems exist, some are based on the mechanism of injury, some on anatomic patterns and some are focusing on the resulting instability requiring operative fixation. The optimal treatment strategy, however, should keep into consideration the hemodynamic status, the anatomic impairment of pelvic ring function and the associated injuries. The management of pelvic trauma patients aims definitively to restore the homeostasis and the normal physiopathology associated to the mechanical stability of the pelvic ring. Thus the management of pelvic trauma must be multidisciplinary and should be ultimately based on the physiology of the patient and the anatomy of the injury. This paper presents the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) classification of pelvic trauma and the management Guidelines.

Diagnostic workup strategies in the emergency room must be standardized and streamlined in order to avoid an unnecessary delay to definitive bleeding control, the time between trauma and operating room has been shown to inversely correlate with survival in patients with traumatic pelvic hemorrhage.

Sensitive laboratory markers of acute traumatic hemorrhage include serum lactate and base deficit by arterial blood gas analysis. In contrast, hemoglobin level and hematocrit do not represent sensitive early markers of the extent of traumatic hemorrhagic shock. As coagulopathic patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock form unstable pelvic ring injuries have a significantly increased post-injury mortality, the presence of coagulopathy should be determined early by “point-of-care“ bedside testing using Thromboelastography (TEG) or Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM), which allow targeted resuscitation with blood products and improved post-injury survival rates [,–]. At first, the evaluation of a PT should be based on the mechanism of injury (particularly in case of high-energy impact, more frequent in blunt trauma) and physical examination to search a pelvic ring deformity or instability, a pelvic or perineal hematoma, or a rectal/urethral bleeding. Lelly maneuver can be useful in evaluating the pelvic ring stability but it should be done cautiously because it can sometime increase the bleeding by dislocating bones margin. In case of hemodynamic instability, particularly in blunt trauma, chest and pelvic x-rays and extended focused assessment for sonographic evaluation of trauma patients (E-FAST) are performed according to ATLS protocols. Chest X-rays and E-FAST are performed to exclude others sours of hemorrhage in the thorax and in the abdomen. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma guidelines reported that E-FAST is not enough sensitive to exclude a pelvic bleeding, however it could be considered adequate to exclude the need for a laparotomy in unstable patients.

### Pelvic trauma: WSES classification and guidelines [^6658c455]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

CT with 3-Dimensional bone reconstruction is helpful reducing tissue damage during invasive procedure, reducing the subjective expertise required from clinical staff and improving patient recovery times. Chen and coll. reported successful rates of screw positioning in 93.8% of cases after 3D CT reconstruction, particularly in patients with sacral fractures and ilio-sacral joint dislocations. This approach permits to also reduce the neurological disorders after surgical fixation, operative times, and irradiation.

In 7-25% of pelvic ring fractures lower urinary tract and urethra are damaged. However the diagnosis of urethral injuries remains difficult at the initial evaluation and about 23% of them are missed. Clinical signs suggesting a urethral injury are perineal/scrotal hematoma, blood from the urethral meatus, the presence of a high-riding or non-palpable prostate at rectal exploration, the presence of an unstable pelvic fracture. The insertion of a transurethral catheter without other previous investigations in patients with a pelvic injury could be associated with severe complications: either acute like complete transection of the urethra, or chronic like stricture formation, impotence and urinary incontinence. For this reason ATLS guidelines, the World Health Organization and some authors suggested a retrograde urethrogram (RUG) prior the urethral catheterization. RUGs is recommended when local clinical signs or a disruption in the PXR are found, particularly in the presence of higher degree of soft tissue disruption, bone displacement, or multiple fractures. In case a positive of RUG or when high suspicion of urethral injury are present, a suprapubic catheter with delayed cystogram is recommended. Magnetic resonance images seem promising to detect type of injuries and could be a useful tool in combination with RUGs or in alternative but only in stable patients. However the sequence between RUG and urethrocystogram with contrast CT is controversial. Performing a RUG before CT could increase the rate of indeterminate and false-negative CT-scans. For this reason when hemodynamic status permits in case of suspected urethral injuries the late contrast CT-scan with a urologic study is recommended.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^c82b9e24]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Anorectal emergencies comprise a wide variety of diseases that share common symptoms, i.e., anorectal pain or bleeding and might require immediate management. While most of the underlying conditions do not need inpatient management, some of them could be life-threatening and need prompt recognition and treatment. It is well known that an incorrect diagnosis is frequent for anorectal diseases and that a delayed diagnosis is related to an impaired outcome. This paper aims to improve the knowledge and the awareness on this specific topic and to provide a useful tool for every physician dealing with anorectal emergencies.The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the boards of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) to perform a systematic review of the available literature and to provide evidence-based statements with immediate practical application. All the statements were presented and discussed during the WSES-AAST-WJES Consensus Conference on Anorectal Emergencies, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES-AAST panel of experts was reached. We structured our work into seven main topics to cover the entire management of patients with anorectal emergencies and to provide an up-to-date, easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.

Methods

To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the boards of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), to develop questions on seven main topics that thoroughly cover the field of this pathology (retained anorectal bodies, perineal necrotizing fasciitis, complicated hemorrhoids, acute anal fissure, anorectal abscess, bleeding anorectal varices, complicated anorectal prolapse). Leading specialists in the field then were asked to perform a thorough search on each of these topics in different databanks (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE) for relevant papers between 1985 and November 2019 and a systematic review of the available literature. They were asked to focus their search to provide evidence-based answers to every question with immediate practical application and to summarize them in statements. Furthermore, the references were kept up to date and the last literature search was performed in January 2021. All the statements were presented and discussed during the WSES - AAST - WJES Consensus Conference on Anorectal Emergencies held in Parma, Italy, on December 12, 2019, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES - AAST panelists was reached. An international expert panel discussed the different issues in subsequent rounds. At each round, the manuscript was revised and improved. The final version about which agreement was reached resulted in the present manuscript. All the members contributed to the development of the manuscript.

The questions were created according to the PICO criteria, and the following guidelines adopt the GRADE methodology.

Topics and questions

For clarity, we report the seven topics together with the relative questions. The statements are summarized in Table 1.

GRADE system to evaluate the level of evidence and recommendation

The discussion of the present guidelines has been realized through the Delphi process. A group of experts in the field coordinated by a central coordinator was contacted separately to express their evidence-based opinion on the different questions about the hemodynamically and mechanically unstable pelvic trauma management. Pelvic trauma patterns were differentiated into hemodynamically and mechanically stable and unstable ones. Conservative and operative management for all combinations of these conditions were evaluated. The central coordinator assembled the different answers derived from the first round and drafted the first version that was subsequently revised by each member of an enlarged expert group separately. The central coordinator addressed the definitive amendments, corrections and concerns. The definitive version about which the agreement was reached consisted in the published guidelines.

Mechanisms of injuries

Principal mechanisms of injuries that cause a pelvic ring fracture are due to a high energy impact as fall from height, sports, road traffic collision (pedestrian, motorcyclist, motor vehicle, cyclist), person stuck by vehicles. Ten to fifteen percent of patients with pelvic fractures arrive to the ED in shock and one third of them will die reaching a mortality rate in the more recent reports of 32%. The causes of dying are represented in the major part by uncontrolled bleeding and by patient’s physiologic exhaustion.

### Hemorrhage control interventions and mortality in trauma patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures (...) [^d2ea7711]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective To characterize clinical outcomes and study the patterns of hemorrhage control interventions in hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures. Design, Setting, and Participants. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were rates of 24-hour, emergency department, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were major in-hospital complications. Results. A total of 1396 patients were identified. Mean age was 47 years, 975 were male, and the mean lowest systolic blood pressure was 71 mm Hg. The median Injury Severity Score was 24, with a 24-hour mortality of 217 patients, ED mortality of 10 patients, in-hospital mortality of 501 patients, and complication rate of 574 patients. On regression analyses, only pelvic AE was associated with a mortality reduction. Preperitoneal PP was associated with increased odds of complications. Trauma remains the leading cause of death among individuals aged 1 to 46 years, 1 and the most common cause of early death is uncontrolled hemorrhage. 2-4 Nearly 9% of all trauma patients present with severe pelvic fractures associated with mortality rates as high as 32%. 5 Approximately 13% of patients with pelvic fracture present with hemodynamic instability from major hemorrhage, which can arise from arterial, venous, and bony sources. 6 Pelvic fractures represent a challenging injury pattern, often necessitating major hemorrhage control interventions.
7. Pelvic angioembolization is performed to occlude actively bleeding vessels, specifically arterial bleeding, while external fixation is used to reduce the fractured pelvis and associated hemorrhage. These multidisciplinary interventions may be applied alone or in combination. No standardization of order of applicability has been studied.

Indeed, a large multicenter study recently showed that a significant variation existed for the use of hemorrhage control interventions in severely injured patients with pelvic fracture.
6. We included all adult patients who presented with pelvic fractures, received 4 or more units of packed red blood cells within 4 hours of presentation, and underwent at least 1 pelvic fracture hemorrhage control intervention. Interventions were pelvic AE, preperitoneal PP, and REBOA zone 3. We excluded patients who were transferred from other institutions or dead on arrival.

Hospital-related data included ACS trauma center verification level, type and timing of intervention for pelvic fracture hemorrhage control, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, days spent on a ventilator, transfusion parameters, in-hospital complications, and mortality. Primary outcomes included rates of 24-hour, ED, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were major in-hospital complications, including cardiac, infectious, respiratory, and venous thromboembolic complications.

Urethra

Patients with post-traumatic urethral hemorrhage should be investigated for urethral injuries. (GoR 1C)
During emergency laparotomy, if an urethral injury is suspected, it should be investigated directly whenever feasible. (GoR 2A)
Retrograde urethrography and selective urethroscopy represent the modalities of choice to investigate traumatic urethral injuries. (GoR 1B)
In the event of penile lesions, urethroscopy should be preferred to retrograde urethrography (GoR 2A)

Patients with urethral trauma may present with blood at the external urethral meatus, suprapubic fullness, perineal laceration, scrotal hematoma, urinary retention, difficulty or inability to insert a urinary catheter, and superiorly displaced prostate on rectal examination.

If urethral injury is present or suspected, rectal and vaginal examination should be performed. Associated rectal injuries are present in up to 5% of cases.

There are two diagnostic modalities: retrograde urethrography and flexible urethroscopy.

If urethral injury is suspected, retrograde urethrography is the procedure of choice and should be performed before attempting any other maneuvers on the genito-urinary system.

In case of hemodynamic instability, all the investigations on the urethra should be postponed and a urinary drainage, (i.e. suprapubic catheter) should be inserted. The placement of a urethral catheter should be postponed until urethrography is obtained.

Extravasation of contrast on retrograde urography indicates an urethral injury. Pelvic MRI, although not indicated in the acute setting, represents a valuable tool for anatomic definition of the injury during the post-traumatic period.

A distinction between incomplete and complete urethral lesions is difficult; in general, incomplete lesions identified on retrograde urography are often characterized by extravasation of contrast which also fills the bladder, whereas extravasation of contrast is not accompanied by bladder filling in complete lesions.

In case of associated penile injuries and in women due to short urethra, urethroscopy is recommended over retrograde urethrography [,–].

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^df642e13]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In hemodynamically stable patients with suspected retained anorectal foreign body and a suspected perforation, we recommend a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 1B).

In patients with retained anorectal foreign body and hemodynamic instability, we suggest against delaying surgical treatment to perform imaging investigations (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Radiography is the major modality used in initial and follow-up imaging of foreign bodies. When foreign bodies are evaluated on radiographs, it is important to remember that they have different radiopacity and radiographic visibility, related to the X-ray attenuation characteristics of the object, its surrounding structures, and the overlying and underlying structures. A biplanar plain X-ray of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis can detect the majority of retained AFB and gives useful information regarding the number, size, shape, location, and orientation of the foreign bodies and possible presence of pneumoperitoneum. The plain X-ray could help predict the cases in whom transanal extraction is likely to be unsuccessful: in fact, the distinction between high- or low-lying retained objects, the latter being usually amenable of manual extraction in the ED, can be usually achieved with abdominal X-rays. However, non-visualization of any object on X-rays does not rule out the presence of retained AFB, because some foreign bodies have very low radiopacity and radiographic visibility. A contrast-enhanced CT scan is usually the next step and is helpful in locating non-radiopaque objects, in case of suspected bowel-free perforation or abscess or in the diagnosis of bowel obstruction; in fact, CT scan allows to evaluate not only the foreign body but also its related complications. In case a CT scan is not available, erect or lateral decubitus chest radiographs can be performed to evaluate the presence of pneumoperitoneum. Erect and left lateral decubitus X-rays have similar diagnostic accuracy, the latter being better tolerated by patients presenting with peritonitis. Water-soluble contrast enema is another valuable option in case of unavailability of CT scan and can be used to evaluate complications such as rectal perforation or fistula. “Point-of-care” ultrasound could also detect free intra-peritoneal, when performed by a trained operator, but it is highly operator dependent and some ultrasound machines have low-quality images; furthermore, sonography has low reliability in obese patients and in case of subcutaneous emphysema. For these reasons, its role in the diagnostic workup of AFB still needs to be defined. Some authors also advocate the execution of a repeated plain film of the abdomen after the extraction process, to ensure that no perforation took place. Given the low sensitivity of the plain X-ray for the detection of pneumoperitoneum, this routine use of repeated radiograph can even be deleterious in case of false negative findings.

Blunt abdominal trauma: observation and nonoperative management

The clinical assessment for a patient with suspected intestinal injury begins with the primary survey to assess life-threatening injuries. Patients who are haemodynamically decompensated with a positive Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) should proceed directly to a trauma laparotomy to stop major abdominal bleeding and, if applicable, other sources of bleeding (e.g. pelvic, or long bone fractures), as well as control spillage of intestinal contents. In circumstances where the degree of haemodynamic decompensation is minor, diagnostic, and therapeutic laparoscopy can be considered. It is important to emphasise that these considerations are time crucial, with every 3 min spent in the emergency department equating to a 1% increased death probability and as a result of such, trauma laparotomies tend to be favoured.

Morbidity, mortality and outcomes

Complications with important functional limitations are present especially in patients with open PT who may have chronic sequelae as fecal and urinary incontinence, impotence, dyspareunia, residual disability in physical functions, perineal and pelvic abscess, chronic pain and vascular complications as embolism or thrombosis.

The majority of deaths (44.7%) occurred on the day of trauma and the main factors that correlate with mortality are increasing age, ISS, pelvic ring instability, size and contamination of the open wound, rectal injury, fecal diversion, numbers of blood units transfused, head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), admission base deficit.

Lastly, a recent study reported the impact given by the multidisciplinary approach resulting in an improvement in performance and in patient outcomes. At first a defined decision making algorithm reduce significantly (p = 0.005) the time from hospital arrival and bleeding control in the theatre with PPP. Furthermore the definition of a massive hemorrhage protocol reduced significantly the use of liquids administered prior blood transfusions and rationalized the use of packed red cells and fresh frozen plasma (ratio 2:1) starting within the first hours following injury. Moreover a dedicated pelvic orthopedic surgeons can improve (p = 0.004) the number of patients that undergoing definitive unstable pelvic fractures repair with a consequently improvement in outcome. Similar data about the importance of the adherence to defined guidelines have been reported by Balogh et al. and recently confirmed by the multi-institutional trial by Costantini et al.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^5d073104]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The definition of anorectal emergencies comprises a wide variety of diseases that share presenting symptoms, i.e. anorectal pain or bleeding, which may require immediate management. While most of the underlying conditions do not need inpatient management, some can be life-threatening, requiring prompt recognition and treatment. Making the correct initial diagnosis is probably the main issue in these cases, because the acute pain could preclude a complete and accurate clinical examination and the embarrassment related to the affected anatomical region delays the presentation of the patient in many cases. It is demonstrated that an incorrect recognition is frequent for anorectal diseases and that a delayed diagnosis is related to an adverse outcome. Furthermore, anorectal disease remains a relevant healthcare problem that can consume a considerable amount of financial resource, both as direct costs related to medical treatments and as indirect expenses, such as loss of work days and impaired quality of life. In the light of the above, it becomes clear how important it is to spread knowledge in this field, improving diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of such a common condition. Every physician working in an acute care setting will face this set of pathologies. This paper aims to improve the knowledge and the awareness on this specific topic and to provide a useful tool for every physician dealing with anorectal emergencies.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^2a79fcc0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In stable patients with suspected Fournier’s gangrene, we suggest to consider performing a CT scan (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with Fournier’s gangrene, we recommend that imaging should not delay surgical intervention (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 1B).

In patients with Fournier’s gangrene and hemodynamic instability persisting after proper resuscitation, we suggest against CT imaging (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Diagnosis of Fournier’s gangrene is mainly clinical. Plain radiographs, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may demonstrate gas in the soft tissue planes as well as help determine the extent of the disease. Evidence of gas formation is present in nearly half of all patients with FG and is highly specific (94%). Ultrasonographic findings typically include marked thickening of the scrotal skin, soft tissue inflammation, collections/abscesses, and subcutaneous gas. In addition, US can demonstrate paratesticular fluid, which is seen prior to clinical crepitus, and scrotal contents along with Doppler blood flow can be examined. As imaging evaluation in patients with FG may be limited by several factors, including the presence of concurrent acute renal failure or patient hemodynamic instability, making transport to the imaging department unsafe, bedside and point-of-care ultrasound have emerged as useful tools for FG diagnosis. US has multiple advantages: it can be promptly performed at the patient’s bedside, can evaluate the scrotal contents, and does not require radiation or intravenous contrast. For these reasons, US can be suggested in cases where a CT scan is not available or not feasible. Otherwise, a contrast-enhanced CT-scan plays an important role in diagnosing and planning the treatment of Fournier’s gangrene, because it has greater specificity for evaluating disease extent than plain radiography, US, or physical examination alone and may also identify a potential underlying cause. CT has a sensitivity approaching 90% for the diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections, in addition to high specificity (93.3%). MRI with gadolinium contrast is an excellent soft tissue imaging modality, but is of limited value in an emergency setting due to its extended time of examination and limited access to emergency MRI scanning in many centers. Furthermore, given the utmost importance of a timely surgical treatment, imaging is not mandatory in treating emergent cases of Fournier’s gangrene with clinical or hemodynamical impairment and we suggest not delaying surgical treatment in these patients to obtain any form of imaging.
2.C - in patients with Fournier’s gangrene, what are the indications for surgical treatment and what is the appropriate timing for surgery?

WSES grade II includes APC II – III and LC II - III hemodynamically stable pelvic ring injuries.
WSES grade III includes VS and CM hemodynamically stable pelvic ring injuries.

Severe pelvic injuries: 
WSES grade IV includes any hemodynamically unstable pelvic ring injuries.

Basing on the present classification WSES indicates a management algorithm explained in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3 
Pelvic Trauma management algorithm (*: patients hemodynamically stable and mechanically unstable with no other lesions requiring treatment and with a negative CT-scan, can proceed directly to definitive mechanical stabilization. MTP: Massive Transfusion Protocol, FAST-E: Eco-FAST Extended, ED: Emergency Department, CT: Computed Tomography, NOM: Non Operative Management, HEMODYNAMIC STABILITY is the condition in which the patient achieve a constant or an amelioration of blood pressure after fluids with a blood pressure >90 mmHg and heart rate <100 bpm; HEMODYNAMIC INSTABILITY is the condition in which the patient has an admission systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, or > 90 mmHg but requiring bolus infusions/transfusions and/or vasopressor drugs, or admission base deficit (BD) >6 mmol/l, or shock index > 1, or transfusion requirement of at least 4–6 Units of packed red blood cells within the first 24 h)

Principles and cornerstones of the management

The management of pelvic trauma as for all the other politraumatized patients needs to pose in definitive the attention in treating also the physiology; decisions can be more effective when combining evaluation of anatomy, mechanical consequences of injury and their physiological effects. During daily clinical practice the first decisions are based mainly on the clinical conditions and the associated injuries, and less on the pelvic ring lesions. The management of trauma in fact aims firstly to restore the altered physiology. The main aims of proper PT management are bleeding control and stabilization of the hemodynamic status, restoring of the eventual coagulation disorders and the mechanical integrity and stability of the pelvic ring, and preventing complications (septic, urogenital, intestinal, vascular, sexual functions, walking) (×9); then to definitively stabilize the pelvis.

### Pelvic trauma: WSES classification and guidelines [^2f45b218]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for traumatic hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to patients with pelvic trauma, pelvic ring stabilization, WSES 2017 guidelines recommend to place anterior resuscitation frames through iliac crest or supra-acetabular route to provide adequate temporary pelvic stability in APC-II/-III and LC-II/-III injury patterns. Consider placing a posterior pelvic C-clamp for bleeding control in vertical shear injuries with sacroiliac joint disruptions.

### Managing severe (and open) pelvic disruption [^1f6c4751]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

A retrograde urethrogram should be performed prior to attempting foley catheter placement in the ED or OR if there is concern for urethral injury as evidenced by blood at the urinary meatus. If complete urethral disruption has occurred, suprapubic catheter insertion should be undertaken to allow for urinary drainage. Incomplete injury may be managed by Foley insertion.

Blood found during a digital rectal examination may indicate rectal injury. A higher incidence of rectal injury has also been associated with widened pubic symphysis and anteroposterior pelvic fractures.Intraperitoneal colorectal injuries should be managed as colon injuries with either primary repair or resection based on extent of defect. If suspected based on examination, injury pattern, or CT with rectal contrast, investigation of rectal injury should include direct visualization of the rectum via proctoscopy.Current recommendations for the the management of extraperitoneal rectal injuries advise against presacral drainage and distal rectal washout, which existed in prior dogma. Proximal diversion, however, continues to be recommended in cases of rectal injury.

Neurological injuries, such as traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury, are similarly associated with poor outcomes, as they complicate resuscitation and limit the patient’s ability to recover from additional injuries. Intra-abdominal trauma, such as bowel or liver injuries, adds another layer of complexity, increasing the likelihood of hemorrhagic shock and overwhelming the capacity for surgical management.

Scant literature exists regarding the management of vaginal injuries associated with pelvic trauma. Although well-vascularized, vaginal bleeding is usually limited by smooth muscle contracture in response to trauma. Mucosal injuries may be managed with gauze packing alone, while deeper injuries should be repaired, when feasible, by an obstetrician/gynecologist.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^2bfca6de]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Male and female urethral trauma—diagnosis of urethral injury is made by physical examination or imaging after pelvic or genital trauma; in male patients a RUG is the preferred imaging for diagnosis and it will guide initial management; because a high-riding prostate has low sensitivity and specificity, a rectal examination is not recommended for urethral injury diagnosis; female urethral injuries are rare and occur in conjunction with pelvic fracture, and a speculum exam should be performed to evaluate for associated injuries; cystoscopy is recommended for evaluation of suspected female urethral injury.

### Current recommendations for imaging in the management of urologic traumas [^4194b209]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Three percent to 10% of trauma patients have genitourinary tract injuries. Radiologic imaging is essential for making the correct diagnosis and managing it appropriately. Which modality is appropriate is based on the mechanism of injury and patient presentation. Patients with pelvic injuries and gross hematuria should undergo either CT cystography or conventional cystography. Ultrasound is warranted in patients with scrotal trauma when physical exam is inconclusive. Patients with penetrating trauma to the external genitalia, who suffer blunt trauma to the penis, or who present with gross hematuria, blood at the meatus, inability to void, perineal/scrotal ecchymosis, or abnormal digital rectal exam should undergo retrograde urethrography. Using these criteria for imaging should lead to the proper diagnosis and minimize patient morbidity.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1a57b1b8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, based on the paucity of available studies and on the small numbers of patients included, we believe that hemorrhoidectomy can be beneficial in selected patients and the decision between NOM and early surgical excision should be based on physician’s expertise and patient’s preference; furthermore, we suggest against the use of incision and drainage of the thrombus, given the higher incidence of bleeding and relapse of symptoms. The evidence about stapled hemorrhoidectomy is scarce and, also given the potential for life-threatening complications of this procedure in the elective setting, we do not make any recommendation for its application in an acute care - emergency setting.

This literature review could not identify any data regarding the role of surgery for bleeding hemorrhoids, so we cannot make any recommendations in this setting.
3.G - in patients with complicated hemorrhoids, what is the role of angiography?

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of angiography in complicated hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

There is growing evidence that angiography and angioembolization could have a role for the treatment of hemorrhoids in an elective setting. The reported results are encouraging, but there are not enough data to make any recommendation regarding its application to an acute care - emergency setting.
4) Bleeding anorectal varices 4.A - in patients with suspected bleeding anorectal varices, what is the role of clinical examination and biochemical investigations?

In patients with suspected bleeding anorectal varices, we suggest to collect a focused medical history and to perform a complete physical examination, including a digital rectal examination, to rule out other causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^46349a52]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

AF can be divided, temporally and morphologically, into acute and chronic: acute fissures are superficial, with well-demarcated edges and last less than 6 weeks; chronic fissures are characterized by a distal sentinel tag and a proximal hypertrophied anal papilla with the exposure of the IAS fibers at the base of the AF and symptoms for over 6 weeks.

The diagnosis of AF is mainly clinical and is based on recent and past medical history, including family history and complete physical examination. Patients with AF often complain of severe and prolonged anal pain, referred as passing a “broken glass”, during and after defecation. Other associated symptoms include spasm and/or intermittent bleeding with defecation. When the tone of the IAS is too high, digital rectal examination can be painful and an examination under anesthesia is indispensable to rule out other concomitant diseases such as anal abscess or fistula. No recommendation can be made regarding the role of biochemical investigations among patients presenting typical acute anal fissure or referring similar symptomatology, based on the available literature. In case of a suspicion but non-conclusive physical examination, when concomitant diseases are suspected, laboratory tests should be based on the supposed associated diseases to rule out other causes.

7.B - in patients with suspected acute anal fissure, which are the appropriate imaging investigations?

No recommendation can be made regarding the use of imaging investigations in patients with typical acute anal fissure, based on the available literature.

In patients with atypical acute anal fissure, we suggest to perform investigations (endoscopy, CT scan, MRI, or endoanal ultrasound) only in case of suspected concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, anal or colorectal cancer or occult perianal sepsis (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Usually, no imaging investigations are necessary at initial presentation of acute AF. In case of a suspicion but non-conclusive physical examination, if the fissure cannot be seen, the diagnosis is unclear,  or if there is significant bright red bleeding in a patient with an increased risk for colorectal cancer or in patients above 50 years of age or if there are features suggesting a secondary anal fissure, imaging such as endo-anal ultrasound, endoscopy, CT scan, or MRI, may be required. The choice of the appropriate imaging technique should be driven by the suspected underling disease. Anorectal manometry could be indicated in patients who have undergone previous surgery, but it is frequently too painful to be performed with in the emergency setting.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^ea09bd2e]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Secondary survey indicators for genitourinary (GU) injury in blunt trauma—GU injuries are most commonly evaluated during the secondary survey based on mechanism of injury, physical findings, and the presence of associated injuries, and diagnostic workup during this phase requires additional imaging studies and/or endoscopic procedures. Findings that may indicate GU injury include unilateral or bilateral flank pain, contusions, abrasions, ecchymosis, or lacerations that may be associated with renal trauma; a mechanically unstable pelvis that raises the index of suspicion for a bladder or urethral injury; lower abdominal contusions from a seatbelt (“seatbelt sign”) that may be associated with a bladder injury; peritoneal signs, gross hematuria, and inability to void that may indicate a bladder injury; and blood at the urethral meatus, perineal and/or penile hematoma or ecchymosis, a palpable full bladder, and inability to void that suggest a urethral injury, with a digital rectal exam no longer recommended to evaluate for a “high-riding prostate” to rule out posterior urethral disruption.

Background

Pelvic trauma (PT) is one of the most complex management in trauma care and occurs in 3% of skeletal injuries. Patients with pelvic fractures are usually young and they have a high overall injury severity score (ISS) (25 to 48 ISS). Mortality rates remain high, particularly in patients with hemodynamic instability, due to the rapid exsanguination, the difficulty to achieve hemostasis and the associated injuries. For these reasons, a multidisciplinary approach is crucial to manage the resuscitation, to control the bleeding and to manage bones injuries particularly in the first hours from trauma. PT patients should have an integrated management between trauma surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, interventional radiologists, anesthesiologists, ICU doctors and urologists 24/7.

At present no comprehensive guidelines have been published about these issues. No correlation has been demonstrated to exist between type of pelvic ring anatomical lesions and patient physiologic status. Moreover the management of pelvic trauma has markedly changed throughout the last decades with a significant improvement in outcomes, due to improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic tools. In determining the optimal treatment strategy, the anatomical lesions classification should be supplemented by hemodynamic status and associated injuries. The anatomical description of pelvic ring lesions is fundamental in the management algorithm but not definitive. In fact, in clinical practice the first decisions are based mainly on the clinical conditions and the associated injuries, and less on the pelvic ring lesions. Ultimately, the management of trauma requires an assessment of the anatomical injury and its physiologic effects.

This paper aims to present the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) classification of pelvic trauma and the treatment Guidelines.

WSES includes surgeons from whole world. This Classification and Guidelines statements aim to direct the management of pelvic trauma, acknowledging that there are acceptable alternative management options. In reality, as already considered for other position papers and guidelines, not all trauma surgeons work in the same conditions and have the same facilities and technologies available.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^7a8fe52c]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Urethral injury—initial evaluation and imaging guidance states that when a urethral injury is suspected, perform a rectal exam (and vaginal exam, for female anatomy) because 5% of urethral injuries are concomitant with a rectal or vaginal injury, but a high-riding prostate has both low sensitivity and low specificity and a rectal examination for its presence or absence is not recommended for urethral injury diagnosis. A RUG is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis of a male urethral injury, whereas if a patient with female anatomy is suspected to have urethral injury, a RUG is not recommended due to poor feasibility and cystourethroscopy and vaginoscopy are warranted. In addition, a complete speculum examination is essential in patients with a vagina and suspected PFUI to identify associated vaginal or rectal injury. Be suspicious for urethral injury when blood is found at the urethral meatus or in the introitus/vaginal canal. Promptly seek urologic consultation or transfer the patient to a center with appropriate expertise.

3 Patient Evaluation

Initial assessment and resuscitation :
Primary survey excluding exsanguinating bleeding with active control of bleeding,
Management of airway, spinal motion restriction,
Breathing and ventilation assessment,
Circulation and other bleeding control,
Disability assessment and exposure.
Basic imaging and bloods, which may include ultrasound and plain film Xs‐rays, with the ideal ultimate imaging in blast trauma being a CT‐based trauma “pan‐scan” if this modality is available.
Secondary survey where the urological and genital tract should be fully evaluated.

More specifically, when the assessment of the urogenital tract is considered, it is important to assess this in the overall clinical picture of the patient. This is paramount to prevent mortality, as genitourinary injury is seldom immediately fatal, with other injuries likely to kill the patient more quickly.

The most common symptoms and signs of injury to the genitourinary system are as follows:
Identify wounds to the external genitalia and perineum and examine and look for flank wounds or bruising,
Flank pain, anterior lower abdominal pain, fractured lower ribs,
Macroscopic hematuria, or frank blood at the meatus.
Microscopic hematuria is important in penetrating trauma, less so with blunt trauma unless hemodynamically abnormal, but may warrant investigation: A positive dipstix should be followed by bedside microscopy to include/exclude cells (hematuria) or not (myoglobinuria).
Pelvic fracture should prompt investigation due to the high risk for bladder or urethral injury. A cautious attempt at urethral catheterization may be attempted if there is meatal blood, and if failed, imaging is needed to exclude pathology and a suprapubic may be placed under ultrasound guidance considering the possibility of an intraperitoneal rupture in a polytrauma scenario.
Ureteral injuries may be clinically occult, must be excluded in penetrating trauma, while these are highly uncommon in blunt trauma, but more so with secondary and tertiary blast trauma.

Physiopathology of the injuries

The lesions at the level of the pelvic ring can create instability of the ring itself and a consequent increase in the internal volume. This increase in volume, particular in open book lesions, associated to the soft tissue and vascular disruption, facilitate the increasing hemorrhage in the retroperitoneal space by reducing the tamponing effect (pelvic ring can contain up to a few liters of blood) and can cause an alteration in hemodynamic status. In the management of severely injured and bleeding patients a cornerstone is represented by the early evaluation and correction of the trauma induced coagulopathy. Resuscitation associated to physiologic impairment and to suddenly activation and deactivation of several procoagulant and anticoagulant factors contributes to the insurgence of this frequently deadly condition. The massive transfusion protocol application is fundamental in managing bleeding patients. As clearly demonstrated by the literature blood products, coagulation factors and drugs administration has to be guided by a tailored approach through advanced evaluation of the patient’s coaugulative asset. Some authors consider a normal hemodynamic status when the patient does not require fluids or blood to maintain blood pressure, without signs of hypoperfusion; hemodynamic stability as a counterpart is the condition in which the patient achieve a constant or an amelioration of blood pressure after fluids with a blood pressure >90 mmHg and heart rate <100 bpm ; hemodynamic instability is the condition in which the patient has an admission systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, or > 90 mmHg but requiring bolus infusions/transfusions and/or vasopressor drugs and/or admission base deficit (BD) >6 mmol/l and/or shock index > 1 and/or transfusion requirement of at least 4–6 Units of packed red blood cells within the first 24 hours. The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) definition considers as “unstable” the patient with: blood pressure < 90 mmHg and heart rate > 120 bpm, with evidence of skin vasoconstriction (cool, clammy, decreased capillary refill), altered level of consciousness and/or shortness of breath. The present classification and guideline utilize the ATLS definition. Some authors suggested that the sacroiliac joint disruption, female gender, duration of hypotension, an hematocrit of 30% or less, pulse rate of 130 or greater, displaced obturator ring fracture, a pubic symphysis diastasis can be considered good predictors of major pelvic bleeding. However unfortunately the extent of bleeding is not always related with the type of lesions and there is a poor correlation between the grade of the radiological lesions and the need for emergent hemostasis.

American Urological Association—urethral trauma evaluation and management—clinicians should perform retrograde urethrography in patients with blood at the urethral meatus after pelvic trauma (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Clinicians should establish prompt urinary drainage in patients with pelvic fracture associated urethral injury (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C), and clinicians should perform percutaneous or open suprapubic tube placement as preferred initial management for most pelvic fracture urethral injury (PFUI) cases (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Surgeons may place suprapubic tubes (SPTs) in patients undergoing open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for pelvic fracture (Expert Opinion). Clinicians may perform primary realignment (PR) in hemodynamically stable patients with pelvic fracture associated urethral injury (Option; Evidence Strength: Grade C), and clinicians should not perform prolonged attempts at endoscopic realignment in patients with pelvic fracture associated urethral injury (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should monitor patients for complications (e.g., stricture formation, erectile dysfunction, incontinence) for at least one year following urethral injury (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Surgeons should perform prompt surgical repair in patients with uncomplicated penetrating trauma of the anterior urethra (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should establish prompt urinary drainage in patients with straddle injury to the anterior urethra (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C).

### Pelvic injury prognosis is more closely related to vascular injury severity than anatomical fracture complexity: the WSES classification for pelvic trauma makes sense [^c9d820a4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2017, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) published its guidelines for the classification and management of pelvic trauma. The WSES guidelines emphasize that the optimal treatment strategy should be determined by the hemodynamic status and associated injuries in addition to anatomical lesions. The first decisions are based mainly on the hemodynamic conditions rather than on the pelvic ring lesions. According to the WSES classification, minor pelvic injuries are defined as those with mechanically stable (LC type I, APC type I) and hemodynamically stable lesions, while moderate injuries comprise those with mechanically unstable fracture (LC type II–III, APC type II–III, VS, and combined type fractures) but hemodynamically stable lesions. In addition, severe pelvic injuries are defined as hemodynamically unstable lesions independent of mechanical status. While the main differences between minor and moderate injuries are the complexity of the fracture patterns, any fractures that are associated with unstable hemodynamics are categorized as severe injuries. Our results showed that patient outcomes were similar between the WSES mild and moderate types of pelvic injuries; however, patients with severe pelvic injuries had significantly worse outcomes than those with the other two types of injuries. Therefore, hemodynamic instability appears to be a more relevant factor than the complexity of the fracture pattern for patient outcome. These results suggest that the WSES classification, which takes both the fracture pattern and hemodynamic status into consideration, might be clinically more useful than the classic YB classification system.

### The benefits and clinical application of the digital rectal exam in trauma populations: towards enhancing patient safety and quality outcomes [^47bcc00b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Current literature contains an extensive number of analyses on the diagnostic value and utilization of the direct rectal exam in trauma patients. Presently, ATLS recommends the application of the digital rectal exam in trauma patients following a primary assessment of traumatic injuries. We aim to assess the validity and diagnostic value of the digital rectal exam in trauma populations.

Methods

PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, ProQuest, and CINAHL databases were searched for studies from the date of database conception to August 6th, 2022. Studies that assessed the validity of the digital rectal exam performed in the emergency department or trauma bay, in both adult and pediatric trauma patients were included. Study outcomes and measurements of validity were summarized and compared.

Results

A total of 9 studies met inclusion criteria for both adult and pediatric trauma populations. The sensitivity of the digital rectal exam in detecting both spinal cord and urethral injuries in adult trauma populations ranged from 0 to 50%, while the sensitivity in detecting gastrointestinal injuries ranged from 0% to 51%. When compared to other clinical indicators, the digital rectal exam was consistently worse at detecting injuries. Within the pediatric trauma populations, the digital rectal exam resulted in high false negative rates ranging from 66% to 100%, failing to detect all urethral and gastrointestinal injuries and pelvic fractures.

Conclusion

The use of digital rectal exams in trauma patients illustrates limited to no validity and reliability in assessing pertinent injuries and does not influence the management of injuries. Trauma societies should consider creating guidelines and algorithms to clarify the use of digital rectal exams in specific situations and injury types.

### Pelvic radiography in ATLS algorithms: a diminishing role? [^e4f2dc8c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

A retrospective chart analysis of all multiple injured (ISS ≥ 16) patients admitted to our emergency room between 01.07.2004 and 31.01.2006 was conducted. Inclusion criteria were blunt abdominal/pelvic trauma, initial hemodynamic stability, and a stable pelvis on clinical examination. Information on age, sex, mechanism and severity of trauma, initial condition of the patient and treatment during the first hour, x-ray findings (if performed), CT findings, other diagnoses, definitive treatment and outcome were collected and compared. The pelvic fractures were classified according to Tiles AO fracture classification modified by Isler and Ganz.

Our unit is a level I emergency medicine facility serving env. 1.5 million people and seeing about 30.000 trauma patients per year. All senior attending physicians are ATLS certified and the protocols are implemented. Clinical pelvic examination is always performed by a senior resident or the attending consultant emergency physician who is the trauma team leader. CT scans were performed using a high-end device yielding thin sections and coronal reconstructions. CT interpretation was done by experienced radiologists.

We defined hemodynamic stability as hemorrhagic shock not worse than Class 2, i.e. patients were normotensive, had elevated or normal pulse rate, respiratory rate <30/min, normal or decreased pulse pressure (art. pulse amplitude), and had a rapid response to the initial fluid therapy of 2 L crystalloid. The finding of clinically stable pelvis in our definition includes that the pelvis does not give way during the application of vertical, horizontal or lateral shearing forces and that such compression is not painful, that there is no perineal hematoma, no open wounds in the pelvic region and that no blood is visible exiting the urethral meatus.
