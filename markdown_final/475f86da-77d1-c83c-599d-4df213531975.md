(C) 324
(D) 432

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many four-digit numbers start with 1 and contain exactly two identical digits, and which option among the given choices matches that count. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the structure of the four-digit number and the constraint that the first digit is 1. Then, I should verify what "exactly two identical digits" means in this context and how it differs from "exactly two pairs". Next, I will enumerate the valid cases by choosing which two positions are identical and what digit they share, making sure I don't overcount or violate the "exactly two identical" rule. Finally, I will compute the total and compare it to the options to select the correct answer.

> Let me first confirm the problem setup. The number is of the form 1 _ _ _, where the first digit is fixed as 1, and among the four digits there must be exactly two that are identical, with the other two digits different from each other and from the repeated digit. Wait, let me verify the wording: "exactly two identical digits" implies a single pair and no additional duplicates, not two separate pairs and not three of a kind, which would change the counting logic.

> I will now examine the positions where the identical pair can occur. Since the first digit is 1, the pair can be in positions (2,3), (2,4), or (3,4), and it can also include the first digit, i.e., positions (1,2), (1,3), or (1,4). Hold on, I should verify that I'm not missing any case; those six position pairs cover all ways to choose two positions out of four, so I can proceed with those six cases and ensure I apply the "exactly two identical" constraint consistently.

> Case 1: the pair is in positions 2 and 3. The repeated digit can be any digit except 1, because if it were 1, then digit 1 would appear at least twice (once in position 1 and again in positions 2–3), which would violate "exactly two identical". So there are 9 choices for the repeated digit (0,2,3,… ,9). The remaining position 4 must be different from 1 and different from the repeated digit, giving 8 choices. Thus, this case contributes 9 × 8 = 72 numbers. Wait, let me double-check: yes, 9 choices for the pair, 8 for the fourth digit, and no overlap issues here.

> Case 2: the pair is in positions 2 and 4. By symmetry, this mirrors Case 1: 9 choices for the repeated digit (not 1), and 8 choices for the remaining position 3, so again 9 × 8 = 72 numbers. I should confirm that the logic is identical; it is, since the constraint is symmetric with respect to positions 2 and 4.

> Case 3: the pair is in positions 3 and 4. Same reasoning: 9 choices for the repeated digit (not 1), and 8 choices for the remaining position 2, yielding another 9 × 8 = 72 numbers. Hold on, I should verify consistency; yes, it's the same pattern.

> Case 4: the pair includes position 1 and position 2. Here the repeated digit must be 1, because position 1 is already 1. Positions 3 and 4 must be different from 1 and different from each other. So there are 9 choices for position 3 (not 1) and 8 choices for position 4 (not 1 and not equal to position 3), giving 9 × 8 = 72 numbers. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I should subtract something because the first digit is fixed, but no — fixing the first digit as 1 is already accounted for, and the pair being 1,1 is exactly what we want here, so 72 is correct.

> Case 5: the pair includes position 1 and position 3. By symmetry with Case 4, this is again 9 choices for position 2 and 8 choices for position 4, totaling 9 × 8 = 72 numbers. I should confirm that positions 2 and 4 are indeed the free variables here; yes, that's right.

> Case 6: the pair includes position 1 and position 4. Similarly, 9 choices for position 2 and 8 choices for position 3, producing 9 × 8 = 72 numbers. Let me reconsider whether any of these cases overlap or are overcounted; they are disjoint by construction because the position of the pair differs across cases.

> Adding these up, I get 6 cases × 72 = 432 total valid numbers. But wait, what if I miscounted the cases or the constraints? Let me verify the total against the options: 432 matches option D, which supports the calculation. I should also double-check that I truly respected "exactly two identical digits" in each case; yes, each scenario has exactly one pair and the other two digits are distinct and different from the pair, so there are no accidental triples or double pairs.

> Final answer: D. 432.

---

The correct answer is **432**. Here's the reasoning: the first digit is fixed as 1, so we need exactly one more digit to match 1, and the remaining two digits must be different from each other and from 1. There are 3 positions for the second 1, 9 choices for the first distinct digit (0, 2–9), and 8 choices for the second distinct digit, giving 3 × 9 × 8 = 216. Alternatively, the repeated digit is not 1, so we choose which digit repeats (9 options), place it in 3 pairs of positions, and pick the remaining digit (8 options), giving 9 × 3 × 8 = 216. Total valid numbers: 216 + 216 = **432**.

## Step-by-step solution

### Case 1: the repeated digit is 1

- **Fixed digit**: the first digit is 1.
- **Second 1**: place the second 1 in one of the remaining 3 positions (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- **Remaining digits**: choose two distinct digits from {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} (9 options) for the two remaining positions, ensuring they are different from each other and from 1.
- **Calculation**: 3 (positions) × 9 (choices for the first distinct digit) × 8 (choices for the second distinct digit) = 216.

---

### Case 2: the repeated digit is not 1

- **Repeated digit**: choose any digit from {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} (9 options) to be the repeated digit.
- **Positions**: place this digit in two of the remaining three positions (positions 2, 3, or 4). There are 3 ways to choose two positions out of three.
- **Remaining digit**: choose a digit from the remaining 8 digits (excluding 1 and the repeated digit) for the last position.
- **Calculation**: 9 (choices for the repeated digit) × 3 (ways to place it) × 8 (choices for the remaining digit) = 216.

---

### Total valid numbers

Adding both cases together gives 216 (Case 1) + 216 (Case 2) = **432**.

---

The answer is **D. 432**.

### Too many digits: the presentation of numerical data [^a41454ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Thus a decimal places rule that ignores significant digits does not work. But equally, and perhaps surprisingly, a significant digits rule that ignores decimal places does not always work either. Reporting risk ratios to three significant digits for example leads to the largest ratio below 1 being reported as 0.999 and the smallest above 1 as 1.01, with three and two decimal places, respectively. This is clearly unsatisfactory as they differ in precision by a factor of ten. In this instance a combination of significant digits and decimal places, the rule of four, works best: round the risk ratio to two significant digits if the leading non-zero digit is four or more, otherwise round to three.

The rule of four gives three decimal places for risk ratios from 0.040 to 0.399, two from 0.40 to 3.99 and one from 4.0 to 39.9. Applying it to the example of 22.68 above gives 22.7 (95% CI 7.5 to 74). Alternatively one can apply the rule with one less significant digit, giving 23 with CI 8 to 70.

Another example is the reporting of test statistics such as t or F. Specifying one decimal place would permit say t = 30.1, where 30 is clearly sufficient as it is so highly significant. Conversely specifying two significant digits would permit t = −0.13, where again the extra precision is irrelevant as it is far from significant. A suitable rule specifies up to one decimal place and up to two significant digits.

When comparing group means or percentages in tables, rounding should not blur the differences between them. This is the basis for the Hopkins two digits rule, whereby the mean has enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the SD. An analogous rule for percentages might be to use enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the range of values across groups, eg, if the range is 10% or more use whole numbers, if less than 1% use two decimal places, and otherwise one. In practice percentages are usually given along with their corresponding frequencies, so precision is less critical as the exact values can be calculated.

### Making sense of number words and Arabic digits: does order count more? [^10cd7b6e]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The ability to choose the larger between two numbers reflects a mature understanding of the magnitude associated with numerical symbols. The present study explores how the knowledge of the number sequence and memory capacity (verbal and visuospatial) relate to number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Preschool children's (N = 140, M age-in-months = 58.9, range = 41–75) knowledge of the directional property of the counting list as well as the spatial mapping of digits on the visual line were assessed. The ability to order digits on the visual line mediated the relation between memory capacity and number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Beyond cardinality, the knowledge of the (spatial) order of numbers marks the understanding of the magnitude associated with numbers.

### Number processing induces spatial performance biases [^177809db]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Response speed in parity judgments is faster with the left hand for small numbers (e.g., 1 or 2) and faster with the right hand for larger numbers (e.g., 8 or 9). This effect suggests that number processing can induce systematic spatial biases in bisection tasks.

Method

Neurologically healthy participants bisected visually presented stimuli with a pencil. Stimuli were long strings of uniform digits (experiment 1) or lines with single digit flankers (experiment 2).

Results

Bisection performance was biased to the left of center for strings made of digits 1 or 2 and to the right of center for strings made of digits 8 or 9. Line bisection was biased toward the flanker representing the larger magnitude, regardless of its position.

Conclusions

These results extend previous findings and support the notion of an automatic association of number magnitudes with spatial response codes. The effect may be useful for an assessment of semantic number processing in special populations.

### Beginnings of place value: how preschoolers write three-digit numbers [^82ad7c0f]. Child Development (2013). Low credibility.

Place value notation is essential to mathematics learning. This study examined young children's (4- to 6-year-olds, N = 172) understanding of place value prior to explicit schooling by asking them write spoken numbers (e.g., "six hundred and forty-two"). Children's attempts often consisted of "expansions" in which the proper digits were written in order but with 0s or other insertions marking place (e.g., "600402" or "610042"). This partial knowledge increased with age. Gender differences were also observed with older boys more likely than older girls to produce the conventional form (e.g., 642). Potential experiences contributing to expanded number writing and the observed gender differences are discussed.

### A new documentation system for congenital absent digits [^77df3d05]. Hand (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital absent digits continue to be described by many confusing terms and are currently classified in categories I, V, and VI of the International Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand classification and seven subclassification systems. Very few classification systems provide any logical basis for surgical reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to develop a simple alphanumerical documentation system to reproducibly describe the morphological or radiographic appearance of congenital absent digits and facilitate communication of these childrens' hand anomalies from one hand surgeon to another.

Methods

Dorsal and palmar photographs and PA radiographs of 235 hands in 204 children born with congenital absent digits over a 15-year period were analyzed to determine which digital rays were missing and their level of absence. Each hand can be described by three letters, R (radial), C (central), and U (ulnar), as well as numbers 1–5. The first letter and number designate which rays are missing and the second and third letters and numbers designate which rays remain present.

Results

There are 15 morphological phenotypes of congenital absent digits. The three most common phenotypes are U4R1 (a thumb but absence of all four fingers), R1U4 (absent thumb), and R5 (aplastic hand).

Conclusions

This new documentation system allows hand surgeons to describe the simple morphological or radiographic appearance of congenital absent digits; incorporates all the previous subclassification systems that have attempted to describe congenital absent digits in radial, central, and ulnar deficiencies, symbrachydactyly, and congenital constriction ring syndrome; and has subsequently allowed the development of an algorithm which predicts whether conventional or microsurgical reconstruction is indicated for each specific phenotype.

### Dynamics of specialization in neural modules under resource constraints [^4372dbe8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

andare the numerical values of both digits (or the indices of the letters in the case of E-MNIST), and σ is the parity of the sum, (ie σ = 0 when both are the same parity, and σ = 1 otherwise, with % being the modulo operator in Eq. 1). This task requires the network as a whole to classify bothand, but if done in a modular way each module can recognize only one digit and communicate only a single bit to the other: the parity of its own digit. This allows us to examine networks at extreme levels of sparse communication that can still solve the task. Let's take a look at the example in Fig. 1 A to make the task clearer:
Two random digitsandare sampled. In this case, and.
Digits are fed to the network through their input weights (either all-to-all or one-to-one), at every time-step.
Modules then need to determine if digits are the same parity (σ = 0) or not (σ = 1). In this case, σ = 1.
In the scenario where σ = 0, the network must output the prediction. If not, the network must output. In this case, the correct label to this particular sample is.

Note that the task is unbalanced, since the caseprovides information on both digits, makingmore frequent than. To balance this, we train our networks to predict both:

The models consist of recurrent neural networks to allow for communication between modules, and we run them for a number of time steps (between 2 and 5). In most cases, stimuli are presented identically at every time step, but in "Function specialization can vary dynamically" they are switched on at a random time step and then remain on (Supplements 1.5.2). In that section we also add independent noise to the inputs at each time step (see details in Supplements 1.5.1).

### An iterative approach for estimating domain-specific cognitive abilities from large scale online cognitive data [^07189726]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Digits Span is a cognitive task designed to measure working memory capacity. Participants are presented with a sequence of numbers that they must recall. The first sequence is always 2 numbers long, and at each trial, if the participant replies correctly, the length of the next sequence increases by one. If the participant incorrectly recalls the sequence of numbers, then another string of the same length is presented. This is repeated until the participant replies incorrectly 3 times consecutively, when the task terminates. Spatial Span has a similar design to Digits Span, but instead of digits participants recall the location of sequences of flashes on a 4 × 4 grid of squares, testing their spatial working memory capacity. As shown in Fig. 3c for Digits Span, the derived DS measure suggested that the more numbers participants must remember, the harder is the trial (correlation between sequence length and DS is r = 0.92). Similarly for Spatial Span, the more squares participants have to remember, the harder is the trial (correlation between sequence length and DS is r = 0.84) (Fig. 3d).

Words Definitions is designed to measure crystallised intelligence. Participants are presented with a word and four alternative definitions. They must select the definition that corresponds to the meaning of the word as quickly as possible. The task has multiple trials and at each trial a different word is shown. The words are characterised by different frequency of occurrence in the English language. To assess the word difficulty scale predicted by IDoCT for the Words Definitions task, the correlation between the obtained measure of difficulty DS and the frequency of occurrence in the English language of the words included in the cognitive assessment was calculated. As shown in Fig. 3a, the most frequently used words in English were assigned a lower D and DS compared to the least frequently used ones. A Spearman correlation of −0.66 and −0.64 between respectively DS and D with the log frequency measures of the words was found.

Motor Control is designed to measure motor abilities. Participants are shown a moving target, which is represented as a circular red button, and are expected to press on the target as quickly as possible, as soon as it appears, and before it changes location in the screen. According to IDoCT, the further the location of the current target from the previous location, the higher the difficulty estimate DS (Spearman correlation between the distance and D and DS was 0.91 and 0.87, respectively — Fig. 3b).

### Giving science the finger-is the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D: 4D) a biomarker of good luck? A cross sectional study [^c387b577]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Digit ratio data collection

Digit ratios were measured by two different procedures in accordance with best practice recommendations (appendix 1). Figure 2 shows example images. Participants were instructed to lightly place their hand on a standard photocopier (MX-3570N, Sharp Electronics, Montvale, NJ), and the researcher then scanned one hand at a time. Digital images were captured and delivered electronically to the research team. To minimize radiation exposure and optimize time efficiency, we also used DXA to obtain images of the phalangeal bones. We used the scanner's lumbar spine analysis software to capture an image with sufficient detail to identify details of the phalangeal bones.

Fig 2
Example hand images used to measure the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D). Both images are the right hand of the same participant; yellow lines represent second and fourth digit measurements. (A) Photocopy image: 2D:4D = 0.966. (B) Radiographic image: 2D:4D = 0.943 (radiographic image has been horizontally flipped to be in the same orientation as the photocopy)

Good luck measurement

Participants were asked to select five cards from a deck of playing cards (United States Playing Card Company, Erlanger, KY). Cards were thoroughly shuffled by an investigator and then fanned out, face down, onto a smooth, flat surface. The participant was then requested to select any five of the face down cards and flip them over. The value and suit of the cards were recorded. This procedure was repeated a second time with a separate, shuffled deck of playing cards, which resulted in each participant having two separate, randomly selected, five card poker hands, drawn from two separate decks of cards.

Poker hands were classified and ranked according to standard poker rules (that is, royal flush as the highest hand, single high card as lowest hand). Each individual's highest ranking hand was then selected, and ranked in relation to all other participants at the completion of the study. For instance, the best poker hand in the study's dataset (a nine high straight) was given the top rank of 1. In the event of a tie, both hands were given the same rank, and the ranking below was given a rank two units below those (eg, if two participants had identical hands, and both were ranked 37th, the next hand below them would be ranked 39th).

### Giving science the finger-is the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D: 4D) a biomarker of good luck? A cross sectional study [^baf32a8c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Results

The analysis included 176 individuals (102 men and 74 women). Men were significantly older (age +1.5 years (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 2.9), P = 0.03), heavier (body mass +16.0 kg (12.9 to 19.1), P < 0.001), and taller (height +0.16 m (0.10 to 0.22), P < 0.001) than women. A total of 690 hand images (346 photocopy, 344 radiograph) were included in the analysis. The left hands from one female and one male participant were excluded from analysis, because of a history of broken digits on those hands. Four photocopies (two left hands for men, one left and right for a woman) and six radiographs (three left and three right for men) were not analyzed for technical reasons (that is, missing scan, digits landmarks not clearly visible).

Reliability and rater agreement

All intraclass correlation values were more than 0.90 and the mean percentage difference between raters was less than 1.0% for all 2D:4D measurements, indicating excellent agreement between raters (table 1).

### Does antenatal micronutrient supplementation improve children's cognitive function? Evidence from the follow-up of a double-blind randomised controlled trial in Nepal [^3e84e143]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

We used a counting Stroop test to assess children's executive function. The number–quantity Stroop task involved three conditions. In each condition, the children were asked to name the quantity of items in rows of one to seven identical items. In the baseline condition, children were asked to name the quantity of X in a row (eg, the correct response to XX is 'two'). Second, in the congruent condition, they were asked to name the quantity of digits in a number with the equivalent digits (eg, 55555 = 'five'). Finally, in the third, incongruent condition, they were asked to name the quantity of digits in a number with the non-equivalent digits (eg, 1111 = 'four'). We recorded the time that children took to correctly name all items for each condition. We then derived two scores from these totals. An interference score was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the incongruent condition. This represented the potentially disruptive effect of automatic reading of the incongruous digits on quantity naming. A facilitation score was calculated by subtracting results for the congruent condition from those for the baseline, representing the enhancing effect of congruent digits.

Training of the testers was comparable to that for the US standardisation of the UNIT. The principal investigator (SD) was trained by two experienced UK-based psychologists (one clinical, one experimental, AK and FL) in the general principles of psychometric assessment and procedures specific to the UNIT and the counting Stroop test. She recruited two testers from Dhanusha district who were fluent in the local language (Maithili) and had a background in education and social science. The testers were trained for 15 days to administer the tests and practised under supervision for a week with children aged 10–13. We video-recorded the testers' practice administrations of the UNIT. These were checked by the two experienced psychologists to ensure adherence to standardised testing procedures.

SD and the two other testers administered the UNIT and Stroop tests in an office with minimal distractions located in Janakpur. The testers recorded the children's UNIT raw and scaled scores on a form with a unique child identification number. We checked each form individually and confirmed the scores using the proprietary CompuScore (V.1.1) UNIT software. These audited raw, scaled and standardised scores were double-entered into a Microsoft Access database. We identified discrepancies between first and second entries and resolved them by consulting the original forms.

### Giving science the finger-is the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D: 4D) a biomarker of good luck? A cross sectional study [^8444b67b]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The ratio between the length of the second and fourth digit, referred to as the 2D:4D digit ratio (2D:4D) has received considerable attention in the scientific community (fig 1) and mainstream mediabecause of its apparent association with health and behavior. The digit ratio is often claimed to be a surrogate for prenatal androgen exposure, based on cross sectional human studies and experimental animal studies. These studies generally postulate that a lower 2D:4D reflects greater testosterone exposure (or greater testosterone-to-estrogen ratio), which accounts for men having lower 2D:4D than women. Variations in 2D:4D are also speculated to be rooted in genetic polymorphisms that influence testosterone metabolism and sensitivity. However, little evidence supports this hypothesis in humans, because prospective studies have reported a lack of consistent associations between androgen concentrations in the amniotic fluid or umbilical cord blood and 2D:4D in childhood and adulthood.

Fig 1
Cumulative number of PubMed indexed papers about the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D). The following search was performed to identify papers published each year, with an example of 2020: ("2D:4D" or "digit ratio") AND (("2020"[date-publication]: "2020"[date-publication])). This search might not capture papers that refer to prenatal testosterone or similar concepts in the abstract but use 2D:4D in the methods

Despite a lack of solid physiological justification for studying 2D:4D, an abundance of studies claim that this anthropometric remnant of the prenatal hormonal environment relates to risk of disease in adulthood (that is, cancersand cardiometabolic disease), age of onset, prognosis, and treatment options. In 2020, 2D:4D was suggested to help "identify those for whom it would be advisable to exercise social distancing" to avoid contracting covid-19. However, thorough examination of the literature raises questions about the validity and reproducibility of 2D:4D research. It is implausible to think that one biomarker in utero not only predicts risk of myocardial infarction and age of onset, but also is associated with the likelihood of a person becoming a firefighter, having musical ability, showing pro-environmental consumption behavior, having a sense of directionality, being successful at Sumo wrestling, being obsessed with celebrities, or making a specific choice of Coca-Cola products from a vending machine.

### Genome sequence: a framework for meta-analysis of wheat QTLs [^800cb9c2]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

JBrowse tracks and QTL naming

Databases containing projected markers and QTL were included into the Ae. tauschii Aet v4.0 genome sequence JBrowse database. Marker and QTL tracks were added to the JBrowse graphical display (File S1). To incorporate projected markers and QTL into the JBrowse, each QTL received an identification number (ID). ID starts with the letter "Q" followed by a four-digit number. The first digit indicates the Ae. tauschii pseudomolecule (1D to 7D). The second digit indicates a 100 Mb section starting at the tip of the short arm of the Ae. tauschii pseudomolecule. The third digit places QTL into ten sections and the last digit subdivides each section into 10 sub-sections, starting at the midpoint. Therefore, a 100 Mb section can contain up to 100 ordered QTL. QTL that are sharing the same four digits because of the same associated marker are differentially designated by using one or two digits after a decimal point. For example, for QTL Q1028.1, the first digit indicates that the QTL was on pseudomolecule 1D, the second digit indicates that it was in the section 0–100 Mb from the tip of the short arm, the third and fourth digits (2 and 8) indicate that the QTL was arbitrarily placed in the third sub-section and ninth sub-sub-section of the 100-Mb section. The decimal digit (0.1) indicates that there are several QTL, which are projected at the same location of pseudomolecule 1D.

### Dyscalculia and the calculating brain [^c12edb0d]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Dyscalculia, like dyslexia, affects some 5% of school-age children but has received much less investigative attention. In two thirds of affected children, dyscalculia is associated with another developmental disorder like dyslexia, attention-deficit disorder, anxiety disorder, visual and spatial disorder, or cultural deprivation. Infants, primates, some birds, and other animals are born with the innate ability, called subitizing, to tell at a glance whether small sets of scattered dots or other items differ by one or more item. This nonverbal approximate number system extends mostly to single digit sets as visual discrimination drops logarithmically to "many" with increasing numerosity (size effect) and crowding (distance effect). Preschoolers need several years and specific teaching to learn verbal names and visual symbols for numbers and school agers to understand their cardinality and ordinality and the invariance of their sequence (arithmetic number line) that enables calculation. This arithmetic linear line differs drastically from the nonlinear approximate number system mental number line that parallels the individual number-tuned neurons in the intraparietal sulcus in monkeys and overlying scalp distribution of discrete functional magnetic resonance imaging activations by number tasks in man. Calculation is a complex skill that activates both visual and spatial and visual and verbal networks. It is less strongly left lateralized than language, with approximate number system activation somewhat more right sided and exact number and arithmetic activation more left sided. Maturation and increasing number skill decrease associated widespread non-numerical brain activations that persist in some individuals with dyscalculia, which has no single, universal neurological cause or underlying mechanism in all affected individuals.

### Giving science the finger-is the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D: 4D) a biomarker of good luck? A cross sectional study [^3c9a2b7d]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed by using the average 2D:4D from at least two raters for each hand and each procedure (photocopy and radiography). Significant relations have been reported between 2D:4D and various outcomes when male and female individuals are combined into one group. In other instances, the relation between 2D:4D and an outcome is only statistically significant when men and women are analyzed separately. Therefore, we performed all analyses both ways — with sexes combined and separated.

In our (facetious) effort to persuade less statistically savvy readers of the validity of our statistical analyses, we report as many P values as possible, even where they are not necessary (eg, descriptive statistics). All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS version 27.0 and a priori statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05.

Inter-rater agreement

To determine reliability of the most consistent raters for a given 2D:4D, a one-way random intraclass correlation coefficient was computed for each hand using each technique. Additionally, the mean inter-rater percentage differences were computed for each measurement technique for each hand.

To determine the relation between 2D:4D and sex, hand, and measurement technique, linear mixed effects models were computed by use of a scaled identity as the repeated measures covariance structure. Sex (male v female), hand (left v right), measurement technique (photocopy v radiograph), and all two way interactions between the three factors served as categorical predictors, and 2D:4D served as the dependent variable. A similar linear mixed effects model was also used to compare age, height, and body mass between sexes.

For correlations between 2D:4D and body composition parameters and good luck, preliminary analysis showed that the continuous body composition outcome variables were not normally distributed. Therefore, Spearman's r s was computed for all correlations.

Patient and public involvement

Conversations with members of the public inspired this study, because many indicated that they had seen 2D:4D mentioned in social media; some believed that scientific research had confirmed that 2D:4D had real life applications, while others expressed doubt that 2D:4D could predict anything. However, patients or the public were not directly involved in this study because of limited resources. A member of the public read this manuscript after submission.

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^b334d893]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In crown group tetrapods, individual digits are homologized in relation to a pentadactyl ground plan. However, testing hypotheses of digit homology is challenging because it is unclear whether digits represent distinct and conserved gene regulatory states. Here we show dramatic evolutionary dynamism in the gene expression profiles of digits, challenging the notion that five digits have conserved developmental identities across amniotes. Transcriptomics shows diversity in the patterns of gene expression differentiation of digits, although the anterior-most digit of the pentadactyl limb has a unique, conserved expression profile. Further, we identify a core set of transcription factors that are differentially expressed among the digits of amniote limbs; their spatial expression domains, however, vary between species. In light of these results, we reevaluate the frame shift hypothesis of avian wing evolution and conclude only the identity of the anterior-most digit has shifted position, suggesting a 1,3,4 digit identity in the bird wing.

### Children's arithmetic skills do not transfer between applied and academic mathematics [^a77b4b34]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Most of these children effectively used arithmetic calculations in their jobs. Figure 1a presents the proportion of children who correctly reported the amount due and change in the three enumerator transactions on both their first and second try (if incorrect on the first try). Overall, 95%, 97% and 98% of children were correct by their second try for the first, second and third transactions, respectively (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Table 1). Most children mentally performed these calculations with no paper aids.

For grade 5 children, the ASER test begins with the subtraction task and proceeds to the right (division) if children succeed and to the left (identifying two-digit numbers) if they fail. Because success at each level requires mastery of the operations required by the tasks to its left, children who succeed at a given level are credited with mastery of all the levels below it.

### A systematic review of T cell epitopes defined from the proteome of human immunodeficiency virus [^8ee59f72]. Virus Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
HLA restriction and protein distribution of validated CD8 + T cell epitopes and CD4 + T cell epitopes in HIV proteome. (A, B) displayed the number of CD8 + T cell epitopes and CD4 + T cell epitopes restricted by each HLA supertype, respectively. (C, D) showed the fraction of CD8 + T cell epitopes and CD4 + T cell epitopes in each HIV protein, respectively.

Furthermore, 88.7% of the epitopes for CD8+ T cell belong to the Pol, Gag, Nef, and Env protein (Fig. 1 C), while 87.81% of epitopes for CD4+ T cell are from the Gag, Nef and Env protein (Fig. 1 D). The biased distribution of epitopes is partially due to the lengths of proteins (Env 857aa, Gag 503aa, Pol 1008aa, and so on) and the sequence conservation. Notably, our review only includes epitopes with the four digits of explicitly HLA type. HLA typing that is specific to the last four digits can further refine the polymorphic information of HLA molecules, allowing for a more accurate understanding of the binding affinity between an individual's HLA molecules and antigen peptides. In contrast, HLA typing that only specifies the first two digits may cover multiple molecules with different binding properties.

Methods

Enumeration of ABC-6 stacking sequences

Our computer programs for the enumeration and interpretation of ABC-6 stacking sequences were written in FORTRAN. To enumerate all possible stacking sequences of length N, our computer program went through every N -digit ternary numeral from the smallest one to the largest allowed. Because only unique stacking sequences were needed, we fixed the first digit of every ternary numeral to be '0' and enumerated the remaining (N −1) digits. To guarantee that only the chemically feasible and topologically unique stacking sequences were retained, our computer program performed a two-step examination procedure for each numeral visited. First, our program checked if the current numeral consisted of three or more successive identical digits. If not, this numeral should represent a chemically feasible stacking sequence. Then, our program generated all equivalent numerals for the current one and examined whether any of these equivalent numerals was smaller than the current one. If not, then the current numeral should represent a new stacking sequence. Only the ternary numerals passing both examinations were saved by our computer program. This examination procedure was repeated until the largest allowed N -digit numeral was achieved. The enumeration of ABC-6 cages followed a similar procedure. The only difference was that the ternary numeral for a valid ABC-6 cage should start and end with the same digit, and this digit must be absent in the middle of this ternary numeral. To ensure that all our enumerated cages are topologically unique, we fixed the starting and ending digits to be '0' and enumerated the middle part with digits '1' and '2' only.

Structural information extraction

To extract the channel information from the stacking sequences, our computer program checked the following situations: (1) if a stacking sequence was comprised of only two types of letters, it represented an ABC-6 topology with 12-ring channels running along the c -direction; (2) if a stacking sequence consisted of successive identical letters, it indicated the existence of interconnecting 8-ring channels perpendicular to the c -direction; (3) other stacking sequences corresponded to ABC-6 topologies with six-ring channels only. To calculate the stacking compactness of an ABC-6 topology from its stacking sequence, our computer program counted the number of letters that were distinct from both of their neighbours and divided that value by N, the number of stacking layers.

### Giving science the finger-is the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D: 4D) a biomarker of good luck? A cross sectional study [^d20e34c0]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This study intended to explore whether researchers can get lucky in finding statistically significant associations between a biomarker and various outcomes of interest, and whether these relations might reflect random chance rather than biological cause and effect. Failure to recognize these common research pitfalls (eg, scientifically unjustified hypotheses, weak experimental and statistical methodology, and improper reporting; box 1) can allow false positive findings to masquerade as evidence to support unsound theories. We focus on the 2D:4D example, but we urge researchers and clinicians to be especially vigilant when interpreting data from biomarker association studies.

Box 1
So-called "pitfalls" to avoid in research on second-to-fourth digit ratios (satirical)

Readers unaware of our study's intent could interpret our results as showing that prenatal testosterone influences body composition in men (maximum r s = 0.26), but not as much as it influences good luck (r s = 0.28). These results accord with much of what is reported in the 2D:4D literature, including similar magnitude correlations (that is, r s = 0.15 to 0.35), lower 2D:4D associated with desirable metrics of performance (that is, better body composition and poker hand), a sex specific effect, and greater association for the right hand than for the left. If study's reported findings are similar to an existing body of research, it might be easy to overlook multiple fallacies and assume that statistically significant findings represent real effects. Thus, our findings could be used (inappropriately) to support theories claiming that prenatal testosterone exposure influences adulthood traits, and they could validate an unfounded hypothesis that 2D:4D might be predictive of future luck.

### Melanoma staging: varying precision and terminal digit clustering in breslow thickness data is evident in a population-based study [^8b72dbf3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Errors in Breslow thickness reporting can give misclassification of T category, an important classifier in melanoma staging.

Objective

We sought to investigate precision (number of digits) and terminal digit clustering in Breslow thickness and potential consequences for T category.

Methods

All first primary and morphologically verified invasive melanomas in Norway between 2008 and 2015 were included. A smoothing model was fitted to estimate the underlying Breslow thickness distribution without digit clustering.

Results

Thickness was reported for 13,057 (97.5%) patients; the median was 1.0 mm (range, 0.09–85). It was reported as whole numbers (15.6%), to 1 decimal (78.2%) and 2 decimal places (6.2%)-thin tumors with more precision than thick tumors. Terminal digit clustering was found with marked peaks in the observed frequency distribution for terminal digits 0 and 5, and with drops around these peaks. Terminal digit clustering increased proportions of patients classified with T1 and T4 tumors and decreased proportions classified with T2 and T3.

Limitations

Breslow thickness was not reported in 2.5% of cases.

Conclusions

The Norwegian recommendation of measurement to the nearest 0.1 mm was not followed. Terminal digit clustering was marked, with consequences for T category. Pathologists, clinicians, and epidemiologists should know that clustering of thickness data around T category cut points can impact melanoma staging with consequent effect on patient management and prognosis.

### Early-onset schizophrenia is associated with impaired adolescent development of attentional capacity using the identical pairs continuous performance test [^daf1fc91]. Schizophrenia Research (2006). Low credibility.

The authors examined performance on the Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs "numbers" task in adolescents with schizophrenia (n = 59) and healthy controls (n = 55). Adjusting for an estimate of premorbid intelligence and socioeconomic status, patients performed worse than normal controls on all three d' conditions (2-digit, 3-digit, 4-digit). However, there was a significant group-by-age-by-condition interaction (F[4,100] = 4.69, p < .01) indicating an interaction between development and disease state. At the simplest level of the task (2-digit) the difference between patients with schizophrenia and controls was evident at all ages; while for the more difficult levels of the task (3-digit, 4-digit), differences between groups gradually increased across the tested age span (10 to 20 years of age). Premorbid social isolation was associated with worse attentional performance in patients, suggesting a relationship and continuity with negative symptoms. These data suggest that attentional differences in adolescents with schizophrenia are better captured by different tasks at different ages. The discrepant findings of attentional impairments reported in the literature for adolescents with schizophrenia could reflect the underlying etiological complexity of the disorder that may have a variable impact on involved brain regions and neurocognitive functioning.

### Second to fourth digit ratio (2D: 4D), breast cancer risk factors, and breast cancer risk: a prospective cohort study [^6b941821]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Inter and intraobserver reliability was high for raw digit measurements, with ICC's for left and right, index and ring fingers all being greater than 0.95. Intraclass correlation coefficients for 2D: 4D ratio were slightly lower than those for raw digit measurements (0.80 for right and 0.73 for left 2D: 4D), but still suggest that the observed variability in digit ratio is largely due to between individual differences rather than measurement error.

Of the 9044 women available for this study, we identified 573 incident breast cancer cases during a median follow-up of 16 years 4 months per participant (a total of 145 328 person-years at risk were observed). Characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. Cases were slightly older than non-cases on average, with median age at baseline of 55 years compared with 53. Seventy-five percent of the participants were born in Australia, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom.

### The genetic relationship between educational attainment and cognitive performance in major psychiatric disorders [^fc60a14a]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Trail-Making-Test (TMT)

The TMT is a measure of visual attention and task switching and is one of several executive functioning measures. The test consists of two parts, part A assesses psychomotor speed of the participant, and part B assesses switching between two automated tasks (counting and reciting the alphabet). The time taken to complete each part of the test was measured and the difference in time needed (part B-part A) was used, as it is considered a more accurate measure of the divided attention and alternating sequencing tasks tested in part B –. In this case, a higher score meant worse cognitive performance.

Verbal digit span

The verbal digit span, from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, assesses short-term (forward digit-span) and working memory capacity (backward digit-span). Briefly, participants were asked to recall verbally a sequence of digits, with increasingly longer sequences in each trial. For each correctly recalled string of digits, one point was given. The test was ended when the participant was unable to correctly repeat two presented strings of the same length. The difference between the forward and backward task is that the latter involves mental manipulation as the participant is required to repeat the digits in backward order. A score for each task was considered.

Digit-Symbol-Test (DST)

The DST is a subset of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scaleand measures processing speed, working memory, visuospatial processing and attention. In this test, the participant was asked to use a key of numbers 1–9 with coinciding symbols to draw the appropriate symbol that matched the number given. The participant was given 120 s to fill in as many corresponding symbols as possible. In the end, the correct number of symbols drawn was totaled to get an overall score.

Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT)

The VLMT is the German version of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test. This word-list learning paradigm assesses several memory parameters through serial list learning with subsequent distraction, retrieval after distraction and half-hour time delay, and through a recognition task. The test consists of two different word lists which are each 15 independent words and a recognition list which includes 30 words from the two lists and 20 similar distractor words. Four VLMT scores were rated, the first for the number of correctly recalled words from the first list, a second score for the number of words lost after distraction, a third score of words lost after a time interval, and a fourth score of correctly recalled words from the recognition list.

Stratified randomisation

Participants will be randomised at a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms. A block randomisation (block size 12) will be performed. Randomisation will be stratified by sex, as the latter influences body mass. Based on data from previous studies, the study population is expected to include about 40% of women. A statistician (at Luxembourg Institute of Health) who is not involved in any other part of the study will provide two pre-established randomisation lists before the beginning of recruitment. The participant identification number will comprise of four digits: the first digit corresponding to the participant's sex (1 = female, 2 = male), followed by three digits corresponding to the randomisation number. The study groups and shoes will be coded, and an IT developer will upload the randomisation lists to the data collection system. Then, the data collection system will provide the investigator in charge of the recruitment with a study group number for each participant, according to the randomisation lists. The investigator will upload the shoe number according to the shoe size chosen and study arm so that the electronic system will perform cross-validation. The investigators in charge of the recruitment, the follow-up and data quality check, and the participants will be blinded regarding the shoe version distributed. The shoe code will be broken after the completion of data analysis.

Comparison of 2D:4D by sex, hand, and measurement technique

A summary of 2D:4D data are provided in table 2. Some significant differences were seen: men had a lower 2D:4D than women (P < 0.001), the left hand had a lower 2D:4D than the right hand for the photocopy technique (P = 0.004; but a two way interaction showed this association was significant for photocopy only), and the radiograph technique produced lower 2D:4D measurements than the photocopy technique (P < 0.001). A significant interaction between measurement technique and hand measured (P = 0.006) was noted, but the interactions between sex and measurement technique (P = 0.70) and between sex and hand measured (P = 0.92) were not significant. Despite significant differences in mean 2D:4D, the distribution of 2D:4D between sexes, hands, and techniques showed considerable overlap (fig 3).

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^ed7257ad]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric coding — CPT within HCPCS and National Drug Code (NDC) usage explains that the American Medical Association (AMA) maintains and annually publishes CPT, CPT is level I of HCPCS, and HCPCS level II identifies products/services not in CPT and is produced and maintained by CMS; CMS often creates G codes within level II. For medications, drug products are reported by an NDC, a "10-digit, 3-segment number"; the first segment has "4 to 5 numbers" for the labeler, the second has "3 to 4 numbers" for strength and form, and the third is a "1- to 2-digit number" for package size/types; Medicare and many payers require NDC code reporting on medication claims.

### Transcriptomic analysis of avian digits reveals conserved and derived digit identities in birds [^9abef665]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

Morphological characters are the result of developmental gene expression. The identity of a character is ultimately grounded in the gene regulatory network directing development and thus whole-genome gene expression data can provide evidence about character identity. This approach has been successfully used to assess cell-type identity. Here we use transcriptomic data to address a long-standing uncertainty in evolutionary biology, the identity of avian wing digits. Embryological evidence clearly identifies the three wing digits as developing from digit positions 2, 3 and 4 (ref. 6), whereas palaeontological data suggest that they are digits I, II and III. We compare the transcriptomes of the wing and foot digits and find a strong signal that unites the first wing digit with the first foot digit, even though the first wing digit develops from embryological position 2. Interestingly, our transcriptomic data of the posterior digits show a higher degree of differentiation among forelimb digits compared with hindlimb digits. These data show that in the stem lineage of birds the first digit underwent a translocation from digit position 1 to position 2, and further indicate that the posterior wing digits have unique identities contrary to any model of avian digit identity proposed so far.

### The impact of learning multiple real-world skills on cognitive abilities and functional independence in healthy older adults [^c2f01534]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Measures

A baseline assessment (Week 0) was added in Study 2, so that the participants could serve as their own control. We also included pre-test (Week 6), midpoint (Week 12), and post-test (Week 18) assessments, following Study 1. The measurement battery for Study 2 was identical to the battery in Study 1, with the exception of two additional working memory measures: the 2-back from the EXAMINER battery, and the forward and backward digit span task (Table 2). The 2-back task required participants to remember the location of a square on two trials prior to the current trial (compared with only one trial prior in the 1-back task). The forward and backward digit span task required participants to memorize 16 sequences for the forward task and 14 sequences for the backward task. There were two sequences per trial, with eight trials for the forward task and seven trials for the backward task. The number of digits in each sequence increased after each trial, starting with two digits in the sequences for the first trial and ending with eight to nine digits in the last trial. The total score was divided by 15, the total number of trials.

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^f3804f70]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Finally, we reassessed the homology of fingers in the bird wing and obtain the result that the three digits reflect a combination of translocated and conserved digit identities. The anterior-most digit in the chicken wing, although it develops in position D2 –, exhibits a gene expression profile seen in the D1 of other limbs; this is consistent with previous studies and the frame shift hypothesis. The gene expression profiles of the posterior wing digits (D3 and D4), however, do not show evidence of translocation. This is observed most clearly by comparison to the hindlimb of the chicken, with the pattern recovered when three different gene lists are considered (transcription factors, limb patterning genes, and CDEGs). As discussed above, although we cannot diagnose conserved gene expression profiles for the digits D3 and D4 across amniotes, we obtain indirect evidence for a correspondence of avian digits to the digits D1, D3, and D4 of other amniote limbs (Fig. 6d). The possibility of a 1, ­3­, 4 pattern of digit identity in the bird wing has been proposed previouslyon the basis of experimental studies. Still, this pattern of correspondence is surprising. It challenges the predominant hypotheses of digit identity and suggests an alternative scenario for how limb development evolved in the lineage leading to Aves (Fig. 7b). Significantly, it indicates that diagnoses of digit identity from the paleontological record and hypotheses of digit identity based upon gene expression profiles have a more complex relationship than previously anticipated.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^ab85dde2]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

National drug code (NDC) reporting — manufacturers may use different NDC configurations with variation in the number of digits assigned to each of the 3 segments; to accommodate this, an 11th digit (a leading 0) may be inserted into a segment, and payers request that administered units be appended to NDC codes on claim forms. An example states that in multidose packaging 1 U equates to 1 dose and, if units are specified in milliliters for a 0.5-mL vaccine dose, one would specify 0.5 U rather than 1 U.

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^f977d5e1]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Limbs evolved from paired fins in the Late Devonian, and early tetrapods possessed more than five digits on the fore- and hindlimbs. Later in the tetrapod stem, a pentadactyl pattern stabilized as the ground plan for the limb. Individual digits are homologized between species and between fore- and hindlimbs in reference to this pentadactyl ground plan. However, it remains controversial whether such hypotheses of identity correspond to distinct developmental programs among the digits (developmental identities), or just the relative position of digits along the limb's anteroposterior axis (positional identities) –. Below we use the symbols D1, D2, etc. to indicate positional identities from anterior (thumb) to posterior in the pentadactyl ground plan, rather than to indicate developmental identities.

The idea that digit homology corresponds to developmental identity is based upon several assumptions. First, that a digit's morphology reflects the expression of effector genes that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and matrix deposition (i.e. the genes that realize the digit during development). Second, that the expression of these effector genes is caused by the differential expression of genes controlling cell–cell signaling and gene transcription (i.e. signaling and transcription factor genes). Therefore, based on the observation of stable, digit-specific morphologies in development and evolution, it is predicted that individual digits will have distinct transcription factor and signaling gene expression profiles. Studies aiming to test for homology of developmental identity predict that the identities were present in a common ancestor and are conserved, detectable through comparative study of transcription factor and signaling gene expression profiles, in descendent lineages.

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^f78f984e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Analyses of developmental identity of digits tend to focus on either Shh expression and signaling in the limb bud prior to digit condensation or gene expression in the interdigital mesenchyme after digit condensation. In this paper, we follow the latter approach. Although Shh signaling determines the number of digits formed and initiates the development of differences between digits, the execution of digit-specific developmental programs continues long after the Shh signal has ceased. Dahn and Fallondemonstrated in the chicken hindlimb that genes expressed in the interdigital mesenchyme regulate digit-specific morphologies, including the number of phalanges. Subsequent work in the chicken hindlimb showed that this signaling, in the phalanx-forming region, is active between stages 27 and 30. In addition, we follow the latter approach because we allow the possibility that in digits developmental identity can be decoupled from digit position.

Here we present comparative transcriptomic data, analyzing developing digits, and their associated posterior interdigital mesenchyme in five species to test hypotheses of digit identity in amniotes. We report a surprising diversity of regulatory gene expression profiles of digits between species. Analyses further reveal a core set of transcription factor genes differentially expressed among digits and suggest an alternative model for the evolution of the bird wing.

### Insights into bird wing evolution and digit specification from polarizing region fate maps [^9363028b]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

The proposal that birds descended from theropod dinosaurs with digits 2, 3 and 4 was recently given support by short-term fate maps, suggesting that the chick wing polarizing region-a group that Sonic hedgehog-expressing cells-gives rise to digit 4. Here we show using long-term fate maps that Green fluorescent protein-expressing chick wing polarizing region grafts contribute only to soft tissues along the posterior margin of digit 4, supporting fossil data that birds descended from theropods that had digits 1, 2 and 3. In contrast, digit IV of the chick leg with four digits (I-IV) arises from the polarizing region. To determine how digit identity is specified over time, we inhibited Sonic hedgehog signalling. Fate maps show that polarizing region and adjacent cells are specified in parallel through a series of anterior to posterior digit fates-a process of digit specification that we suggest is involved in patterning all vertebrate limbs with more than three digits.

### Routineness of social interactions is associated with higher affective well-being in older adults [^8e4463a9]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Episodic memory was assessed with two tests (M = 0.05, SD = 0.79, range = −1.67 to 2.45) (see Author Note 1). In a word recall task, a list of words had to be memorized and reproduced in free order. In a numerical memory task, a list of pairs of three-digit numbers had to be learned. At retrieval, the first number of each pair was given in a different order, and the second number was to be recalled and written down.

Speed was assessed with three tests (M = 0.07, SD = 0.76, range = −2.50 to 2.14, McDonald's omega = 0.67). The digit symbol test required participants to write down the corresponding symbol as fast as possible under each digit according to nine digit–symbol pairs followed by a list of digits. In an animal naming task, participants wrote down as many names of animals as quickly as possible. In a word classification task, participants marked all words naming plants in a list of words.

Vocabulary was assessed with multiple choice tasks (M = 32.13, SD = 2.64, range = 25 to 36), where participants identified a correct word among four similar nonwords (MWT-B;) (see Author Note 1).

A confirmatory factor analysis showed good fit for a model with four correlated ability factors (comparative fit index = 0.92, root mean square error of approximation = 0.074, standardized root mean square residual = 0.054). For the constructs that included multiple measures (i.e. reasoning, episodic memory, and speed), the scores were calculated as the average z -score across all measures. For all the constructs, higher scores represent higher abilities.

### Effect of age on the protein profile of healthy malay adults and its association with cognitive function competency [^ef2bc27f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Forward Digit Span (FDS)

Subjects listened to a string of digits and repeated them in forward order verbally. The first sequence consisted of three digits. An additional digit was added until a maximum span of nine digits was achieved if subjects were able to express each digit correctly. The subjects had two trials for each span. If subjects repeated wrong digits in two of the trials, the test was halted. Scoring was based on the maximum digits repeated without error in one of the two trials.

Backward Digit Span (BDS)

Execution of this test was similar to the FDS. Subjects repeated the span in reverse order with the last digit in the span repeated first. The first span included two digits, and the last one was eight digits. The test was stopped if an error was made in two consecutive trials. Like the FDS, each subject's score was the maximum digits repeated without error in one of the two trials.

Digit Symbol

Subjects were required to redraw symbols that were matched with a particular number within 120 min. A list of numbers was shown in parallel to the assigned symbols for reference during the task. Subjects were allowed to practice drawing the symbols before beginning the actual test. Scoring was based on the total number of symbols drawn regardless of sequence.

Visual Reproduction (VR)

There were two parts of this task, VRI and VRII. In VRI, four different cards were presented to the subjects. Each card was shown within five seconds, and subjects were asked to redraw the shape on each card. In VRII, subjects were given a glimpse of the drawn shapes and required to memorize them. The subjects were then asked to redraw the shapes without the presence of any visual stimuli.

### Shared and distinct neural circuitry for nonsymbolic and symbolic double-digit addition [^e42635f2]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

Symbolic arithmetic is a complex, uniquely human ability that is acquired through direct instruction. In contrast, the capacity to mentally add and subtract nonsymbolic quantities such as dot arrays emerges without instruction and can be seen in human infants and nonhuman animals. One possibility is that the mental manipulation of nonsymbolic arrays provides a critical scaffold for developing symbolic arithmetic abilities. To explore this hypothesis, we examined whether there is a shared neural basis for nonsymbolic and symbolic double-digit addition. In parallel, we asked whether there are brain regions that are associated with nonsymbolic and symbolic addition independently. First, relative to visually matched control tasks, we found that both nonsymbolic and symbolic addition elicited greater neural signal in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, and the right superior parietal lobule. Subsequent representational similarity analyses revealed that the neural similarity between nonsymbolic and symbolic addition was stronger relative to the similarity between each addition condition and its visually matched control task, but only in the bilateral IPS. These findings suggest that the IPS is involved in arithmetic calculation independent of stimulus format.

### Standardizing the use of the continuous performance test in schizophrenia research: a validation study [^c7221e10]. Schizophrenia Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The Continuous Performance Test (CPT) has emerged as the most commonly administered measure of sustained attention, but use of discrepant versions reduces the ability of researchers and clinicians to accurately draw cross-study conclusions. In an effort to standardize use of the CPT, this study compared four versions of the Identical Pairs CPT for their reliability and ability to discriminate between patients with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers. The relationship of performance on the different versions of the CPT with measures of psychopathology, functioning, and other aspects of cognition was also examined.

Methods

Performance on the 2-digit, 3-digit, 4-digit, and Shapes Identical Pairs CPT was assessed at three test sessions over five weeks, during which subjects also completed the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and questionnaires assessing psychopathology and functioning.

Results

All four CPTs discriminated between patients with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers, but there were no statistical differences in sensitivity among the versions. The 3-digit CPT showed non-statistical advantages in that it had high test-retest reliability, low potential for a ceiling effect, and a very low rate of false alarms. There were also moderate correlations between CPT performance and performance of the BACS subtests, but no significant correlations between CPT performance and measures of psychopathology and functioning.

Conclusions

While all versions of the CPT tested here had good psychometric characteristics, the 3-digit CPT-IP has some advantages in repeated measures studies such as clinical trials.

### Cognitive performance in dialysis patients-"when is the right time to test? " [^c099248e]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

RBANS

The RBANS is a brief, individually-administered test measuring cognitive function across five domains: attention, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and immediate and delayed memory. Performance in each domain is measured by the subtests (12 in total) described below, which are combined to yield five scaled "index scores" gauging function in the respective domains. These five index scores are in turn combined to yield a composite score referred to as the "total scale score". Stimuli are contained in a wire-bound, easel-type booklet, making the test easily portable and allowing for bedside administration. Total administration time is 20–30 min. Normative information from the manual for the index and total scores is based on 540 healthy adults who ranged in age from 20 to 89 years.

The battery was designed to be amenable to the construction of multiple equivalent forms, and there are different, equivalent versions of the RBANS available for test-retest use.

The domains comprise the following subtests:
Immediate Memory

List Learning: immediate recall of a 10-item list of words.
Story Memory: a 12 item story, read aloud for immediate recall over two trials.

2 Visuospatial/Constructional

Figure Copy: copying a geometric figure of 10 parts.
Line Orientation: a 10 item line orientation test.

3 Language

Picture Naming: 10-line drawings which the subject must name
Semantic Fluency: the total number of examples generated for a given semantic category within 60 s.

4 Attention

Digit Span: analogous to digits forward on the WAIS. There are two strings of digits in each item, each pair increasing in length from 2 to 9 digits. The second string of a given length is only read if the first string is failed.
Coding: numbers rather than symbols were chosen for the response in order to avoid the possible detrimental effect of a constructional apraxia on performance.

5 Delayed Memory

List Recall: free recall of the words from the List Learning task.
List Recognition: yes/no recognition testing for memory of the words from the List Learning task.
Story Recall: free recall of the story from the story memory test.
Figure Recall: free recall of the figure from the figure copy subtest.

All subtests of the RBANS were scored according to standardized age-adjusted criteria. Raw scores from the 12 subtests were converted to age- adjusted scaled scores before calculating an index score for each domain. The sum of the index scores was then converted to a total scale score.

### Comprehension of acoustically degraded speech in Alzheimer's disease and primary progressive aphasia [^af1dd9b5]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Experimental procedure

The stimuli were administered binaurally in a quiet room via Audio-Technica ATH-M50X headphones at a comfortable fixed listening level (at least 70 dB). Data for 30 participants were collected remotely via video link during the Covid-19 pandemic (Table 1 and Supplementary material).

To familiarize the participants with the experimental procedure, they were first asked to repeat five three-digit numbers (not included in the experimental session) that were spoken by the experimenter. Prior to presenting the experimental stimuli, participants were advised that the numbers they heard would vary in how difficult to understand they were, but that they should guess the number even if uncertain. Stimuli were presented in order of progressively decreasing channel number (intelligibility), first clear speech, then from 24 vocoding channels to one vocoding channel. On each experimental trial, the task was to repeat the number (or as many of the three digits as the participant could identify). Participants were allowed to write down the numbers they heard rather than speaking them if preferred; in scoring, we accepted the intended target digit as correct, even if imperfectly articulated. Responses were recorded for offline analysis. During the experiment, no feedback about performance was given and no time limits were imposed.

### Second to fourth digit ratio and prostate cancer severity [^27d0a2f0]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer. There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the 2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease.

Methods

Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with digit ratios to determine relationships.

Results

African-American men with prostate cancer are 3.70 times more likely to have a low 2D:4D digit ratio than Caucasian men with prostate cancer (95% confidence interval: 1.98, 6.92; P < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of metastasis, Gleason score, family history or age at diagnosis by digit ratio.

Conclusion

2D:4D ratio shows strong differences between African-Americans and Caucasians; however, it does not correlate with disease severity in men already diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although this is a small population sample with possible confounding factors, it does not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that prenatal androgens affect prostate cancer grade or progression.

### Shared polygenic risk for ADHD, executive dysfunction and other psychiatric disorders [^390e8ce5]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Digit span test for working memory

The digit span test is a component of the Chinese version of Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (C-WISC). In this study, we used the digits backward digit span test to assess the patient's working memory, as it measures the child's ability to manipulate verbal information while it is in temporary storage. In this test, the child listens to a sequence of numbers and repeats them in reverse order. The length of each sequence of numbers increases as the child responds correctly. Higher score indicates better working memory.

The phenotype distribution plot showed working memory was normally distributed, but inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility had some outliers. Considering excessive scores on cognitive measures may indicate the participant did not understand the task or something else happened during testing, using the method described in ref. we used a loose threshold to remove the samples with inhibitory control or cognitive flexibility below F L −4 × (F U −F L) or above F U + 4 × (F U −F L), in which F L and F U were the lower and upper fourths of the phenotype. We removed 1 and 2 outliers for inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility respectively. From the 1134 subjects, we also collected ADHD symptoms according to the Clinical Diagnostic Interview Scale. The phenotype distribution plot and related skewness and kurtosis after removing outliers is shown in Fig. S1 and Table 1. We compared the phenotype data with a small group of controls and the result showed ADHD patients had significantly worse performance in shifting time, inhibitory control and working memory than normal controls (Table S1).

For subjects with all three EF measures, we did exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using SPSS 26. EFA method is to identify the underlying relationships between measured variables and get a latent variable to denote common factor of the measured variables. The KMO and Bartlett's test was significant (P < 0.001), which denoted the three EF measures had high correlation and were suitable for EFA. The scree plot showed the first principal component (EF-PC) had eigenvalue > 1. Detailed parameters for the EFA model was shown in Fig. S2. The total variance explained by the first component is 56.523%. We used EF-PC to denote the main component among these three EF measures. To test the correlations among the EF measures (including EF-PC) and correlations with ADHD symptoms, two-tailed Pearson correlation was conducted by using SPSS 26.

### Neural association between non-verbal number sense and arithmetic fluency [^3b9765a4]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Numerosity comparison

Three dot arrays were presented simultaneously on the screen. The target array was presented in upper part of the screen, and two candidate arrays were presented in the lower half of the screen. Participants were asked to judge which candidate array contained the same number of dots as the target array. However, as this was not a matching task, the layout of the dots differed even when the number of dots was the same. For half of the trials, the total area taken up by the dots was the same for all three arrays. For the other half, the average area for a single dot (total area/number of dots) was the same for all three arrays. Dot size varied and dots were randomly distributed within a circle. Choices were made by pressing the "Q" (left candidate) and "P" (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. The task comprised 120 trials that were divided into two 60‐trials blocks.

2.3.3 Simple addition

We used a simple single‐digit addition task. For each trial, an addition problem was presented in the middle of the upper part of the screen and two candidate answers, one of which was correct, were presented side by side in the lower part of the screen. Participants were asked to choose the correct answer by pressing the "Q" (left candidate) and "P" (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. There are 81 possible single‐digit addition problems starting from 1 + 1 and ending at 9 + 9. To avoid repeating the same problem more than once, this test only had 81 trials.

2.3.4 Simple subtraction

The subtraction problems were the reversed calculations from the single‐digit addition. Thus, there are 81 possible problems starting from 2 to 1 and ending at 18 to 9. Again, to avoid repeating problems, this test only had 81 trials. All other aspects of the task were the same as the simple addition task.

2.3.5 Character rhyming

Two Chinese characters were presented simultaneously on the screen. Participants were asked to judge whether they rhymed or not. This test had 120 trials.

### An interdigit signalling centre instructs coordinate phalanx-joint formation governed by 5' hoxd-gli3 antagonism [^fb008600]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The number of phalanges and joints are key features of digit 'identity' and are central to limb functionality and evolutionary adaptation. Prior chick work indicated that digit phalanges and their associated joints arise in a different manner than the more sparsely jointed long bones, and their identity is regulated by differential signalling from adjacent interdigits. Currently, there is no genetic evidence for this model, and the molecular mechanisms governing digit joint specification remain poorly understood. Using genetic approaches in mouse, here we show that functional 5'Hoxd-Gli3 antagonism acts indirectly, through Bmp signalling from the interdigital mesenchyme, to regulate specification of joint progenitors, which arise in conjunction with phalangeal precursors at the digit tip. Phalanx number, although co-regulated, can be uncoupled from joint specification. We propose that 5'Hoxd genes and Gli3 are part of an interdigital signalling centre that sets net Bmp signalling levels from different interdigits to coordinately regulate phalanx and joint formation.

### Shh and gli3 are dispensable for limb skeleton formation but regulate digit number and identity [^eeaa8961]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Most current models propose Sonic hedgehog (Shh) as the primary determinant of anteroposterior development of amniote limbs. Shh protein is said to be required to direct the formation of skeletal elements and to specify digit identity through dose-dependent activation of target gene expression. However, the identity of genes targeted by Shh, and the regulatory mechanisms controlling their expression, remain poorly understood. Gli3 (the gene implicated in human Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome) is proposed to negatively regulate Shh by restricting its expression and influence to the posterior mesoderm. Here we report genetic analyses in mice showing that Shh and Gli3 are dispensable for formation of limb skeletal elements: Shh(-/-) Gli3(-/-) limbs are distally complete and polydactylous, but completely lack wild-type digit identities. We show that the effects of Shh signalling on skeletal patterning and ridge maintenance are necessarily mediated through Gli3. We propose that the function of Shh and Gli3 in limb skeletal patterning is limited to refining autopodial morphology, imposing pentadactyl constraint on the limb's polydactyl potential, and organizing digit identity specification, by regulating the relative balance of Gli3 transcriptional activator and repressor activities.

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^78762742]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations and Conclusions

Our study has several limitations. First, in order to understand when specialized networks for these categories of symbols start to appear, it will be necessary to test younger children. Second, a larger sample and an extended assessment of literacy and numeracy skills would be necessary to assess if the amplitude of selective responses to letters and digits relate to character knowledge. Finally, although we demonstrate the possibility to use very short recording times (2 × 40 s), it would be beneficial to have more trials to increase SNR by averaging and therefore decreasing noise. Future studies should also attempt to quantify the frequency of occurrence of letters and digits in kindergarten children.

In conclusion, our study sheds new light on the visual cortex specialization for culturally derived characters like letters and digits and shows that already at 6 years of age, those arbitrary shapes are discriminated from each other. These findings agree with the proposal that VOTC specialization for cultural visual symbols partly depends on the relevant coactivated brain networks.

### Characterizing intraindividual variability in bipolar disorder: links to cognition, white matter microstructure, and clinical variables [^8ee84a81]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Intraindividual variability

IIV measures were derived for all participants from individual responses on the Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs (CPT-IP) version (Cornblatt et al.). The CPT-IP was collected during the administration of the Matrics Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), a battery of tests validated for use in BD (Burdick et al; Van Rheenen & Rossell). The CPT-IP is a computerized neurocognitive measure requiring participants to monitor a series of two-, three-, and then four-digit sequences and respond when identical sequences are presented consecutively. Across the two-, three-, and four-digit blocks, a total of 450 rapidly flashed digit sequences (150 per block) are delivered, including 30 'target' digit pairs within each block, as well as 30 'catch' trials that feature two successive similar but not identical digit sequences, and 90 random digit sequences that are in no way similar. Stimuli are flashed on the screen for 50 ms, followed by a 950-ms blank screen (stimulus onset asynchrony = 1,000 ms). Participants are asked to respond by quickly pressing and releasing the left mouse button whenever they are presented with an identical digit sequence pair. The total test time is ~10 min.

IIV was operationalized from the raw reaction time (milliseconds) values for each successful 'hit' across the entirety of the CPT-IP. (The size of the case–control difference in the mean standard deviation in response time for the CPT-IP was stronger when calculated across its entirety versus for each individual block. Hence, we decided to use the IIV measures calculated across the full task. See theand Supplementaryfor further details.) Hit trials refer to any trial in which the second stimulus in a target pair received a response during the interstimulus interval (i.e. the response window). Thus, any response to the second stimulus in a target pair occurring after the onset of the next trial was not retained for the IIV calculation. Each participant's mean reaction time was based on their hits, and the standard deviation of the mean of this reaction time (reflecting the participant's iSD) was computed. Each individual's CoV was also derived by dividing the iSD by their mean reaction time. These IIV measures are mathematically (and conceptually) distinct from accuracy, speed, or d-prime scores typically derived from the CPT-IP (Cho et al.).

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^95bf787b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To assess whether spatial gene expression profiles can be conserved between the fore- and hindlimbs of a species, even when they differ in digit number, we performed in situ hybridization in alligator. We evaluated expression of Tbx2, Tbx3, and Sall1, three transcription factor genes identified as differentially expressed between alligator forelimb D3 and D4. In situ hybridization confirms their expression in the posterior interdigital mesenchyme (Fig. 6c) and shows conserved positional expression patterns for Tbx3 and Sall1 between the forelimb and hindlimb. It is unclear whether the pattern also holds for Tbx2, where difference in expression level detected from RNA sequencing appear to reflect the proximodistal extent of gene expression.

We also tested the frame shift hypothesis by comparing the limbs of chicken to the pentadactyl forelimbs of other species. For each pentadactyl species, PCA were run using the CDEGs (49 in mouse and alligator, and 42 in Anolis), and chicken samples were projected into the reference PCA plane as supplementary observations. CDEGs were used because they can produce digit-specific expression profiles for mouse and alligator forelimb and chicken hindlimb, and because these patterns are reflective of more inclusive gene lists, as described above. These projections show that the digits D2, D3, and D4 of the bird wing consistently fall into regions of the PCA plane corresponding to the digits D1, D3, and D4 of other limbs. Although it is difficult to differentiate D3 and D4 expression in all species, it is clear that D3 of the chicken forelimb does not correspond in its expression profile of these genes to the D2 of the other limbs sampled (Fig. 6d).

Skeletal tissues in the three digits of the adult avian wing (D2–D4) do not derive from Shh expressing cells. This pattern is consistent with digits of positions D1–D3 in other limbs and can be regarded as evidence in favor of the frame shift hypothesis. Our data are incongruent with such diagnoses of digit developmental identity for the second and third digit in the avian wing, but confirm previous identification of the first avian wing digit as homologous to D1 in the pentadactyl ground plan. Thus, according to the prediction that core regulatory networks of transcription factor genes responsible for developmental identity are expressed in the posterior interdigital mesenchyme, we suggest that Shh expression is not a conserved marker of developmental digit-identity in limbs with highly reduced digit number.

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^ab365260]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that 6‐year‐old children display specific neural responses to visually presented letters and digits, both arbitrary visual shapes conveying culturally acquired meaning. Remarkably, this differential brain response to letters/digits occurred in a very fast presentation mode (< 170 ms per stimulus), low‐level confounds being controlled through random changes at every stimulus onset. These results suggest that already at the beginning of first grade, letters and digits give rise to specific neural responses, directly indicating selective modes of processing for one category compared to the other.

This novel finding goes beyond previous study where categorical responses emerged between familiar letters and unfamiliar pseudofonts (Lochy et al. 2016). At this age, children have had limited reading and arithmetic instruction, but they already possess letter and number knowledge due to early sociocultural and preschool‐related exposure to print (Wright et al. 1991; for digits see also Mejias & Schiltz, 2013; Hoffmann, Hornung, Martin, & Schiltz, 2013). Our results contrast with previous studies on the neuronal substrate of (differential) letter and digit processing in children. An fMRI study with 4‐year‐old preschoolers revealed greater selectivity for symbols (letters and digits) than objects (shoes and faces) processing in the left hemisphere, but no difference for letters versus digits (Cantlon et al. 2011). In a working memory task involving letters, digits or faces, 8‐year‐old children also did not show specific activation for letters versus digits (Libertus et al. 2009). Recently, an ERP study (Park et al. 2017) did not reveal lateralized response pattern for letters versus digits in 7‐ and 10‐year‐old children. Here on the contrary, inspection of topographies indicated that letters (vs. digits) are selectively associated with left occipital responses (PO9) and digits (vs. letters) to right occipital responses (PO10). In line with neuropsychological data (Starrfelt & Behrmann, 2011), topographies and amplitude values also suggested stronger discrimination abilities for digits than letters in 6‐year‐olds. While requiring further investigation, this might be because digits contain only 10 exemplars, and all (except 0) were presented here. In contrast, letters contain 26 exemplars, and only a subset was used (among which "J" and "Z", not very frequent in French). Finally, digits might bear a meaning by themselves, already known at this age, whereas letters do not mean anything in isolation.

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^66932b3d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Serial homologs are repeated body parts, generated by a common developmental program. In the case of digits, chondrogenic condensations are generated by a reaction-diffusion Turing-type mechanism. Serial homologs can be developmentally identical (homomorph parts) or they can assume distinct developmental identities through the differential expression of regulatory genes (paramorph parts). The degree to which serial homologs are individuated can be difficult to assess from morphology alone, because the same developmental program can lead to different morphological outcomes depending on the developmental environment. However, detailed analyses of gene expression and regulation can identify developmentally individualized body parts.

In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of whole genome expression data to test the hypothesis that digits have conserved developmental identities. In interpreting our data, we acknowledge that gene expression does not demonstrate gene function. Nevertheless, a lack of differential gene expression between digits is evidence of a lack of developmental individuation, and a high level of differential expression (particularly in transcription factor and signaling genes) is evidence for distinct gene regulatory states.

We studied gene expression in the developing digit and the interdigital mesenchyme after digit condensation. This approach was guided by previous experimental work. It was demonstrated in the chicken hindlimb that genes expressed in the interdigital mesenchyme regulate digit-specific morphologiesand that this signaling, in the phalanx-forming region, is active between stages 27 and 30. Here, we analyzed the expression profiles chicken hindlimb digits of stages 28 and 31 and showed that expression profiles of limb patterning genes and transcription factor genes are stable over this developmental window (Figs. 4b, c, 6b and Supplementary Fig. 3b, c). Thus, signals pertinent to digit patterning continue to be expressed at late stages of limb development, even after phalanges have formed. Analyses of alligator show a consistent pattern: between stages 18 and 19.5, the expression patterns of limb patterning genes and transcription factor genes are stable as assessed by HCA, PCA, and in profiles of genes of interest (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Figs. 4b, c, 6c). Although not all species were sampled at multiple time points, we argue on the basis of these comparisons in chicken and alligator that it is unlikely our conclusions on the evolution and development of digit identity are biased by temporal dynamism in gene expression within the developmental window studied here.

### Renal outcomes and all-cause death associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors versus other glucose-lowering drugs (CVD-REAL 3 Korea) [^8788090b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

2.4 Statistical methods

Baseline characteristics are presented as means ± SD or n (%). The incidence rates for the primary outcomes were calculated by dividing the number of incident cases by the total follow‐up duration (patient‐years). The disease‐free probability of primary outcomes was calculated using Kaplan–Meier curves, and a log‐rank test was performed to analyse differences between the groups. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ESRD and all‐cause death were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model for each category.

A non‐parsimonious propensity score for initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor was developed for each individual episode of a new treatment initiation. Variables that could potentially affect treatment assignment or outcomes were selected: eGFR, age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, height, weight, presence of proteinuria, T2D duration, fasting blood glucose, presence of diabetic retinopathy, prior CVD, hypertension, blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, smoking, drinking, exercise, income status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, insulin treatment, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists, number of oGLDs, and index date. The propensity matching was assessed by evaluating standardized differences of patient characteristics post‐match. A significant imbalance was considered to be present if a > 10% standardized difference was present between the two groups after propensity matching. An SAS (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, North Carolina) matching macro, "%OneToManyMTCH", was used for this matching. It allows propensity‐score matching from 1‐to‐1 to 1‐to‐N. We set a caliper for nearest‐neighbour matching within the first four to eight digits; for example, two patients with propensity scores of 0.12345678 and 0.12347123 match on the first four digits (0.1234). The macro makes the "best" matches first and the "next‐best" matches next in a hierarchical sequence until no more matches can be made. If no patient in the oGLD group has a propensity score that lies within a four‐digit width of a propensity score of a patient in the SGLT2 inhibitor group, then that patient in the SGLT2 inhibitor group is left unmatched and is not used in subsequent analyses.

### Engaging communities in emerging infectious disease mitigation to improve public health and safety [^8f385715]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Sample and Procedure

Using qualitative data obtained from the focus groups in phase I, we developed a 20-item HSC measure. To validate the measure, we incorporated the items into the Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, which is an expansion of the Understanding America Study (UAS) that includes questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The UAS is an ongoing internet panel of ≈9,500 adult respondents who represent households across the United States. Beginning in 2020 and continuing throughout the pandemic, UAS sent out waves of the tracking surveys to inquire about personal behaviors and perceptions relevant to COVID-19.

We selected questions from the Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey relevant to behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic to serve as a standard for the predictive validity of the HSC measure. Questions included: "Which of the following have you done in the last seven days to keep yourself safe from coronavirus: 1) Avoid public spaces, gatherings, or crowds; 2) Avoid contact with high-risk persons; 3) Avoid eating at restaurants; 4) Wear a face mask or some other face coverings; 5) Remain in your residence except for essential activities or exercise; and 6) Wash hands with soap or used hand sanitizer several times a day". Potential responses for each question were yes, no, or unsure.

To enable reporting of the HSC measure in community subgroups, we selected all ZIP (postal) codes within the UAS that had ≥ 10 respondents, resulting in 153 postal codes. In February 2021, we distributed English- and Spanish-language versions of the HSC measure to all UAS participants residing in one of the 153 postal codes (n = 2,359). We received responses from 1,672 (70.9%) participants. We excluded from analysis 24 (1.4%) respondents with missing data (final n = 1,648).

To protect the identities of respondents and ensure a sufficient number of respondents from each geographic community, we created a community for each postal code, identified by the first 3 digits of the postal code. To mask respondent identifiers, the UAS survey team created a variable that provided respondents with an index number associated with their 3-digit postal-code community. Only postal-code communities with ≥ 10 respondents were included in the analyses. The final sample included 1,438 respondents who were nested in 49 communities. The average number of respondents from each community was 29.34 (range 10–319).

### Probiotics-induced changes in gut microbial composition and its effects on cognitive performance after stress: exploratory analyses [^7bf440af]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Procedure Subjects were tested on two days: the first day (baseline), before the intervention started, and the second day after 28 days (four weeks) of probiotics or placebo administration. The identical test sessions included cognitive testing in and outside the MRI scanner, an acute stress intervention, and fecal material collection before starting and after the last day of the intervention (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Overview of the testing sessions.

Each participant was tested twice, before and after 4 weeks of supplementation with probiotics/placebo. The procedure of the two sessions was the same (i.e. subjects performed the same tests in the same order). Tx: x minutes since the start of the test session. SECPT: socially evaluated cold pressor test.

Relevant to the current analyses, the working memory task (digit span forward and backward) was performed before and after the SECPT. The SECPT is an established stress-inducing paradigm consisting of both a physical and a social stressor. Also in this experiment, the SECPT increased subjective feelings of stress measured with Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) and increased physiological measures, i.e. heart rate, blood pressure, and cortisol levels, in our subjects (see Fig. 4 in Papalini et al.). During the digit span task, subjects listen to a series of numbers and are instructed to repeat each series correctly (digit span forward) or repeat it backward (digit span backward). Following a correct response, increasingly longer sequences are presented to the participant. Different series of numbers are used on each occasion (before and after stress on the first and second test day) to avoid long-term memory effects. In the SECPT, subjects were instructed to hold their hand in a bucket of ice water (0–3 °C) for as long as possible (limited to 3 min) under the surveillance of a video camera and an unfamiliar, disesteem expressing researcher. After the SECPT, the digit span was re-tested, thereby enabling assessment of stress on working memory performance. As in our previous work, we only focus on the digit span backward, given that SECPT specifically influenced this type of working memory modulation instead of simply working memory maintenance that is needed in the digit span forward. Throughout the test session, VAS was used to assess well-being (5 times), heart rate and blood pressure were measured (7 times), and saliva samples (5 times) were obtained. Three fMRI paradigms measuring different aspects of emotion and cognition were performed while scanning. Once per test session, we further evaluated mood, emotional state, sensitivity, and diet. The total test session lasted almost 3 h. The effects of the probiotics versus placebo intervention on these measures have already been reported in Papalini et al.

### United States medical licensing examination step 1 two-digit score: a correlation with the American board of pathology first-time test taker pass / fail rate at the university of Pittsburgh medical center [^e3df6a29]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Factors that correlate with success or failure on the American Board of Pathology (ABP) examination are not known. Other medical residency programs have shown that standardized test scores correlate with specialty board examination scores; however, data from pathology programs are lacking.

Objective

To investigate whether the 2-digit score on step 1 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) was correlated with ABP examination performance at a large university pathology program.

Design

Nine years of data (2001–2009) from pathology residents (n = 72) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) was collected from existing files and deidentified. Step 1 USMLE 2-digit scores and ABP failure rates for first-time test takers were compared. Results are reported as the percentage of residents who failed either the anatomic pathology or clinical pathology part of the ABP examination in cohorts by their USMLE 2-digit score (≤ 80, 81–85, 86–89, ≥ 90).

Results

The rolling 5-year (2005–2009) ABP average failure rate for first-time test takers of the anatomic pathology examination was 3.1% (UPMC) and 14.1% (nationally); in clinical pathology, it was 13.8% (UPMC) and 23.6% (nationally). At UPMC, no resident failed the anatomic pathology or clinical pathology parts of the ABP examination if his or her 2-digit USMLE step 1 score was 90 or more across 9 years of training (2001–2009).

Conclusions

In the UPMC pathology program, 2-digit scores on USMLE step 1 of 90 or more and 80 or less were strong measures of ABP first-time pass/failure rates, whereas scores of 81 to 89 were less-accurate measures.

### Smartphone-based symbol-digit modalities test reliably captures brain damage in multiple sclerosis [^9ee9f230]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have optimized and validated tests that measured motoric and cerebellar functions. Here, we have tested psychometric properties of the modified Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). The SDMT is a cognitive processing speed test traditionally administered by neuropsychologists. Participants are given a key of nine symbol-digit pairs along with a sequence of symbols. They are then asked to use the key to match as many symbols in the sequence to their corresponding numbers as possible within 90 s. In the written format, participants write the matching numbers on the paper. In the verbal format, participants say the number and test administrators write in participants' responses. This operator-dependency makes SDMT prohibitively expensive to administer in routine neurology practice. Whereas neuropsychologists administer written followed by oral versions, MS investigators use predominantly oral SDMT to minimize influence of the hand disability on test performance. The common SDMT administration uses a single form, copyrighted by Western Psychological Services, raising a possibility of code memorization on repeated testing, as demonstrated in the oral SDMT for both healthy volunteers (HV) and MS patients.

To prevent memorization, we introduce several adaptations of the smartphone SDMT. For instance, the symbol-digit key pairing changes randomly with each trial. While this key is displayed on the top of the screen during test duration, participants are shown each symbol (again, randomly generated) one at a time. This prevents inputting the numbers out of sequence in unsupervised testing. To input their responses, participants touch the corresponding number on a virtual number keypad (numpad; Fig. 1). An oral version of the smartphone SDMT uses voice recognition technologies for patients whose motoric disability prevents them from using the numpad.

### Examining the effectiveness of a video-based parent-child program on executive functions for children 5 to 6 years old: a randomized controlled trial [^64e8bd3c]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Sample pictures of the Mr. Cucumber task. The first slide displayed colored stickers (as shown in the figure on the left). Following that, a second slide showed a picture of Mr. Cucumber with numbers and letters covering the original positions of the stickers (as shown in the figure on the right). Children were instructed to recall and indicate the position of all the stickers by reading the corresponding number or letter aloud. In this example the correct response would be F, 8, 9 (provided in any order).

To accommodate the larger number of positions on the picture, both numbers and letters were used. The inclusion of letters was necessary to prevent exceeding double‐digit numbers due to space limitations on the picture. According to the Kindergarten Education Curriculum Guide in Hong Kong (Curriculum Development Council,), K3 children should be generally capable of understanding the English alphabet and simple English words, as well as be able to count and write from 1 to 20. To ensure clarity and minimize confusion caused by the screen display (e.g. "8" and "B"), we carefully selected additional alphabet characters (specifically, "A", "C", "D", "F", and "H") that are easily distinguished from single‐digit numbers (i.e. "1" to "9"). Each level included three trials, and if the child recalled inaccurately in all three trials within the same level, the task was terminated. Scores were assigned based on accuracy. A score of 1 was given for two or three accurate recalls within a level, and a score of 0.33 was given for one accurate recall beyond that level. The total scores were calculated by summing scores for all trials as an index of working memory.

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^9eb2b09b]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

We used this sensitive approach to examine in first graders whether neural responses specific to single letters (LETT) and digits (DIG) could already be elicited, when inserted in streams of the other category. This direct contrast allowed to obtain specific responses for letters within streams of digits (hereafter: dig‐LETT) and vice‐versa (hereafter: lett‐DIG).

If letters and digits already elicit specialized neural processes at 6 years of age, we should observe responses at the frequency of the categorical change. For dig‐LETT, we expected a left‐lateralized posterior response, as letters are visual objects learnt directly in association with phonological codes and trigger connections between anterior phonological and posterior visual regions (Phonological Mapping Hypothesis, Maurer & McCandliss, 2007). For lett‐DIG we anticipated a right response lateralization, given the previous findings on adults (Park et al. 2017, 2014) and the potential link with lateralization for numerical competencies heavily relying on the right IPS (rIPS; Cantlon, Brannon, Carter, & Pelphrey, 2006; Vogel, Goffin, & Ansari, 2015)

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^b8be0052]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Disparity in digit expression profiles

To characterize the gene expression profiles of digits in pentadactyl amniote limbs, we sequenced RNA of developing digits and their associated posterior interdigital mesenchyme from the forelimbs of mouse, green anole (Anolis), and American alligator (Fig. 1a). In each of these species, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptomes shows a weak signal of sample clustering by digit (Supplementary Fig. 1). The strongest signals of digit-specific expression profiles are observed in D1 of mouse and D4 of the alligator. Groupings of the other digit samples are not well supported. We hypothesized that this result might imply that any signal of gene expression differentiation among digits is overwhelmed by noise when all genes are considered, because most genes are likely irrelevant to the developmental identity of digits. If such a signal exists, we predict that it will be reflected preferentially in the expression of transcription factor and signaling genes. Therefore, we again performed HCA and PCA on the samples of each species, this time using two gene lists: a curated set of known limb patterning genes that are sensitive to Shh signaling (N = 159), and transcription factor genes (N = 2183).

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^9924fbe3]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The anterior-most digit (D1) (e.g. human thumb) appears to have a distinct developmental identity in amniotes as compared with the more posterior digits (D2–D5). D1 is marked by a unique gene expression profile — low expression of HoxD11 and HoxD12 and high expression of Zic3 relative to other digits – — and it appears able to develop independently of Shh signaling –. In addition, analysis of morphological variation in primates identified a high degree of variational independence of D1 relative to the more posterior digits. Models of posterior digit identity have been proposed according to the relative exposure of limb bud mesenchymal cells to Shh, which emanates from the zone of polarizing activity prior to digit condensation. However, broadly conserved marker genes for individual posterior digits have not been identified in the interdigital mesenchyme, the signaling center that patterns digits. For instance, while the combinatorial expression of Tbx2 and Tbx3 is necessary to generate the phenotypes of D3 and D4 in chicken hindlimb, it is questionable whether these developmental identities are conserved in other species, like mouse, with limited morphological differentiation of the posterior digits.

Debates of digit homology are especially challenging to resolve when limbs have fewer than five digits. This problem has been most actively investigated in the tridactyl avian wing, because of the appearance of a conflict between paleontological and developmental data. The fossil record of theropod dinosaurs shows a clear pattern of reduction of the posterior two digits in the lineage leading to birds, yet digits in the wing have been described as developing in the middle three positions of a pentadactyl developmental ground plan –. To explain this discrepancy, the frame shift hypothesis was proposed. It posited that a homeotic shift occurred in the avian stem such that the developmental programs that were once expressed in D1, D2, and D3 are now executed in the digits that develop in positions D2, D3, and D4, respectively. Comparative analyses of gene expression have found support for this hypothesis: in situ hybridization and transcriptomics have revealed similarity between the anterior digit of the adult avian wing, which develops in position D2, and D1 of other limbs, and cells in the zone of polarizing activity do not contribute to the skeletal tissues of the digits of the adult avian wing, a pattern consistent with digit D1–D3 of other limbs.

### The association of APOE genotype and cognitive decline in interaction with risk factors in a 65–69 year old community sample [^ed76fecc]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Cognitive tests

Speed

Mental speed was measured with the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test, which asks the participant to substitute as many digits for symbols as possible in 90 seconds.

Reaction time (RT)

Reaction time (RT) was tested using a small box held with both hands, with left and right buttons at the top to be depressed by the index fingers. There were four blocks of 20 trials measuring simple reaction time (SRT), followed by two blocks of 20 trials measuring choice reaction time (CRT). Means were calculated after removing outliers. This was done by first eliminating any values under 100 ms or over 3,000 ms. Next, means and standard deviations were calculated for each individual for each block, and values outside three standard deviations from the individual's block mean were eliminated.

Memory

Immediate and delayed recall were assessed with the first trial of the California Verbal Learning Test, which involves recalling a list of 16 nouns. The interval between immediate and delayed recall was occupied by a test of grip strength.

Working memory

Working memory was assessed with the Digits Backwards subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale, which presents participants with series of digits at the rate of one per second and asks them to repeat the digits backwards.

General cognitive impairment

The 11 item Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered primarily for screening purposes. However, the MMSE provides a reliable measure of mental status, covering aspects of cognition (in particular, orientation to time and place) that were not measured by the other cognitive tests.

Cognitive change scores were calculated for each test by subtracting Wave 1 scores from Wave 2 scores.

The thumb is a specialized organ with unique functions that cannot be replicated by any other digit. The most powerful technique for construction of a missing thumb is index finger pollicization. In this article, we outline our technique for index finger pollicization. Over a 30-year period, certain technical refinements have improved the function and appearance of these transposed digits.

### Neural representations of the perception of handwritten digits and visual objects from a convolutional neural network compared to humans [^ff78311b]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

Although we assigned [1,2,3] and [7,8,9] for the grouping of lower and higher digits, the grouping cannot be uniquely determined. Thus, we also constructed the RDMs using other groups of the lower and higher digits from the digit "5" by excluding the digit "0". Now, there were four digits in each of the two groups (i.e. [1,2,3,4] for lower and [6,7,8,9] for higher). Following that, the magnitude RDMs were constructed based on all the 16 combinatorial conditions (i.e. three digits selected for each of the lower and higher magnitude groups), and a subsequent RSA was performed. The resulting 16 RSA maps in each subject were averaged and one‐sample t ‐test was performed using the average RSA maps across the 15 participants, followed by multiple comparison correction. In addition, we also investigated the neural representations of the digit versus object condition using an alternative set of six object classes to evaluate the generalizability of our findings. Please refer to the supplementary materials, "RSA using an alternative set of six objects" for the detailed methods and results.

2.11 Links between the trainedmodel and the visual category/class perception of humans

We examined the potential links between the two RSA perspectives obtained from the CNN model and the visual perception of humans. First, we evaluated the degree of visual perception of humans in the trained CNN model using the cosine similarity between the RDM for each of the CNN layers and the RDM for each visual category/class perception of humans (Figure 1b). We also conducted RSA between the neural RDMs in the ROIs found from the category/class perception codes of humans and the RDM for each layer of the CNN model. Only the dissimilar elements in the RDM (bottom of Figure 1b) that encodes the category/class perception of interest (i.e. across digits, magnitude of digits, across objects, animacy of objects, and digits vs. objects) were used for this RSA. The similarity between the neural RDM in the ROIs and the RDM for each CNN layer was calculated using Spearman's rank correlation ρ. One‐sample t ‐tests were applied to z ‐transformed ρ values across 15 participants for group inference. We averaged positive t ‐scores within each ROI to reveal the relationship between the ROIs representing the visual perception of humans and each of the CNN layers.

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^fa3f11e6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The frame shift hypothesis is an integrative model. It aimed to explain an apparent incongruity between paleontological and neontological data sets by providing a developmental account for evolutionary transformation rooted in a mechanistic model of homology. Our results show that any such integrative model will be more complicated than previously presumed. Moving forward, we recommend systematic reappraisal of phalangeal and metacarpal characters along the avian stem. It has been proposed that patterns of digit reduction in theropods might be more complex than is generally assumed. For example, study of the ceratosaur Limusaurus led to the hypothesis that in basal tetanurans metacarpal characters correspond to identities 2-3-4, while phalanges have identities 1-2-3, although specifically how this taxon informs the plesiomorphic avian condition has been contested. In addition, we recommend continued, broad taxonomic sampling in studies of limb development. Building expanded, comparative data sets will allow for documentation of homoplasy between species and between the fore- and hindlimbs, which could impact hypotheses of digit identity presented here. Sampling should also be extended to earlier timepoints to test for the possibility that developmental identities might be detectable at earlier stages. Finally, additional functional genetic studies are required to understand how digit-specific phenotypes are regulated and to test the hypothesis that CDEGs play privileged roles in establishing gene regulatory states in the interdigital mesenchyme.

The question of how to diagnose the digits of the avian wing is among the oldest in comparative morphology. This study tests several assumptions that underlay many contemporary studies of the homology and developmental identity of digits. Indeed, it is the first to comparatively analyze the full gene expression profiles of digits of different species. Such data, and a willingness to consider hypotheses that previously might have been regarded as heterodox, are required for the testing and refinement of integrative theories on the nature of limbs.

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^6163fb29]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

The emergence of visual cortex specialization for culturally acquired characters like letters and digits, both arbitrary shapes related to specific cognitive domains, is yet unclear. Here, 20 young children (6.12 years old) were tested with a frequency-tagging paradigm coupled with electroencephalogram recordings to assess discrimination responses of letters from digits and vice-versa. One category of stimuli (e.g., letters) was periodically inserted (1/5) in streams of the other category (e.g., digits) presented at a fast rate (6 Hz). Results show clear right-lateralized discrimination responses at 6 Hz/5 for digits within letters, and a trend for left-lateralization for letters. These results support an early developmental emergence of ventral occipito-temporal cortex specialization for visual recognition of digits and letters, potentially in relation with relevant coactivated brain networks.

Hands with supernumerary fingers perform more complex movements. Subplots (a – f) report on analyses of hand movements recorded during manipulation of objects of various shapes. The movement task was carried out by two six- and 13 five-fingered subjects. a Dependency between individual fingers quantified by the mutual information between the movements of pairs of fingers, with a value of 0 indicating complete independence between fingers and positive values an increasing dependency. Note that the mutual information is symmetric, i.e. b The cumulative amount of explained variance of hand movements as a function of an increasing number of principal components. Error bars depict SDs across subjects. c The number of effective dof (computed using the principle components, see Methods) was higher in six-fingered than in five-fingered subjects. d Information entropy of the discretized movements where each finger is either resting, flexing or extending. Entropy is shown for an increasing number of fingers, starting with thumb only ("T") and successively adding one finger (index "I", middle "M", ring "R", little "L" and supernumerary "S"). Dotted lines indicate the theoretically maximum possible entropy for five- and six-fingered hands. e Percentage of times thumb and index finger ("T + I"), thumb only ("T"), index only ("I") were moving when the supernumerary finger moved.

### Neuropsychological test performance of cognitively healthy centenarians: normative data from the Dutch 100-plus study [^20228cd9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychological Tests

The neuropsychological test battery consisted of 15 tests measuring global cognition, premorbid intelligence, attention and/or concentration, language, memory, executive function, and visuospatial function. See supplementary data for more detailed information on properties of these tests. At the start of the study, the test battery was limited to the MMSE and CDT but expanded gradually over the course of the study with tests that allow the evaluation of specific cognitive domains. For this reason, not all centenarians were presented with the same battery or the same number of tests.

The MMSE was used to evaluate global cognition. 21 We addressed premorbid intelligence using the DART, 22, 23, 24 in which subjects are asked to read out loud 50 words with atypical phonemic pronunciation. These words were presented in an enlarged font size to take into account possible visual difficulties. The Digit Span was used to evaluate attention/concentration (forward condition) and working memory (backward condition). 25 The forward condition requires subjects to repeat sequences of digits that increase in length, whereas in the backward condition, sequences of digits have to be repeated in reverse order. We evaluated processing speed and attention using the TMT A, and mental flexibility using the TMT B, which respectively requires subjects to connect dots of numbers in numerical order and alternate between numbers and letters in numerical and alphabetical sequence. 26 If the centenarians were not determined to proceed after 180 seconds (TMT A) and 300 seconds (TMT B), the test was aborted and scores were extrapolated based on the last finished item (number or letter) and the time spent on the test. The Dutch version of the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (naming words from initial letters) and Category fluency (naming animals) were administered to evaluate executive functioning and language, the latter also assessing semantic memory. 27, 28 To evaluate executive functioning, we administered the Key Search subtest of the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome Test Battery 29 involving a problem‐solving task instructing subjects to think of a strategy to find a lost key. Memory was measured with the story recall subtest of the Dutch version of the RBMT and the VAT. 30, 31, 32 The RBMT requires subjects to immediately repeat all items they remember from two stories read out loud, and again after a 15‐minute interval. When necessary, a cue was given for helping them recall the story line, which was considered when calculating the total score. We made two adaptations to the test procedure: (1) two stories were read instead of one to improve reliability; (2) during recall, all remembered items were scored, whether they belonged to the appropriate story line or not. The VAT involves subjects to name two visual items shown in one picture (eg, a hedgehog on a chair), of which one item (hedgehog) needs to be recalled afterwards while the other (the chair without the hedgehog) is used as a cue. We used naming of the items as an additional measure of language functioning. Visuospatial orientation was assessed with the Number Location subtest of the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery, 33 which required subjects to indicate a specific number that corresponded with the exact location of a dot. For evaluating visuospatial construction, subjects were instructed to draw a clock with the hands at 10 past 11 (CDT). Because of common tremors in centenarians, the CDT was offered with a predrawn circle and was scored according to a method that does not consider the drawing of the circle. 34, 35

### Similar somatotopy for active and passive digit representation in primary somatosensory cortex [^f704666c]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2.3 Passive task

In the passive stimulation task, participants were asked to rest their right hand in a comfortable, supine position on a foam support. A trained experimenter used a plastic probe to tap the distal pad of a single digit at a 1 Hz rate, before moving on to the next digit. There were 12 trials (taps) per digit in each digit block before the experimenter moved on to the next digit, and 15 blocks per scan (three per digit). Timing was controlled by audio cues presented to the experimenter over headphones. During the task, participants were shown five white dots on the screen, corresponding to each of the five digits (Figure 1, right). One dot, indicating the stimulated digit, would flash at a rate of 1/s whilst the digit was being stimulated to help participants attend to that digit (note that attention is known to modulate digit representations in SI; Puckett et al.). To promote engagement during the task, double taps were administered randomly (one double‐tap per digit condition in each scan). Participants were asked to indicate when they felt the double taps by pressing a button on a button‐box placed in their left hand.

2.2.4 Digit‐specific clusters localiser

An independent functional localiser was carried out using a traveling wave design task in order to identify digit‐specific clusters used for later analysis. Participants used the same keyboard and visual display as in the active task (see Section 2.2.2). Two separate scans with reverse orders, forward (digit 1‐2‐3‐4‐5) and backward (digit 5‐4‐3‐2‐1) cycles, were used to overcome potential order‐related biases due to the sluggish hemodynamic response (Besle et al.).

In each scan, the cycle was repeated five times continuously with no rest periods in between. Each cycle consisted of five blocks (one per digit) which progressed in either the forward or backwards order of digits. At the start of each block, participants were visually instructed which of their digits to use in the upcoming block (see Figure 1). Eight trials were then completed in which the participant had to move one of their digits eight times at 1 Hz, before the instructions for the next digit was shown. Each scan lasted ~4 min.

### Similar somatotopy for active and passive digit representation in primary somatosensory cortex [^9071107a]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

Scientists traditionally use passive stimulation to examine the organisation of primary somatosensory cortex (SI). However, given the close, bidirectional relationship between the somatosensory and motor systems, active paradigms involving free movement may uncover alternative SI representational motifs. Here, we used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare hallmark features of SI digit representation between active and passive tasks which were unmatched on task or stimulus properties. The spatial location of digit maps, somatotopic organisation, and inter-digit representational structure were largely consistent between tasks, indicating representational consistency. We also observed some task differences. The active task produced higher univariate activity and multivariate representational information content (inter-digit distances). The passive task showed a trend towards greater selectivity for digits versus their neighbours. Our findings highlight that, while the gross features of SI functional organisation are task invariant, it is important to also consider motor contributions to digit representation.

### Neural representation precision of distance predicts children's arithmetic performance [^87c900f6]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Illustration of the task design and decoding procedure. (A) The illustration of the dot pattern comparison procedure. Subjects needed to compare the two numerical stimuli and decide which one was larger. (B) We first divided the data into a training set with 4/5 trials and a test set with the remaining 1/5 trials. In the training phase, the pattern from 4/5 training trials and their actual labels (distance or magnitude) were used to fit a model (set of weights on each voxel). During the testing phase, the test patterns were multiplied by the weight vector to generate predicted labels (which could take on any real value). A 5‐fold cross‐validation was conducted which iteratively left out 1/5 trials. Performance was assessed by computing the correlation between the actual and predicted labels (aggregated across iterations).

During the fMRI scanning, participants viewed centrally presented dot arrays in succession. Participants were instructed to respond with one of the two buttons depending on whether the first or second number was larger; if the first number was larger, then press the leftmost button with the thumb of the left hand, and if the second number was larger, then press the rightmost one with the thumb of the right hand. The button pressed was balanced across trials. The presentation details for each trial were shown in Figure 1.

2.3 Weber Fraction Estimation

The Weber fraction estimated each participant's minimum distinguishable difference between the number of dots and which was also known as the ANS (Approximate number system) acuity. The Weber Fraction score was assessed for 29 subjects using the accuracy (ACC) of the dot comparison task. The percentage correct was modeled for each individual subject as 1 — error rate (Halberda et al.), where the error rate is defined as:where erfc (x) is the complementary error function, which is associated with the integral of the normalized Gaussian distribution. This model describes the percentage of correct responses as a function of the Gaussian approximation of number representations for the two dot sets presented in each trial, namely n 1 and n 2 (i.e. n 1 is the numerosity of the larger set, n 2 is the numerosity of the smaller set), with a single adjustable parameter, the Weber fraction (w).

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^0966e2b5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Overall, data from these four species do not support the hypothesis that amniote digits have conserved developmental identities. The exception appears to be D1, which likely had a distinct developmental program in the most recent common ancestor of amniotes. We further tested whether D1 has a conserved gene expression profile by sequencing RNA from developing human fore- and hindlimb, which were partitioned into D1 and the posterior digital plate (D2–5). Of the ten genes identified above as differentiating D1 and D2, six show conserved patterns of expression change at this position: in all limbs sampled Hand2, Hoxd11, Hoxd12, and Tfap2b are more highly expressed in D2 than D1, and Alx1 and Pax9 are more lowly expressed in D2 than D1 (Fig. 4b).

T-box family genes are predicted to regulate the identities of posterior digits. Our data provide some support for the hypothesis that this function is conserved across amniotes (Fig. 4c). Tbx2, which was previously shown to regulate posterior digit identity in the chicken hindlimb, shows divergent patterns of expression in the posterior digits of other species. Tbx3 differentiates D3 from D4 in mouse, alligator, and chicken hindlimb, and the likelihood that it was recovered by chance alone is 7.2 × 10–6 (binomial test); however, it is not differentially expressed at this position in Anolis forelimb. Tbx15 differentiates D4 from D5 among pentadactyl limbs (Fig. 3), and the likelihood that it was recovered by chance alone is 1.9 × 10–5 (binomial test).

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^876349c9]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Total serum IgE assays — reporting, standardization, applications, and assay performance — are reported in international units or nanograms per milliliter (1 IU/mL = 2.44 ng/mL), and total IgE is cross-standardized with the WHO 75/502 human reference IgE serum verified by periodic proficiency surveys. Clinical applications are of modest value; high serum IgE concentrations occur in allergic bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA), with therapeutic response evaluated by serial IgE values, and total serum IgE is required for assessing the suitability of a patient for omalizumab therapy and determining the initial dose. For most commercial methods, total serum IgE determinations should be accurate to 2 significant digits and the coefficient of variation for repeated assays should be less than 10%, and interlaborational coefficients of variation should remain less than 20% when assay parallelism is maintained. A technical issue, the hook effect, describes samples with very high total IgE that produce results identical to those of samples with much lower IgE; to avoid this, some laboratories assay samples at 2 dilutions expecting the more dilute sample to be quantitatively lower, and if not, the sample needs to be rediluted and reassayed until appropriate dilution is clear.

### Children exhibit superior memory for attended but outdated information compared to adults [^21c9141e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Sample trial sequence in Experiment 1.

The questions were presented in Chinese and the translations were: (1) location question: Press a corresponding number to indicate the location of target letter; (2) identity surprise question: This is a surprise memory test! Which one of following four letters is the one that you had just seen? Press a corresponding number (5–8) to indicate its identity. The corresponding numbers (1–4) in the location task were pre-defined and replaced by four placeholders during the experiment. The adults read the question and responded by pressing corresponding keys, whereas children were asked by the experimenter and made verbal responses.

The results are shown in Table 1. The location report accuracy on the pre-surprise trials for adults and children were 99% and 94% respectively, indicating that both adults and children could accurately locate the target letter presented among the distractor numbers. For the question in the surprise trial, only 10 of 20 (50% correct) adults correctly reported the identity of the target letter, which was significantly worse than the accuracy in the first control trial (50% vs. 90%), χ 2 (1, N = 40) = 7.619, p = 0.006, φ = 0.436. As a contrast, 16 of 20 (80% correct) children correctly reported the identity of the target letter, which showed no statistically significant difference from that in the first control trial (80% vs. 65%), χ 2 (1, N = 40) = 1.129, p = 0.288, φ = 0.168, BF 10 = 0.572; as well as from that in the following control trials (80% vs. 80%; 80%; 95%), χ 2 (1, N = 40) ≤ 2.057, p s ≥ 0.151, φ ≤ 0.227, BF 10 ≤ 0.631. Importantly, children performed significantly better than adults in reporting the identity of the target letter (80% vs. 50%), χ 2 (1, N = 40) = 3.956, p = 0.047, φ = 0.314. Notably, as both adults and children had to attend to and use the target identity to locate the target in this task set, this finding indicated that children had not yet developed the ability of memory selection for the attended yet outdated information.

### Is the control of applied digital forces during natural five-digit grasping affected by carpal tunnel syndrome? [^9eb94552]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The impaired sensory function of the hand induced by carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is known to disturb dexterous manipulations. However, force control during daily grasping configuration among the five digits has not been a prominent focus of study. Because grasping is so important to normal function and use of a hand, it is important to understand how sensory changes in CTS affect the digit force of natural grasp.

We therefore examined the altered patterns of digit forces applied during natural five-digit grasping in patients with CTS and compared them with those seen in control subjects without CTS. We hypothesized that the patients with CTS will grasp by applying larger forces with lowered pair correlations and more force variability of the involved digits than the control subjects. Specifically, we asked: (1) Is there a difference between patients with CTS and control subjects in applied force by digits during lift-hold-lower task? (2) Is there a difference in force correlation coefficient of the digit pairs? (3) Are there force variability differences during the holding phase?

Methods

We evaluated 15 female patients with CTS and 15 control subjects matched for age, gender, and hand dominance. The applied radial forces (Fr) of the five digits were recorded by respective force transducers on a cylinder simulator during the lift-hold-lower task with natural grasping. The movement phases of the task were determined by a video-based motion capture system.

Results

The applied forces of the thumb in patients with CTS (7 ± 0.8 N; 95% CI, 7.2–7.4 N) versus control subjects (5 ± 0.8 N; 95% CI, 5.1–5.3 N) and the index finger in patients with CTS (3 ± 0.3 N; 95% CI, 3.2–3.3 N) versus control subjects (2 ± 0.3 N; 95% CI, 2.2–2.3 N) observed throughout most of the task were larger in the CTS group (p ranges 0.035–0.050 for thumb and 0.016–0.050 for index finger). In addition, the applied force of the middle finger in patients with CTS (1 ± 0.1 N; 95% CI, 1.3–1.4 N) versus the control subjects (2 ± 0.2 N; 95% CI, 1.9–2.0 N) during the lowering phase was larger in CTS group (p ranges 0.039–0.050). The force correlations of the thumb-middle finger observed during the lowering phase in the patients with CTS (0.8 ± 0.2; 95% CI, 0.6–0.9) versus the control subjects (0.9 ± 0.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.0; p = 0.04) were weaker in the CTS group. The thumb-little finger during holding in the patients with CTS (0.5 ± 0.2; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7) versus the control subjects (0.8 ± 0.2; 95% CI, 0.6–0.9; p = 0.02), and the lowering phase in the patients with CTS (0.6 ± 0.2; 95% CI, 0.3–0.8) versus the control subjects (0.9 ± 0.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.0; p = 0.01) also were weaker. The force variabilities of patients with CTS were greater in the CTS group than in the control subjects: in the thumb ([0.26 ± 0.11 N, 95% CI, 0.20–0.32 N] versus [0.19 ± 0.06 N; 95% CI, 0.16–0.22 N], p = 0.03); index finger ([0.09 ± 0.07 N; 95% CI, 0.05–0.13 N] versus [0.05 ± 0.03 N; 95% CI, 0.04–0.07 N], p = 0.03); middle finger ([0.06 ± 0.04 N; 95% CI, 0.04–0.08 N] versus [0.03 ± 0.01 N; 95% CI, 0.02–0.04 N], p = 0.02), and ring finger ([0.04 ± 0.03 N; 95% CI, 0.20–0.06 N] versus [0.02 ± 0.01 N; 95% CI, 0.02–0.02 N], p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Patients with CTS grasped with greater digit force associated with weaker correlation and higher variability on specific digits in different task demands. These altered patterns in daily grasping may lead to secondary problems, which will need to be assessed in future studies with this model to see if they are reversible in patients undergoing carpal tunnel release.

Clinical Relevance

The current results helped to identify altered patterns of grasping force during simulated daily function in patients with CTS and to provide the clinician with potential information that might help guide the rehabilitation of grasp in these patients.

### Bidirectional associations between cognitive functions and walking performance among middle-aged women [^a830242a]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Cognition

Executive functions were assessed with the Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B and a verbal fluency test (VF). In TMT A, which assesses psychomotor speed, participants were instructed to combine numbers 1 and 2 and so on until number 25 as quickly as possible. Part B assesses the ability to shift attention between two tasks. In this part, participants were instructed to combine number 1 and letter A and letter A and number 2 and so on with a line as quickly as possible. The time (s) to complete part A and B was measured with a stopwatch. In VF, which assesses the ability to update and monitor working memory representations (updating), participants were asked to name as many animals as possible in 1 minute. The total number of named animals was taken as the result. Working memory was assessed with the digit span test and word list test. In the digit span test, participants were asked to repeat the extended number sequences after the examiner, first forwards and then backwards, for as long as they were able to remember the sequence. The scores (one point per correctly remembered sequence) of the two tasks were summed. In the word list test, participants were asked to repeat as many words as they could remember from a list of 12 words read aloud by the examiner. The test was repeated four times. After at least 15 minutes, participants were asked to first recall and then recognize all the words that they could remember from the list of words. Finally, the number of words remembered and recalled of all lists was calculated as total scores. Visual memory was assessed with Family Pictures. In this test, participants were asked to remember details of four pictures of family members in different situations. All four pictures were shown to the participants at 10-second intervals. After seeing all the pictures, they were asked to recall which family members were in a specific picture, what were they doing and where they were located in the pictures. After at least 15 minutes, participants were asked to recall the same details without seeing the pictures again. The test was scored according to the number of recalled details.

### Association of prenatal depression with second to fourth digit ratio in children aged 4 and 6 years [^6d42ed6f]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

5. Conclusions

In this prospective cohort study, we observed that prenatal depressive symptoms were associated with an increased 2D:4D digit ratio in offspring of both sexes at 4 and 6 years of age. Dose–response relationships were found with regard to both the strength and duration of depressive symptoms. Our study suggests that prenatal depressive symptoms may perturb the reproductive development of offspring and predominantly exhibit a feminizing effect. Our findings advocate an increased focus on screening and intervention for prenatal depressive symptoms to potentially mitigate the long-term effects on offspring reproductive health.

### Functional annotation of enzyme-encoding genes using deep learning with transformer layers [^1913132d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Error bars, mean ± SD (n = 3 independent experiments). Black circles represent each data point. Source data are provided as a Source data file.

To validate the ability of DeepECtransformer in identifying metabolic functions that cannot be detected by DeepEC and Swiss-Prot functional annotation processes, we performed in vitro enzyme assays to validate the predicted enzyme functions. We first selected three representative EC number classes, namely oxidoreductase (EC:1), transferase (EC:2), and hydrolase (EC:3) to show the capability of DeepECtransformer to predict unknown enzyme functions. Among the 295 proteins that are exclusively predicted by DeepECtransformer to have all four digits of EC numbers, 179 proteins are predicted to be soluble in E. coli by NetSolP, a deep learning model for protein solubility prediction. From the 179 proteins, we randomly selected three proteins, YgfF, YciO, and YdjM, that are predicted to be oxidoreductase, transferase, and hydrolase, respectively. For YgfF, DeepECtransformer predicted its EC number to be EC:1.1.1.47 (glucose 1-dehydrogenase). The enzyme assay results showed that YgfF exhibited a specific glucose 1-dehydrogenase activity of 305.55 U mg −1 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1), which was comparable to the previously reported value of 205.70 U mg −1 for the glucose 1-dehydrogenase from Lysinibacillus sphaericus G10. In the case of YciO, which was previously annotated to belong to the SUA5 family, DeepECtransformer predicted its EC number to be EC:2.7.7.87 (L-threonylcarbamoyladenylate synthase) with the prediction score of 0.9108. The specific activity of YciO was measured to be 0.0705 U mg −1 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1), which was higher than the previously reported specific activity range of L-threonylcarbamoyladenylate synthase (0.00556–0.01112 U mg −1) from Bacillus subtilis. Lastly, YjdM was predicted by DeepECtransformer to have the EC number EC:3.11.1.2 (phosphonoacetate hydrolase). The specific phosphonoacetate hydrolase activity of YjdM obtained by enzyme assay was 139.85 U mg −1 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1), which exceeded the specific activity of phosphonoacetate hydrolase (60 U mg −1) from Pseudomonas fluorescens 23F. We also analyzed whether the EC number predictions for these three enzymes were made by the neural network or by the homology search. First, YgfF was predicted to have an EC number of EC:1.1.1.47 by the neural network with a prediction score of 0.6331. It should be noted that although YgfF exhibited a higher sequence identity with a different enzyme (A0A069CGU9_ECOLX; EC:1.1.1.100) from the training dataset than glucose 1-dehydrogenase exhibiting the maximum sequence identity within the training dataset, the neural network made an accurate prediction. Likewise, for YjdM, predicted by the neural network as EC:3.11.1.2 with a prediction score of 0.6103, the training sequence with the highest sequence similarity had a different EC number (C9Y1B8_CROTZ; EC:2.7.7.6). Lastly, the predicted EC number for YciO by the neural network was EC:3.1.11.2 with a prediction score of 0.9108, and the training sequence with the highest sequence identity with YciO was also a L-threonylcarbamoyladenylate synthase (EC:3.1.11.2). To examine whether the neural network understands the functional regions of YciO rather than relying on the sequence identity, the motifs with high attention scores were analyzed. It was found that the highlighted motifs correspond to TIGR00057, a NCBIfam family for L-threonylcarbamoyladenylate synthase (Supplementary Fig. 13). These results suggest that DeepECtransformer leverages not only homology search but employs latent features learned during the training process during the prediction of EC numbers. Notably, DeepEC was unable to provide predictions for the three proteins, likely due to its low recall associated with predicting enzyme functions, stemming from a highly imbalanced dataset. Also, Swiss-Prot functional annotation failed to make predictions for the three proteins, possibly due to the limited sequence identity shared between the y-ome proteins and protein signatures available in existing databases. These results suggest that DeepECtransformer can effectively contribute to the discovery of metabolic functions of enzymes that have yet to be fully characterized.

### Distributed functional connectivity predicts neuropsychological test performance among older adults [^79e1903f]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2.2 KSHAP neuropsychological test

To test the generalizability of the predictive model, we identified eight homologous neuropsychological tests included in the KSHAP dataset. Similarity and correspondence of administration procedures and contents were scrutinized. For the attention and working memory, Digit Span Forward, and Digit Span Backward tests included in the Elderly Memory disorder Scale (Chey, 2007) were available. The score was the sum of all correct trials were counted from 2 to 8 lengths of digits. The category fluency test asked participants to generate words from the two semantic categories (i.e. animal and supermarket) each within a minute (Kang, Chin, Na, Lee, & Park, 2000; Kang, Jang, & Na, 2012). While interference condition of the original Trail Making Test in UDSNB asks to alternate between numbers and alphabets (Reitan & Wolfson, 1993), modified Trail Making Test (mTMT) asked to alternate between numbers and symbols (triangle and rectangle) to minimize the floor effect of illiterate elderly (M. Park & Chey, 2003; Seo et al. 2006). The mTMT Part A (Trail A) consisted of 15 consecutively numbered circles arranged randomly on a sheet of paper. Participants were asked to draw a line between the circles in ascending order as quickly as possible. In mTMT Part B, they were asked to draw between triangles and squares alternately. In mTMT Part C (Trail C), participants consecutively connected lines between 8 numbers (ascending order) and 7 shapes (triangle and square) in an alternating way (1 – △ – 2 – □ – 3 – △…). Total time consumed to complete the mTMT‐A and mTMT‐C were used in the analysis, and mTMT‐B was not used in the analysis due to the variability in the possible trail options. A few participants exceeded the typical time limit of mTMT‐A (150 s, n = 1) and mTMT‐C (300 s, n = 7), but a maximum of 300 and 600 s, respectively, were allowed to finish the task due to the participants' unskilled usage of pencil. Total time (s) to complete the lines were log‐transformed and inversed. The Story Recall Test included in the Elderly Memory disorder Scale was used to assess episodic memory function. The Story Recall Test consisted of one story modified from the Logical Memory subtest in WMS‐III into a more culturally familiar content (An & Chey, 2004). The SRT required subjects to recall a paragraph containing 24 semantic units and the delayed recall subtests were administered 15–30 min after the immediate recall session.

### An unusual case of preaxial polydactyly of the hands and feet: a case report [^9a4ad7de]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

An unusual case of polydactyly of the hands and feet is described. The ulnar 4 digits of both hands and the outer 4 digits of both feet appeared normal, and the extra digits were on the radial side of the hands and on the medial side of the feet. The pattern of polydactyly did not fit any of the well-known deformities associated with radial digital duplication such as thumb polydactyly, mirror hand, or duplicated (multiple) hands. The harmonious deformities of the hands and feet suggest a genetic alteration to the development of all 4 limb buds, but the case did not fit any of the known syndromes that have high-level preaxial digital duplication of the hands and feet.

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^d06a293a]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Our analyses show that patterns of regulatory gene expression in digits are evolutionarily dynamic (Fig. 7a). The developmental identities of digits are evolving across amniotes and can be lineage-specific. The exception is a conserved developmental identity that characterizes the D1 of mouse, alligator and Anolis forelimbs, chicken hindlimb, and human fore- and hindlimbs (Fig. 4b). This digit identity is unlikely to be an edge effect (i.e. merely a corollary to which digit occupies the most-anterior position in a limb). In the rabbit hindlimb, which has lost the digit D1, this developmental identity is not observed in D2, despite that digit now occupying the anterior-most position in the limb. In addition, in the hindlimb of Silkie chicken mutants, which have additional anterior digit on their foot, developmental identity is preserved in the digit of the morphology of the native D1, despite that digit no longer occupying the anterior-most position in the limb.

The evolution of digit gene expression in amniotes is highly dynamic. a A phylogeny of the taxa sampled by this study and schematic graphs summarizing the relative similarity of digits within limbs, where connections and line thickness reflect degree of similarity in gene expression profiles. b Schematic of a limited frame shift model for evolutionary origin of the avian wing in which the developmental identity of D1 was translocated to position D2.

In contrast to D1, we do not find support for conserved digit identities in the more posterior digits. Among the pentadactyl limbs we studied, no genes consistently distinguish the median digits (D2, D3, and D4) from one another. And when we consider the chicken hindlimb rather than Anolis, because similarity among Anolis digits might be secondarily derived, we find no gene differentiates D2 and D3, and only one gene (Tbx3) differentiates D3 and D4. There is limited evidence for a conserved developmental identity for digit D5. A single gene (Tbx15) is differentially expressed between D4 and D5 among mouse, alligator and Anolis, however more genes are shared between just mouse and alligator (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4b).

### Similar somatotopy for active and passive digit representation in primary somatosensory cortex [^6e9001f5]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

3.2.1 Somatotopic index

We examined whether the classical hallmark of S1 organisation, the somatotopic gradient, is manifested similarly following passive versus active stimulation by correlating an index of digit preference with position along the central sulcus using circular correlation (see Section 2.6.2). This did not result in a significant group difference between the passive and active task (mean r passive :.63; mean r active :.71; t (14) = .655, p = .523, BF = 1.86). Coarse somatotopic organisation was, therefore, not different between the two tasks.

3.2.2 Neighbourhood relationships analysis

We next examined activity level profiles for different digits within and across our digit‐specific clusters to investigate whether the activity patterns followed similar somatotopic neighbourhood relationships between tasks. Note that this was conducted within digit‐specific clusters created using the independent localiser (see Section 2.5.2 and example in Figure 3a). As a reminder, the term 'target digit' refers to activity resulting from touch/movement of a single digit within its own digit‐specific cluster.

First, we wanted to confirm that digit 'selectivity' — with respect to the identity of the digit‐specific cluster — was found for both tasks. Selectivity is defined here as maximal activity in response to touch/ movement of a target digit within its own digit‐specific cluster. This was generally identified for both the active (69/75 winner‐takes‐all 'hits') and passive tasks (70/75 hits; see Table 1).

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^bac8604c]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

Method

Participants

Twenty first‐grade children (10 males, M age = 6.12 years; range = 5.11–7.03 years) with normal or corrected‐to‐normal vision, were tested after parents gave their written informed consent for a study approved by the Ethical Committee of the Catholic University of Louvain. Participants were recruited from two different schools in Brussels, and had been enrolled in French‐speaking school since kindergarten. Three participants were excluded because of abnormal scores in more than two behavioral assessments in the screening battery for general cognitive functions and reading (Table 1). Ethnicity of children was as follows: 8 Caucasian, 10 Arabic, 2 African (Table 1 for demographic information, typical of this area).

Table 1
Descriptive Statistics for Demographic Characteristics and Tests of General Cognitive Functions and Reading (N = 17)

EEG Testing Stimuli

The nine possible Arabic digits (excluding 0) were presented in five different fonts (Figure 1). Nine upper‐case letters were chosen to match digits visually (overall shape and/or number of strokes) and were also presented in five different fonts (Figure 1). These fonts were used to maximize variability among the stimuli of a given category, in order to ensure that any selective response reflects generalization beyond specific visual features. Final images were resized to 236 × 236 pixels. At a distance of 1 m, displayed with an 800 × 600 pixel resolution, the average size was 6 × 6 degrees of visual angle. Images were presented at the center of the screen with no immediate repetition of the same stimulus.

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^6bf3f84c]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

The emergence of visual cortex specialization for culturally acquired characters like letters and digits, both arbitrary shapes related to specific cognitive domains, is yet unclear. Here, 20 young children (6.12 years old) were tested with a frequency‐tagging paradigm coupled with electroencephalogram recordings to assess discrimination responses of letters from digits and vice‐versa. One category of stimuli (e.g. letters) was periodically inserted (1/5) in streams of the other category (e.g. digits) presented at a fast rate (6 Hz). Results show clear right‐lateralized discrimination responses at 6 Hz/5 for digits within letters, and a trend for left‐lateralization for letters. These results support an early developmental emergence of ventral occipito‐temporal cortex specialization for visual recognition of digits and letters, potentially in relation with relevant coactivated brain networks.

### The big finger: the second to fourth digit ratio is a predictor of sporting ability in women [^db9c6e54]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The second to fourth finger length ratio (2d:4d) is thought to be related to diverse traits including cognitive ability, disease susceptibility, and sexuality.

Objective

To examine the relationship between 2d:4d and sports ability in women.

Methods

Hand radiographs from 607 women (mean age 54 years) were used to estimate 2d:4d. Ranking of sports ability was on a scale (1–5).

Results

The highest achieved level of participation in any sport was significantly negatively associated with 2d:4d (b = -4.93, p = 0.01) as was the relationship between 2d:4d and running level (b = -6.81, p = 0.034). Ability in other sports also showed a negative relationship albeit non-significant.

Conclusions

These results suggest that a low 2d:4d ratio is related to increased female sports ability. It can be postulated that this ratio may predict potential sports ability. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning this relationship may give important insights into musculoskeletal fitness, health and disease.

3.3 Multivariate representational structure is comparable between tasks but information content is higher in the active task

Next, we used RSA to examine the multivariate representational structure of the hand (RSA; Ejaz et al; Nili et al.). Figure 5a shows the inter‐digit distance matrices (RDMs) calculated for the active and passive tasks, based on the (unthresholded) activity patterns across the entire SI hand mask. Greater distances indicate larger differences in multivariate representation.

The colour bars indicate dissimilarity, such that hotter colours indicate greater dissimilarity across digit pairs. Please note, different scales have been used for the active and passive RDMs to allow comparability of the pattern of inter‐digit relationships which is obscured when the same scale is used (as the active task produced significantly greater dissimilarity overall, see Section 3.3). (b) 2D depiction of the data in (a), using multidimensional scaling (MDS).

### Spatial acuity after digit amputation [^33958c91]. Brain (2002). Low credibility.

Digit amputation in human and non-human primates results in reorganization of somatosensory cortex in which the representations of adjacent, intact digits expand to fill the cortical region previously devoted to the amputated digits. Whether this expanded representation results in improved sensory performance has not been determined. Consequently, we measured the ability to recognize small objects (raised letters) with a digit adjacent to the amputation and the same digit on the normal, contralateral hand in 15 amputees. The same digits were also tested in 15 age-matched, amputation-free subjects. There was no significant difference in recognition scores between digits in the amputees or between amputees and control subjects. More detailed analyses of specific confusion patterns and of the improvement with practice showed no significant differences. As far as we could determine, the cortical expansion that is presumed to accompany digit amputation had no effect on tactile pattern recognition performance.

### Digit distribution of proper digital nerve action potential [^9b1181ae]. Muscle & Nerve (2001). Low credibility.

Antidromic sensory nerve action potential testing is well characterized and commonly used to assess the sensory component of the upper limb median and ulnar nerves. The final terminal segments of these nerves are the proper digital nerves. Ring recording electrodes are commonly used to detect the proper digital nerves' antidromic responses. Attempts to record the separate contributions of individual digital nerves along the lateral aspects of each finger, using small surface electrodes, is shown to be unreliable for determining the integrity of a single terminal digital branch. We found between 50% to 77% of the stimulated terminal branch's response amplitude when recorded at electrodes positioned over the nonstimulated branch located 180 degrees from the activated terminal branch. Detecting a single terminal nerve response was achieved by using the fourth digit and the second digit with one of the second digit's branches neurophysiologically blocked by local anesthetic. The volume-conducted response from the opposite side of the finger resulted in this relatively large recorded response, which remains within the range of reference values precluding the simple use of antidromic techniques to assess injury to a single proper digital nerve. Techniques are proposed to avoid such pitfalls and to assess most accurately the desired response.

### The measure of a man: associations between digit ratio and disordered eating in males [^a1d3507b]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The current study sought to determine whether there is a relationship between prenatal testosterone exposure, as indicated by the digit ratios of the second to fourth fingers (2D:4D ratio), and disordered eating and drive for muscularity in men.

Method

Digit ratios were calculated by measuring photocopies of participants' finger lengths. Self-reported body image and eating attitudes and behaviors were assessed.

Results

There were significant correlations between 2D:4D ratio and disordered eating and drive for leanness, indicating that greater prenatal testosterone exposure was associated with less disordered eating and increased drive for muscularity.

Discussion

This suggests that greater prenatal testosterone exposure may be protective factor against the development of eating disorders in men. Potential mechanisms are discussed.

### Reversal of subjective temporal order due to arm crossing [^d8e9a585]. Nature Neuroscience (2001). Medium credibility.

How does the brain order successive events? Here we studied whether temporal order of two stimuli delivered in rapid succession, one to each hand, is determined before or after the stimuli are localized in space. When their arms were crossed, subjects could accurately report the temporal order, even when the interval between stimuli was as short as 70 ms. In most trials, subjects could also judge temporal order when their arms were crossed, but only if given adequate time (> 1 s). At moderately short intervals (< 300 ms), crossing the arms caused misreporting (that is, inverting) of the temporal order. Thus, at these intervals, the determining factor of temporal order was the spatial location of the hands. We suggest that it is not until the spatial locations of the hands are taken into account that the cutaneous signals from the respective hands are ordered in time.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^77ed6480]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Population proportions of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people — school- and survey-based estimates in youth and comparative adult ranges — show low single-digit prevalence that varies by definition. Reported estimates include 1.9% TGD overall (0.7% transgender; 1.2% nonbinary) using a three-question instrument; among high school surveys, 1.2% TGD and 2.5% unsure in over 8,000 New Zealand students, 2.7% TGD in nearly 81,000 Minnesota students, and in the 2017 US Youth Risk Behavior Survey 1.8% "Yes, I am transgender" and 1.6% "I am not sure if I am transgender" among nearly 120,000 participants. A 2015 Florida/California survey of just over 6,000 grades 9–12 students using a "high gender-nonconforming" definition reported 13% among assigned male at birth (AMAB) students, 4% among assigned female at birth (AFAB) students, and 8.4% overall. In younger students from San Francisco public middle schools (grades 6–8; age 11–13 years), 2,700 were surveyed, Thirty-three self-identified as TGD, and the resulting proportion was 1.3%. Across study designs, health system–based studies using diagnostic codes report markedly smaller proportions than survey-based findings, and when surveys ask specifically about "transgender" identity, estimates range 0.3% to 0.5% among adults and 1.2% to 2.7% in children/adolescents, whereas broader gender diversity definitions yield higher proportions of 0.5% to 4.5% among adults and 2.5% to 8.4% among children/adolescents.

BEFORE YOU START TAKING YOUR PILLS

DECIDE WHAT TIME OF DAY YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR PILL.

It is important to take it at about the same time every day.
LOOK AT YOUR PILL PACK TO SEE IF IT HAS 28 PILLS.

Your tablet dispenser consists of a case and a pill pack containing 28 pills. They are arranged in four numbered rows with the days of the week printed above them. The 28-pill pack has 21 "active" pink pills (with hormones) to take for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of reminder white pills (without hormones). To remove a pill, press down on it with the flat of your finger. The pill will drop through a hole in the bottom of the dispenser.

### Finger counting training enhances addition performance in kindergarteners [^1dd652fd]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Out of the 328 children involved in this first experiment, there were more children who spontaneously used their fingers in an addition task (N = 197) than children who did not use their fingers at all (N = 131). As it is obvious from Figure 5 and in replication to previous studies (e.g. Dupont‐Boime & Thevenot; Jordan et al.), finger users at pre‐test presented a higher percentage of correctly solved additions (i.e. 84.1%) than non‐finger users (i.e. 38.1%). As predicted, the strategy massively used spontaneously by children was the "ALL" strategy (Table 1), the one we taught to children.

As already stated and supported by a higher increase in finger counting after the training program in the experimental than in the control group, we show in this first experiment that it is possible to teach the "ALL" strategy to kindergartners. In fact, almost 75% of the children who did not count on their fingers at pre‐test responded positively to our training or, in other words, used finger counting during the immediate post‐test (massively using the strategy taught). Moreover, we established here that our training program significatively enhanced children's arithmetic skills because the increase in performance between pre‐ and post‐test was higher in the experimental group than in the control group. This effect was created by non‐finger users at pre‐test and was even more pronounced when only children who responded positively to the training were considered (+54.1% between pre‐ and post‐test in the percentages of correctly solved additions).

### Photonic neuromorphic computing using symmetry-protected zero modes in coupled nanolaser arrays [^9f51c90e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Results

General principle

The principle of our coupled nanolasers is illustrated in Fig. 1. For illustration purposes, we will focus on an image classification task. Let us consider an image of a handwritten "1" with dimensions I x × I y, where I x and I y represent the number of pixels in the x and y directions, respectively. The input matrix is then reshaped into a one-dimensional column vector, consisting of m = I x × I y elements in total. The input information is subsequently encoded into the pump patterns P through a linear matrix M (p × m), specifically, where p is the total number of cavities on the photonic chip (see the insert below the hidden layer in Fig. 1). Finally, the pump pattern is projected onto the nanolaser array via a spatial light modulator (SLM). The coefficients of M are adjusted such that the optical spectrum — serving as the output layer — exhibits a lasing zero mode (interpreted as a positive response) when the digit "1" is presented. Conversely, for any other handwritten digit, the zero mode remains off, indicating a negative response.

Fig. 1
Schematic of the system.

The input digits are first reshaped into a one-dimensional vector, which is then encoded into a pump pattern through a matrix multiplication. The resulting pattern is projected onto the nanolaser array using a spatial light modulator. The emergence of the zero mode indicates a positive response.

Two key features are at the heart of our architecture. First, the nanolaser array acts as a hidden recurrent nonlinear layer of the optical ANN, enabling the system to tackle classification tasks — including non-convex problems, as will be shown in Sec. "XNOR logic gate". Second, the semiconductor lasers inherently provide a nonlinear activation function through gain saturation, which plays an important role when feature-space boundaries are highly overlapped, as will be presented in Sec. "Binary classification".

### Functional somatotopy of finger representations in human primary motor cortex [^12de3ed3]. Human Brain Mapping (2003). Low credibility.

To assess the degree of fine-scale somatotopy within the hand area of the human primary motor cortex (M1), functional mapping of individual movements of all fingers was performed in healthy young subjects (n = 7) using MRI at 0.8 x 0.8 mm2 resolution and 4 mm section thickness. The experimental design comprised both a direct paradigm contrasting single digit movements vs. motor rest and multiple differential paradigms contrasting single digit movements vs. the movement of another digit. Direct mapping resulted in largely overlapping activations. A somatotopic arrangement was only recognizable when considering the mean center-of-mass coordinates of individual digit representations averaged across subjects. In contrast, differential paradigms revealed more segregated and somatotopically ordered activations in single subjects. The use of center-of-mass coordinates yielded inter-digit distances ranging from 2.0 to 16.8 mm, which reached statistical significance for pairs of more distant digits. For the middle fingers, the functional somatotopy obtained by differential mapping was dependent on the choice of the digit used for control. These results confirm previous concepts that finger somatotopy in the human M1 hand area emerges as a functional predominance of individual digit representations sharing common areas in a distributed though ordered network.
