## Question

Low normal testosterone, low normal LH, high FSH in male azzospermia. Cystic fibrosis negative, Fragile X negative, nomal XY, no Y microdeletion.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a case of azoospermia with low-normal testosterone, low-normal LH, and high FSH, with negative CFTR, Fragile X, 46, XY karyotype, and no Y microdeletion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hormonal pattern and what it implies about testicular function versus hypothalamic-pituitary drive. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis for azoospermia and where this profile fits. Next, I will review the implications of negative genetic testing and what that excludes. After that, I need to check for reversible or treatable contributors and outline next diagnostic steps. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis, prognosis, and management options, including ART and counseling points, with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the hormonal pattern and its physiologic meaning. High FSH with low-normal testosterone and low-normal LH suggests primary testicular failure with impaired spermatogenesis but relatively preserved Leydig cell function, because FSH rises when Sertoli cell function is impaired, whereas LH may be normal or only mildly elevated when Leydig cells can still produce near-normal testosterone despite reduced intratesticular androgen milieu. This aligns with expected profiles in non-obstructive azoospermia due to spermatogenic failure rather than obstruction or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should categorize the azoospermia etiology carefully. With normal semen volume and elevated FSH, obstructive azoospermia becomes less likely, and non-obstructive azoospermia due to impaired sperm production is favored. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism would show low or inappropriately normal gonadotropins, which is not the case here, and androgen resistance would typically show high testosterone with elevated LH, which we do not see either [^112uY5Zj] [^117TBbBt].

> I need to check the implications of the negative genetic tests. Negative CFTR testing makes congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens unlikely, which supports a non-obstructive process. A normal 46, XY karyotype and absence of Y-chromosome microdeletions substantially reduce the likelihood of Klinefelter syndrome and common AZF deletions as causes of azoospermia, though mosaicism or rare variants can still be present and may require consideration if clinical suspicion remains high [^115N5GSY] [^115LjEQF] [^112HmwS4].

> Let me consider the differential beyond common genetic causes. With normal karyotype and no Y microdeletion, idiopathic spermatogenic failure remains the most likely diagnosis, but I should also keep in mind less common entities such as Sertoli cell–only syndrome, maturation arrest, meiotic arrest, or other genetic defects not captured by routine panels. Importantly, some men with unexplained azoospermia harbor bi-allelic mutations causing meiotic arrest, and emerging data suggest that expanded genetic testing may uncover causative variants in a subset of idiopathic cases [^113LQLau] [^116CMHqD].

> Next, I should review reversible or treatable contributors and make sure I am not missing anything. I need to ensure there is no history of exogenous testosterone, anabolic steroids, or other gonadotoxins; testosterone therapy suppresses spermatogenesis and can cause azoospermia, and recovery after cessation is variable, so medication history is critical. I should also confirm no recent febrile illness, radiation, chemotherapy, or significant varicocele on exam, and I should double-check for pituitary or systemic disease if symptoms suggest hypogonadotropic features or hyperprolactinemia, even though the baseline labs here argue against HH [^113VdpqK] [^113BwK6E] [^116VvMTb].

> I will now examine what additional diagnostics are warranted. Even with negative routine genetic testing, guidelines support offering karyotype and Y microdeletion testing in men with azoospermia and elevated FSH or testicular atrophy, and some couples may benefit from expanded genetic panels or exome testing in research or specialized settings. I should also obtain testicular ultrasound to assess testicular size and echotexture, and consider transrectal ultrasound if obstruction is suspected, though the hormonal pattern here makes obstruction less likely. If uncertainty persists, a diagnostic testicular biopsy can distinguish Sertoli cell–only, maturation arrest, or hypospermatogenesis and may allow sperm retrieval for cryopreservation if sperm are found [^115N5GSY] [^115LjEQF] [^112Syf6t] [^113cLaYx].

> Let me synthesize the most likely diagnosis. Given high FSH with low-normal testosterone and low-normal LH, normal karyotype, no Y microdeletion, and negative CFTR, the pattern is most consistent with idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia due to primary testicular spermatogenic failure, likely reflecting intrinsic testicular defects at the germ cell or Sertoli cell level that are not detected by standard genetic panels. This is a common endpoint in a substantial fraction of azoospermic men after exclusion of known causes [^113cLaYx] [^1164YmGZ].

> Now, I should address prognosis and management. Natural conception is unlikely without surgical sperm retrieval, but sperm can often be found with microsurgical testicular sperm extraction, with success rates varying by histology and FSH/testis size. I should counsel that FSH level alone does not reliably predict sperm retrieval, and that micro-TESE offers the best chance of finding focal spermatogenesis for ICSI. Concurrently, I should arrange genetic counseling and consider expanded genetic testing in select cases, and coordinate with a reproductive urologist for ART planning and sperm cryopreservation if sperm are retrieved [^113cLaYx] [^116E2EGX] [^115FXT22].

> But wait, what if I am underestimating the chance of a genetic cause? I should double-check whether any subtle phenotypic clues suggest mosaicism or a disorder of sexual development, and if so, I should broaden genetic evaluation. Although 46, XX SRY-positive sex reversal is rare, it can present with azoospermia and variable testicular volumes, and case-based literature underscores the need to consider expanded genetics when the phenotype and history raise suspicion, even when routine karyotype and Y microdeletion are normal [^111ekzeJ] [^112FZvGS].

> Finally, I need to ensure I am not recommending harmful therapy. Exogenous testosterone should be avoided in men pursuing fertility because it suppresses spermatogenesis; if hypogonadism symptoms are significant, alternatives such as hCG with or without FSH, or a SERM, may be considered in select contexts, but in primary testicular failure these strategies are unlikely to restore spermatogenesis and should not delay ART planning. The focus should remain on micro-TESE and ICSI with appropriate genetic counseling and preimplantation considerations [^111nE9eJ] [^113ErgG2] [^113cLaYx].

---

The pattern of **low-normal testosterone, low-normal LH, and high FSH** in azoospermia with normal XY karyotype and no Y microdeletion indicates **primary testicular failure** (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism) due to **Sertoli cell dysfunction** [^112uY5Zj]. This profile reflects impaired spermatogenesis with intact Leydig cell function, explaining the near-normal testosterone and LH, while FSH rises due to loss of inhibin B feedback. The negative CFTR and Fragile X results exclude obstructive and common genetic causes, so the most likely etiology is **idiopathic testicular failure** or **Sertoli cell-only syndrome**. Management should include genetic counseling, testicular biopsy to define histology, and consideration of micro-TESE with ICSI; testosterone therapy is contraindicated if fertility is desired [^113cLaYx] [^111nE9eJ].

---

## Hormonal pattern analysis

- **Testosterone**: Low-normal indicates partial Leydig cell dysfunction but preserved basal androgen production.
- **LH**: Low-normal reflects reduced Leydig cell stimulation despite primary testicular failure.
- **FSH**: Elevated indicates Sertoli cell dysfunction and impaired spermatogenesis, with loss of inhibin B feedback [^113ikDQe].

This pattern is characteristic of **primary testicular failure** with compensated androgen production [^113ikDQe].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Relevance to current case** |
|-|-|-|
| Genetic | - Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) <br/> - Y chromosome microdeletions <br/> - CFTR mutations | - Excluded by normal karyotype and negative Y microdeletion/CFTR testing [^115N5GSY] [^1128Nz4M] |
| Endocrine | - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism <br/> - Hyperprolactinemia <br/> - Thyroid dysfunction | - Excluded by normal gonadotropins and testosterone [^113ikDQe] |
| Obstructive | - Congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens <br/> - Ejaculatory duct obstruction | - Excluded by normal semen volume and negative CFTR [^112uY5Zj] |
| Testicular | - Sertoli cell-only syndrome <br/> - Maturation arrest <br/> - Idiopathic testicular failure | - Most likely given normal karyotype, no Y microdeletion, and hormonal profile [^113cLaYx] |

---

## Pathophysiology

The most likely mechanisms include **Sertoli cell dysfunction** — impaired Sertoli cell function reduces inhibin B, causing FSH elevation despite normal LH — and **idiopathic testicular failure**, in which unexplained primary testicular damage leads to spermatogenic arrest with preserved Leydig cell function [^113ikDQe].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Fertility**: Azoospermia indicates severe spermatogenic failure; natural conception is unlikely without assisted reproduction [^113cLaYx].
- **Testosterone therapy**: Contraindicated if fertility is desired, as it suppresses spermatogenesis [^111nE9eJ].
- **Genetic counseling**: Recommended despite normal karyotype/Y microdeletion due to potential unidentified genetic factors [^113cLaYx].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm azoospermia**: Repeat semen analysis with centrifuged pellet [^113cLaYx].
- **Testicular biopsy**: Define histology (SCO, maturation arrest, hypospermatogenesis) and assess for focal spermatogenesis [^113cLaYx].
- **Extended genetic testing**: Consider panel testing for rare genetic causes if available [^116CMHqD].
- **Testicular ultrasound**: Assess testicular volume and echotexture [^notfound].

---

## Management options

- **Micro-TESE**: Consider for sperm retrieval if focal spermatogenesis is present [^116E2EGX].
- **ICSI**: Required for conception using retrieved sperm [^113cLaYx].
- **Donor sperm**: Alternative if no sperm are retrieved [^117TBbBt].
- **Testosterone therapy**: Only if fertility is not desired, with counseling on risks [^111nE9eJ].

---

## Prognosis

Sperm retrieval rates with micro-TESE vary by histology, with **SCO having the lowest** and **maturation arrest/hypospermatogenesis higher**. Overall, **favorable outcomes** are possible with assisted reproduction, though success depends on testicular histology and female factors [^113cLaYx].

---

The hormonal pattern indicates **primary testicular failure** with compensated androgen production; after excluding genetic and obstructive causes, **idiopathic testicular failure** or **Sertoli cell-only syndrome** is most likely. Management centers on **micro-TESE with ICSI**, with testosterone therapy avoided if fertility is desired [^113cLaYx] [^111nE9eJ].

Introduction

Infertility is one of commonest disorders to afflict young men and women. The evaluation of infertility is initiated typically after 1 yr of failure to conceive.

Diagnostic Evaluation

The couple should be evaluated together to determine whether the problem resides in the male partner, the female partner, or both. The objectives of evaluation are to exclude treatable conditions — gonadotropin deficiency, obstruction, and coital disorders — and identify those who are candidates for assisted reproductive technologies, those who are sterile and should consider adoption or artificial insemination using donor sperm, and those who should undergo genetic screening. All infertile men should undergo several semen analyses according to the World Health Organization manual, as well as measurements of testosterone, LH, and FSH levels. Hormone measurements can help determine whether the patient has gonadotropin deficiency (low testosterone and low or inappropriately normal LH and FSH), primary testicular failure (low testosterone, elevated LH and FSH), spermatogenic failure (normal testosterone and LH, elevated FSH), or androgen resistance (high testosterone, elevated LH). A majority of infertile men have normal testosterone, LH, and FSH levels. Obstruction should be ruled out in azoospermic men with normal testosterone, LH, and FSH levels.

Genetics

Yq microdeletions are the most prevalent cause of spermatogenic failure in men with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia. Infertile men with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia should undergo karyotyping and testing for Yq microdeletions. Men with congenital absence of vas should be tested for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations.

Therapy

Gonadotropin therapy is highly effective in gonadotropin-deficient men. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has emerged as the treatment of choice for idiopathic male factor infertility. However, ICSI is expensive and associated with a higher risk of multiple gestation, low birth weight, preterm delivery, perinatal complications, and chromosome aneuploidy than naturally conceived pregnancies. Men considering ICSI should be offered karyotyping, Yq microdeletion testing, and genetic counseling by counselors experienced in reproductive disorders.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^115GBXcH]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone deficiency — men desiring fertility: Men who are interested in fertility should have a reproductive health evaluation performed prior to treatment (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Men interested in preserving fertility should undergo testicular exam to evaluate testicular size, consistency, and descent and have serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measured to assess reproductive status. Elevated FSH levels in the setting of testosterone deficiency indicate impaired spermatogenesis and clinicians should consider fertility testing, such as semen analysis. Men with severe oligospermia (sperm concentration < 5 million per mL) or non-obstructive azoospermia should be offered reproductive genetics testing consisting of karyotype testing and Y-chromosome analysis for microdeletions, and the management of such patients is best conducted by a reproductive urologist.

### When is azoospermic infertility treatable without intracytoplasmic sperm injection? [^116MiE6r]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Infertility with azoospermia requires a diligent search for reversible factors and treatment to restore natural fertility, even though most cases are due to untreatable primary spermatogenic failure and are destined to require consideration of assisted reproductive treatment (ART) options. Complete clinical and diagnostic evaluation is essential for avoiding both unnecessary ART and overlooking important co-morbidities. Gonadotrophin deficiency is the most treatable cause, resulting from drug effects or congenital or acquired disease, and medical therapy is highly efficacious. A range of uncommon endocrinocrinopathies may also result in reversible azoospermia. Finally, obstructive azoospermia may be surgically remediable in selected cases.

Diagnosis/assessment/evaluation — testing and interpretation: The results from SA should be used to guide management of the patient, and results are of greatest clinical significance when multiple SA abnormalities are present (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should obtain hormonal evaluation including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone for infertile men with impaired libido, erectile dysfunction, oligozoospermia or azoospermia, atrophic testes, or evidence of hormonal abnormality on physical evaluation (Expert Opinion). Azoospermic men should be clinically evaluated to differentiate genital tract obstruction from impaired sperm production initially based on semen volume, physical exam, and FSH levels (Expert Opinion). Karyotype and Y-chromosome microdeletion analysis should be recommended for men with primary infertility and azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (< 5 million sperm/mL) with elevated FSH or testicular atrophy or a presumed diagnosis of impaired sperm production as the cause of azoospermia (Expert Opinion).

### Screening for testosterone deficiency is worthwhile… [^112TrCDn]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Normal physiologic functioning of the testes is mandatory for virilization, male reproduction, and maintenance of lean muscle and bone mass. Testosterone deficiency is caused by inadequate production of serum testosterone and typically results in decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased stamina, depressed mood, and decreased muscle and bone mass. In primary hypogonadism, impaired testosterone production at the level of the testes impedes spermatogenesis, with concomitant elevation of serum gonadotropin levels. Secondary hypogonadism results from disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis with low or normal serum gonadotropin levels. Suspicion of inadequate testosterone production in an aging man warrants a detailed investigation. A growing body of evidence shows a relationship between low serum testosterone levels and the development of chronic disease.

A population-based cohort trial of men 20 to 79 years of age determined that low serum testosterone levels are associated with increased mortality and can predict risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, but not from respiratory diseases. 5 A study of 3, 156 multiethnic men 45 to 84 years of age yielded evidence that the incidences of glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus were inversely correlated with serum total testosterone levels. 6 Data from several studies — including the Study of Health in Pomerania trial, a population-based prospective cohort of 1, 004 men 20 to 79 years of age, and the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, a population-based prospective cohort of 1, 709 men — have demonstrated a relationship between low serum testosterone levels and the risk of metabolic syndrome.

7, 8 These relationships strengthen the argument for screening for testicular hypogonadism in men with risk factors for chronic disease. Although screening targets asymptomatic men, testosterone deficiency is unique because symptoms are not always well defined. This warrants casting a wider net to identify a treatable condition. Symptoms such as depression, fatigue, and inability to perform vigorous activity are related to low testosterone levels, whereas there is an inverse relationship between the number of sexual symptoms and testosterone levels.

Male infertility algorithm — initial evaluation and branching are outlined as follows: One year of failure to conceive if female < 35 years old or if female > 35 years old, 6 months of failure to conceive prompts parallel assessment in which male and female are evaluated in parallel including male reproductive history, with counselling re: post-vasectomy fertility options for post-vasectomy cases. If there is at least one abnormal semen analysis or abnormal male reproductive history, complete male evaluation with history and physical follows; otherwise, primary evaluation/ management of female partner proceeds. Subsequent steps include initial hormonal evaluation (FSH, T), and for azoospermia, to categorize azoospermia with FSH, exam. The algorithm lists options such as genetic testing (karyotype and Y microdeletion), genetic (CF) testing for congenital cases of obstruction, and sperm retrieval or microsurgical reconstruction, and also states to consider diagnostic and therapeutic biopsy if FSH & testicular volume normal but no clinical evidence of obstruction.

### Genetic testing in male infertility-reassessing screening thresholds [^116CMHqD]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Genetic testing in male infertility is an essential part of the process of diagnosis. Genetic abnormalities, such as Y-chromosome microdeletion, chromosomal abnormalities and mutations for cystic fibrosis, can all negatively impact a male's fertility and can be tested for during a fertility evaluation. Both Y-chromosome microdeletion and chromosomal abnormalities increase in prevalence as sperm concentrations decrease, and azoospermic men have the greatest frequency of genetic abnormalities.

Recent Findings

These genetic abnormalities can also be found in oligospermic men; however, on the basis of several recent studies, the prevalence of genetic abnormalities is lower in oligospermic men than previously thought.

Summary

The current screening thresholds are devised from the previously determined prevalences and have not been revised based on the emerging data; thus, in this review of the literature, we will discuss this new evidence and whether screening thresholds should be changed.

Azoospermia definition and clinical differentiation note that azoospermia is defined as the absence of sperm in the ejaculate, including after examination of a centrifuged semen pellet; men with azoospermia and small volume testes, elevated FSH and normal semen volume will typically have NOA, whereas men with normal testis volume (e.g., testis length > 4.6 cm), FSH < 7.6 and/or semen volume < 0.5 or 1.0 mL most likely have obstructive azoospermia, especially if the proximal epididymis is enlarged or the vasa deferentia are absent on exam.

### Male sex reversal syndrome: a disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD) with infertility [^111ekzeJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

46, XX male sex reversal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder where individuals with a 46, XX karyotype present with male phenotypic characteristics despite the absence of an Y chromosome. We report a case of a male in his early 30s, presenting with infertility and azoospermia, with bilateral small testes, but no other sexual dysfunction or any signs of hypovirulisation. His hormonal evaluation revealed hypogonadism with normal gonadotropin levels. Genetic testing showed a 46, XX karyotype with the presence of the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (SRY) gene and microdeletions in the azoospermia factor region, confirming the diagnosis of SRY-positive 46, XX male sex reversal syndrome. As sperm retrieval was not recommended, the couple pursued donor insemination, resulting in conception during the first cycle. The female partner is now in her third trimester of pregnancy. Testosterone replacement therapy was initiated for hypogonadism, and long-term follow-up was recommended for monitoring therapy and neoplastic risk. This case intends to provide an overview focused on improving diagnostic and management strategies for 46, XX male sex reversal syndrome, emphasising the necessity of genetic evaluation for all patients with hypogonadism and azoospermia presenting with infertility, not limited to those with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. It also highlights the critical role of a multidisciplinary approach in the effective management of this condition.

### Male reproductive health in cystic fibrosis [^112HmwS4]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2019). Medium credibility.

The impact of cystic fibrosis (CF) on male reproductive health is profound. The vast majority of men with CF are infertile due to obstructive azoospermia. Multiple factors associated with CF contribute to an increased prevalence of testosterone deficiency, which adversely affects muscle mass, bone density, and quality of life. This article reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of infertility and testosterone deficiency that occur in men with CF. With improving survival of CF patients, these topics are becoming more significant in their clinical care.

Discovery and Validation Cohort

White patients of Caucasian origin were diagnosed with idiopathic or unexplained male infertility, meaning no major factors contributing to impaired fertility had been identified, leading to a unique and highly selected study cohort (unexplained: normozoospermia, idiopathic: abnormal semen parameters). The patients had visited our center from 2010 through 2018 for an infertility workup. To select for male infertility without etiologic factors, we applied the following selection criteria: inclusion of men with FSH greater than or equal to 1 IU/L, total testosterone greater than or equal to 8 nmol/L, bitesticular volume greater than or equal to 20 nmol/L, and total sperm count (TSC) greater than or equal to 1 Mill. sperm/ejaculate. Exclusion criteria included men with karyotype anomalies, azoospermia factor deletions, current or former oncological diseases and/or gonadotoxic treatments, single testis, and female partner infertility. By applying the combination of these criteria, we excluded men with hypogonadotropic/hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. The threshold in TSC of 1 Mill sperm was chosen because of the increasing risk of underlying, undiscovered genetic causes in more severe phenotypes of infertility. For all patients that we included in the study and whose sperm concentration was less than 5 mill/mL, we performed additional genetic testing (karyotype, azoospermia factor deletions) to rule out commonly known genetic factors.

These clinical selection criteria were supplemented by procedural parameters like availability of sufficient DNA (for GWAS or TaqMan PCR, respectively). Selected men for the discovery and validation study were chosen chronologically by their appearance/visit at the Centre of Reproductive Medicine and Andrology (CeRA).

All men provided written informed consent for the evaluation of their clinical data and genetic analysis of the donated DNA samples. The study was carried out in accordance with the protocols approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty and the state medical board (Az. 2017-139-f-S and 2013-255-f-S).

Clinical Workup and Laboratory Analyses

Routine clinical workup included physical examination, ultrasound of the testes, and hormone and semen analysis. Hormone analysis included measurement of FSH, LH, and testosterone. These procedures have been described previously.

Ejaculates were obtained by masturbation after sexual abstinence of 3 to 7 days, at 2 time points, and semen analysis was carried out according to the World Health Organization guidelines.

### Approach to the patient with oligozoospermia [^1149suEW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Male infertility affects 1 in 20 men and is the sole or contributory factor in half of assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs). A reduced sperm density (oligozoospermia) is often accompanied by poor motility and morphology reflecting qualitative and quantitative defects in spermatogenesis. Many reproductive and nonreproductive disorders and treatments may be responsible, but most cases remain unexplained (idiopathic). A thorough evaluation may identify treatable causes and allow natural fertility. Comorbidities more prevalent in infertile men, especially androgen deficiency and testicular cancer, should be sought. Idiopathic spermatogenic disorders are common, but evidence-based treatment is not available; full evaluation informs management and the decision to pursue ART using the low numbers of functional sperm available. Chromosomal anomalies may impact the chance of a normal healthy pregnancy, and new genetic causes of oligozoospermia are being discovered. ART, particularly intracytoplasmic sperm injection, bypasses instead of treats the sperm defect but has dramatically improved the fertility prospects. The clinical approach to the oligozoospermic man involves understanding reproductive endocrinology, aspects of urology and clinical genetics, modern ART options, and the realistic discussion of their outcomes, alternatives such as adoption or donor gametes, and appreciation of the psychosocial concerns of the couple.

A prerequisite for the NNOA and NOA groups was that (m)TESE had been performed, and that histological samples and their respective evaluation were available. To rule out further etiologic factors contributing to the impaired fertility status and having a highly selected group of unexplained/idiopathic men, the following exclusion criteria were applied equally to all 3 groups: genetic pathology (karyotype analysis, Y-chromosome microdeletion, and gene-panel analysis including up to 26 genes known to be causative for azoospermia), oncological disease, and medication affecting spermatogenesis. To exclude men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism we also excluded patients with luteinizing hormone (LH) ≤ 1 IU/L and testosterone ≤ 8 nmol/L. To exclude obstructive origin, men with ejaculate volume less than 1.5 mL and patients with more than 80% elongated spermatids in the testicular histology sample were excluded. We identified (1) 79 infertile men for the study group (NNOA group) with NOA and FSH levels within normal range (1–7 IU/L), (2) 87 infertile men for the azoospermic control group (NOA group) with NOA and upregulated FSH levels (> 7 IU/L), and (3) 88 normozoospermic men for the normozoospermic control (NC) group with a total sperm count ≥ 39 Million (Mio)/ejaculate and physiological FSH serum level (1–7 IU/L) (Fig. 2).

All patients provided written informed consent for the use and evaluation of the clinical data and biopsy samples. The study was carried out in accordance with the protocols approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty and the state medical board (Az. 2013-255-f-S).

### Clinical review #: state of the art for genetic testing of infertile men [^111poWnP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) now provides fertility in many cases of severe idiopathic spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia. Genetic causes must be sought by systematic evaluation of infertile men and affected couples informed about the implications of such diagnoses for assisted reproductive technology outcome and their potential offspring. This review discusses established and emerging genetic disorders related to fertility practice. Chromosomal anomalies are found in about 7% men with idiopathic spermatogenic failure, predominantly numerical/structural in azoospermic men and translocations/inversions in oligospermic men. Routine karyotyping of men with sperm densities less than 10 million/ml, even in the absence of other clinical presentations, is recommended because infertility is associated with higher rates of aneuploidy in ejaculated or testicular sperm and increased chromosomal defects in ICSI offspring. The long arm of the Y chromosome microdeletions are the most common recognized genetic cause of infertility and are found in about 4% men with sperm densities less than 5 million/ml. Routine testing using strict quality assurance procedures is recommended. Azoospermia factor (AZF)-c deletions, the most common form of the long arm of the Y chromosome microdeletions, are usually associated with low levels of sperm in the ejaculate or in testis biopsies, whereas men with AZFa or AZFb+c deletions usually produce no testicular sperm. When AZF-deleted sperm are available and used for ICSI, fertility defects in male offspring seem inevitable. Bilateral congenital absence of the vas is associated with heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor mutations making routine gene screening and genetic counseling of the couple essential. Testing for less common genetic associations/defects linked with different reproductive dysfunction may be applicable to specific patients but have not entered routine practice.

### Ambiguous genitalia, 45, X / 46, XY mosaic karyotype, and Y chromosome microdeletions in a 17-year-old man [^115zBWYD]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe clinical and laboratory features of a patient with 45, X/46, XY mosaic karyotype and Y chromosome microdeletions and to discuss the diagnostic problems in his management.

Design

Case report.

Setting

University department.

Patient(S)

A 17-year-old man with ambiguous genitalia, 45, X/46, XY mosaic karyotype, and Y chromosome microdeletions.

Intervention(S)

Testicular ultrasonography, karyotype, open testicular biopsy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for cystic fibrosis, PCR screening for Y chromosome microdeletions in peripheral blood and testicular tissue, and reverse transcriptase PCR in testicular tissue for Y chromosome microdeletions.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Avoidance of dissemination of testicular cancer.

Result(S)

The patient was referred for bilateral orchiectomy.

Conclusion(S)

45, X/46, XY mosaic karyotype is associated with a broad spectrum of phenotypes that includes female with Turner syndrome, male with mixed gonadal dysgenesis, male pseudohermaphroditism, and apparently normal male. Microdeletions of the long arm of the Y chromosome may be associated with Y chromosomal instability, leading to formation of 45, X cell lines. 45, X/46, XY males carry an increased risk for gonadal tumors and must be followed closely.

Hypogonadism and its therapies have a significant impact on male fertility potential. It is necessary to determine the etiology to treat and counsel the patient appropriately on therapeutic options. For the hypogonadal male on exogenous testosterone, management should begin with cessation of the exogenous testosterone and supplemental subcutaneous human chorionic gonadotropin and an oral follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-inducing agent to allow reestablishment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and spermatogenesis. Further supplemental therapy with recombinant FSH in some patients may be necessary to achieve optimal semen parameters.

### A GWAS in idiopathic / unexplained infertile men detects a genomic region determining follicle-stimulating hormone levels [^112dwU5N]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In Western countries, infertility affects at least 15% of couples during reproductive age, and in 50% of all cases a male factor contributes essentially. Impaired spermatogenesis can be attributed to oncologic or genetic causes in 4% to 10% of infertile men, rendering about 72% of infertile men with no or only mild etiologic factors, insufficient to explain their impaired fertility status. In infertile men with unknown etiology, 2 conditions are to be distinguished: unexplained and idiopathic male infertility. By definition, unexplained infertility comprises men in whom female factors and other etiologic factors are missing; these men show normozoospermia in their semen analyses. Different from idiopathic infertile men, who also lack etiologic and female factors, but who display abnormal semen parameters. In this very heterogeneous condition, there is an urgent need to improve the diagnostic workup by identifying genetic and endocrine factors influencing spermatogenesis.

The pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is essential for initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis in humans. During the prenatal and prepubertal stages, FSH stimulates Sertoli cell (SC) proliferation and by this determines their final number and the potential for spermatogenic output. In the adult testis, FSH is mandatory for qualitative and quantitative spermatogenesis. Together with testosterone, signals for germ cell maturation are evoked via the SCs. In addition, signaling for antiapoptotic survival factors, and for adhesion complexes between SCs and germ cells, is initiated.

Compared with luteinizing hormone (LH), which is stored in the gonadotropic cells and released on gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulus, FSH is directly secreted on stimulus into the bloodstream. Thus, the transcription of FSHB messenger RNA is not only the rate-limiting step, it also determines FSH serum level.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^113VdpqK]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Infertility effects of testosterone therapy — Testosterone treatment is a form of male birth control that suppresses LH and FSH and leads to severe oligospermia or absolute azoospermia typically within 3 to 4 months of use; contraception trials reported sperm concentrations less than 1 million/mL in 95% of men on injections and 90% on gels, with testis atrophy showing a mean loss of 4 to 5 mL of testis volume. Recovery is variable: in a study of 271 men, the median time to regain sperm counts of more than 20 million was 3.7 months and only 46% returned to baseline at an average of 6.7 months. Counseling is advised: All men of child-bearing age should be asked before the initiation of TT whether they are considering fathering children, and a study revealed that 25% of urologists reported using T to treat infertility.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^113duQSa]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — Adjunctive testing with luteinizing hormone (LH) indicates that in patients with low testosterone, clinicians should measure serum luteinizing hormone levels (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). A low or low/normal LH level points to a secondary (central) hypothalamic-pituitary defect (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), while an elevated LH level indicates a primary testicular defect (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism); in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the yield from adjunctive tests (e.g., prolactin measurement, pituitary imaging, iron studies) is increased, and in the event that a patient may have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, adjunctive tests should be ordered, although the literature at this time fails to define the LH level below which such adjunctive testing is warranted. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is not a contraindication to begin testosterone therapy, and in some cases a karyotype may be warranted to establish a diagnosis of KS (47, XXY). Testosterone deficient patients with low or low/normal LH levels can be considered candidates for selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) use, particularly those wishing to preserve their fertility, but an LH level below which SERM response is optimized is not firmly established.

Karyotype and Klinefelter syndrome — Karyotype can be useful in diagnosing KS (47 XXY), a common identifiable cause of primary testicular failure characterized by infertility, gynecomastia, very small testes (testicular volume < 6 mL; although men with mosaic KS may have larger testes), and elevated gonadotropin levels. The karyotype obtained from peripheral blood lymphocytes may be normal (46 XY) in some men with KS who have mosaicism (46 XY/47 XXY). Men with KS can benefit from genetic counseling and need surveillance for certain disorders, such as breast cancer and autoimmune disorders, for which they are at increased risk.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^111nE9eJ]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) testosterone deficiency — exogenous testosterone and fertility/contraception: Exogenous testosterone therapy should not be prescribed to men who are currently trying to conceive (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Exogenous testosterone therapy has been shown to interrupt normal spermatogenesis and can put patients in severely oligospermic to azoospermic ranges, and exogenous testosterone suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and intratesticular testosterone production. Testosterone enanthate 200 mg IM every week has been shown to decrease intratesticular testosterone levels by 94% within 3 weeks of initiation. Clinicians may offer human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (250 IU or 500 IU every other day) concurrent with exogenous testosterone, which in a single small study has been shown to maintain baseline levels of intratesticular testosterone. A systematic review of 33 RCT's indicated that higher doses of testosterone were more likely to result in azoospermia than lower doses; however, a dose-response effect was not consistently seen.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^113ErgG2]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) management and endocrine therapy considerations: Patients with HH present with deficient luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH secretion, and referral to an endocrinologist or male reproductive specialist is encouraged; spermatogenesis can be initiated and pregnancies achieved in many men with idiopathic HH when treated with exogenous gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH. With gonadotropin treatment for HH, hCG injections are typically initiated with serum testosterone monitored, and after normalization of testosterone, FSH or FSH analogues may be added to optimize sperm production. Exogenous testosterone administration provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland that can inhibit gonadotropins such that spermatogenesis may decrease or cease altogether, resulting in azoospermia, supporting avoidance of testosterone monotherapy in men desiring fertility. Although not currently FDA-approved for use in men, SERMs such as clomiphene or tamoxifen are often prescribed to attempt improvement in semen parameters and fertility outcomes. While exogenous FSH may be used as an adjunct for HH with good results, in idiopathic infertile men without HH its fertility benefits are measurable but limited; the cost-to-benefit ratio is questionable because men are typically treated for 3 months or more and the incremental increase in pregnancy rates is small. There are no clear, reliable data to support use of supplements (vitamins, antioxidants, nutritional formulations) for men attempting conception; current data suggest they are likely not harmful but of questionable value in improving fertility outcomes.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116Q7pEX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation of suspected testosterone deficiency begins with "Measure morning fasting total T* (and free T* if altered SHBG or borderline total T, Table 2)". Abnormal results are "Confirm by repeating morning fasting total T (and free T5)", after which "Diagnosis of hypogonadism is confirmed"; if instead "Normal total T or Normal or low total T and normal free T", then "Consider other causes of symptoms and signs". Following confirmation, "Measure LH and FSH" (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) to differentiate "LH and FSH low or inappropriately normal (Secondary hypogonadism)" — with actions to "Consider potentially reversible functional causes, Table 1", "Measure prolactin, iron saturation", "Evaluate other pituitary hormones (if clinically indicated5)", and "Pituitary MRI (if indicated7)" — from "LH and FSH high (Primary hypogonadism)", for which to "Obtain karyotype to diagnose Klinefelter syndrome (if clinical indication)". The figure specifies that "The lower limit of the normal total testosterone (TT) harmonized to the CDC standard in healthy nonobese young men is 264 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L) (9); this limit could be used for TT assays that are CDC certified" and that "Free testosterone (FT) should be measured by an equilibrium dialysis method or estimated from total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin using a formula that accurately reflects FT by equilibrium dialysis".

Case presentation

The patient was a 33-year-old man who visited a doctor 5 years ago due to infertility. He had a normal sexual desire and sexual life and denied having a positive family history and other diseases. Physical examination revealed that he was in standard shape (height 172 cm, weight 73 kg), and his body mass index was 24.6 kg/m 2. The investigation revealed that the patient's secondary sexual characteristics, testicular, and penis development were normal, and there was no gynecomastia, but the bilateral vas deferens and epididymis were not palpable. Two independent semen analyses confirmed that the patient was azoospermic. Testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin levels in the morning were normal. Ultrasound revealed that the volume of both testes was normal; however, the tails of the epididymis were absent. Transrectal ultrasound showed that the left seminal vesicle was missing, and the right seminal vesicle was atrophied (Fig. 1). No abnormality was observed in Y chromosome microdeletion. Karyotype analysis indicated that the patient was 46, XY/47, XYY mosaic (Fig. 2). Genetic testing found heterozygous mutations at two sites of CFTR (c263T > G and c2249C > T). Some sperms were discovered via a testicular puncture (Fig. 3). Given the low genetic risk of the disease, we recommend that patients undergo intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for fertility assessment.

### Fertility considerations in hypogonadal men [^113ThEu4]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypogonadism can be present in up to 40% in men who present with couple infertility. Testosterone is the major androgen regulating-spermatogenesis in men; as a result, men with either primary or secondary hypogonadism may be subfertile because of impaired spermatogenesis. The clinical impact of hypogonadism on fertility potential depends on the timing of its onset (fetal, prepubertal, or postpubertal) and effect on semen parameters. Treatment pathways and success rates differ according to the cause of hypogonadism and the time of its onset. When medical therapy fails to induce sufficient sperm, assisted reproductive technologies are considered.

### Can tangier disease cause male infertility? A case report and an overview on genetic causes of male infertility and hormonal axis involved [^111yKo6f]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Tangier disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ABCA1 gene and characterized by the accumulation of cholesteryl ester in various tissues and a near absence of high-density lipoprotein. The subject in this investigation was a 36-year-old Italian man with Tangier disease. He and his wife had come to the In Vitro Fertilization Unit, Pesaro Hospital (Azienda Ospedaliera Ospedali Riuniti Marche Nord) seeking help regarding fertility issues. The man was diagnosed with severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. Testosterone is the sex hormone necessary for spermatogenesis and cholesterol is its precursor; hence, we hypothesized that the characteristic cholesterol deficiency in Tangier disease patients could compromise their fertility. The aim of the study was to therefore to determine if there is an association between Tangier disease and male infertility. After excluding viral, infectious, genetic and anatomical causes of the subject's oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, we performed a hormonal analysis to verify our hypothesis. The patient was found to be negative for frequent bacteria and viruses. The subject showed a normal male karyotype and tested negative for Yq microdeletions and Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator gene mutations. A complete urological examination was performed, and primary hypogonadism was also excluded. Conversely, hormonal analyses showed that the subject had a high level of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, low total testosterone and a significant decline in inhibin B. We believe that the abnormally low cholesterol levels typically found in subjects with Tangier disease may result in a reduced testosterone production which in turn could affect the hormonal axis responsible for spermatogenesis leading to a defective maturation of spermatozoa.

### Men with acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism treated with testosterone may be fertile [^114NomvL]. Pituitary (2003). Low credibility.

Men with acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism treated with testosterone are generally assumed to be infertile. The finding of two such patients with unexpected fertility and normal sperm counts prompted an evaluation of spermatogenesis in additional men with this condition. Case records were initially searched and one similar case with fertility was found. Subsequently, 12 consecutive men with acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism were evaluated for gonadal function and sperm production while receiving testosterone. In five of the cases with proven spermatogenesis, exon 10 of the FSH receptor was sequenced to look for activating mutations. The original three cases and four of the subsequent 12 men had sperm concentrations ≥ 15 million/ml. Two additional men had concentrations of 1 million/ml and six were azoospermic. Residual LH and FSH levels were slightly higher in those with maintained spermatogenesis prior to testosterone replacement. No activating mutations were found in exon 10 of the FSH receptor in the five cases studied. We conclude that men with acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism being treated with testosterone should not be assumed to be sterile, as we have found that more than half have been shown to have persistent spermatogenesis with more than one-third having sperm concentrations ≥ 15 million/ml. This may be related to fact that gonadotropin levels in such patients are present, albeit low. Semen analyses in such men should be routinely carried out so that they can be appropriately counseled regarding potential fertility.

### Physiology of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis in the male [^116nUueE]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone synthesis and male fertility are the results of the perfect coordination of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. A negative feedback finely controls the secretion of hormones at the 3 levels. Congenital or acquired disturbance at any level leads to an impairment of reproductive function and the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism. In some cases, this condition is reversible. Once the diagnosis is made, testosterone replacement therapy is the standard therapy; however, novel therapies may improve spermatogenesis while elevating testosterone levels.

### Sexual and reproductive health among men with cystic fibrosis [^114v5kvV]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Due to the distribution of the CFTR protein, CF presents with a heterogeneous phenotype. Men with CF may present with infertility due to congenital abnormalities of the vas deferens. In addition, they may experience testosterone deficiency. Today, they can father biological children with assisted reproductive technologies. We reviewed the current literature on the pathophysiology of these conditions, describe interventions that allow men with CF to conceive biological children, and provide recommendations for management of CF patients with reproductive health concerns.

Testosterone deficiency — spermatogenesis recovery after stopping exogenous testosterone and salvage therapy is variable: the probability of recovery of sperm concentration to > 20 million/mL was 67% within 6 months, 90% within 12 months, 96% within 16 months, and 100% within 24 months, in a cohort eligible with 2 semen samples with a sperm concentration of ≥ 20 million/mL; in 66 males who presented with infertility while on exogenous testosterone, exogenous testosterone was stopped and combination high-dose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) therapy was initiated, using a total motile sperm count (TMSC) of 5 million as the benchmark with repeated semen testing at 6 and 12 months, and 65% with azoospermia versus 92% with cryptozoospermia achieved a TMSC > 5 million at 12 months; for men planning future reproduction, testosterone cessation should occur in advance of initiation of any effort to conceive, noting that while two-thirds recovered within 6 months, 10% failed to do so until the second year and some infertile men may never recover spermatogenesis.

### Normal spermatogenesis in a man with mutant luteinizing hormone [^116fq5uV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Men with mutations in LHB, the gene encoding the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone (LHB), have azoospermia with absent or few fetal Leydig cells. We report a mutation in LHB in a man and his sister. The man presented with absence of virilization, undetectable luteinizing hormone, and a low serum testosterone level. He had complete spermatogenesis with a normal sperm count. The mutant luteinizing hormone had a low level of partial activity in vitro. We concluded that the residual luteinizing hormone activity, resulting in the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in few mature Leydig cells producing small amounts of intratesticular testosterone (20.2 ng per gram), was sufficient for complete and quantitatively normal spermatogenesis.

### XX males SRY negative: a confirmed cause of infertility [^112FZvGS]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

We report on a family with two azoospermic brothers of 47 and 46 years of age, both 46, XX, SRY negative, who have a 96 kb triplication 500 kb upstream of SOX9 (figure 1B, C) that is not present in their two fertile sisters and mother. Interestingly, two of the three paternal cousins of our probands are reported as infertile (figure 1A). The probands' father, who was considered to have been completely normal and the probable carrier of the triplication, died at age of 50 years from a myocardial infarction. The two probands share the same paternal haplotype for the SOX9 region (supplementary table 1), confirming the possibility that the father was indeed the carrier of the same triplication. The two brothers are phenotypically normal males with bilaterally hypotrophic testes, low serum testosterone concentrations (1.0 ng/ml; normal values 1.80–16 ng/ml) and increased follicle stimulating hormone (39.5 mU/ml; normal values 5–25 mU/ml) and luteinising hormone (14.4 mU/ml; normal values 1.5–9.3 mU/ml). A testicular biopsy in one of them showed germinal cell aplasia and mild bilateral gynaecomastia. Both have normal libido and the older brother requested a clinical investigation after 10 years of infertility in spite of continual attempts to have children. A similar family was recently reported by Cox et al. They describe three SRY negative azoospermic XX males, two brothers and a paternal uncle, all having a duplication of 178 kb with a distal breakpoint almost coincident to the one we detected in our family. The XY members carrying the duplication were normal fertile males.

### Cryptozoospermia in the shadow of azoospermia: accurate diagnosis with clinical predictors and extended semen analysis [^113px2hY]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To address the critical issue of cryptozoospermia misclassification as non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), this study aims to highlight the importance of accurate cryptozoospermia diagnosis with extended semen analysis and to identify predictive clinical markers in men initially labeled as azoospermic.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed men diagnosed with azoospermia at external centers who underwent extended semen analysis at our center between April 2021-April 2024. To investigate the clinical significance and potential predictors, clinical data were compared to 239 patients diagnosed with NOA who underwent micro-TESE during the same period.

Results

Extended semen analysis revealed cryptozoospermia in 74 of 372 patients (19.9%). Compared to the NOA group, patients with cryptozoospermia exhibited significantly lower FSH levels (p < 0.001), higher total testosterone levels (p = 0.002), larger testicular volumes (p < 0.001), and a higher prevalence of AZFc microdeletions and parental consanguinity (p = 0.029 and p = 0.043, respectively). Multivariate analysis identified serum FSH level (< 18.6 mIU/mL) and testicular volume (> 11 mL) were found as independent predictors for the diagnosis of cryptozoospermia.

Conclusion

Our findings reveal that nearly one in five men initially diagnosed with NOA were, in fact, reclassified as having cryptozoospermia following extended analysis. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for missed cryptozoospermia in azoospermic patients presenting with favorable clinical profiles-particularly lower FSH, higher testosterone, and larger testicular volume- to ensure accurate diagnosis and guide individualized ART strategies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility-related male hormonal dysfunction [^111wNt57]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Treatment of infertility-related hormonal dysfunction in men requires an understanding of the hormonal basis of spermatogenesis. The best method for accurately determining male androgenization status remains elusive. Treatment of hormonal dysfunction can fall into two categories - empirical and targeted. Empirical therapy refers to experience-based treatment approaches in the absence of an identifiable aetiology. Targeted therapy refers to the correction of a specific underlying hormonal abnormality. However, the tools available for inferring the intratesticular hormonal environment are unreliable. Thus, understanding the limitations of serum hormonal assays is very important for determining male androgen status. Furthermore, bulk seminal parameters are notoriously variable and consequently unreliable for measuring responses to hormonal therapy. In the setting of azoospermia owing to spermatogenic dysfunction, hormonal therapy - relying on truly objective parameters including the return of sperm to the ejaculate or successful surgical sperm retrieval - is a promising treatment. This approach to the treatment of fertility-related hormonal dysfunction in men contrasts with the current state of its counterpart in female reproductive endocrinology. Treatment of male hormonal dysfunction has long emphasized empirical therapy, whereas treatment of the corollary female dysfunction has been directed at specific deficits.

### Managing congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism: a contemporary approach directed at optimizing fertility and long-term outcomes in males [^111EmYgk]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

As already stated, hCG monotherapy has no place in the management of men with prepubertal testes (TV < 4 ml) or a history of cryptorchidism, as the failure rate is exceedingly high, even with prolonged therapy – and non-responders to hCG/FSH combination therapy after 3–6 months of hCG pretreatment (a protocol originally devised for FSH product licensing studies in men and not grounded in developmental physiology) are over-represented by patients with similar characteristics. Therefore, spermatogenesis induction with combined gonadotrophin treatment from the outset is considered the standard of care for this group of patients. However, it is disappointing that up to one-third of men remains azoospermic on combined gonadotrophin therapy (or the equivalent pulsatile GnRH therapy). Of the responders, a significantly longer period of treatment compared with men with larger baseline TV would be required before sperms are observed in ejaculate. In addition, sperm counts typically plateau well below that of WHO reference value (⩾15 million/ml), although that does not necessarily preclude the possibility of natural conception.

### Progressive hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in an adolescent with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^117UCiXJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Testis-specific serine/threonine kinases (TSSKs), members of the protein kinase family, play a crucial role in spermatogenesis due to their exclusive expression in the testis. To date, five members of the Tssk gene family, including Tssk1, Tssk2, Tssk3, Tssk4, and Tssk6, have been identified in mice. In humans, the TSSK2 gene is located on the 22q11.21 region. This could be associated with the hypogonadism observed in DiGeorge syndrome. It has been suggested that the hypogonadism in this reported case is related to primary testicular failure and could be explained by the TSSK2 deletion in DiGeorge syndrome. However, the failure of the patient's FSH and LH levels to rise as expected has been linked to associated hyperprolactinemia, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity, which may influence pituitary hormones. In addition, cases of oligospermia and azoospermia associated with the 22q11 deletion have also been reported in the literature. Douet-Guilbert and colleagues described a case of oligozoospermia associated with a 46, XY, t(9;22) del(q21; q11.2) translocation. Perrin and colleagues reported another case of oligozoospermia in a 46, XY, t(9;22)(q21; q11.2) individual. In another study, azoospermia was described in patients with DiGeorge syndrome. A 35-year-old patient diagnosed with DiGeorge syndrome was evaluated for infertility, with normal levels of testosterone, LH, and FSH, but azoospermia was detected in sperm analysis. In this case, it was suggested that the co-occurrence of DiGeorge syndrome and azoospermia could be either coincidental or that azoospermia might be one of the unknown clinical features of the syndrome. Furthermore, this condition was proposed as a potential cause of reduced reproductive function in males. Among the most common chromosomal abnormalities leading to azoospermia are Y chromosome microdeletions. However, independent of genetic etiologies, intelligence levels can also impact reproductive ability. In our case, sperm analysis could not be performed due to insufficient erection and ejaculation. Further studies are needed to define pubertal trajectories and establish screening guidelines for gonadal function in this population.

### The pituitary-testicular axis in Klinefelter's syndrome and in oligo-azoospermic patients with and without deletions of the Y chromosome long arm [^116g2sJf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The most frequent known genetic causes of severe oligospermia (< 5 million sperm/ml) or azoospermia in men are Klinefelter's syndrome (KS), and deletions in the Y chromosome long arm (Yq). We aimed to compare the function of the pituitary-testicular axis in patients with severe oligospermia or azoospermia, idiopathic or associated with Y chromosome deletions or Klinefelter's syndrome (KS) and in control subjects.

Patients

We studied 47 men with idiopathic oligo-azoospermia, 42 with Yq deletions (27 AZFc, 13 AZFb and two AZFa) and oligo-azoospermia, 14 with KS and 39 control subjects (total 143).

Measurements

We analysed levels of FSH, inhibin-B, LH, free testosterone and oestradiol in all subjects, and we calculated indexes based on those hormones.

Results

Inhibin-B levels were indistinguishable between patients with idiopathic and Y deletion-associated oligo-azoospermia, lowest in the Klinefelter's patients and highest in controls. FSH levels followed the reverse pattern: indistinguishable between patients with idiopathic and deletion-associated oligo-azoospermia, highest in Klinefelter's patients and lowest in controls. Oestradiol, free testosterone and the derived indeces were not different in subjects with Yq deletions compared to those with idiopathic oligo-azoospermia. Among the Yq-deleted patients, no measured or derived parameter differed between the subjects with AZFc deletion and those with AZFb deletion. When non-KS oligo-azoospermic patients were classified according to histology [Sertoli cell-only (SCO), n = 18 or non-Sertoli cell only (non-SCO), n = 18] and compared to KS patients, the hormonal pattern did not differ between SCO and non-SCO subjects, but levels in KS patients were significantly different for FSH, inhibin-B and the FSH/inhibin-B ratio. KS patients not only had lower inhibin-B than SCO and non-SCO oligo-azoospermic men, but also higher FSH levels for any given inhibin-B concentration.

Conclusion

Our data show that Y-deleted patients do not have a lesser impairment of Sertoli cell function than patients with idiopathic oligo-azoospermia, and support the concept that the main determinant of inhibin-B production is the germ cell mass. Also, our results suggest that one or more other factors, apart from inhibin-B, may contribute to increased pituitary secretion of FSH in KS patients.

2.5 Dosing for Induction of Spermatogenesis in Males with Azoospermia and Primary or Secondary Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism:

Prior to initiation of treatment with GONAL-f:

Confirm azoospermia
Perform a thorough medical and endocrinologic evaluation to exclude other treatable etiologies of azoospermia
Confirm hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
Exclude primary testicular failure
Normalize serum testosterone levels

The dosing scheme follows a stepwise approach and is individualized for each man.

GONAL-f must be given in conjunction with hCG.
Prior to concomitant therapy with GONAL-f and hCG, pretreatment with hCG alone (1,000 to 2,250 USP units two to three times per week) is required to normalize serum testosterone levels.
Treatment with hCG alone should continue until serum testosterone levels reach the normal range, which may take 3 to 6 months. The dose of hCG may also need to be increased during this time to achieve normal serum testosterone levels.
After serum testosterone levels have normalized, administer GONAL-f 150 International Units subcutaneously three times a week and hCG 1,000 USP units (or the dose required to maintain serum testosterone levels within the normal range) three times a week. The lowest dose of GONAL-f which induces spermatogenesis should be utilized.
If azoospermia persists, increase the dose of GONAL-f up to a maximum dose of 300 International Units three times per week. Administer GONAL-f for up to 18 months to achieve adequate spermatogenesis.

2.6 Missed Dose

Do not double the next dose if a woman or a man misses or forgets to take a dose of GONAL-f.

Results

Clinical data

Two Chinese families with infertility participated in this study (online supplementary figure 1A). In family 1, two brothers had a history of male infertility for 3 and 2 years, respectively. There was no family history of consanguinity or fertility problems and no chronic diseases in the medical history. Neither patient had a history of cryptorchidism, hypogonadism, cancer, drinking or smoking. They were 29 and 32 years old at phenotyping and in good physical condition (online supplementary table 2). Physical examination showed normal development of penis, epididymis, prostate, scrotum and vas deferens, and there was no varicocele in either brother. However, their testes (10 mL in both sides) were slightly smaller than reference (12–15 mL in Chinese individuals). Laboratory examination revealed that both brothers had normal serum FSH level (12.44 IU/L and 11.26 IU/L; normal range: 1.5–12.5 IU/L). Both had 46, XY karyotypes and there were no microdeletions in the Y chromosome.

In family 2, the proband was 28 years old at phenotyping, and he had a history of male infertility for 2 years with no family history of consanguinity or fertility problems. As in family 1, physical examination showed normal development of penis, epididymis, prostate, scrotum and vas deferens. The volumes of his testes were 15 mL (left) and 20 mL (right). Routine semen analyses (three times) revealed complete azoospermia, and the semen volume was normal. Sex hormone levels were comparable with the reference values (online supplementary table 2). The proband's karyotype was 46, XY and there were no Y chromosome microdeletions in the proband. The proband's older sister had a history of infertility for 3 years. After failure of several assisted reproduction technology trials, the couple adopted a child. The history was described by the proband. Unfortunately, the sister's basal hormone levels at phenotyping and ovary volume were unknown (online supplementary figure 1B) and unavailable to us.

The probands in families 1 and 2 underwent the microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) procedure at Urologic Medical Center of Shanghai General Hospital. Histopathological analysis revealed MA in the probands. Furthermore, the older brother in family 1 underwent a testicular biopsy, which confirmed MA.

### Managing congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism: a contemporary approach directed at optimizing fertility and long-term outcomes in males [^114VMKgD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Hormonal induction of spermatogenesis offers men with azoospermia due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH) the promising prospect of fertility restoration. However, an important exception is the subset of individuals affected by congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (CHH), also known as Kallmann syndrome if associated with anosmia, who often display dismal responses to fertility induction, despite prolonged therapy. This primarily stems from the loss of minipuberty, which is a crucial phase of testicular maturation in early life that has a far-reaching impact on eventual spermatogenic capacity. Further exacerbating the compromised reproductive health is the failure to initiate timely pubertal induction in many CHH patients, resulting in suboptimal genital and psychosexual development. In this paper, the clinical implications and management of male HH across the lifespan is comprehensively reviewed, with a special focus on novel strategies that have the potential to modify disease severity and maximize fertility potential in CHH by addressing the inadequacies of conventional approaches.

### Endocrine causes of male infertility [^115VaUMu]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Although endocrinopathies are not often seen in infertile men, these disorders are clinically significant; they often have potentially serious medical significance, regardless of fertility issues. Correction of these disorders represents a possible way to restore normal fertility for the male partner. Male fertility is critically dependent upon a normal hormonal milieu. The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is quite sensitive to disruption by endocrine disorders and other generalized medical disorders. Thus, male infertility is occasionally the presenting sign for significant underlying medical disease; it is important to properly evaluate these patients.

### Recent advancement in the treatment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism [^1144z6Wj]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

When there is a whole gonadal dysfunction, due to either primary or central hypogonadism, the lack of testosterone rise results in the lack of signs of pubertal development. For primary hypogonadism to be associated with complete lack of development of secondary sex characteristics, the testicular disorder must be severe, for example, complete testicular regression syndrome or gonadal removal. Otherwise, Leydig cell function often remains sufficient to provoke some signs of androgenisation, even if Sertoli cells are severely affected, for example, in many cases of partial gonadal dysgenesisor long-standing cryptorchidism.

Apart from the already mentioned congenital form, central hypogonadism may be acquired during childhood, for example, due to tumours or other lesions of the central nervous system affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary region or to functional states such as chronic or acute illnesses that impair the HPT axis. The severity of the condition may lead to a complete lack of pubertal onset or to a normal or delayed onset with incomplete progression.

In those cases where there is no personal or family history that could drive the diagnosis, constitutional delay of puberty is the commonest cause of lack of pubertal signs in a boy reaching the age of 14 years, that is, that corresponding to more than 2 standard deviations from normal pubertal age onset. The differential diagnosis may prove difficult: basal LH and testosterone levels are usually uninformative and several dynamic tests have been developed with controversial results. Although neglected in males, the FSH-gonadal axis seems to be more informative. –

Family 3, of African and African-American ancestry, have a son (3.1) who presented with small testes and low testosterone at 16 years of age (Figure 1A; Table 1). He was on testosterone supplementation inconsistently through his late teens and 20s. At 30 years of age, he was found to have bilateral atrophic testes (less than 5cc) and small phallus (5–6 cm stretched length). Genetic evaluation showed a 46, XX karyotype (SRY -negative) with a normal microarray. Endocrine evaluation showed primary testicular failure, based on very low testosterone (34 ng/dL [300–1080]), raised gonadotrophins (FSH (25 mIU/mL [1.3–11.4]) and LH (15 mIU/ml [1.2–7.8])), and low AMH (0.657 pmol/l [15–219.2]) and inhibin B (< 10 pg/ml [40–450]). Adrenal function and sex-hormone binding globulin levels were normal. Testosterone levels remained low following a 4-day hCG stimulation test (testosterone 46 ng/dL, androstenedione 0.272 ng/ml [0.33–1.34], and dihydrotestosterone 55 pg/ml [112–955]). Semen analysis showed azoospermia. The diagnosis of 46, XX TDSD was made.

Family 4, of South Asian ancestry, have an older girl (4.1) who was seen in six years of age because of labial fusion and mild clitoral enlargement. The karyotype was 46, XY (SRY -positive) (Figure 1A; Table 1). Gonads were palpable in the inguinal region, which were dysgenetic testes on histology. No uterus was found and a diagnosis of partial gonadal (testicular) dysgenesis was made. A younger brother (4.2) had severe penoscrotal hypospadias but palpable gonads in the scrotum. Biopsy of the right testis showed dysgenetic testicular tissue (Figure 1B). Surprisingly, the karyotype was 46, XX (SRY -negative), suggesting a diagnosis of 46, XX TDSD (Figure S1). The mother has no reported androgenisation but has had very irregular periods all her life. This family therefore has a 46, XY girl with partial gonadal dysgenesis and a 46, XX boy with TDSD who are siblings.

### Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and chromosomal aberrations: clinical heterogeneity and implications on the health of elderly men, case series [^11268iqx]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Primary gonadal failure leads to impaired secretion of gonadal steroids, namely testosterone. This causes elevated FSH and LH levels as the negative feedback loop is decreased. The chromosomal abnormalities leading to hypergonadotropic hypogonadism are generally caused by specific syndromes, which are generally rare and most are associated with typical dysmorphic features. The most common of these is Klinefelter Syndrome, which has an incidence of 1 in 1,000 males. Other less common causes include: chromatin negative gonadal dysgenesis; anorchidia; Noonan Syndrome; abnormal testosterone synthesis; agenesis of Leydig cells; Sertoli Cell Only Syndrome (SCO); Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome; Steinert myotonia and Bloom Syndrome. A more complete list of causes can be found in a text published by Topaloglu. Furthermore, chromosomal aberrations involving either the sex chromosomes or autosomes can also result in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, particularly Kallman syndrome. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism discovered in middle or old age is generally ascribed to late onset hypogonadism.

### British Society for Sexual Medicine guidelines on adult testosterone deficiency, with statements for UK practice [^116kpqgV]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to testosterone levels, BSSM 2017 guidelines recommend to repeat total testosterone measurement on two or more occasions by a reliable method. Obtain measurement of free testosterone in patients with levels close to the lower normal range (8–12 nmol/L) or with suspected or known abnormal SHBG levels.

### Diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in the male partner in the setting of infertility: a committee opinion [^115R2Zsk]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Decreased libido — Hormonal dysfunction is frequently associated with sexual complaints among infertile men, most commonly diminished libido; evaluation may include straightforward questions or a validated questionnaire such as the androgen deficiency in aging male's test. Indeed, 43% of 94 men presenting to an infertility clinic with normozoospermia provided a positive response to a validated questionnaire of symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency, and men presenting with oligozoospermia have concomitant hypogonadism in 42%-50% of cases. Correction of testosterone deficiency in the setting of ED should be approached with modest expectations, although men with diminished libido related to testosterone deficiency may achieve good symptomatic benefit from hormonal therapy. Exogenous testosterone replacement therapy should be avoided in men attempting conception because of disruption of normal spermatogenesis.
