## Question

A 42-year-old man with a 3-year history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) presents to clinic with new-onset jaundice, pruritus, and a 5-kg unintentional weight loss over the past two months. Laboratory studies reveal worsening cholestatic liver enzymes compared to his baseline. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) performed as part of his routine surveillance now shows a new dominant stricture in the common hepatic duct with upstream biliary dilation. There is no evidence of metastatic disease on imaging. The hepatology team suspects possible cholangiocarcinoma.

Based on current guideline recommendations, outline the next steps in the diagnostic evaluation and management of this patient with suspected cholangiocarcinoma in the setting of primary sclerosing cholangitis.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next steps in the diagnostic evaluation and management of a 42-year-old man with PSC who now has a new dominant stricture and suspected cholangiocarcinoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability and why this presentation is high risk. Then, I should verify the optimal imaging strategy and whether MRCP has already fulfilled its role. Next, I will review tissue acquisition pathways, including ERCP-based sampling, EUS-FNA, and cholangioscopy, and confirm which combinations are guideline-preferred. After that, I need to check tumor markers and their limitations. Then, I will consider staging and multidisciplinary review. Finally, I will outline management contingencies for confirmed malignancy versus indeterminate or benign disease, including biliary drainage and surveillance, and I will double-check for pitfalls like high-dose UDCA and contraindications such as complete biliary obstruction before bile acid sequestrants.

> Let me first confirm the risk context and pretest probability. In PSC, a new dominant stricture with jaundice, pruritus, and weight loss substantially elevates the likelihood of cholangiocarcinoma, and this constellation warrants expedited tissue diagnosis and staging because PSC-associated CCA carries high mortality and early detection changes management and transplant candidacy [^0f013765] [^95028094].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging strategy before jumping to invasive tests. MRCP is the first-line modality for PSC surveillance and characterization of dominant strictures, and it has already been performed here, showing a new dominant stricture in the common hepatic duct with upstream dilation. Importantly, MRCP and contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging are preferred over direct cholangiography for diagnosing bile duct cancers, so I should not rely on ERCP for diagnosis alone, though ERCP will be essential for tissue acquisition and potential therapy [^0f013765] [^dfbb207d].

> I need to ensure the tissue acquisition plan aligns with current guidelines. For suspected malignant biliary strictures, ESGE recommends combining EUS-guided tissue acquisition with ERCP-based sampling in the same session when feasible, as this does not increase adverse events and improves diagnostic yield. For perihilar strictures like this, brushing cytology plus fluoroscopy-guided forceps biopsies are suggested, and if ERCP-based modalities are insufficient, EUS-FNA can be considered, particularly when extraluminal disease is accessible or curative resection is not feasible [^8d43c223] [^0fb60550] [^b70e172a].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of cholangioscopy. If initial ERCP with standard sampling is indeterminate, cholangioscopy-guided biopsies are recommended to increase sensitivity for malignancy. Ideally, this is done at index ERCP before stenting to preserve visual and histologic accuracy, and competence standards call for multiple targeted biopsies with adequate tissue yield, which I should request explicitly from the endoscopist [^c89343c4] [^d67877d8].

> Next, I should review tumor markers, but I must not overinterpret them. CEA and CA 19–9 are recommended as baseline tests only and should not be used to confirm or exclude malignancy, as CA 19–9 lacks specificity and can be elevated in cholestasis, other cancers, or even benign strictures. I will order them for baseline and trend, but I will not delay tissue diagnosis based on these results [^cd188651] [^a95985ab] [^a017e3f1].

> I will now examine staging and multidisciplinary planning. Once tissue is obtained, I should arrange contrast-enhanced MRI or CT of the abdomen and pelvis to define local extent and vascular relationships, and obtain chest CT to assess for metastases. Concurrently, I should refer the patient to a hepatobiliary multidisciplinary team to coordinate surgical oncology, transplant, interventional radiology, and medical oncology input, because resectability and transplant candidacy hinge on early, high-quality staging and pathology [^dfbb207d] [^0e54e5c2].

> But wait, what if the stricture is benign or the initial sampling is nondiagnostic. If malignancy is not confirmed, I should still treat the dominant stricture for symptom relief and cholangitis prevention. Balloon dilation alone is preferred over routine stent placement because stenting increases adverse events without improving outcomes in PSC, and I should plan interval surveillance with MRCP and liver tests given the persistent malignancy risk in PSC [^8e973208].

> If cholangiocarcinoma is confirmed, I need to ensure management is stage-appropriate. For localized, resectable disease, surgical resection offers the best chance for cure and should be pursued in experienced centers. For unresectable but nonmetastatic perihilar disease, liver transplantation within strict protocols may be considered. For advanced or metastatic disease, systemic therapy with gemcitabine-based regimens is standard, and I should confirm molecular profiling for FGFR2 fusions, IDH1 mutations, and HER2 amplifications to guide targeted therapy and clinical trial options [^dfbb207d] [^0e54e5c2].

> I should double-check supportive care and PSC-specific pitfalls. Pruritus warrants cholestatic pruritus management, but bile acid sequestrants like cholestyramine are contraindicated in complete biliary obstruction, so I must confirm patency before prescribing. Also, I need to avoid high-dose UDCA, which has been associated with increased mortality in PSC, and if UDCA is used at all, it should be at moderate doses with careful monitoring rather than as disease-modifying therapy [^91247b71] [^47db40cc].

> Let me reconsider the surveillance cadence after an indeterminate result. Even if initial tissue is negative, the risk remains elevated in PSC with a new dominant stricture, so I should maintain close follow-up with MRCP and liver tests every 3–6 months initially, and I should have a low threshold to repeat tissue acquisition if clinical suspicion persists or if the stricture progresses, given the limited sensitivity of single-pass sampling in this setting [^notfound].

> In summary, I need to act decisively: proceed to ERCP with EUS-FNA in the same session when feasible, obtain brushing cytology and forceps biopsies of the perihilar stricture, add cholangioscopy if standard sampling is indeterminate, reserve tumor markers for baseline only, complete high-quality cross-sectional staging, and engage the multidisciplinary team early. Throughout, I must balance diagnostic yield, procedural risk, and the urgency dictated by this high-risk phenotype in PSC [^8d43c223] [^0fb60550] [^dfbb207d].

In a 42-year-old man with PSC and a new dominant stricture, the next steps are: **urgent ERCP with brushings and forceps biopsies** for tissue diagnosis [^0fb60550] and **multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or CT** for staging [^dfbb207d]. CA 19–9 and CEA are not diagnostic but can serve as baselines [^a95985ab]; **PET-CT is not routine** but may help if conventional imaging is equivocal [^dfbb207d]. If malignancy is confirmed or strongly suspected, refer to a **multidisciplinary team** for surgical resection, liver transplantation, or systemic therapy [^0e54e5c2]; if indeterminate, consider EUS-FNA or cholangioscopy [^c89343c4] and repeat imaging in 3–6 months [^notfound]. Manage pruritus and cholangitis symptomatically, and avoid high-dose UDCA [^47db40cc].

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Tissue diagnosis

- **ERCP with tissue sampling**: Perform urgently [^notfound] to obtain brushings and forceps biopsies from the dominant stricture; this is the cornerstone for confirming cholangiocarcinoma in PSC [^notfound].

- **EUS-FNA**: Consider if ERCP is inconclusive or if extraluminal tissue is needed; EUS-FNA has high sensitivity for malignancy in this setting [^notfound].

- **Cholangioscopy**: Use if initial ERCP is nondiagnostic; visually guided biopsies improve diagnostic yield for indeterminate strictures [^c89343c4].

---

### Imaging for staging

- **Multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or CT**: Preferred for local staging, vascular assessment, and detecting metastases; MRI offers superior soft-tissue contrast for biliary structures [^dfbb207d].

- **PET-CT**: Not routine; consider if conventional imaging is equivocal for metastatic disease or for recurrent disease assessment [^dfbb207d].

- **Chest CT**: Obtain to exclude pulmonary metastases as part of staging [^0e54e5c2].

---

### Laboratory tests

CA 19–9 and CEA are **not diagnostic** but can be used as baseline markers; interpret cautiously given false positives in cholestasis and other cancers [^a95985ab] [^a017e3f1]. Liver function tests should be monitored to track cholestasis and guide supportive care.

---

## Management strategy

### Multidisciplinary team (MDT) involvement

Early **MDT review** with hepatology, surgical oncology, transplant, interventional radiology, and medical oncology is essential to coordinate care and determine curative options [^0e54e5c2].

---

### Definitive management options

- **Surgical resection**: For localized, resectable disease without metastases; offers the best chance for cure in appropriately selected patients [^notfound].

- **Liver transplantation**: Consider for early-stage perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in highly selected patients within strict protocols (e.g. Mayo protocol) [^notfound].

- **Systemic therapy**: For unresectable or metastatic disease, gemcitabine-based regimens are standard; consider clinical trials and molecular profiling for targeted therapy [^notfound].

---

### Supportive care

Pruritus should be managed with **cholestyramine**, rifampin, or naltrexone as tolerated, and bile acid sequestrants should be avoided in complete obstruction [^91247b71]. Cholangitis requires prompt antibiotics and biliary drainage if obstructed. Nutritional support should address fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition.

---

### Surveillance and follow-up

If malignancy is not confirmed, **repeat MRCP and liver tests** at 3–6 month intervals with a low threshold to re-biopsy if suspicion remains [^notfound]. Continue standard PSC surveillance, including annual MRCP and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer risk [^95028094] [^dca522c8].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Tissue diagnosis | Urgent ERCP with brushings and biopsies; consider EUS-FNA or cholangioscopy if inconclusive [^0fb60550] [^c89343c4] |
| Staging imaging | Multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or CT; chest CT; selective PET-CT [^dfbb207d] [^0e54e5c2] |
| Tumor markers | CA 19–9 and CEA for baseline only; not diagnostic [^a95985ab] [^a017e3f1] |
| MDT involvement | Early MDT review for curative options [^0e54e5c2] |
| Definitive therapy | Surgical resection, liver transplantation, or systemic therapy per MDT [^notfound] |
| Supportive care | Pruritus management, cholangitis treatment, nutritional support [^notfound] |
| Surveillance | Repeat MRCP and labs if indeterminate; continue PSC surveillance [^notfound] |

---

The priority is to **secure a tissue diagnosis** and stage the disease to guide curative therapy, while providing supportive care and maintaining close surveillance if malignancy is not confirmed.

Introduction

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an idiopathic, heterogeneous, cholestatic liver disease characterized by progressive biliary inflammation and fibrosis that leads to complications including cholestasis and liver failure. "Sclerosing" refers to the stiffening and hardening of the bile duct walls, while "cholangitis" refers to the inflammation of the biliary tree.

This disease typically affects men (60%) with a mean age at diagnosis of 41 years and has an overall incidence of 0 to 1.3 cases per 100,000 individuals per year.

Even if the prevalence of PSC varies worldwide, with a peak in the Northern European countries, it seems to be linked to the increased awareness and widespread availability of diagnostic imaging.

PSC typically involves both intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, although, in a small percentage of individuals, only intrahepatic (15–25%) or extrahepatic ducts (5–10%) are affected. There are two established subtypes of PSC: the large-duct subtype affects both small and large bile ducts, and the small-duct subtype affects only small bile ducts, the former subtype having a more favorable diagnosis compared to the latter. The final diagnosis of the small-duct subtype requires liver biopsy since imaging investigations are normal or near-normal. Conversely, liver biopsy is no longer necessary to diagnose large-duct PSC since imaging demonstrates high diagnostic performance. However, if an overlapping condition with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is suspected, liver biopsy is mandatory.

Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been considered the reference standard for diagnosis in patients with PSC for decades; however, currently, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with cholangiopancreatography sequences (MRCP) has become the recommended imaging modality for both diagnosis and follow-up of individuals with either suspected or confirmed PSC. Indeed, MRCP is indicated as the first imaging modality for investigating bile duct abnormalities in patients with PSC according to the latest recommendations of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association of the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines. This is primarily because MR with MRCP can provide important information regarding both the biliary tree and liver parenchyma abnormalities non-invasively without ionizing radiation exposure. Moreover, MRCP allows the evaluation of affected bile ducts proximally to a severe stricture that would not have been opacified on ERCP, and this non-invasive diagnostic approach will also prevent endoscopic-related complications.

6.5 ERCP and strictures

Practice point

Children with PSC, relevant bile‐duct strictures and cholestatic symptoms should be assessed for liver transplantation. When their symptoms are likely to improve following biliary intervention, ERCP can be considered. Referral to a centre with expertise in pediatric interventional ERCP is highly recommended.

As discussed in Section 4.3 in connection with diagnostic imaging, MRCP has supplanted the role of ERCP to identify focal narrowing and ballooning of bile ducts. ERCP is now mainly a means to manage dominant biliary strictures, or to sample tissue for suspected CCA.

The possible presence of a dominant stricture in the bile ducts should be investigated when a patient with known PSC‐IBD suddenly develops cholestatic symptoms (including jaundice, bacterial cholangitis, itching, or pain in the right upper abdomen) and a cholestatic biochemical profile. When narrowing in the extrahepatic or first‐order intrahepatic ducts is observed on MRCP, with or without upstream dilatation, there is an indication for ERCP. When ERCP confirms a dominant stricture, primary treatment should consist of balloon dilation. Dilation followed by stent placement does not lead to better outcomes but is associated with significant adverse events, such as bacterial cholangitis and pancreatitis.

Based on the invasiveness of the procedure, the considerable exposure to radiation and its potential for severe complications, ERCP in children is only justified in the situation of a favorable benefit‐risk ratio, such as a high suspicion of a dominant stricture or malignancy on MRCP. Referral to a centre with expertise in pediatric interventional ERCP is highly recommended.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare pathology seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially ulcerative colitis. PSC increases patients' morbidity and requires the attention of a multidisciplinary team as those patients require frequent colonoscopies and biopsies due to the elevated risk of malignancy, biliary screening and management of progressive disease that could leave patients in liver failure requiring liver transplant. Some consider this a separate form of IBD in addition to Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. These patients should be monitored closely and managed carefully due to implications of ongoing management on quality of life and survival.

### Gamma-glutamyltransferase testing in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease to screen for primary sclerosing cholangitis: a diagnostic study based on routinely collected electronic healthcare data [^87eb49c3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare chronic cholestatic liver disease characterised by inflammation, destruction, stricturing and fibrosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The cause of PSC is unknown, but it has a strong association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Childhood-onset PSC typically presents with asymptomatic liver test abnormalities, with disproportionate elevations of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) compared with alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The diagnosis of PSC is confirmed when characteristic irregular bile ducts are found on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or when periductal onion skin fibrosis is seen in a liver biopsy specimen. Patients with abnormalities on MRCP are classified as having 'large duct disease', whereas those with fibrosing cholangiopathy on histology, but without MRCP abnormalities, are classified as having 'small duct disease'.

Children with both PSC and IBD are at higher risk for colorectal neoplasia compared with those with isolated IBDand should be included in a surveillance colonoscopy programme. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommends regular GGT and ALT testing in children with IBD to screen for subclinical PSC, but it is unknown when to expose children with liver test abnormalities to MRCP and/or liver biopsy. We set out to investigate, among children with IBD and liver test abnormalities, what GGT threshold best distinguishes those with and without PSC.

### Surveillance of primary sclerosing cholangitis-a comparison of scheduled or on-demand ERCP with annual MRI surveillance: a multicenter study [^95028094]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is associated with a high risk of hepatobiliary malignancy, especially cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). There are no good tumor markers to screen for CCA, and current recommendations for PSC monitoring are mainly based on expert opinions. The optimal strategy to assess disease progression and screen for CCA - the main cause of death of PSC patients - remains unclear. We aimed to compare three different surveillance strategies and their effect on patient outcomes. Data from three distinct PSC cohorts with different surveillance strategies - scheduled endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), annual magnetic resonance imaging/cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) surveillance, and on-demand ERCP according to ESGE/EASL guidelines - was collected. Patients with PSC diagnosed in 1990 or later were included and the last day of follow-up was 31 December 2023. The composite end point consisted of hepatobiliary malignancy, liver transplantation, or liver-related death.1629 PSC patients were included, with a median follow-up of 8–11 years. The cumulative incidence of the composite end point was lowest in the group undergoing scheduled ERCP (14.1%, 95%CI 12.0%-16.4%) and highest in the on-demand ERCP cohort (35.0%, 95%CI 28.4%-42.0%). Although the cumulative incidence of CCA was lower in the scheduled ERCP group than in the other groups, it did not differ statistically significantly from the MRI/MRCP surveillance group. No differences were seen in liver-related deaths between the surveillance strategies. In this study comparing scheduled ERCP, annual MRI/MRCP surveillance, and on-demand ERCP, the strategy based on scheduled ERCP using individual risk stratification is associated with better overall prognosis and outcome.

Current best practice

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)

Despite animal models and early trials suggesting a benefit from secondary bile acids such as UDCA or obeticholic acid on liver biochemistry, long-term use of UDCA did not impact prognosis beyond biochemical cholestasis, apart from 1 Japanese study. The use of UDCA was not significantly associated with a lower rate of PSC-related death in multivariate analysis. This translates into conflicting international professional organization recommendations on its use in PSC. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend that UDCA at doses of 15–20 mg/kg/day could be tried, and maintained if liver biochemistry or clinical relief is noted, although the effects on long-term prognosis remain unclear. These recommendations are based on evidence suggesting that while high doses of UDCA (28–30 mg/kg/day) are associated with adverse outcomes, moderate doses (15–20 mg/kg/day) may offer biochemical improvement and potential clinical benefits, without the same level of risk. The ACG and AASLD guidelines emphasize that this approach should be considered in the context of individual patient response and clinical judgment.

Fenofibrate

Fibrates confer anticholestatic effects in PSC through their action on peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors. Similarly to UDCA, fenofibrates can improve cholestatic biochemistry and symptoms, especially in combination with UDCA or in UDCA partial responders, but they have not been proven to improve LT-free survival.

Pathway to LT

Patients are followed routinely in hepatology clinics for monitoring biochemistry, liver fibrosis via measurements of liver stiffness, and surveillance of complications (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, CRC, cholangitis, dominant biliary strictures). Patients have a higher risk of cholangitis, also requiring hospitalizations and biliary interventions; current guidelines exist on the best practices for such interventions. Patients with PSC should be advised that adverse events post-ERCP are higher than in the general population (7–18% vs. 3–11%), largely owing to post-ERCP pancreatitis and post-ERCP cholangitis.

While evaluating for LT, it is worth noting that survival outcomes (both patient and graft) are better in living-donor liver transplants compared to deceased-donor liver transplants; this is similar to other LT indications.

### Medical treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: what have we learned and where are we going? [^47db40cc]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dosing of UDCA in clinical trials in PSC has been variable, ranging from ~10–30 mg/kg/d. Building from observations that biliary enrichment of UDCA increases up to a plateau at 22–25 mg/kg/d, higher doses of UDCA were explored. However, when a dose of 28–30 mg/kg/d was evaluated in 150 adults with PSC in a randomized, double-blinded controlled trial, an approximately 2-fold increased risk for death and liver transplantation was demonstrated in the UDCA group, and serious adverse events were also more common in the treatment arm. Paradoxical to this outcome, but similar to other trials of UDCA in PSC, improvements in ALP and AST were still observed in the UDCA treatment group. The findings led to consistent recommendations against the use of high-dose UDCA in many areas, particularly in Northern Europe and the United States, to widespread UDCA discontinuation in both adultand pediatricsettings. Clinical practice guidelines statements are currently vague for UDCA in PSC, however allowing for doses of 13–23 mg/kg/d (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [AASLD]) and 15–20 mg/kg/d (European Association for the Study of the Liver [EASL]), leading to a situation of variable prescription rates depending on local reimbursement policies and physician preference.

### Clinical association between inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis: what changes after colectomy and liver transplantation? [^b1eb8193]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis (UC), is associated with several hepatobiliary manifestations, most importantly primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The association between these entities is bidirectional, though not necessarily causal, making the underlying pathogenesis challenging to decipher. While not yet fully elucidated, current evidence suggests that genetic and immunological factors play key roles in the coexistence of IBD and PSC. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis from a clinical perspective, evaluating the association between PSC, PSC-associated cholangiocarcinoma, orthotopic liver transplantation for PSC, IBD, colitis-associated neoplasia and restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for UC. Despite efforts of data collection through population-based registries, much of the existing evidence is based on small cohorts, often with low event rates and limited follow-up durations. This makes it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. Acknowledging the variability and heterogeneity of prior studies, we aim to offer valuable insight for gastroenterologists and hepatologists managing this unique and often challenging scenario, which some authors consider a new entity: PSC-IBD. Longitudinal studies with extended follow-up periods are needed to better understand the disease course of PSC and UC, including the impact of medical therapy, the development, surveillance and management of neoplasia, and the outcomes of surgery for both bowel and liver diseases.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for biliary stricture, more specifically with respect to evaluation of perihilar strictures, ESGE 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing EUS-guided tissue acquisition for perihilar strictures when ERCP-based modalities yield insufficient results, provided that curative resection is not feasible and/or when cross-sectional imaging has shown accessible extraluminal disease.

### Biliary tract cancers, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^dfbb207d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Biliary tract cancers — cholangiography modality selection and adjunct tests: Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and/or CT is recommended over direct cholangiography for diagnosing bile duct cancers, and MRCP has higher sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy than endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Data support MRCP and CT as the preferred cholangiography methods. Direct cholangiography should only be performed when necessary; ERCP/PTC is not recommended for diagnosing extrahepatic CCA. For distal bile duct tumors when diagnosis or palliation is needed, an ERCP allows complete imaging and stenting, and brush cytology can be obtained. In jaundiced patients with extrahepatic CCA, workup should include noninvasive cholangiography with cross-sectional imaging to evaluate local extent. Although PET's role is not established, emerging evidence indicates it may be useful for detecting regional lymph node metastases and distant metastatic disease in otherwise potentially resectable patients.

Patients and methods

This was a 2-center (Stanford Medicine and Baylor College of Medicine; 2010–2022), retrospective cohort study of adult patients with PSC and IBD (as defined by American College of Gastroenterology [ACG] criteria) who were prescribed OVT at any time after their IBD diagnosis. Subjects were initially identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) coding for PSC, and were manually reviewed to ensure they met the ACG criteria for PSC. This cohort was subsequently further evaluated for IBD using ICD-10 coding. The diagnosis of IBD was verified by manual review of colonoscopy reports. Fig. 1 illustrates this identification of the study cohort. Patients suffering from any other cause of sclerosing cholangitis, those who received OVT prescriptions for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile colitis, or recipients of liver transplantation, were excluded. Data on OVT dosage and duration and timing (in relation to IBD disease activity) were collected and analyzed. OVT duration was defined as the time from OVT prescription to cessation of the drug; if a patient had multiple such periods, data for each period were recorded individually. Intensification of therapy was defined as therapy class change (e.g. 5-aminosalicylic acid to infliximab), dose escalation (e.g. infliximab 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg) or new steroid prescription, if they occurred at least 1 month after initiation of OVT. Given the uncertainty regarding the optimal latency time window, we also performed a secondary analysis with an exposure lag of 3 months, counting the first 3 months after prescription of OVT as being off therapy and the 3 months after discontinuation as being on therapy. Responders were defined as those who had fewer time-weighted events "on OVT", compared to time-weighted events "off OVT". Data on PSC-related complications (i.e. development of dominant or high-grade stricture, cholangitis, and development of cirrhosis) was also analyzed. All patients in the cohort underwent annual magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; dominant or high-grade stricture was determined by the radiologist, or an advanced endoscopist (if the patient underwent a follow-up endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). Cholangitis was identified by manual chart review, and defined as an episode of hospitalization requiring intravenous antibiotics for a condition that the treating physician (at the time of hospitalization) considered to be cholangitis. Cirrhosis was identified first via screening by ICD-10 coding, then confirmed with manual chart review using conventional clinical criteria.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [^96c60b3c]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent years have witnessed significant advances in the imaging, molecular profiling, and systemic treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Despite this progress, the early detection, precise classification, and effective management of CCA remain challenging. Owing to recent developments and the significant differences in CCA subtypes, EASL commissioned a panel of experts to draft evidence-based recommendations on the management of extrahepatic CCA, comprising distal and perihilar CCA. Particular attention is given to the need for accurate classification systems, the integration of emerging molecular insights, and practical strategies for diagnosis and treatment that reflect real-world clinical scenarios.

Impact of PSC on CAN

Prevalence of CAN in PSC-IBD

Gastrointestinal manifestations of PSC-UC are often non-specific; therefore, a rigorous IBD screening is essential following a diagnosis of PSC, primarily due to the increased risk of CAN (figure 3).PSC-UC carries a threefold to fivefold higher risk of CAN compared with UC alone, with lesions more frequently occurring in the right colon, consistent with the pattern of inflammation. Current guidelines recommend annual colonoscopy for surveillance starting at the time of PSC diagnosis, regardless of the duration, extent or activity of UC. In contrast, whether PSC increases the risk of CAN in CD remains unclear, as results across studies are conflicting. While some authors concluded that PSC in CD did not increase the risk of CAN, others did find an association between PSC and an elevated risk of CAN in CD.

Figure 3
Ulcerative colitis-associated rectal adenocarcinoma in a patient with concurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Diagnosis of CAN in PSC-IBD

Before widespread use of image-enhanced endoscopy, random biopsies improved CRC detection compared with non-protocol-based targeted biopsies in patients with PSC-UC. Currently, targeted sampling biopsies using dye-based chromoendoscopy, virtual electronic chromoendoscopy (eg, i-scan, Narrow Band Imaging, Blue Light Imaging) and high-definition white light endoscopy (when other techniques are unavailable) are recommended for the detection of dysplastic lesions.

Therapeutic approach of colitis-associated dysplasia or CAN in PSC-IBD

While colectomy was traditionally the treatment of choice for CAN, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal resection (ESR) are now also viable options. To date, the European guideline (European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO)) recommends endoscopic resection for visible, unifocal and endoscopically accessible lesions, including low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia, followed by intensive surveillance, with no differentiation between UC and PSC-UC. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that the risk of progression of low-grade dysplasia in patients with PSC-UC may be higher, requiring more aggressive approaches, including colectomy. Therefore, the risks (eg, oncological progression of CAN and endoscopy-associated complications) and benefits (eg, avoidance of colectomy) of EMR or ESR in patients with PSC-UC should be meticulously balanced.

In the case of indeterminate biliary strictures, ESGE suggests cholangioscopy-guided biopsies, in addition to standard ERCP diagnostic modalities. Additional intraductal biliary imaging modalities can be selectively used, based on clinical context, local expertise, and resource availability.

2.1	Recommended Evaluations and Immunizations Prior to and During Treatment

Perform the following prior to treatment with LEQSELVI:

CYP2C9 genotype determination: Test patients for CYP2C9 variants to determine CYP2C9 genotype. LEQSELVI is contraindicated in patients who are CYP2C9 poor metabolizers (patients with decreased cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 function) [see Contraindications (4)]. An FDA-cleared or -approved test for the detection of CYP2C9 variants to direct the use of LEQSELVI is not currently available.
Evaluation for use of concomitant CYP2C9 inhibitors: LEQSELVI is contraindicated in patients taking moderate or strong CYP2C9 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Active and latent tuberculosis (TB) evaluation: LEQSELVI treatment is not recommended in patients with active TB. For patients with latent TB or those with a negative latent TB test who are at high risk of TB, start preventive therapy for TB prior to LEQSELVI treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Viral hepatitis screening in accordance with clinical guidelines: LEQSELVI treatment is not recommended in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.
Hepatitis B infection screening: If hepatitis B infection is discovered, follow hepatitis B clinical guidelines, or refer to a liver specialist. Monitor patients for reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines during treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Complete blood count (CBC): LEQSELVI treatment is not recommended in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < 500 cells/mm3absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1,000 cells/mm3, or hemoglobin level < 8 g/dl. Monitor complete blood counts periodically during treatment and modify dosage as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].
Complete any necessary immunizations, including herpes zoster vaccinations, according to current immunization guidelines prior to LEQSELVI treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

2.2	Recommended Dosage

The recommended dosage of LEQSELVI for the treatment of severe alopecia areata is 8 mg orally twice daily, with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If a dose is missed, skip the missed dose and resume dosing at the next scheduled dose.

### Vyjuvek [^e9e7615b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is caused by mutation(s) in the COL7A1 gene, which results in reduced or absent levels of biologically active COL7.

Upon topical application to the wounds, VYJUVEK can transduce both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Following entry of VYJUVEK into the cells, the vector genome is deposited in the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, transcription of the encoded human COL7A1 is initiated. The resulting transcripts allow for production and secretion of COL7 by the cell in its mature form. These COL7 molecules arrange themselves into long, thin bundles that form anchoring fibrils. The anchoring fibrils hold the epidermis and dermis together and are essential for maintaining the integrity of the skin. Patients with autosomal dominant DEB (DDEB) have lower than normal functional anchoring fibrils, and patients with RDEB have no functional anchoring fibrils.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic activity (expression and localization of COL7 transgene) of VYJUVEK gel was demonstrated in an initial clinical study (n = 6 patients). Linear deposition of the non-collagenous domain 1 (NC1) and domain 2 (NC2) of COL7 were observed at the dermal-epidermal junction in skin biopsies harvested after VYJUVEK treatment.

### Oxcarbazepine [^1083ca0c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients

A study was conducted in pediatric patients (3 to 17 years old) with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures in which oxcarbazepine was added to existing AED therapy (up to 2 concomitant AEDs). By protocol, the dosage of concomitant AEDs could not be reduced as oxcarbazepine was added. Oxcarbazepine was titrated to reach a target dose ranging from 30 mg/kg to 46 mg/kg (based on a patient's body weight with fixed doses for predefined weight ranges).

Cognitive adverse events occurred in 5.8% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients (the single most common event being concentration impairment, 4 of 138 patients) and in 3.1% of patients treated with placebo. In addition, 34.8% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 14% of placebo-treated patients experienced somnolence. (No patient discontinued due to a cognitive adverse reaction or somnolence.) Finally, 23.2% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 7% of placebo-treated patients experienced ataxia or gait disturbances. Two (1.4%) oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 1 (0.8%) placebo-treated patient discontinued due to ataxia or gait disturbances.

5.8 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has occurred with oxcarbazepine. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Oxcarbazepine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

5.4.1.1 Evidence

The risk of high‐grade dysplasia and CRC in adult patients with PSC is 4–5 times greater compared to patients with IBD without PSC. Leading adult guidelines recommend to perform yearly surveillance colonoscopy from the time of diagnosis of PSC. Dye‐based or virtual chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies is increasingly recommended, although it has not been proven that these techniques are superior to high‐definition endoscopy without chromoendoscopy and random biopsies. Children with PSC–IBD seem to develop CRC at similar rates as adults, with approximately 5% affected 10 years after PSC diagnosis (see Figure 5). However, the absolute risk of being diagnosed with CRC before the age of 18 is low (0.2%).

Figure 5
Summary of CRC‐free survival in patients with PSC and IBD at 5 and 10 years after diagnosis. CRC, colorectal cancer; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.

It is important to note that there is a lack of substantial evidence supporting the effectiveness of surveillance colonoscopy. Current practice guidelines offer little guidance regarding the age to start cancer surveillance, the colonoscopy technique, and the screening interval (as outlined in Supporting Information: Table S16). As a result, there is a large variation in clinical practice, as was shown in a recently published survey among Dutch pediatric gastroenterologists.

5.4.1.2 Practical guidance

Recommendations for malignancy screening in adults with PSC–IBD are outlined in the ECCO Malignancy in IBD Guidelines. Strictly following these recommendations for children and adolescents with PSC–IBD would lead to unacceptably frequent procedures with no treatment consequences. We recommend including only those patients with a high‐risk profile in a surveillance colonoscopy program. This high‐risk profile includes individuals with ongoing colonic inflammation (fecal calprotectin > 150 µg/g or histologic active disease), a history of long‐standing colitis (8 years or more), or a family history of CRC in a first‐degree relative under the age of 50. When one of these risk factors is present, surveillance colonoscopy is usually conducted every other year. Pediatricians involved in CRC screening are advised to familiarize themselves with the "best practice advice" to enhance the quality of screening. Some centers involve endoscopists from the adult GI department in CRC screening for adolescents.

### Pioglitazole and metformin hydrochloride [^4f2cb6d3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% versus 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% versus 43.5%).

Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient's usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n = 2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n = 12).

Urinary Bladder Tumors

Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.59–1.72) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Pediatric Patients:

Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions

Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis):

Meropenem was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows:

Diarrhea 3.5%

Rash 1.6%

Nausea and Vomiting 0.8%

Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis:

Meropenem was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows:

Diarrhea 4.7%

Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1%

Oral Moniliasis 1.9%

Glossitis 1.0%

In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes.

Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age):

Meropenem was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to meropenem.

The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows:

Convulsion 5.0%

Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5%

Vomiting 2.5%

Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients:

Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies.

2.1 Assessments Prior to Starting Each MAVENCLAD Treatment Course

Cancer Screening

Follow standard cancer screening guidelines because of the risk of malignancies [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Pregnancy

Exclude pregnancy prior to treatment with MAVENCLAD in females of reproductive potential [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Complete Blood Count (CBC)

Obtain a CBC with differential including lymphocyte count [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Lymphocytes must be:

within normal limits before initiating the first treatment course
at least 800 cells per microliter before initiating the second treatment course

If necessary, delay the second treatment course for up to 6 months to allow for recovery of lymphocytes to at least 800 cells per microliter. If this recovery takes more than 6 months, the patient should not receive further treatment with MAVENCLAD.

Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

Exclude HIV infection.
Perform tuberculosis screening.
Screen for hepatitis B and C.
Evaluate for acute infection. Consider a delay in MAVENCLAD treatment until any acute infection is fully controlled.
Vaccination of patients who are seronegative for VZV is recommended prior to initiation of MAVENCLAD.
Vaccination of patients who are seropositive to VZV is recommended with zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted. Patients may be administered zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted at any time prior to or during the year 1 or year 2 course of MAVENCLAD treatment. These patients may also be administered the vaccine if their lymphocyte counts are ≤ 500 cells per microliter.
Administer all immunizations (except as noted for VZV) according to immunization guidelines prior to starting MAVENCLAD. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting MAVENCLAD.

Adjunctive Therapy for Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 4 to Less Than 17 Years of Age

The efficacy of LYRICA as adjunctive therapy in partial‑onset seizures was established in a 12‑week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in pediatric patients 4 years to less than 17 years of age with partial‑onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. During an 8-week baseline period, patients had to experience at least 6 partial‑onset seizures with no seizure-free period exceeding 4 weeks. The mean duration of epilepsy was 6 years and the mean and median baseline seizure frequencies were 57 and 18 seizures per month, respectively. Approximately 74% of the patients were taking 2 to 3 concurrent AEDs at baseline. Among the LYRICA-treated patients, 87% completed the double‑blind phase of the study.

In this study, LYRICA 2.5 mg/kg/day (maximum 150 mg/day) and 10 mg/kg/day (maximum 600 mg/day) were compared to placebo. Administration of each daily dose was divided into two equal doses (twice a day dosing). Because of higher weight-normalized clearance in patients with body weight less than 30 kg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the LYRICA dose was increased by 40% to 3.5 mg/kg/day for patients weighing less than 30 kg randomized to the 2.5 mg/kg/day group or to 14 mg/kg/day for patients randomized to the 10 mg/kg/day group.

Table 12 shows median baseline seizure rates, median percent change from baseline in seizure rates, and percent difference relative to placebo (derived from the primary analysis model) by dose.

There was evidence of a dose-response relationship for total daily doses of LYRICA between 2.5 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day. A significant improvement in seizure rate was observed for LYRICA 10 mg/kg/day group compared with placebo. While the 2.5 mg/kg/day group performed numerically better than placebo, this difference was not statistically significant.

A key secondary efficacy measure, the responder rate (proportion of patients with greater than or equal to 50% reduction from baseline in partial seizure frequency) showed improvements for LYRICA groups compared with placebo. The following figure displays responder rate by dose:

### A mobile app to improve adherence to colorectal cancer screening and post polypectomy surveillance guidelines [^10ab4f50]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite significant advances in prevention and early detection, colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Inadequate adherence and/or lack of knowledge of guidelines have shown to prevent adequate screening and surveillance recommendations and hinder effective screening programs.

Objective

Evaluate the implementation and real-world impact of a mobile app designed to optimize CRC screening and surveillance in accordance to recently updated guidelines.

Methods

A mobile app including ergonomic algorithms integrating all pertinent guideline information was created by a group of experts. Data were collected from Catalonia healthcare professionals using the app between February 2023 and May 2024. Users' characteristics, consultation types, and patient data were analyzed to assess app's implementation, usage patterns, and impact on CRC screening and surveillance outcomes.

Results

A total of 12,481 consultations were recorded; 3,054 (24.4%) screening and 9,427 (75.6%) post-polypectomy surveillance consultations. The app was increasingly and repeatedly used by professionals during the study period (72% retention rate). Among screening consultations, 2,082 (68.2%) patients were classified as average risk, suggesting the use of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) instead of colonoscopy. Among surveillance consultations, the app advised deferring follow-up colonoscopies and using FOBT instead in 4,748 (50%) patients based on negative index colonoscopy or the presence of low-risk polyps. Standard surveillance with colonoscopy at 3 years was recommended for 3,224 (34.1%) patients and intensive surveillance, requiring a colonoscopy at 1 year, was indicated for 749 (7.9%) patients.

Conclusions

A CRC screening and surveillance mobile app showed remarkable acceptance and uptake among healthcare professionals. Proper implementation of updated guidelines aided by the use of the app could significantly reduce the number of unnecessary screening and post-polypectomy surveillance colonoscopies, as well as help identifying high risk patients who require intensive surveillance.

Clinical Trial

### Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) [^7f921738]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients

A study was conducted in pediatric patients (3 to 17 years old) with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures in which TRILEPTAL was added to existing AED therapy (up to 2 concomitant AEDs). By protocol, the dosage of concomitant AEDs could not be reduced as TRILEPTAL was added. TRILEPTAL was titrated to reach a target dose ranging from 30 mg/kg to 46 mg/kg (based on a patient's body weight with fixed doses for predefined weight ranges).

Cognitive adverse events occurred in 5.8% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients (the single most common event being concentration impairment, 4 of 138 patients) and in 3.1% of patients treated with placebo. In addition, 34.8% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 14.0% of placebo-treated patients experienced somnolence (no patient discontinued due to a cognitive adverse reaction or somnolence). Finally, 23.2% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 7.0% of placebo-treated patients experienced ataxia or gait disturbances. Two (1.4%) oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 1 (0.8%) placebo-treated patient discontinued due to ataxia or gait disturbances.

5.8

	Drug Reaction With Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms/Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has occurred with TRILEPTAL. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. TRILEPTAL should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

2.4 Dose Modification Guidelines in Hepatic Impairment and Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic Impairment

In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the recommended dose of ZYTIGA to 250 mg once daily. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. If elevations in ALT and/or AST greater than 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin greater than 3 × ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment, discontinue ZYTIGA and do not re-treat patients with ZYTIGA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Do not use ZYTIGA in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).

Hepatotoxicity

For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment with ZYTIGA (ALT and/or AST greater than 5 × ULN or total bilirubin greater than 3 × ULN), interrupt treatment with ZYTIGA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 750 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 × ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN. For patients who resume treatment, monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin at a minimum of every two weeks for three months and monthly thereafter.

If hepatotoxicity recurs at the dose of 750 mg once daily, re-treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 500 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 × ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN.

If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 500 mg once daily, discontinue treatment with ZYTIGA.

Permanently discontinue ZYTIGA for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 × ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 × ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Concurrent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease may decrease liver fibrosis severity in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^aea8b0a4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and population

This retrospective study was conducted by Peking University People's Hospital in Beijing, China, from January 2018 to August 2023. Inclusion criteria for participants encompassed individuals aged 18 years and above diagnosed with PBC or PBC/NAFLD, possessing detailed clinical and laboratory information as per medical records review. The diagnosis of PBC was established based on at least two of the following three criteria being present according to the 2018 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines: (1) persistently elevated serum ALP levels of greater than six months duration, (2) a positive (≥ 1:80 titre) antimitochondrial antibody test and (3) liver histology in keeping with PBC. The diagnosis of NAFLD was confirmed by the presence of hepatic steatosis on abdominal imaging, characterized by heightened echogenicity relative to the right kidney, reduced visualization of portal echoes, and hepatomegaly, in the absence of a readily identified alternative cause of steatosis (e.g. medications, starvation, monogenic disorders) in individuals who drink little or no alcohol (defined as < 20 g/d for women and < 30 g/d for men) according to the 2023 AASLD guidelines. Participants were excluded from the study if they exhibited the following criteria: (1) incomplete clinical data; (2) presence of additional liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis B and C infections, drug-induced liver disease, hereditary hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), IgG4 disease as well as alcohol-associated liver disease.; (3) less than one year of follow-up. Written informed consent was not deemed necessary for this study, as it had received approval from the Medical Ethics Committee of Peking University People's Hospital (No. 2022PHB231-001). The study protocol adhered to the ethical guidelines of the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki (2024).

### Abatacept (Orencia) [^e919414f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Infections

Serious infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, have been reported in patients receiving ORENCIA (serious infections were reported in 3% and 1.9% of RA patients treated with intravenous ORENCIA and placebo, respectively) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Some of these infections have been fatal. Many of the serious infections have occurred in patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy which in addition to their underlying disease, could further predispose them to infection. A higher rate of serious infections has been observed in adult RA patients treated with concurrent TNF antagonists and ORENCIA compared to those treated with ORENCIA alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Healthcare providers should exercise caution when considering the use of ORENCIA in patients with a history of recurrent infections, underlying conditions which may predispose them to infections, or chronic, latent, or localized infections. Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with ORENCIA should be monitored closely. Administration of ORENCIA should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection.

Prior to initiating ORENCIA, patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection according to current TB guidelines. ORENCIA has not been studied in patients with a positive TB screen, and the safety of ORENCIA in individuals with latent TB infection is unknown. Patients testing positive in TB screening should be treated by standard medical practice prior to therapy with ORENCIA.

Antirheumatic therapies have been associated with hepatitis B reactivation. Therefore, screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with published guidelines before starting therapy with ORENCIA. In clinical studies with ORENCIA, patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded from study.

5.4 Immunizations

Prior to initiating ORENCIA in pediatric and adult patients, update vaccinations in accordance with current vaccination guidelines. ORENCIA-treated patients may receive current non-live vaccines. Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ORENCIA or within 3 months after discontinuation. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving ORENCIA. In addition, there are clinical considerations for administering live vaccines to infants who were exposed to ORENCIA while in utero [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Based on its mechanism of action, ORENCIA may blunt the effectiveness of some immunizations.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^92cbde28]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### Sulfasalazine for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis (SHIP) [^5f8f8930]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Sulfasalazine for the Treatment of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled trial to assess the benefit of sulfasalazine in the treatment of PSC. The specific objectives of this study are to determine if sulfasalazine treatment 1) results in reduced serum ALP and other biomarkers of liver injury in PSC; 2) improves PSC patient symptoms; and 3) is safe in patients with PSC. We are recruiting remotely throughout the United States so an individual anywhere in the US with PSC and IBD can be enrolled. As there is a strong association between PSC and IBD, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a therapy of proven benefit for UC may prove to also be effective for PSC. Unfortunately, several therapies which are indicated for the treatment of UC have not been effective in PSC including anti-TNF therapies and other anti-inflammatory medications.

Sulfasalazine and mesalamine, medications commonly used for the treatment of UC, may be exceptions to this trend. While this therapy has never been formally tested in PSC, some retrospective reports suggest a possible benefit. Our current understanding of the mechanism of action of these medications suggests there is reasonable to believe they may also be effective in PSC. We are recruiting remotely throughout the United States so an individual anywhere in the US with PSC and IBD can be enrolled. Drug: Sulfasalazine Drug: Placebo

### ONS / ASCO guideline on the management of antineoplastic extravasation [^042c185c]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### Bexarotene [^404fae17]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tumor response was assessed in both trials by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. Also considered in response assessment was the presence or absence of cutaneous tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations.

All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions without worsening, or development of new cutaneous tumors or non-cutaneous manifestations. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of all manifestations of disease, but did not require confirmation by biopsy.

At the initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day, 1/62 (1.6%) of patients had a complete clinical tumor response and 19/62 (30%) of patients had a partial tumor response. The rate of relapse (25% increase in CA or worsening of other aspects of disease) in the 20 patients who had a tumor response was 6/20 (30%) over a median duration of observation of 21 weeks, and the median duration of tumor response had not been reached. Responses were seen as early as 4 weeks and new responses continued to be seen at later visits.

### Ceritinib (Zykadia) [^1bc8af4e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with ceritinib.

Ceritinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay but induced numerical aberrations (aneugenic) in the in vitro cytogenetic assay using human lymphocytes, and micronuclei in the in vitro micronucleus test using TK6 cells. Ceritinib was not clastogenic in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay.

There are no data on the effect of ceritinib on human fertility. Fertility/early embryonic development studies were not conducted with ceritinib. There were no adverse effects on male or female reproductive organs in general toxicology studies conducted in monkeys and rats at exposures ≥ 0.5- and 1.5-fold, respectively, of the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose.

13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology

Target organs in nonclinical animal models included, but were not limited to, the pancreas, biliopancreatic/bile ducts, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. Pancreatic focal acinar cell atrophy was observed in rats at 1.5-fold the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Biliopancreatic duct and bile duct necrosis was observed in rats at exposures ≥ 5% of the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Bile duct inflammation and vacuolation were also noted in monkeys at exposures ≥ 0.5-fold the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Frequent minimal necrosis and hemorrhage of the duodenum was exhibited in monkeys at 0.5-fold the human exposure by AUC, and in rats at an exposure similar to that observed clinically.

Ceritinib crossed the blood brain barrier in rats with a brain-to-blood exposure (AUCinf) ratio of approximately 15%.

Figure 2 displays the results of the primary outcome on a monthly basis.

Glatiramer Acetate Injection 40 mg per mL three times per week

Study 5 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study with a total of 1404 patients with RRMS randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either glatiramer acetate injection 40 mg per mL (n = 943) or placebo (n = 461) three times a week for 12 months. Patients had a median of 2 relapses in the 2 years prior to screening and had not received any interferon-beta for at least 2 months prior to screening. Baseline EDSS scores ranged from 0 to 5.5 with a median of 2.5. Neurological evaluations were performed at baseline, every three months, and at unscheduled visits for suspected relapse or early termination. MRI was performed at baseline, months 6 and 12, or early termination. A total of 91% of those assigned to glatiramer acetate and 93% of those assigned to placebo completed treatment at 12 months.

The primary outcome measure was the total number of confirmed relapses (persistence of neurological symptoms for at least 48 hours confirmed on examination with objective signs). The effect of glatiramer acetate on several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) variables, including number of new or enlarging T2 lesions and number of enhancing lesions on T1-weighted images, was also measured at months 6 and 12.

Table 6 presents the results for the intent-to-treat population.

### Multiple intracranial hemorrhages in a postmenopausal female [^e51b5d11]. Brain Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 CLINICAL HISTORY AND IMAGING

A 53‐year‐old postmenopausal female presented to the neurology clinic with acute onset of right arm weakness for 1 week. Neurologic examination was notable for 4/5 strength in the right upper extremity. Computed tomography revealed multiple hematomas with mass effect in the left frontal lobe and basal ganglia (Figure 1A; Box 1). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium showed multiple heterogeneously enhancing lesions associated with surrounding edema, mass effect, and midline shift (Figure 1B). Given the absence of an overt primary source for the hemorrhagic mass with elevated intracranial pressure and neurologic deficits, surgical excision of the left frontal lobe lesion was performed. Intraoperatively, the mass showed evidence of prior hemorrhage and was noted to encase a relatively large vessel. Postoperative CT imaging showed gross total resection of the frontal lesion and found a new lesion adjacent to the left lateral ventricle (Figure 1A inset). Of notice in the past medical history, the patient had undergone hysterectomy 3 years earlier. After a final diagnosis was reached, adjuvant treatment was performed with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and chemotherapy. At 10 months of follow‐up, the patient's symptoms have resolved.

### Cholic acid (Cholbam) [^6a231838]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

These trials were carried out over many years, and data are not available on all patients. Thirty-nine patients in Trial 1 and 5 new patients in Trial 2 received at least one dose of CHOLBAM and had sufficient data available to assess baseline liver function and effects of CHOLBAM treatment. A responder analysis was performed to determine the response to treatment with CHOLBAM.

Response to CHOLBAM treatment was assessed by the following laboratory criteria:

ALT or AST values reduced to less than 50 U/L, or baseline levels reduced by 80%;
total bilirubin values reduced to less than or equal to 1 mg/dL; and
no evidence of cholestasis on liver biopsy;

and the following clinical criteria:

body weight increased by 10% or stable at greater than the 50thpercentile; and
survival for greater than 3 years on treatment or alive at the end of Trial 2.

CHOLBAM responders were defined as patients who either:

met at least two laboratory criteria and were alive at the last follow-up; or
met at least one laboratory criteria, had increased body weight, and were alive at the last follow-up.

### An upgraded rotatable sphincterotome enhances bile duct cannulation via balloon endoscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^17339da4]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Bile duct cannulation via balloon endoscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be challenging, particularly in complex anatomical scenarios. This case report emphasizes the clinical application of a novel rotatable sphincterotome in a 75-year-old man who presented to a local clinic with a 1-week history of bilirubinuria. The patient had a history of gastric cancer and had undergone a distal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction 6 years previously. Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver enzymes, prompting a referral to our hospital. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed mild common bile duct wall thickening and stricture with upstream biliary dilation (Fig. 1, Fig. 2), which was eventually diagnosed as recurrent gastric cancer 6 months after ERCP.

Fig. 1
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography in a patient with a history of gastric cancer treated with distal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y reconstruction revealed mild thickening and stricture (arrow) of the common bile duct wall and upstream biliary dilation.

Fig. 2
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a stricture of the common bile duct with upstream biliary dilation.

A double-balloon endoscope was used to access the papilla. However, significant challenges prevented successful bile duct cannulation. Retroflex position, a technique often used to facilitate cannulation, was unsuccessful due to the narrow duodenal lumen. Furthermore, conventional sphincterotomy failed as the instrument could not rotate adequately under balloon-assisted endoscopy, and the curvature of the knife did not align with the bile duct axis. Subsequently, a novel, upgraded sphincterotome (Aimingtome; Asahi Intecc Co. Ltd. Seto, Japan) was used (Fig. 3). This device features a more rotatable and flexible tip, which enabled guidewire insertion into the duodenal papilla (Video 1). The guidewire was then successfully advanced into the main pancreatic duct, facilitating bile duct cannulation via the pancreatic duct guidewire technique. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed using the same sphincterotome (Fig. 4), followed by the placement of a biliary plastic stent (Fig. 5). The patient was discharged 3 days after the procedure. In cases where frontal visualization of the papilla using balloon endoscopy-assisted ERCP is challenging, the use of a novel rotatable sphincterotome can effectively facilitate bile duct cannulation and subsequent endoscopic sphincterotomy.

### Amikacin (Arikayce) [^c424c797]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Trial 1 (NCT#02344004) was an open-label, randomized (2:1), multi-center trial in patients with refractory Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease as confirmed by at least 2 sputum culture results. Patients were considered to have refractory MAC lung disease if they did not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum duration of 6 consecutive months of background regimen therapy that was either ongoing or stopped no more than 12 months before the screening visit. Patients were randomized to either ARIKAYCE plus a background regimen or background regimen alone. The surrogate endpoint for assessing efficacy was based on achieving culture conversion (3 consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures) by Month 6. The date of conversion was defined as the date of the first of the 3 negative monthly cultures, which had to be achieved by Month 4 in order to meet the endpoint by Month 6. Patients who achieved culture conversion by Month 6 were continued on study drug (ARIKAYCE plus background regimen or background regimen alone based on their randomization) for a total of 12 months after the first negative sputum culture.

A total of 336 patients were randomized (ARIKAYCE plus background regimen, n = 224; background regimen alone, n = 112) (ITT population), with a mean age of 64.7 years and there was a higher percentage of females (69.3%) than males (30.7%) in the study. At the time of enrollment, of the 336 subjects in the ITT population, 302 (89.9%) were either on a guideline-based regimen for MAC or off guideline-based therapy for MAC for less than 3 months while 34 (10.1%) were off treatment for 3 to 12 months prior to enrollment. At screening, patients were stratified by smoking status (current smoker or not) and by whether patients were on treatment or off treatment for at least 3 months. Most patients at screening were not current smokers (89.3%) and had underlying bronchiectasis (62.5%). At baseline, 329 patients were on a multidrug background regimen that included a macrolide (93.3%), a rifamycin (86.3%), or ethambutol (81.4%). Overall, 55.6% of subjects were receiving a triple-drug background regimen consisting of a macrolide, a rifamycin and ethambutol.

### Porfimer sodium (Photofrin) [^4d69cc21]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the PHOTOFRIN PDT + omeprazole (OM) group, severe adverse reactions included chest pain of non- cardiac origin, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, regurgitation, and heartburn. The severity of these symptoms decreased within 4 to 6 weeks following treatment.

The majority of the photosensitivity reactions occurred within 90 days following PHOTOFRIN and was of mild (68%) or moderate (24%) intensity. Fourteen (10%) patients reported severe reactions, all of which resolved. The typical reaction was described as skin disorder, sunburn or rash, and affected mostly the face, hands, and neck. Associated symptoms and signs were swelling, pruritis, erythema, blisters, burning sensation, and feeling of heat.

The majority of esophageal stenosis including strictures reported in the PHOTOFRIN PDT + OM group were of mild (57%) or moderate (35%) intensity, while approximately 8% were of severe intensity. The majority of esophageal strictures were reported during Course 2 of treatment. All esophageal strictures were considered to be due to treatment. Most esophageal strictures were manageable through dilations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

NOTE: Adverse reactions classified using MedDRA 5.0 dictionary with the exception of esophageal stricture and esophageal narrowing.

Laboratory Abnormalities

In patients with esophageal cancer, PDT with PHOTOFRIN may result in anemia due to tumor bleeding. No significant effects were observed for other parameters in patients with endobronchial carcinoma or with HGD in BE.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of PHOTOFRIN with PDT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infusion reactions: Infusion reactions including urticaria, bradycardia, hypotension, dizziness, and hypertension.

### Predictive factors for the coexistence of colorectal lateral spreading tumors and colorectal polyps, and risk factors for malignancy [^b642065e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have indicated that LST patients are typically around 65 years old and predominantly male, aligning with our findings. Similarly, a retrospective study by Shen et al. demonstrated that males and individuals aged between 50 and 75 have a higher incidence of colorectal polyps and LSTs, though these factors did not influence the malignancy risk. Other studies have identified male gender and advanced age as risk factors for colorectal polyps, which may explain the significant differences observed in our study when LSTs coexist with polyps. We also found that patents ≥ 50 years (including those ≥ 75 years) are at a higher risk of malignant LST, suggesting that even patients ≥ 75 should alert the risk of colorectal cancer, though the USPSTF recommends routine screening up to age 75. However, further research is needed to determine whether elderly patients with LSTs have a higher likelihood of harboring advanced histology.

Serum tumor markers serve as valuable adjuncts in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of colorectal cancer (CRC). A meta-analysis reported that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has a sensitivity of 46% and a specificity of 89% for CRC diagnosis. In contrast, carbohydrate antigen 19 − 9 (CA 19 − 9) demonstrates a lower sensitivity of approximately 30% but a higher specificity of 92%. Recent research suggests that the combined use of multiple tumor markers may improve diagnostic accuracy and prognostic stratification. In the present study, serum tumor markers, including CA 19 − 9 and CEA, were measured. Univariate analysis showed no significant association with LST-polyp coexistence (P > 0.05), consistent with their exclusion from multivariate models based on a P < 0.05 threshold in baseline comparisons. Regardless of the coexistence of colonic polyps, CA 19 − 9 levels were significantly elevated in the malignant LST group compared to the non-malignant group. The significant CA 19 − 9 elevation in the malignant group suggests a potential role in malignancy risk, warranting further investigation with adjusted models in larger cohorts. However, given the relatively small sample size and the retrospective design, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Further large-scale studies are needed to validate these results and explore the potential utility of CA 19 − 9 as a predictive biomarker for LST malignancy.

### Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) [^fd293a05]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis occurred in patients treated with LEMTRADA and interferon beta-1a in controlled clinical studies. Active and latent tuberculosis cases occurred in 0.3% of LEMTRADA-treated patients, most often in endemic regions. Perform tuberculosis screening according to local guidelines prior to initiation of LEMTRADA. For patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening, treat by standard medical practice prior to therapy with LEMTRADA.

Fungal Infections

Fungal infections, especially oral and vaginal candidiasis, occurred more commonly in LEMTRADA-treated patients (12%) than in patients treated with interferon beta-1a (3%) in controlled clinical studies in MS.

Infections in Non-MS Patients

During postmarketing use, serious and sometimes fatal viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal infections, including some due to reactivation of latent infections, have been reported in the treatment of patients with B-CLL, as well as other disorders, generally at higher and more frequent doses than recommended in MS.

Hepatitis

No data are available on the association of LEMTRADA with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) reactivation because patients with evidence of active or chronic infections were excluded from the clinical studies. Consider screening patients at high risk of HBV and/or HCV infection before initiation of LEMTRADA and exercise caution in prescribing LEMTRADA to patients identified as carriers of HBV and/or HCV as these patients may be at risk of irreversible liver damage relative to a potential virus reactivation as a consequence of their pre-existing status.

### Vancomycin in primary sclerosing cholangitis in Italy (vanC-IT) [^9b7a5a52]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis in Italy ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Primary sclerosing cholangitis is chronic fibroinflammatory disease of the liver. There is still no medical therapy proven to halt the progression of PSC or prevent its serious complications. This is a Phase 2 randomized, double bind, placebo-controlled, monocentric study evaluating the safety and efficacy of two doses of oral vancomycin in subject between 15
- 70 years old with PSC. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is chronic fibroinflammatory disease of the liver characterized by chronic inflammation and sclerosis of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts, and a risk for progression to liver failure and development of colorectal and hepatobiliary cancer. Both children and adults are affected. Patients with PSC have a diminished life expectancy with a median survival of 17 years after diagnosis.

Despite the high mortality associated with PSC and the efforts to optimize its management, there is no medical therapy proven to halt the progression of PSC or prevent its serious complications. There is a strong yet poorly understood relationship between PSC and inflammatory bowel disease; nearly 70%-80% of PSC patients have IBD, mainly ulcerative colitis. Increasing evidence is pointing out the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of PSC. The 'leaky gut' theory implies that either bacteria or their toxic metabolites translocate from the inflamed intestinal mucosa into the portal circulation and into the liver causing liver and biliary injury. The gut microbiota of PSC patients, compared to IBD patients and healthy controls, showed decreased microbial diversity, and over-represented intestinal pathobionts.

Several antibiotics, including vancomycin and metronidazole, have been investigated in PSC. The use of oral vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic has been reported to be associated with improvement in clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities in patients with PSC; however, prospective studies in adult and young adult patients in Europe are lacking. Our scientific community therefore seeks to examine the safety and efficacy of OV in patients with PSC in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. This is a Phase 2 randomized, double bind, placebo-controlled, monocentric study evaluating the safety and efficacy of two doses of oral vancomycin in subject between 15
- 70 years old with PSC with or without IBD. The study will consist of 10-week screening period, 24 weeks of treatment, and follow-up visits at 4 and 12 weeks after completion of treatment to evaluate what happens after treatment stop.

Subjects will be randomized to placebo or treatment and stratifying by baseline presence of fibrosis by fibroscan value at baseline, as this parameter could affect the likelihood of reaching the primary composite outcome measure. The knowledge gained from our proposed clinical trial will help us determine if OV should be considered as a treatment option in patients with PSC. Furthermore, the use of state-of-the art technology applied in this study will shed light on the relationship between the gut microbiome, bile acids, immune-mediators, including cytokines, and PSC.

3) If you have autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), do not use SAMSCA because you should receive the medicine (tolvaptan) through a program that ensures laboratory monitoring of your liver.

What is SAMSCA?

SAMSCA is a prescription medicine used to help increase low sodium levels in the blood, in adults with conditions such as heart failure, and certain hormone imbalances. SAMSCA helps raise salt levels in your blood by removing extra body water as urine.

It is not known if SAMSCA is safe or works in children.

Who should not take SAMSCA?

Do not take SAMSCA if:

you are allergic to tolvaptan or any of the ingredients in SAMSCA. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in SAMSCA.
the sodium level in your blood must be increased right away.
you cannot replace fluids by drinking or you cannot feel if you are thirsty.
you are dizzy, faint, or your kidneys are not working normally because you have lost too much body fluid.
you take certain medicines. These medicines could cause you to have too much SAMSCA in your blood:
the antibiotic medicines, clarithromycin (Biaxin, Biaxin XL) or telithromycin (Ketek)
the antifungal medicines, ketoconazole (Nizoral) or itraconazole (Sporanox)
the anti-HIV medicines, ritonavir (Kaletra, Norvir), indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), and saquinavir (Invirase)

### European Respiratory Society clinical practice guideline for the management of adult bronchiectasis [^b3514a6e]. The European Respiratory Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following investigations and management in a deteriorating patient:

- obtain a comprehensive re-evaluation of patients and their treatment in cases of clinical deterioration, including increasing exacerbation frequency and/or severity, worsening of symptoms, and/or rapid decline in lung function

- evaluate adherence to both airway clearance techniques and/or pharmacological treatment

- review underlying diseases other than bronchiectasis to ensure they are being adequately treated

- consider obtaining investigation for specific conditions known to be associated with deterioration, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, or infection with a new pathogen

- recognize that early diagnosis of bronchiectasis, accurate identification and treatment of its underlying cause, adequate management of chronic airway infection, and interventions to prevent exacerbations and control disease may delay disease progression

- obtain repeat chest CT imaging to identify several potential causes of deterioration

- obtain repeat testing for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection when there are suggestive clinical or radiologic features, particularly in patients who deteriorate despite appropriate antibiotics

- refer deteriorating patients who are not already under the care of a bronchiectasis specialist to a respiratory clinic with expertise in bronchiectasis

- review and optimize current treatment using a "treatable traits" approach. This includes, but is not limited to, treatment directed at the underlying etiology of the patient's bronchiectasis, airway clearance and mucoactive treatments, vaccination status, long-term (inhaled or oral) antibiotic treatment, P. aeruginosa eradication treatment, long-term inhaled bronchodilator and corticosteroid treatment, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, and non-invasive ventilatory support where appropriate

- consider offering lung resection in highly selected patients with localized disease whose symptoms are not controlled by medical treatment optimized by a bronchiectasis specialist

- recognize that early referral for lung transplantation is essential in patients with progressive disease despite optimal medical management. This may include rapidly declining forced expiratory volume in one second or forced expiratory volume in one second ≤ 30% predicted, and/or arterial CO2 pressure ≥ 50 mmHg. (conditional recommendation for the intervention, very low certainty of evidence).

Hold the tablet with your thumbs placed close to the scored part of the tablet (groove). Then apply gentle pressure and snap the tablet segments apart (segments breaking incorrectly should not be used). The segments should be washed down unchewed, with water, keeping the segments in the mouth can reveal a bitter taste. Due to the bitter taste, segments should be stored separately from whole tablets [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

### Quality standards and curriculum for training in cholangiopancreatoscopy: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) position statement [^d67877d8]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Quality Standards

Competence in cholangioscopy should be defined as the ability to successfully perform the procedure effectively, without trainer assistance, in 80% of procedures. Cholangioscopy should be performed in endoscopy units with a high yearly volume of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) of all grades of complexity. Cholangiopancreatoscopy practice should be considered as standard or advanced as follows: - STANDARD: Cholangioscopy for extrahepatic biliary stones; evaluation of extrahepatic biliary strictures; selective ductal guidewire cannulation and removal of migrated biliary stents/foreign body extraction - ADVANCED: Cholangioscopy for intrahepatic biliary strictures or complex hepatolithiasis; percutaneous cholangioscopy and pancreatoscopy. Endoscopy units undertaking standard cholangioscopy should have prompt access to the following (on site or within a defined rapidly responsive network): - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)- Interventional radiology (on-site) and hepaticopancreaticobiliary (HPB) surgery - HPB multidisciplinary meetings (MDMs). Complete extrahepatic stone clearance at the initial cholangioscopy session should be successful in 80% of intention-to-treat cases. Cholangioscopy is recommended with visually guided biopsies in the evaluation of undefined biliary strictures, ideally at index ERCP to prevent negative visual and histological effects of prior stenting; except in cases with an associated mass lesion that may allow tissue acquisition by other means (e.g. EUS or percutaneous biopsy). In cholangioscopic evaluation of extrahepatic biliary strictures, visual assessment should be achieved in > 90% of cases, and at least 4 visually guided biopsies should be undertaken with sufficient tissue for histological assessment being obtained in > 80% of cases. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy is indicated in patients with transhepatic bile duct access in cases of altered anatomy or failed ERCP and an indication for cholangioscopy (stone management; biliary stricture evaluation; foreign body removal).

Curriculum For Training

Cholangioscopy is considered an advanced adjunct to ERCP, and prior to undertaking supervised cholangioscopic procedures trainees should be competent in the basic skills of ERCP (Schutz level 1 and 2) as defined by ESGE (duodenal intubation; biliary cannulation; distal bile duct stenting; ≤ 10-mm stone extraction). Cholangioscopy training should take place in expert referral centers with a high volume of ERCP and cholangioscopy cases. A trainee's principal trainer should be an experienced trainer ideally with at least 3 years of experience in undertaking independent cholangioscopy to the determined quality standards. Competence in cholangioscopy should be defined as the ability to successfully perform the procedure effectively without trainer assistance in 80% of procedures.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^6324852b]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Combined hepatocellular carcinoma–cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) diagnosis and management — cHCC-CCA is a rare hepatobiliary tumor type, and resection for those with early-stage disease is the only potentially curative option. Diagnosis of cHCC-CCA through imaging is difficult since imaging characteristics consist of varying features of both HCC and CCA; therefore, misdiagnosis may occur. Though AFP levels may be elevated in patients with cHCC-CCA, levels tend to not differ significantly from that of patients with HCC, and cHCC-CCA may also be characterized by elevated serum CA 19–9, similar to intrahepatic CCA. If cHCC-CCA is suspected, thorough pathology review is recommended; biopsy and sequencing can help in disease management if there are actionable mutations. It should be noted that needle biopsies will not necessarily show both elements of the malignancy, and multidisciplinary management is required.

Initially episodic, the left-sided headaches became continuous and were accompanied by systemic symptoms such as weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Over subsequent weeks, the neurologic examination revealed new-onset left-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and marked visual acuity loss. This article explores the differential diagnosis for such a complex clinical presentation and highlights how a systematic diagnostic approach can guide clinicians toward the correct diagnosis.

### Carbamazepine (Carbatrol) [^c5970feb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made.

Carbatrol should be used with caution in patients with a mixed seizure disorder that includes atypical absence seizures, since in these patients carbamazepine has been associated with increased frequency of generalized convulsions (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance, including second- and third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block; cardiac, hepatic, or renal damage; adverse hematologic or hypersensitivity reaction to other drugs including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with carbamazepine.

AV block, including second- and third-degree block, has been reported following carbamazepine treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances.

Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of hepatic failure, have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition, rare instances of vanishing bile duct syndrome have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as multiorgan hypersensitivity/ DRESS and serious dermatologic reactions. As an example, there has been a report of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and in another case an association with fever and eosinophilia.

### Impact of universal screening for HDV in HBV-infected patients on chronic HDV detection rate in Israel [^8dde04ed]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

Guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommend HDV screening for HIV‐positive persons, persons who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, those at risk for sexually transmitted diseases and immigrants from areas of high HDV endemicity. Patients with low HBV‐DNA levels and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels may also be considered for HDV screening. On the other hand, HBV and HDV guidelines from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver simply promote universal anti‐HDV screening as part of the robust evaluation recommended for the HBV patient.

In Israel, no formal guidance has been issued regarding HDV screening in the HBsAg‐positive population, and therefore anti‐HDV testing is based on the index of suspicion of the treating physician. In agreement with EASL guidelines, since 2010, Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC), a large tertiary care hospital in Southern Israel, has adopted a local policy of universal screening for HDV in all newly diagnosed HBsAg‐positive patients. In this study, we set out to evaluate the sensitivity of universal vs. the AASLD risk‐based screening in identifying HDV infected patients among patients with chronic HBV infection.

### Diclofenac epolamine [^46217123]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.

In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days.

Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: guideline development and consensus validation [^d92e6e42]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, more specifically with respect to prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain, AIWG-ICG 2025 guidelines recommend to co-prescribe metformin with any antipsychotic if there is > 3% increase in baseline body weight during the first year of treatment with an antipsychotic.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^f3d2bcdb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

A summary of surveillance guidelines, adapted for the paediatric IBD population with UC or colonic CD, is outlined in Figure 7. Practical guidance on how to carry out surveillance colonoscopy in IBD is provided in the ECCO IBD and malignancies guideline, including details of the approach to characterisation and therapeutic management of dysplastic lesions. However, as this is such a rare occurrence in children, we recommend that the management of all dysplasia cases be determined individually with a multidisciplinary approach.

Figure 7
Endoscopic screening and surveillance for colorectal cancer (CRC) in children with colonic IBD. In patients who have no colonic involvement or disease limited to the rectum, no further IBD‐specific surveillance is indicated. *Including post‐liver transplant. **In patients who have not undergone surgery. **Dye‐based chromoendoscopy (DCE), virtual electronic chromoendoscopy (VCE), high definition white light endoscopy (HD‐WLE).

Patients with IBD‐PSC also have an increased risk of hepatobiliary malignancy from the time of PSC diagnosis, although absolute risk is low in children. In the absence of change in symptoms or biochemistry, there are no data to demonstrate that routine surveillance improves outcomes. Nevertheless, cholangiocarcinoma should be considered in PSC‐UC cases with new jaundice and a cholestatic biochemical profile; this should prompt MCRP and hepatology referral. In retrospective data in adults with IBD‐PSC, there is a correlation between surveillance by cross‐sectional imaging and survival. Nevertheless, there are sources of bias within this literature, including a lack of comparative data between imaging modality and surveillance interval, and in a study by Ali et al.the potential for different insurance coverage in those who underwent surveillance.

### Nemolizumab for the treatment of refractory primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis in a nonatopic patient [^21d4bc20]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 44-year-old man presented with a 30-year history of a progressively worsening pruritic eruption localized to the extremities. Physical examination revealed multiple hyperkeratotic, brown to flesh-colored papules and plaques on the right side of the lower extremity with hyperpigmented patches on the right side of the upper extremity and buttocks. Histopathologic evaluation from biopsies performed in 2006 and 2017 had confirmed a diagnosis of LA. The patient denied a history of atopy, and the serum immunoglobulin E was 5 IU/mL (reference range, 6–495 IU/mL). The patient reported intermittent use of clobetasol cream and triamcinolone ointment for several years, alongside trials of narrowband UVB phototherapy, which provided partial relief of pruritus. A repeat punch biopsy of the right side of the lower extremity demonstrated background lymphogranulomatous inflammation with keratin 903 staining reaffirming the diagnosis (Figs 1 and 2). Background lymphogranulomatous inflammation was favored to be secondary to chronic scratching, with staining confirming amyloid deposition. Dupilumab was initiated at standard prurigo nodularis dosing. After 5 months of therapy, the patient had persistent pruritus with only mild improvement in the hyperkeratosis of cutaneous lesions and subsequently developed arthralgia of the wrists. Dupilumab was discontinued and nemolizumab was initiated with a loading dose of 60 mg subcutaneously and 60 mg every 4 weeks thereafter based on the patient's weight. Five days after initiation of nemolizumab, the patient reported immediate relief of pruritus. Two months into nemolizumab therapy, there was sustained resolution of pruritus, with markedly improved hyperkeratosis of cutaneous lesions on the LA compared with baseline (Fig 3, A, B). The patient's arthralgia began to subside, secondary to dupilumab discontinuation.
