## Question

short mental fog episodes serious

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether short mental fog episodes are serious and what that means clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "short mental fog episodes" mean in different contexts. Then, I should verify how "serious" is framed in the literature and guidelines. Next, I will examine prevalence, functional impact, and risk factors. After that, I need to check mechanisms and whether there are red flags that warrant urgent evaluation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer and outline when to escalate care, making sure I anchor each point to the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the question. "Short mental fog episodes" could refer to brief, transient cognitive clouding or slowed thinking that resolves quickly, or it could mean intermittent "brain fog" within a longer post-COVID syndrome that waxes and wanes. I should keep both in mind and distinguish them explicitly in the reasoning and conclusion [^28a30892] [^4324cd43].

> Next, I should review how "serious" is operationalized in the literature. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — seriousness here is best judged by functional impact, persistence, and association with objective deficits or high-risk features rather than duration alone. Large cohorts and reviews emphasize that cognitive symptoms in long COVID are common, often persistent, and correlate with reduced daily functioning and quality of life, which supports treating them as clinically meaningful even when individual episodes are brief [^774ad572] [^4324cd43] [^d6c277b1].

> I will now examine prevalence to gauge how common these symptoms are. Wait, let me verify the ranges. Meta-analytic estimates suggest roughly 20–32% of people with long COVID report "brain fog" or related cognitive complaints at or beyond 3 months, with higher rates in some cohorts and lower in others depending on case definitions and ascertainment. Importantly, even non-hospitalized individuals can have substantial symptom burdens, so frequency alone signals clinical relevance [^d6c277b1] [^533ef1ff] [^89d28219].

> Hold on, I should verify functional impact because that is central to "seriousness". Survey and cohort data show that cognitive symptoms in post-COVID conditions are strongly associated with poorer daily functioning, work impairment, and reduced quality of life, and that these deficits can persist for months to over a year in a subset, which aligns with the concept of episodic disability and underscores the need for clinical attention even when episodes are intermittent [^774ad572] [^28a30892] [^4324cd43].

> Let me consider risk factors and mechanisms to understand who is more vulnerable and why. Female sex, prior psychiatric history, severe acute COVID-19, and ICU admission increase risk, and biologically, both inflammatory and coagulation pathways have been implicated, with acute-phase biomarkers predicting later cognitive deficits. But wait, I should double-check the mediation claim — one high-quality study found that subjective cognitive complaints were mediated by fatigue and to a lesser extent depression and anxiety, not by sleep quality, which helps explain why patients may report "brain fog" even when formal testing shows only modest deficits [^2195d7ad] [^ec0dff1e] [^4324cd43].

> I need to ensure I address the "short episode" aspect explicitly. Even when individual foggy episodes are brief, their recurrence and clustering with fatigue, PEM, and neuropsychiatric symptoms can be disabling; moreover, long COVID is characterized by fluctuating, relapsing-remitting symptoms, so "short" does not equal "benign" in this context. This pattern supports proactive screening and management rather than reassurance alone [^28a30892] [^4324cd43].

> But wait, what if the "short mental fog" is not due to long COVID at all? I should review differentials and red flags. Transient cognitive clouding can also signal delirium, metabolic derangements, medication effects, seizures, syncope, or functional neurological disorder, so new-onset, escalating, or accompanied-by-altered-awareness episodes warrant a structured evaluation to exclude reversible or dangerous causes before attributing them to post-viral syndromes [^f375e05c] [^8011589e].

> Next, I should review how to assess and when to escalate. Let me verify screening tools and thresholds. The MoCA is widely used but has limited sensitivity for mild deficits in this population, so persistent complaints despite a normal MoCA should prompt referral for neuropsychological testing. In parallel, screen for depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and fatigue, and consider basic labs to exclude common contributors like B12 deficiency or hypothyroidism. If episodes are accompanied by confusion, focal deficits, or loss of awareness, pursue urgent evaluation for delirium, seizure, or syncope [^7252c82a] [^78fe15ac] [^f375e05c].

> I should confirm management principles. Evidence-based care is supportive and multidisciplinary: treat comorbid mood and sleep disorders, use pacing and graded return-to-activity strategies, optimize sleep and nutrition, and consider symptom-targeted pharmacotherapies such as stimulants or amantadine for brain fog in selected cases, while acknowledging that high-quality RCT evidence is still evolving. Vaccination reduces risk of long COVID and may reduce brain fog risk, which is a practical prevention message [^59dc7f91] [^4903eba4] [^18d33836].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. Yes, short mental fog episodes can be serious when they recur, persist beyond 3 months, impair function, or cluster with fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially in the context of prior COVID-19. They are common in long COVID, often fluctuate, and can meaningfully degrade quality of life and work performance, so they warrant clinical evaluation and management rather than dismissal. Individual brief episodes are not necessarily emergencies, but new, worsening, or functionally limiting cognitive symptoms should be assessed and monitored over time [^4324cd43] [^774ad572] [^28a30892].

---

Short mental fog episodes can be **serious** when they are frequent, persistent, or interfere with daily activities, as they may signal underlying medical or psychiatric conditions such as long COVID [^4324cd43], epilepsy, or mood disorders [^notfound]. Most brief, isolated episodes are benign, but **red flags** (e.g. confusion with altered consciousness, focal deficits, or post-COVID cognitive symptoms) warrant prompt evaluation [^f375e05c]. Persistent or recurrent brain fog should be assessed with history, exam, and targeted testing to identify treatable causes and prevent functional decline [^78fe15ac].

## Clinical significance of short mental fog episodes

Short mental fog episodes are **clinically significant** when they are frequent, persistent, or impair daily functioning. They may reflect underlying medical, neurological, or psychiatric conditions, including:

- **Long COVID**: Cognitive impairment ("brain fog") is a common post-acute sequela of COVID-19, affecting approximately 20–30% of patients [^d6c277b1] [^533ef1ff]. These symptoms can persist for months and significantly impact daily functioning and quality of life [^774ad572] [^4324cd43].

- **Neurological conditions**: Transient cognitive impairment can occur in epilepsy, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and other neurological disorders. These episodes may precede or accompany seizures or vascular events and require careful evaluation [^notfound].

- **Psychiatric conditions**: Anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders can manifest as cognitive complaints, including short episodes of mental fog. These symptoms are often accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms and may fluctuate with emotional states [^ec0dff1e].

---

## Potential underlying causes

Several **underlying causes** can contribute to short mental fog episodes:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Medical conditions | - Hypoglycemia [^b9b20638] <br/> - Thyroid dysfunction [^78fe15ac] <br/> - Vitamin deficiencies (e.g. B12) [^78fe15ac] <br/> - Infections (e.g. COVID-19) [^4324cd43] <br/> - Autoimmune disorders |
| Neurological conditions | - Epilepsy <br/> - Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) <br/> - Migraine aura <br/> - Multiple sclerosis |
| Psychiatric conditions | - Anxiety disorders <br/> - Depression <br/> - Stress-related disorders <br/> - Functional neurological disorder [^8011589e] |
| Lifestyle factors | - Sleep deprivation [^c1850b82] <br/> - Poor nutrition <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Substance use (e.g. alcohol, cannabis) [^d04bc317] |

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

Certain features indicate **serious underlying conditions** and warrant immediate medical evaluation:

- **Sudden onset confusion or altered mental status**: Especially if accompanied by changes in consciousness, focal neurological deficits, or speech difficulties [^f375e05c].

- **Confusion with altered consciousness**: Episodes of confusion or disorientation associated with loss of consciousness, seizures, or syncope [^f9d7d94f].

- **Post-COVID cognitive symptoms**: Persistent cognitive impairment following COVID-19 infection, particularly if accompanied by fatigue, dyspnea, or other long COVID symptoms [^4324cd43].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to identify the **underlying cause** of short mental fog episodes. This typically includes:

- **Clinical history and physical examination**: Detailed assessment of symptoms, triggers, duration, frequency, and associated features [^f375e05c].

- **Laboratory tests**: Blood tests to evaluate for metabolic, endocrine, nutritional, or infectious causes [^f375e05c].

- **Neuropsychological testing**: Objective assessment of cognitive function to differentiate between subjective complaints and objective impairment [^7252c82a].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI or CT scans may be indicated if structural brain lesions or vascular abnormalities are suspected [^f375e05c].

- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**: Useful in evaluating suspected seizures or epilepsy-related cognitive disturbances [^f375e05c].

---

## Treatment and management strategies

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause** and may include:

- **Medical management**: Addressing underlying medical conditions, such as thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiencies, or infections [^78fe15ac].

- **Neurological management**: Antiepileptic medications for epilepsy, stroke prevention strategies for TIAs, and disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis.

- **Psychiatric management**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), antidepressants, and anxiolytics for anxiety and depression-related cognitive symptoms [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Improving sleep hygiene, nutrition, hydration, and stress management techniques [^59dc7f91].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis varies with the **underlying cause** and response to treatment. Many patients experience significant improvement with appropriate management, but some may have persistent symptoms, particularly in chronic conditions such as long COVID or neurodegenerative diseases. Persistent cognitive impairment can significantly impact daily functioning, employment, and quality of life, underscoring the importance of early identification and intervention [^4324cd43].

---

Short mental fog episodes can be **serious**, particularly when frequent, persistent, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms. They may indicate underlying medical, neurological, or psychiatric conditions that require evaluation and treatment. Persistent or recurrent episodes should not be ignored, as they can significantly impact daily functioning and quality of life.

Long COVID — prevalence, symptoms, and prevention: Long COVID is more common among women, people with more severe acute COVID-19 illness, and people with underlying health conditions, and common reported symptoms include tiredness or fatigue that interferes with daily life, symptoms that get worse with physical or mental effort, difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes called "brain fog"), cough, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. The best way to protect against Long COVID is to prevent infection and severe acute COVID-19, and vaccination can reduce the risk of Long COVID, while data are mixed on whether antivirals during acute infection may reduce the risk of Long COVID.

### Conceptualising long COVID as an episodic health condition [^28a30892]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Long COVID and episodic disability

Long COVID is characterised as a 'fluctuating' or 'relapsing and remitting' condition, which may be termed episodic. Episodes may fluctuate with Long COVID within the day, between weeks or over a longer continuum. Individuals can present with clusters of overlapping and episodic symptoms such as fatigue or exhaustion, postexertional symptom exacerbation, chest pain, painful joints or muscles, new shortness of breath and difficulty thinking or concentrating ('brain fog'). Individuals living with Long COVID sometimes characterise their experiences as unpredictable in nature. The multidimensional, episodic and unpredictable health consequences of Long COVID resembles episodic disability, a concept derived from the context of HIV, where health challenges can fluctuate daily or over longer periods of time. There is an opportunity to apply lessons learned in other chronic and episodic illnesses to understand and conceptualise the disability experienced among adults living with Long COVID.

The dimensions of Long COVID disability can be represented by a diversity of health-related challenges spanning physical health challenges (fatigue or exhaustion, postexertional symptom exacerbation or shortness of breath), cognitive health challenges (difficulty thinking or concentrating ('brain fog')), mental–emotional health challenges (post-traumatic stress, anxiety or depression), difficulties carrying out day-to-day activities (showering, meal preparation or walking) and challenges to social inclusion (meaningful life roles or employment). The multidimensional nature of disability experienced by people living with Long COVID can adversely affect day-to-day activities, return to employment, family life, relationships, and ability to care for others. Diagnostic clarity of Long COVID can be difficult to ascertain, particularly for those without a COVID-19 PCR, antigen or antibody test. Stigma related to disbelief of symptoms and the complexity of diagnostic uncertainty, particularly among those without a COVID-19 PCR, antigen or antibody test, can add complexity to those faced with challenges accessing employment or income benefits after leaving the workforce during illness, further contributing to disability and reduced quality of life after acute COVID-19.

### The role of mental function in the pathogenesis of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^01afabd7]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling episodic gait disturbance that is common among patients with Parkinsonism. FOG typically lasts a few seconds and is associated with a unique sensation: the patient feels that his feet are glued to the ground, causing him to remain in place despite making a concerted effort to overcome the motor block and move forward. Traditionally, FOG has been viewed as a motor symptom of advanced Parkinson's disease. Here we describe evidence which demonstrates that mental conditions also likely play an important role in the pathogenesis of FOG. Stress, anxiety, depression and cognitively challenging situations are associated with FOG, and may set the stage for and increase the likelihood that FOG occurs. A conceptual model that explains how mental conditions may modulate FOG is developed.

Introduction

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom affecting many people with Parkinson's disease (PD), defined as a 'brief, episodic absence or marked reduction of forward progression of the feet despite the intention to walk'. This leads to an increased risk of falling, and a major impact on physical and mental health-related quality of life. Notoriously, FOG is challenging to treat due to the differential response to dopamine-replacement therapy and the potential negative effects of levodopa on FOG with time. In addition, the effects of rehabilitation are short-termand only possible when FOG is still mild –. Given these challenges, markers of FOG onset are essential to screen for FOG conversion and deliver therapy pre-emptively.

Until now, various studies have looked into the clinical risk factors of conversion to FOG –. However, only one study investigated neural markers of conversion, and found that striatal dopaminergic deficits additionally contributed to a clinical prediction model of this transition. Owing to the limited evidence, an investigation into neural markers of conversion is warranted for additional predictive purposes and to help explain the elusive mechanisms leading to the onset of FOG. While freezing episodes likely signify transient dysfunctional information processing across the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical parallel circuits –, these transient events are challenging to elicit and interpret, and therefore have poor applicability as predictive markers. Compensatory or maladaptive structural alterations of the nodes within these circuits, however, are more persistent and therefore easier to capture as possible predictive markers for FOG in PD. A recent systematic reviewof cross-sectional investigations of structural alterations in persons with PD and FOG revealed widespread cortical and subcortical grey matter atrophy –, and associations between FOG severity and atrophy, suggesting that grey matter morphology may be a useful marker of FOG onset and progression. Furthermore, when centrally or peripherally originating PD pathology enters the brain, subcortical structures are affected earlier, and maybe early markers of FOG onset. However, a prospective assessment of this hypothesis is lacking.

Introduction

Although acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 can be mild and time limited, with recovery over days or weeks, a subset of patients experience long-term symptoms, which can persist for months or years after the acute infection. This is referred to as long COVID or post-COVID-19 condition, among other terms.WHO defines long COVID as 'the continuation or development of new symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least 2 months with no other explanation'. Long COVID is associated with a wide range of enduring symptoms that appear to be similar to other postviral syndromes, and which can have substantial impacts on patient well-being.

The prevalence of long COVID appears to be around 13.9% among adults who experience an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, long COVID can affect patients with SARS-CoV-2 regardless of hospitalisation status or the severity of initial infection. Symptoms of long COVID appear to be multisystemic and include neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some of the most common symptoms include fatigue, dyspnoea, 'brain fog' or cognitive dysfunction, headache, attention problems. Mental health symptoms and conditions are associated with long COVID, including generalised anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and post-traumatic stress disorder. Substantial impacts on mental health, well-being and coping with the challenges of everyday life have been noted by patients.

### Long COVID: rapid evidence review [^59dc7f91]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Postacute sequelae of COVID-19, also known as long COVID, affects approximately 10% to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who have had acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines long COVID as the presence of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms associated with acute COVID-19 that persist beyond 28 days. The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and does not require a prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm infection. Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, anosmia, chest pain, cognitive impairment (brain fog), dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, insomnia, mood changes, palpitations, paresthesias, and postexertional malaise. The presentation is variable, and symptoms can fluctuate or persist and relapse and remit. The diagnostic approach is to differentiate long COVID from acute sequelae of COVID-19, previous comorbidities, unmasking of preexisting health conditions, reinfections, new acute concerns, and complications of prolonged illness, hospitalization, or isolation. Many presenting symptoms of long COVID are commonly seen in a primary care practice, and management can be improved by using established treatment paradigms and supportive care. Although several medications have been suggested for the treatment of fatigue related to long COVID, the evidence for their use is currently lacking. Holistic treatment strategies for long COVID include discussion of pacing and energy conservation; individualized, symptom-guided, phased return to activity programs; maintaining adequate hydration and a healthy diet; and treatment of underlying medical conditions.

### A meta-analysis identifies factors predicting the future development of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^9749cdb7]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

The findings of this review support the idea that the pathological processes contributing to the development of FOG may be present years before FOG becomes clinically evident, at least in some subpopulations. Consistent with this notion, in several of the reviewed studies that matched the subjects at baseline with respect to disease duration and the severity of motor symptoms, non-motor factors differed in individuals who later developed FOG and those who did not during 5–10 years of follow-up. The role of non-motor symptoms in FOG is not surprising. Indeed, affect, depression and anxiety have been shown to be increased in people with FOG, compared to people with PD who do not have FOG. Extending that idea, the present analyses support the position that these alterations in mental health not only are related to and may trigger specific FOG episodes, among people who experience FOG, but in addition, these non-motor alterations may be in the causal pathway and lead to the future development of FOG.

### Interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in long COVID: a systematic review of registered trials [^788e6949]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

While COVID-19 infection is usually associated with a brief illness followed by recovery within weeks, many people experience prolonged symptoms months after acute infection (Liu et al.). Prolonged symptoms after an acute COVID-19 infection have been given a number of names, including long COVID, post-COVID syndrome, and COVID long haulers (Raveendran, Jayadevan, & Sashidharan). Long COVID is associated with a wide variety of symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath, loss of sense of smell, 'brain fog', cognitive impairment, neuropathy, muscle pain, sleep disturbance, and other multi-system symptoms, along with reduced mental health and impaired quality of life (Crook, Raza, Nowell, Young, & Edison; Malik et al; Maury, Lyoubi, Peiffer-Smadja, de Broucker, & Meppiel; Sudre et al.).

A meta-analytic estimate of the pooled prevalence of long COVID indicates that, around the world, some 43% of those who contract COVID-19 experience long-term symptoms (Chen et al.). Risk factors include female sex, pre-existing asthma, older age, obesity, comorbidities, and more severe acute COVID-19 symptoms (Cabrera Martimbianco, Pacheco, Bagattini, & Riera; Chen et al; Sudre et al.). Social isolation, decreased physical activity, changed lifestyles, and pandemic-related social and economic insecurities may contribute to developing the physical and psychological symptoms of long COVID (Cabrera Martimbianco et al; Marshall, Bibby, & Abbs). For some, long COVID may become a protracted, debilitating, multi-systemic disability (Alwan; Brown & O'Brien).

### Neuropsychiatric disorders following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^dd1f29ec]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Several large-scale electronic health records studies have reported increased diagnostic rates for neuropsychiatric disorders following Coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection)], but many questions remain. To highlight the issues, we selectively review this literature, focusing on mood disorder, anxiety disorder, psychotic disorder, and cognitive impairment ('brain fog'). Eight key questions are addressed, comprising: (i) the nature and magnitude of the risks; (ii) their association with severity of infection; (iii) their duration; (iv) whether the risks differ between adults and children, or between men and women; (v) whether prior vaccination protects against them; (vi) the risk profile associated with different SARS-CoV-2 strains; (vii) what the underlying mechanisms might be; and (viii) whether the sequelae can be predicted. We consider the major unknowns, the limitations of electronic health records for research in this area, and the use of additional approaches to help characterize and understand the neuropsychiatric burden of COVID-19.

### Freezing of gait: moving forward on a mysterious clinical phenomenon [^5ae7fd9c]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Freezing of gait (FoG) is a unique and disabling clinical phenomenon characterised by brief episodes of inability to step or by extremely short steps that typically occur on initiating gait or on turning while walking. Patients with FoG, which is a feature of parkinsonian syndromes, show variability in gait metrics between FoG episodes and a substantial reduction in step length with frequent trembling of the legs during FoG episodes. Physiological, functional imaging, and clinical-pathological studies point to disturbances in frontal cortical regions, the basal ganglia, and the midbrain locomotor region as the probable origins of FoG. Medications, deep brain stimulation, and rehabilitation techniques can alleviate symptoms of FoG in some patients, but these treatments lack efficacy in patients with advanced FoG. A better understanding of the phenomenon is needed to aid the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

### Brain fog [^3107fe77]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

'Brain fog' is a term that patients use increasingly frequently in the neurology clinic. We may think that we know what patients are talking about but at least some of the time we are likely to be getting it wrong. Patients use the term 'brain fog' to describe a wide range of subjective phenomena and symptoms. This paper suggests useful lines of questioning, and discusses the clinical correlates of a range of common 'brain fog' experiences.

### Prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog in people with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^18d33836]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Long COVID can include impaired cognition ('brain fog'; a term encompassing multiple symptoms) and mental health conditions. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate their prevalence and to explore relevant factors associated with the incidence of impaired cognition and mental health conditions.

Methods

Searches were conducted in Medline and PsycINFO to cover the start of the pandemic until August 2023. Included studies reported prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog in adults with long COVID after clinically-diagnosed or PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Findings

17 studies were included, reporting 41,249 long COVID patients. Across all timepoints (3–24 months), the combined prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog was 20·4% (95% CI 11·1%-34·4%), being lower among those previously hospitalised than in community-managed patients(19·5 vs 29·7% respectively; p = 0·047). The odds of mental health conditions and brain fog increased over time and when validated instruments were used. Odds of brain fog significantly decreased with increasing vaccination rates (p = ·000).

Conclusions

Given the increasing prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog over time, preventive interventions and treatments are needed. Research is needed to explore underlying mechanisms that could inform further research in development of effective treatments. The reduced risk of brain fog associated with vaccination emphasizes the need for ongoing vaccination programs.

### Postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 in university setting [^2eeeef5c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

It is estimated that 1 in 3 Americans who have SARS-CoV-2 infection will experience symptoms related to postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, also referred to as long COVID (other terms include long-haul coronavirus disease, post–-COVID-19 conditions, or chronic COVID-19). The length of time that a person must experience symptoms to be considered to have long COVID is not universally accepted; definitions range from 28 days to 6 months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent World Health Organization working group used a Delphi process to conclude that "a post-COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis".

Regardless of a universally agreed upon length of time a person must experience symptoms to be characterized as long COVID, this sequela has been suggested to be the "next national health disaster", and because of discrepancies in symptoms and long-term effects on quality of life, there seem to be more questions than answers. Although long COVID manifests differently in each person, nearly 50 signs and symptoms have been linked to the condition. The most common signs and symptoms are fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, cough, chest pain, altered smell, altered taste, and diarrhea. Other reported signs and symptoms include cognitive impairment (known as brain fog), memory loss, palpitations, anxiety, sore throat, sleep disorders, runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, ear pain, thoughts of self-harm and suicide, seizures, and bladder incontinence, as well as cardiac effects, such as myocardial inflammation.

### Long COVID-ACOEM guidance statement [^d1495862]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Long COVID — "brain fog", neurologic symptoms, and cognitive impairment show that persistent cognitive dysfunction after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely in those with severe illness or who were admitted to the ICU; among those hospitalized, moderate or severe cognitive deficits were associated with elevated inflammatory markers 5 months after the acute illness, and cognitive changes in those who did not feel recovered persisted through almost 2 years of follow-up; in a small study involving 29 patients with persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19, including 79% reporting problems with memory and 93% with concentration complaints, symptomatic patients had similar performance on the NIH Toolbox battery as controls; in a study of 200 patients, an average of 125 days since a positive COVID-19 test, self-reported neurocognitive dysfunction did not correlate with quantitative testing, although self-reported cognitive symptoms were associated with depression and anxiety.

### Prevalence of depression, anxiety, fatigue, and headache before and after long COVID onset: a case-control study in the total population of region stockholm [^5ebacee0]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health crisis with profound and long-lasting effects on individuals and healthcare systems. While most patients recover from the acute COVID-19 infection, a significant number of individuals experience symptoms that persist for months or years, described as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID. Long COVID is defined as having persistent symptoms > 12 weeks after the acute infection, which cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. The range of symptoms often experienced by patients includes fatigue, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety and depressive symptoms, dizziness, sensorimotor symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, palpitations, dyspnea, chronic cough, and chest pain, ultimately impacting the overall health-related quality of life.

It is estimated that around 10–30% of people previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 are affected by long COVID, with the frequency appearing to have decreased in more recent times. However, longitudinal studies have reported numbers as high as 46% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 still having persistent symptoms after 12 months. The variation in numbers is linked to the uncertainties and complexity surrounding the precise diagnostics of long COVID. While long COVID today is recognized as a single condition with multiple distinct phenotypes, its pathophysiology remains unclear. Evidence points to a multifactorial explanation as multiple organs are involved, and a combination of direct viral-specific pathophysiological damage, immune dysregulation, microvascular injury, and inflammation in response to acute infection, which may persist and lead to chronic inflammation, exacerbating long-term symptoms. Further, persistent viral reservoirs, aberrant immune responses, and post-viral autonomic dysfunction have all been hypothesized as contributing factors. Importantly, persistent symptoms are not unique to COVID-19 but have also been observed across a wide range of medical conditions, suggesting the involvement of potential transdiagnostic mechanisms. Finally, researchers have argued that different mechanisms may underlie persistent symptoms in individuals with varying infection severity, even though current long COVID criteria do not distinguish between mild and severe cases. Conversely, given that functional neurological disorder often begins after a noxious sensory event, it is expected that some individuals develop functional symptoms following COVID-19 infection. The association between long COVID and functional disorders remains a topic of ongoing debate.

### Features of acute COVID-19 associated with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 phenotypes: results from the IMPACC study [^d75b7122]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

This study has several strengths, including enrollment of a diverse population from a wide variety of geographically dispersed hospitals and detailed clinical and biological phenotyping, as well as several limitations. Due to the timing of our recruitment window, very few study participants were infected with variants of concern or variants of interest or vaccinated prior to hospital admission; thus, symptom persistence in our cohort may not be representative of patients infected with more recent emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or with breakthrough infections, but does provide an important characterization of post-acute disease follow-up in a virus-naïve population.

Along the same lines, certain symptoms that are now frequently linked to PASC (e.g. 'brain fog', sleep disturbance, dysautonomia) were not recorded as the surveys were designed prospectively early in the pandemic (March 2020) when PASC had not yet been reported. However, our use of standardized PROs that targeted cognitive, mental, and psychosocial functions enabled the identification of a specific cluster with predominant mental and cognitive deficits. Although symptoms at hospital admission were captured, pre-COVID symptomatology was not recorded, limiting estimation of the proportion of persistent symptoms directly attributable to PASC versus part of a pre-existing co-morbid condition. In addition, we did not attempt to identify alternative causes of persistent or new symptoms. However, PRO measures were chosen to attempt to mitigate this limitation by including a comparison to pre-illness baseline or some other appropriate recall period when possible. Our incidence of new onset or worsening health-related quality measures is in line with other published studies with 31% impairment in one study, and 15.4% with poor physical component, and 32.6% with poor mental component in another study.

### Multivariate profile and acute-phase correlates of cognitive deficits in a COVID-19 hospitalised cohort [^f71ae629]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is growing evidence that COVID-19 can cause lasting cognitive and mental health problems. Recovered patients reporting psychological symptoms including fatigue, cognitive difficulties ("brain fog" and "problems finding the words"), sleep disturbances breathlessness and psychiatric disorders months after infection. In the UK alone, 13.7% of 20,000 individuals reported having symptoms inclusive of cognitive difficulties 12 weeks after a positive COVID-19 test (UK Office for National Statistics, April 2021). Mild cases can report persistent cognitive symptoms; however, prevalence is higher in severe cases, with ∼33–76% of patients suffering cognitive symptoms 3–6 months post hospitalisation.

The neurobiological and psychological bases of these deficits remain unclear. Imaging biomarker studies indicate multiple likely candidates. Indeed, drawing parallels with serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) and post-critical illness/intensive care syndrome, a range of neurological/ central nervous system (CNS) complications can arise from infection. Most notably, encephalitis, ischaemia, haemorrhage, microstructural and functional changes and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) have been observed in COVID-19 patients, and more recently, evidence of brainstem inflammation using 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported. There has been concern regarding whether cognitive deficits will remain for years as a chronic syndrome, and whether patients who develop CVD as a result of infection will experience neurodegeneration and dementia in the long-term, despite recovery of other acute and sub-acute symptoms.

We also recognise that the subjective nature of symptoms creates the potential for reporting and recall bias. We used information regarding presence and duration of symptoms rather than whether participants described themselves as having "Long COVID" to reduce potential reporting bias. The data on symptoms at the time of PCR testing were retrospective which introduces the possibility of recall bias, although we have previously shown that REACT participant reports of symptom onset date closely mirrored the epidemic curve. There is also a risk that recall bias may have differentially affected reporting of symptoms by participants infected at different times, along with other time-varying factors, such as behaviour, seasonal weather patterns and changing pandemic restrictions, knowledge and expectations, which may account for at least part of the association between persistent symptoms and Wild-type infection. However, studies looking at individuals with confirmed infections of different SARS-CoV-2 strains also show lower risks with more recent variants.

We used validated instruments to assess mental health, quality of life. dyspnoea, and fatiguebut recognise the limitations of self-reporting and floor and ceiling effects (i.e., if a higher percentage of individuals achieve either maximum or minimum scores). The PHQ-9 scale used is a diagnostic tool for depression. However, some of the somatic questions have been found to be strongly correlated with symptoms that are common in Long COVID, including fatigue, sleep disruption and brain fog. As such, by using this scale we might be overestimating the level of depression. This issue was raised by Re'em et al. who suggest the PHQ-2screening criteria may be more appropriate for Long COVID as they do not include somatic items and simply require a score of 3 or more from the first two questions of PHQ-9. The percentage of participants in our study across all COVID-19 categories with a PHQ-2 score ≥ 3 was lower than the percentage with PHQ-9 ≥ 10 and the difference was more marked in those with ongoing persistent symptoms post-COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Table 8).

### Characterizing predictors and chronicity of brain fog in long COVID [^69034263]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Long COVID is a chronic illness that persists following COVID-19 infection, with fatigue and brain fog as the most frequent complaints. However, there is no objective case definition for brain fog in long COVID and chronicity of symptoms remains unclear. This study recruited two waves of participants: those with a history of COVID-19, who participated in 2023 (N = 793, age = 38.5 ± 13.2, 44% female, 35.1% long COVID) and a follow up cohort collected in 2024 of participants who qualified as having long COVID at time point 1 (N = 119, 61 female, 58 male). Participants completed questionnaires and cognitive tasks from home. We trained a binary classification model for long COVID diagnosis (73% accuracy) and a linear regression model for cognitive complaints (RMS error 5.8). A long COVID diagnosis at timepoint 1 was classified by biopsychosocial variables including stress, social support, and sex (women more likely). Symptom clustering revealed that phenotypes with both mental and physical health symptoms were predictive of brain fog, but not phenotypes with only sleep-related or physical symptoms. Markers of brain fog included slower reading and typing, slower reaction times in cognitive tasks, and changes in information processing speed and thresholds for making choices. Timepoint 2 data showed that the majority (82.4%) of participants did not remit from long COVID. These findings highlight the complex biopsychosocial factors that predict having long COVID with brain fog, and the need for interventions to improve remission rates.

### Symptoms and risk factors for long COVID in non-hospitalized adults [^89d28219]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were at increased risk of reporting a wide range of symptoms at ≥ 12 weeks after infection, compared to propensity score-matched patients with no record of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, after accounting for both sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and the reporting of symptoms before infection. The symptoms most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection included some that are already recognized in previous studies, such as anosmia, shortness of breath, chest pain and fever, but also included a range of other symptoms that have previously not been widely reported such as hair loss and sexual dysfunction. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was independently associated with the reporting to primary care of 20 of the 33 symptoms included in the WHO case definition and an additional 42 symptoms, beyond 12 weeks from infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a 26% relative increase in risk of reporting at least one of the symptoms included in the WHO case definition for long COVID.

Among those with a history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, several risk factors were associated with reporting symptoms 12 weeks or more after infection. Female sex, a gradient of decreasing age, belonging to a Black, mixed ethnicity or other ethnic minority group, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, high BMI and the presence of a wide range of comorbidities were associated with increased risk of both symptoms included in the WHO definition of long COVID and symptoms statistically associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported 12 weeks or more after infection.

Among those with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and who reported at least one symptom that was statistically associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 12 weeks after infection, three major clusters of phenotypes of long COVID were observed. These included patients with symptoms dominated by (1) a broad spectrum of symptoms, including pain, fatigue and rash (80.0%); (2) respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath and phlegm (5.8%); and (3) mental health and cognitive symptoms, including anxiety, depression, insomnia and brain fog (14.2%).

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^2bf2eb21]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID — definition, prevalence, and symptoms are described as follows: Long COVID is defined by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine as "an IACC that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems", and the current global prevalence is estimated to be 6%. Higher prevalence has been identified among female gender, certain racial and ethnic groups, and individuals who live in nonurban areas; however, anyone can develop Long COVID after being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The most common symptoms include exaggerated fatigue and diminished energy windows, postexertional malaise (PEM)/postexertional symptom exacerbation (PESE), cognitive impairment (brain fog), dysautonomia, pain/myalgias, and smell and taste alterations.

### Acute blood biomarker profiles predict cognitive deficits 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 hospitalization [^2195d7ad]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Post-COVID cognitive deficits, including 'brain fog', are clinically complex, with both objective and subjective components. They are common and debilitating, and can affect the ability to work, yet their biological underpinnings remain unknown. In this prospective cohort study of 1,837 adults hospitalized with COVID-19, we identified two distinct biomarker profiles measured during the acute admission, which predict cognitive outcomes 6 and 12 months after COVID-19. A first profile links elevated fibrinogen relative to C-reactive protein with both objective and subjective cognitive deficits. A second profile links elevated D-dimer relative to C-reactive protein with subjective cognitive deficits and occupational impact. This second profile was mediated by fatigue and shortness of breath. Neither profile was significantly mediated by depression or anxiety. Results were robust across secondary analyses. They were replicated, and their specificity to COVID-19 tested, in a large-scale electronic health records dataset. These findings provide insights into the heterogeneous biology of post-COVID cognitive deficits.

### Mid and long-term neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of post-COVID-19 syndrome: a meta-analysis [^d6c277b1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Importance

Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms that persist or develop three months after the onset of COVID-19 pose a significant threat to the global healthcare system. These symptoms are yet to be synthesized and quantified via meta-analysis.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported 12 weeks (3 months) or more after acute COVID-19 onset in adults.

Data Sources

A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Scopus was conducted for studies published between January 1st, 2020 and August 1st, 2021. The systematic review was guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses.

Study Selection

Studies were included if the length of follow-up satisfied the National Institute for Healthcare Excellence (NICE) definition of post-COVID-19 syndrome (symptoms that develop or persist ≥ 3 months after the onset of COVID-19). Additional criteria included the reporting of neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently extracted data on patient characteristics, hospital and/or ICU admission, acute-phase COVID-19 symptoms, length of follow-up, and neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Main Outcome(S) and Measure(S)

The primary outcome was the prevalence of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported ≥ 3 months post onset of COVID-19. We also compared post-COVID-19 syndrome in hospitalised vs. non-hospitalised patients, with vs. without ICU admission during the acute phase of infection, and with mid-term (3 to 6 months) and long-term (> 6 months) follow-up.

Results

Of 1458 articles, 19 studies, encompassing a total of 11,324 patients, were analysed. Overall prevalence for neurological post-COVID-19 symptoms were: fatigue (37%, 95% CI: 24%-50%), brain fog (32%, 9%-55%), memory issues (27%, 18%-36%), attention disorder (22%, 10%-34%), myalgia (18%, 4%-32%), anosmia (12%, 7%-17%), dysgeusia (11%, 4%-17%) and headache (10%, 1%-21%). Neuropsychiatric conditions included sleep disturbances (31%, 18%-43%), anxiety (23%, 13%-33%) and depression (12%, 7%-21%). Neuropsychiatric symptoms substantially increased in prevalence between mid- and long-term follow-up. Compared to non-hospitalised patients, patients hospitalised for acute COVID-19 had reduced frequency of anosmia, anxiety, depression, dysgeusia, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and sleep disturbance at three (or more) months post-infection. Conversely, hospital admission was associated with higher frequency of memory issues (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4–2.3). Cohorts with > 20% of patients admitted to the ICU during acute COVID-19 experienced higher prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances than cohorts with < 20% of ICU admission.

Conclusions and Relevance

Fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog, memory issues, attention disorder) and sleep disturbances appear to be key features of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Psychiatric manifestations (sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression) are common and increase significantly in prevalence over time. Randomised controlled trials are necessary to develop intervention strategy to reduce disease burden.

### Functional neurological disorder: practical management [^8011589e]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Obtaining the history

Approach to the patient with FND should follow the same rules for diagnosing any medical disorder. The history should begin with a nonjudgmental mindset that everyone experiences functional symptoms and to consider a broad differential from the start to best help every patient. Many patients with FND have been told of other diagnostic "possibilities" which are remembered as definitive (ie, hemiplegic migraine, transient ischemic attack) from neurologists or emergency department clinicians leaving FND off the differential for someone else to bring up. Alternatively, patients may feel a lack of concern from well-meaning clinicians when presented with "good news, all tests returned normal" implying no disease and offering no follow up. Putting effort into listening to the patient's concerns and beliefs about their symptoms helps identify readiness for treatment. Due to the high rate of traumatic experiences reported in all people, especially those with FND, using communication that fosters trust and reduces harm has been shown to impact patient engagement and improve outcomes. Trauma-informed care principles should be incorporated in interactions with all patients. These include making patients feel safe, having choice in their care decisions, collaborating with the clinician, developing trust, and feeling that they are empowered in their own care. A detailed review of symptoms may uncover migraine or other chronic pain disorder, cognitive complaints such as 'brain fog', fatigue, and other neurological symptoms commonly experienced by patients with FND that may need to be addressed before treatment which requires active participation to be helpful. Identifying the possibility of a functional cognitive disorder, a common mimic of Alzheimer's Disease, should be considered in those presenting mainly with memory/cognitive decline of abrupt onset, at young age and with shorter duration of symptoms. Comorbid sleep disorders and psychiatric comorbidities are also elevated and should be carefully screened for. Many but not all patients identify a precipitating injury or incident and describe a sudden and maximal onset of symptoms right at the start. For paroxysmal FND such as seizure or syncope, some patients report recognizing vulnerable states or triggers that also can be helpful for future intervention. Many patients with FND do not report experiencing "stress" and do not appreciate when the clinician assumes psychiatric disorder or "stress" as the cause. There are many potential pitfalls to avoid in diagnosing FND.

### A systematic review on exercise and training-based interventions for freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^748978a1]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a very disabling paroxysmal symptom affecting over half of people with Parkinson's disease (PD). During FOG, patients experience a sudden episodic inability to take an effective step while walking, turning, or initiating gait, leading to a marked reduction or complete cessation in forward progression of the feet despite the intention to walk. FOG episodes are characterized by trembling of the knees, short shuffling steps or complete akinesia, and usually last 1–2 s, although longer periods can occur. FOG drastically increases the risk and fear of falling.

The most frequent trigger for FOG is turning –, while other common drivers include performing cognitive challenges while walking (i.e. dual-tasking), overcoming environmental challenges, such as negotiating doorways, approaching destinations, and reduced visual input, such as when walking in the dark. Greater anxiety has also been related to worse FOG.

Like most other symptoms of PD, FOG is more pronounced with advanced disease and when OFF dopaminergic medication. A more specific explanation related to FOG is that episodic shortages of dorsal striatal dopamine in PD will lead to transient epochs of over-activity in the striatal output nuclei (i.e.g.lobus pallidus internus and substantia nigra pars reticulata) and bursts of GABAergic inhibitory projections to the motor thalamus and brainstem locomotor regions inducing gait breakdown. Dysfunctional cortical and cerebellar projections to the basal ganglia and brainstem locomotor region may exacerbate the neural manifestation of FOG.

Figure 1 shows a simplified representation of the brain circuits involved in maintaining gait in healthy adults and PD. As stated above, the pathophysiology of FOG likely involves both localized primary dysfunction of the dorsal motor circuit and a breakdown across compensatory networks.

### Diagnosing respiratory long COVID: a practical approach [^0fa2935a]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Long COVID or post-COVID Condition, defined as the persistence of symptoms at least three months post-acute COVID-19 infection, is a novel condition where a definitive diagnostic marker and treatment has yet to be found. This condition, which has been estimated to impact more than 65 million individuals worldwide, manifests with multisystem involvement, most commonly presenting with fatigue, brain fog, dyspnea and/or cough. The burden of these symptoms can range from mild to severe with many patients reporting an inability to return to usual activities. Here, we present several hypothetical but clinically representative cases to allow discussion around how we approach the diagnosis of respiratory symptoms of Long COVID in those with and without chronic lung disease.

2 LONG COVID, NEUROLOGICAL AND COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS, AND EEG SIGNATURES

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection can induce "Long COVID", a postacute sequela of COVID‐19 that refers to persistent symptoms continuing for months or longer after the initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The persistent symptoms affect multiple physiological systems with respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and psychological symptoms. One study found that 76% of individuals with mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19 experienced at least one persistent symptom 6 months after their initial infection. Another study found that 52% of COVID‐19 survivors experienced persistent symptoms 3 months after infection. These persistent symptoms can significantly impair individuals' quality of life and result in higher healthcare costs.

2.1 Neurological and cognitive symptoms of Long COVID

Neurological symptoms are a significant part of Long COVID, and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial for better diagnosis and treatment. In a meta‐analysis of 18 studies on 10,530 patients 3 months after COVID‐19 onset, overall prevalence of neurological symptoms was 32% for brain fog, 28% for memory problems, and 22% for attention disorder. Another report with clinical observations of neurological complications in 236,379 patients in the 6 months after a COVID‐19 diagnosis found that 33.62% of patients had demonstrated clinically significant neurological or psychiatric dysfunction.

Neurological symptoms of Long COVID reflect the COVID‐19 neuroinvasion and include headache, tremors, problems with attention and concentration, sluggish cognitive function, dysfunction in the peripheral nerves, and mental health problems. Beyond these typical brain fog symptoms, systematic evidence suggests frequent associations with depressionand post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Together, these symptoms can be characterized as "brain fog". The American Medical Association defines brain fog as some persistent neurological symptoms, including slowed cognition, concentration difficulties, confusion, and forgetfulness. Most people with Long COVID report instances of severe fatigue and brain fog several months after their initial infection. Those symptoms may fluctuate or relapse over time.

### Characterizing freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease: models of an episodic phenomenon [^534f8910]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a very disabling and common gait disorder in Parkinson's disease (PD). The first aim of this article was to provide a methodological and critical review of the most common research approach to understand FOG, ie, comparing the behavior of freezers with that of non-freezers. The review demonstrates that studies often fall short in clearly defining the freezer\non-freezer groups and in controlling for disease severity and other confounders. These problems complicate data interpretation on FOG. The second aim of this article was to summarize the literature on the potential mechanisms behind the episodic nature of FOG in the following four models: (1) The threshold model assumes that FOG occurs when the accumulation of various motor deficits reinforce each other to a point of motor breakdown; (2) the interference model proposes that FOG represents an inability to deal with concurrent cognitive, limbic, and motor input, causing an interruption of locomotion; (3) the cognitive model views FOG as induced by a failure to process response conflict, leading to behavioral indecision; and (4) the decoupling model sees FOG as a disconnection between preparatory programming and the intended motor response as a result of which automatic movement generation gets stuck. These four theoretical premises are still incomplete and do not fully explain FOG. The depletion of motor and cognitive reserves and an increasingly complex response to levodopa with disease progression will also have an impact on the emergence of FOG episodes.

### A nationwide study of risk factors for long COVID and its economic and mental health consequences in the United States [^1c636501]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The first set of models examined the risks of 1) long COVID in the full samples; 2) long COVID among those with confirmed/diagnosed COVID-19 infection based on a positive rapid point-of-care test, self-test, or laboratory test for COVID-19 or being told by a doctor or other health care provider of having COVID-19; and 3) confirmed/diagnosed COVID-19 infection in the full sample. The risk of long COVID is a function of the risk of becoming infected with COVID and the risk of progressing from acute infection to long COVID. Long COVID was defined in the HPS as reporting any symptoms lasting 3 months or longer that were not present prior to having COVID-19 including fatigue, difficulty concentrating and forgetfulness, "brain fog", shortness of breath, joint or muscle pain, heart palpitations, changes to taste/smell, and inability to exercise.

The second set of models examined 4 recent outcomes in the full sample and among those still reporting long COVID symptoms: whether the respondent was employed in the past week; experienced financial hardship, defined as household difficulty (somewhat/very difficult vs. not at all/a little difficult) to pay for usual household expenses including food, rent/ mortgage, and loans, within the previous week; and the frequency of experiencing anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms (using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2)) over the previous 2 weeks, with scores of 3–6 vs 0–2 being employed previously to screen for anxiety and depressive disorders. Based on a cut-off score of ≥ 3, the GAD-2 demonstrated optimal sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity = 0.71, specificity = 0.69), and the PHQ-2 exhibited peak sensitivity and adequate specificity (sensitivity = 0.64, specificity = 0.85). Internal consistency reliability has been demonstrated to be high for both measures (Cronbach's α = 0.81 and 0.83 for the GAD-2 and PHQ-2 scales, respectively).

### Is google trends a useful tool for tracking mental and social distress during a public health emergency? A time-series analysis [^e2868c06]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

4.1 Strengths and limitations

The availability of validated measures of population mental and social distress in a large sample that was weighted (in a sensitivity analysis) to reflect population demographics and surveyed at weekly intervals, over a period when there were marked changes in levels of population distress and risk factors for poor mental health, gave us a powerful opportunity to identify whether changes in self-reported mental health were mirrored in Google search activity. It is unusual for population mental health to fluctuate so markedly over a short period of time, so the context of the pandemic provided an important natural experiment for testing the usefulness of Google search activity as a research tool within mental health. Nevertheless, it is possible that search activity and the issues that concern individuals may be very different during a pandemic and associated public health measured than at other times.

### Cognitive symptoms of post-COVID-19 condition and daily functioning [^774ad572]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this survey study suggest that cognitive symptoms represent common features of post–COVID-19 condition, encompassing impairments often characterized by the widely used lay term brain fog. In light of their marked association with poorer functioning and quality of life, these symptoms represent important targets for assessment and identifying scalable interventions to remediate cognitive dysfunction in post–COVID-19 condition.

### Factors associated with short-term disability episodes [^da4707b5]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This study examines factors associated with a mental/behavioral disorder-related short-term disability episode versus a physical disorder-related disability episode using administrative longitudinal data.

Methods

Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between worker characteristics and different types of disability episodes.

Results

A previous disability episode is significantly associated with a current disability. Nevertheless, mental/behavioral disorders are related to higher odds of another episode. A worker with a previous disability episode related to a mental/behavioral disorder is almost 7x more likely to have another disability episode related to a mental disorder/behavioral disorder.

Conclusions

One of the critical factors associated with a disability episode is a history of a previous disability episode. Relapse is a critical factor and should be considered in the design of occupational health programs.

### Chatbots in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic [^92034506]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Mental health support

Although global and national health bodies highlight the importance of mental health in a pandemic, COVID-19 mental health needs have reportedly been under-addressed. Front-line clinicians are often not trained in emergency psychological support, and mental health practitioners are in short supply. Short-term, chatbots may mitigate the psychological harm of isolation, even though they cannot maintain human-level conversations. Simply disclosing concerns and receiving emotionally supportive responses can have positive value in some contexts. If effectively designed and deployed, chatbots may lessen the long-term harm of pandemic-related isolation, trauma, and depression. Preliminary evidence shows that chatbots may reduce mental health symptoms, but long-term outcomes are unclear and worthy of future investigation.

### Operationalisation of post-COVID condition case definition in a comprehensive research protocol [^23dbc02c]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Post‐COVID condition (PCC) is one of the most prevalent complications of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, especially in non‐hospitalised patients. However, PCC case definition is broad and non‐standardised. For this reason, the precise identification of patients affected by this condition and the establishment of a pathophysiological link with primary SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are still difficult. Attempts to devise reliable diagnostic criteria for PCC have been limited by the number and breadth of its manifestations. Accordingly, the most recent proposals by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provide only a timeframe for symptom onset and persistence, without circumscribing PCC‐associated manifestations. In addition to the lack of a standardised definition, we also lack common protocols for patient assessment, and different studies have almost invariably used assessment protocols that differ both in scope of assessment and single tests employed.

Despite the overwhelming number of described symptoms, several recurring key manifestations of PCC have emerged, as shown in a recent systematic review. These manifestations include cognitive (e.g. memory/attention difficulties, and brain fog), psychiatric (e.g. mood disorders, anxiety, stress) and 'systemic/general' symptoms (e.g. fatigue, headache), and likely constitute a common ground for a PCC definition. Peripheral nervous system symptoms and dysautonomia have also been reported; however, their prevalence in PCC is unclear, as is their co‐occurrence with more frequent symptoms. Moreover, a significant proportion of these may be direct consequences of acute critical illness or part of established post‐infectious sequelae independent of PCC (e.g. acute‐immune polyradiculoneuropathy).

Laying the groundwork for a widely shared case definition of PCC is paramount to ensure consistent participant enrolment in observational studies, to foster comparability, and ultimately to improve the chances of understanding the pathophysiological underpinnings of this condition. Moreover, given the breadth of its cognitive and psychiatric manifestations, we advocate also for the focused, comprehensive neuropsychological and psychiatric symptom evaluation of PCC.

Within a European multi‐centre observational cohort study (Horizon Project ID n.101057775), we aimed to create a simple and flexible instrument to operationalise PCC case definition, in an attempt to create a common framework for PCC screening. Furthermore, based on the most commonly associated symptoms and findings, we propose a comprehensive assessment protocol that could be adopted in clinical and research settings.

### Novel perspective of' poor sleep' in public health: a narrative review [^c1850b82]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Who are the poor sleepers?

Poor sleep represents a new category of sleep disturbances, which does not fall within any existing definitions of sleep disorder, yet it affects a large part of the general population. Poor sleepers need to be recognised as sufferers, not only because of the impact on their quality of life but also because sleep disturbances affect long-term mental and physical health and can ultimately lead to the development of sleep disorders. We propose that a poor sleeper is someone who regularly sleeps less than 6 hours/night, for at least three times/week for 3 months (consensus between expert authors), experiencing unsatisfactory, non-restorative sleep episodes that result in two or more symptoms impacting the following day's activities. Although the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult is at least 7 hours/night, less than 6 hours is the duration associated with increased health risk in the literature, and the one considered more appropriate for the definition of poor sleepers in order to account for individual variations. Similarly, the frequency of sleep problems occurring more than or equal to three times a week is an indicative measure based on existing evidence. Sleep regularity (eg, weekdays vs weekend) and napping are important factors to consider when assessing sleep duration, as catching up on sleep in the long term may contribute to developing irregular sleep patterns. However, short 10 min naps taken in the afternoon have been shown to produce immediate benefits without the side effect of sleep inertia. The following is a non-comprehensive list of day-to-day symptoms associated with poor sleepers: (1) irritability, (2) sleepiness, (3) tiredness, (4) increased stress, (5) decreased attention and concentration and (6) somatic problems, such as headache, fatigue, pain, bowel problems or dizziness. A summary of the characteristics of a poor sleeper is shown in figure 2A.

Introduction

People who have survived COVID-19 frequently complain of cognitive dysfunction, which has been described as brain fog. The prevalence of post–COVID-19 cognitive impairment and the association with disease severity are not well characterized. Previous studies on the topic have been limited by small sample sizes and suboptimal measurement of cognitive functioning. We investigated rates of cognitive impairment in survivors of COVID-19 who were treated in outpatient, emergency department (ED), or inpatient hospital settings.

Mental Capacities Associated With Reported Episodes

Participants interpreted the above-described behaviors as evidence of a range of mental capacities the person living with dementia either retained or temporarily regained during the lucid episode (see Table 4). Behaviors observed within a single episode could be associated with multiple different capacities.

Table 4.
Mental Capacities Inferred From Reported Episodes

In 12 episodes, interviewees believed persons living with dementia could temporarily recognize specific people or animals, typically by the accurate usage of proper names. In a couple episodes, usage of a name was accompanied by eye contact that, for caregivers, affirmed recognition. For instance, a caregiver's (interviewee 18) mother unexpectedly uttered her nickname when she otherwise "had no clue who [the caregiver] was". The caregiver added: "For that second, for that moment that we shared in our eyes, you know, we're looking at each other and it just came to her, and she knew who it was, but it left quick". In one recurring episode described by a caregiver (interviewee 61), he inferred recognition from nonverbal gestures: he interpreted his wife rubbing his back as her "realiz[ing] that I'm her husband, she's my wife, and, you know, we're together".

In 11 cases, a person living with dementia's unusual behavior in a social situation evinced to caregivers a heightened capacity to understand the emotions and intentions of others. Typically, these episodes involved utterances of unexpected contextual appropriateness. A caregiver (interviewee 43) recounted taking his wife to a family party, where she asked their daughter, "How have you been?" This otherwise mundane interaction was interpreted by the participant as demonstrating an unusual level of social sensitivity given that his wife had been, in his words, a "stoic robot" since developing advanced dementia. Another caregiver (interviewee 63) described mumbling to himself about financial concerns when his wife, sitting nearby, said, "Don't worry, you're smart. You'll figure it out". This reassurance was "what I needed in the moment", he said, a brief instance of his wife "getting through the fog" and attuning to his emotional state.

### Long COVID: cognitive complaints (brain fog) and dysfunction of the cingulate cortex [^e1aac460]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Many patients who have suffered from acute COVID infections have long-lasting symptoms affecting several organs including the brain. This long COVID status can include "brain fog" and cognitive deficits that can disturb activities of daily living and can delay complete recovery. Here, we report two cases of neurological long COVID with abnormal FDG PET findings marked by hypometabolic regions of the cingulate cortex.

### Cognitive domains affected post-COVID-19; a systematic review and meta-analysis [^533ef1ff]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As seen in previous coronavirus epidemics, a significant proportion of patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 develop cognitive (neuropsychological) sequelae from the infection, and a significant proportion of these persist long term. Post‐COVID‐19 condition is defined by National Institutes of Health guidance as symptoms present 3 months from the onset of COVID‐19 with symptoms that have lasted at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Cognitive impairment appears to be common after recovering from COVID‐19 disease, with an estimated 18%–36% of people affected depending on whether subjective or objective measures are used, and 32% of patients reporting subjective 'brain fog' over 3 months after the initial infection.

Meta‐analysis demonstrates a prevalence of objectively measured global cognitive impairment of 22% at 12 weeks or more following COVID‐19 infection, compared to infected controls, and similar persistent cognitive impairment can be seen in formal testing even in those without persistent COVID‐19 symptomology. Early reports suggested that COVID‐19 patients suffered from a dysexecutive syndrome during acute infection; however, a detailed, domain‐specific phenotype of cognitive impairment occurring in individuals in this post‐acute phase is yet to be established.

An acute‐phase dysexecutive syndrome may suggest frontal lobe pathology, but the neurobiological basis of post‐COVID‐19 cognitive impairment remains unclear, with multiple and multifactorial aetiologies being proposed. Likely mediators include the well‐established cognitive sequelae of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, acute respiratory distress syndrome and delirium. The medium‐ and long‐term cognitive symptoms experienced by those with asymptomatic or mild effects from the initial infection suggest a separate aetiology to those seen in patients with more direct effects such as stroke or encephalitis. Although there is literature on how general severity of COVID‐19 illness may affect cognitive symptoms, fewer studies have explored how the presence of neurological sequelae in this context might affect outcomes.

Elucidating the pattern of cognitive impairment is key to understanding this pathophysiology, improving diagnosis and formulating management options for a condition that is likely to have an impact on quality of life, economic output and societal engagement.

The aims of this review were therefore (1) to identify which primary cognitive domains are impaired in this population and, if present, whether these change over time, (2) to identify which neuropsychological tasks were used and how impairment was defined and (3) to establish whether any demographic or clinical factors predict the presence, and/or severity, of this impairment.

### Examining the comparative incidence and costs of physical and mental health-related disabilities in an employed population [^d0f2ebd7]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To address gaps in knowledge about disability rates and costs of short-term disability by answering the following questions: (1) what is the incidence and the costs of short-term disability episodes related to mental disorders? and (2) how do these figures compare with those of short-term disability episodes related to physical disorders?

Methods

The data set comes from a Canadian resource sector company's 2003–2006 short-term disability leave and human resource data sets. The multi-year data set consists of 33,913 records for all nonseasonal employees. The study focused on all episodes that began in 2003, 2004, or 2005. There are 12,407 unique employees represented.

Results

The overall disability rate was 14.5 episodes/100 person-years. The top five primary categories of disability episodes were respiratory disorder (2.3/100 person-years), musculoskeletal disorder (1.9/100 person-years), mental/behavioral disorder (2.1/100 person-years), injury (2.0/100 person-years), and digestive disorder (1.3/100 person-years). The mean disability episode was 33 days, and the mean cost was $9027/episode. Highest episode costs were associated with mental/behavioral disorder-related episodes ($18,000/episode), and the lowest costs were for respiratory disorders ($3000/episode).

Conclusions

The results underscore that although disability related to mental/behavioral disorders may not comprise the largest proportion of cases, they represent the largest costs.

### Long-term neuropsychological consequences of severe COVID-19 infection: the NEUROCOG-COVID study [^ac523dba]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

As early as 2020, numerous international scientific articles reported the possible presence of cognitive disorders in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The onset of cognitive complaints is said to be very frequent in the aftermath of COVID-19 infection, particularly in patients who have experienced severe infection. In general, "brain fog" is often described as slowed thinking, difficulties with focused attention, forgetfulness, and a subjective sense of confusion. Most often, the presence of a cognitive complaint is associated with the presence of cognitive disorders on neuropsychological assessment, particularly executive dysfunction. However, cognitive complaints do not correlate with the severity of objective cognitive impairment on neuropsychological assessment, and can persist over time.

While some articles testify to the absence of neuropsychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a growing number of studies seem to validate a causal effect of COVID-19 on the central nervous system, possibly manifesting as neuropsychiatric disorders, both in the acute and long-term phases. Studies seem to consistently show that the development of neuropsychological disorders after COVID-19 infection is independent of the severity of the infection, i.e. mild infection requiring no respiratory assistance and hospitalization versus severe infection with respiratory distress requiring intensive care. Although cognitive impairment may be more pronounced in patients with severe infections, it also seems possible in asymptomatic patients. The long-term course of cognitive impairment is again variable; while it tends to persist after onset, it may increase over time, particularly in patients with moderate or severe infection, or, conversely, gradually improves in patients with mild infection. As in other neurological pathologies, functional cognitive disorders could be present in association with the organic consequences of COVID-19 infection.

### Dissipating the fog: cognitive trajectories and risk factors 1 year after COVID-19 hospitalization [^5c41bd5c]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cognitive impairment is common after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, associations between post-hospital discharge risk factors and cognitive trajectories have not been explored.

Methods

A total of 1105 adults (mean age ± SD 64.9 ± 9.9 years, 44% women, 63% White) with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were evaluated for cognitive function 1 year after hospital discharge. Scores from cognitive tests were harmonized, and clusters of cognitive impairment were defined using sequential analysis.

Results

Three groups of cognitive trajectories were observed during the follow-up: no cognitive impairment, initial short-term cognitive impairment, and long-term cognitive impairment. Predictors of cognitive decline after COVID-19 were older age (β = -0.013, 95% CI = -0.023;-0.003), female sex (β = -0.230, 95% CI = -0.413;-0.047), previous dementia diagnosis or substantial memory complaints (β = -0.606, 95% CI = -0.877;-0.335), frailty before hospitalization (β = -0.191, 95% CI = -0.264;-0.119), higher platelet count (β = -0.101, 95% CI = -0.185;-0.018), and delirium (β = -0.483, 95% CI = -0.724;-0.244). Post-discharge predictors included hospital readmissions and frailty.

Discussion

Cognitive impairment was common and the patterns of cognitive trajectories depended on sociodemographic, in-hospital, and post-hospitalization predictors.

Highlights

Cognitive impairment after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospital discharge was associated with higher age, less education, delirium during hospitalization, a higher number of hospitalizations post discharge, and frailty before and after hospitalization. Frequent cognitive evaluations for 12-month post-COVID-19 hospitalization showed three possible cognitive trajectories: no cognitive impairment, initial short-term impairment, and long-term impairment. This study highlights the importance of frequent cognitive testing to determine patterns of COVID-19 cognitive impairment, given the high frequency of incident cognitive impairment 1 year after hospitalization.

### A systematic review on exercise and training-based interventions for freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^7f6d0edd]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Box 1 Three conceptual categories of training interventions as based on their relevance to FOG

FOG-specific Exercise or training-based interventions aimed directly at alleviating imminent FOG episodes or better prepare patients for upcoming FOG while the interventions are applied, and possibly in times beyond. This includes mixed intervention studies, of which at least one training component is directly aimed at reducing FOG episodes or circumventing FOG-provoking circumstances. Examples are: cueing offered to help patients overcome FOG episodes; action-observation training strategies designed to relieve FOG in FOG-provoking situations; and fall-prevention training including strategies to overcome imminent FOG episodes, such as through the use of cueing. FOG was assessed as a primary or other outcome in these studies.
FOG-relevant Exercise or training-based interventions aimed at training the motor- and/or non-motor correlates of FOG with the aim to reduce the severity or amount of FOG following the intervention, but not aimed at the immediate alleviation of imminent FOG episodes or circumventing FOG-provoking circumstances while the intervention was applied. Examples are cognitive training; cognitive-motor dual-task training; balance training; curved treadmill training; regular treadmill training with cueing that was aimed at improving gait parameters other than FOG; and obstacle avoidance training. FOG was assessed as a primary or other outcome in these studies.
Generic exercises Conventional physical therapy or generic exercise interventions that are also frequently offered to healthy older individuals to improve physical- and/or mental fitness and other benefits, irrespective of their possible potential to also benefit FOG. Examples are different types of dancing; yoga; physiotherapy not aimed at FOG; aquatic training; Tai-chi; gait training; muscle-power training, and; music therapy. FOG was not assessed as a primary outcome in these studies.

### Screening for brain fog: is the Montreal cognitive assessment an effective screening tool for neurocognitive complaints post-COVID-19? [^7252c82a]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive complaints are one of the most frequent symptoms reported in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been used to estimate prevalence of cognitive impairment in many studies of PASC, and is commonly employed as a screening test in this population, however, its validity has not been established.

Objective

To determine the utility of the MoCA to screen for cognitive impairment in PASC.

Methods

Sixty participants underwent neuropsychological, psychiatric, and medical assessments, as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 6–8 months after acute COVID-19 infection.

Results

The overall sample had a mean score of 26.1 on the MoCA, with approximately one third screening below the cutoff score of 26, similar to the rate of extremely low NP test performance. MoCA score was inversely correlated with fatigue and depression measures and ethnic minority participants scored on average lower, despite similar education and estimated premorbid function. The MoCA had an accuracy of 63.3% at detecting any degree of diminished NP performance, and an accuracy of 73.3% at detecting extremely low NP performance.

Discussion/Conclusion

The MoCA may not be accurate for detecting neither mild nor more severe degrees of diminished NP test performance in PASC. Therefore, patients with persistent cognitive complaints in the setting of PASC who score in the normal range on the MoCA should be referred for formal NP assessment.

### Acute and chronic neurological disorders in COVID-19: potential mechanisms of disease [^022dcd20]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic neurological sequelae

The long-term neurological impact of COVID-19 is uncertain, but it is already apparent that a range of signs and symptoms emerge among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 while non-hospitalized patients also exhibit neurological disorders that arise after the acute COVID-19 illness phase (Fig. 3). The lingering or delayed neurological syndromes have been termed long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)and are composed of a wide range of symptoms and signs including neurocognitive symptoms with associated impaired performance on neuropsychological testing. Of note, neurocognitive and mood alterations among ICU survivors are well recognized phenomena, often attributed to sedating medications as well as systemic inflammation and neuronal injury. Notably, these ICU-related effects can confound the evaluation of chronic sequelae among survivors of severe acute COVID-19. A study evaluating patients with COVID-19 at 2–3 months post-hospitalization (approximately a third of patients required ICU) reported that those patients reported significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms and decreased quality of life compared to age- and comorbidity-matched controls. Moreover, abnormalities in visuospatial and executive function were detected among COVID-19 survivors compared to controls when assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA), recapitulating clinical experience of patients with post-COVID-19 who report apathy, short-term/working memory difficulties and 'brain fog' after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent study of patients post-COVID-19 without hospitalization reported 'brain fog', headache, anosmia, dysgeusia and myalgia as the predominant persisting symptoms. Over half of hospitalized COVID-19 patients report significant fatigue months after discharge, particularly among those who required admission to the ICU. Similarly, persistent psychological distress is reported by half of hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related ICU admission as well as those COVID-19 patients not requiring the ICU. A retrospective cohort analysis of over 200 000 patients in the UK found that 12.8% of patients with COVID-19 received a new neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the 6 months after initial infection. In the same study, nearly half of ICU-COVID-19 survivors had a neurological or psychiatric illness at 6-month follow-up, of which half were new diagnoses. Of note, frontotemporal FDG hypometabolism reported for acute COVID-19, discussed previously, was also observed among COVID-19 patients with cognitive symptoms > 3 weeks after initial illness, accompanied by brainstem and thalamus hypometabolism in 'long COVID' patients, compared to controls. A separate study of eight patients in the subacute and chronic stages of recovery from COVID-19 observed a similar pattern of bilateral frontoparietal hypometabolism, which resolved at the 6-month follow-up assessment and was accompanied by improved MoCA scores.FDG-PET imaging is a potentially useful research tool although it is not validated for diagnosis of COVID-19 related neurocognitive impairments, which require clinical evaluation. Future studies of cognitive impairment in COVID-19 survivors must take into account the fact that hospitalization for any infection is associated with an increased 10-year risk of dementia, particularly vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

### Cognitive and mental health outcomes in long COVID [^4324cd43]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Roughly one in five adults who meet criteria for long covid present with objective or subjective cognitive dysfunction or elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety lasting ≥ 12 weeks from an acute covid illness. These neuropsychiatric sequelae have considerable functional consequences at the level of the individual, society, and the broader economy. Neuropsychiatric long covid symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present, objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months after an acute covid illness. Emerging research points to the early recovery period as a potential window of opportunity for intervention to alter patient trajectories, though evidence based treatment remains lacking.

### Depression-related short-term disability in an employed population [^b251826b]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There has been a growing realization that the number of workplace disability claims for mental and nervous disorders is increasing. Yet, little is known about the working population disabled by these disorders. Absence of basic information describing this population makes it virtually impossible to plan effective workplace programs. Using administrative data collected from three major Canadian financial/insurance sector employers, we focus on one group of disorders — depression. In this study, we report the prevalence of short-term disability due to depression and describe the characteristics of workers affected and their disability outcomes. We observed that compared with other nervous and mental disorders, depression-related short-term disability generally affected more employees, lasted longer, and had a higher rate of recurrence. In addition, at the end of their episodes more than three quarters of workers returned to work. These estimates suggest that the potential magnitude of the impact of short-term disability should be a concern for employers. This study helps identify the main characteristics of workers who develop depression-related disability. It also helps clarify what happens to those on short-term disability.

### Unraveling brain fog in post-COVID syndrome: relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^61f57e06]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Participants and study design

We conducted a cross‐sectional study including 170 patients reporting cognitive complaints in the context of PCS. The patients met the WHO criteria for PCS. The following inclusion criteria were considered: (i) diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and (ii) diagnosis of PCS according to the WHO criteria (symptoms lasting 2 months and an interval of at least 3 months since the acute infection with no other potential causes). Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) any cognitive complaint before COVID‐19; (ii) history of neurological or psychiatric disorders potentially associated with PCS symptoms; (iii) history of abuse of alcohol or other drugs; (iv) uncontrolled medical conditions associated with cognitive dysfunction at the moment of the assessment; and (v) sensory disorders potentially impacting cognitive assessments. The mean age of the sample was 49.37 ± 10.96 years, and 73.10% were women. The mean time since acute COVID‐19 was 14.50 ± 6.91 months. The patients' clinical and demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Sample description and associations of the main clinical and demographic factors with the FLEI scale.

Assessment of brain fog

We used the FLEI questionnaire to assess brain fog. FLEI is a questionnaire designed to assess subjective cognitive complaints. The test is self‐administered by the patient, who must respond to 35 statements using a five‐point rating scale (never; rarely; sometimes; often; very often). The answer "never" receives no points, "rarely" one point, "sometimes" two points, "often" three points and "very often" four points. Questions are focused on difficulties in everyday situations in the last 6 months, examining three cognitive areas: attention (10 questions, 0–40 points), memory (10 questions, 0–40 points), and executive functioning (10 questions, 0–40 points). There are also five control questions to check the response tendency. Besides the three cognitive domains, the main score "mental ability" is calculated as the sum of the three cognitive domains (0–120 points). Higher scores indicate low subjective cognitive ability, while lower raw scores indicate high subjective ability. The questionnaire was administered using the Vienna Test System (Schuhfried).

### Joint consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and sleep research society on the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: methodology and discussion [^6083e50b]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Sleep duration and mental health — short self-reported sleep duration is associated with increased cross-sectional and longitudinal risk for depression, whether measured as symptoms or as a diagnosis. The threshold for short sleep varies across studies from 5–7 hours, with the majority using 6 hours, and some data also demonstrate increased risk associated with sleep duration longer than 8–9 hours. No published meta-analysis has specifically addressed the relationship between sleep duration and depression, anxiety or other psychiatric disorders. Experimental and longitudinal observational studies suggest short sleep duration can lead to depression and other mental health symptoms, whereas insomnia symptoms typically improve when depression is treated, even when the treatment does not specifically target sleep. Experimental data are not available to suggest a causal role for long sleep duration in relation to mental health.

### Long COVID syndrome-associated brain fog [^dbdbf81d]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

We investigated the frequency of brain fog in a large cohort of patients with documented coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) who have survived the illness. We also scrutinized the potential risk factors associated with the development of brain fog. Adult patients (18–55 years of age), who were referred to the healthcare facilities anywhere in Fars province from February 19, 2020 to November 20, 2020 were included. All patients had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. In a phone call, at least 3 months after their discharge from the hospital, we obtained their current information. A questionnaire was specifically designed for data collection. In total, 2696 patients had the inclusion criteria; 1680 (62.3%) people reported long COVID syndrome (LCS). LCS-associated brain fog was reported by 194 (7.2%) patients. Female sex (odds ratio [OR]: 1.4), respiratory problems at the onset (OR: 1.9), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR: 1.7) were significantly associated with reporting chronic post-COVID "brain fog" by the patients. In this large population-based study, we report that chronic post-COVID "brain fog" has significant associations with sex (female), respiratory symptoms at the onset, and the severity of the illness (ICU admission).

### Post-COVID-19 condition: clinical phenotypes, pathophysiological mechanisms, pathology, and management strategies [^5c0d24c3]. The Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fatigue/neuropsychiatric phenotype

A cognitive or neuropsychiatric PCC phenotype is identified by symptoms such as brain fog (including poor concentration, memory loss, and difficulty in thinking), insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Multiple cluster analysis studies combined this phenotype with chronic fatigue, although it must be mentioned that fatigue is a common symptom in multiple phenotypes, as it is a broad concept (e.g. physical, mental, or emotional fatigue) with multiple underlying pathophysiological pathways. Sleep disturbance including insomnia is another common symptom, which by itself may lead to cognitive difficulties and emotional distress.

The fatigue/neuropsychiatric phenotype is the most common in the literature, representing 42% of PCC individuals in one study. Neurological involvement in PCC has also become evident in societal contexts, manifesting in cognitive difficulties with work, social participation, and daily functioning. This phenotype was the most common phenotype after alpha and delta SARS‐CoV‐2 variants, whereas a cluster of cardiorespiratory symptoms was the most common in the ancestral variant, possibly indicating lung damage. Furthermore, this phenotype was more prevalent in females than males, and had a high proportion of preexisting depression in one study, highlighting the possibility of preexisting neuropsychiatric comorbidities as a risk factor. Preexisting neurological and psychiatric conditions may compromise the central nervous system's resilience to manage additional stressors, including viral infections, leading to a higher risk of persistent symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, and mood disturbances. A French population‐based study demonstrated that the higher prevalence of PCC in women is partially explained by their greater burden of depressive symptoms during the pandemic, as depressive symptoms contributed to around 40–45% of the observed sex differences. This highlights that taking both mental health factors and biological sex differences into account is essential for understanding and managing the fatigue/neuropsychiatric manifestations of PCC. Sleep disorders in PCC, particularly insomnia, are more commonly observed in females, with a suggested relation to affective disorders such as depression or anxiety, whereas men primarily experience sleep‐related issues including snoring and sudden movements, mostly associated with respiratory disorders. Finally, the fatigue/neuropsychiatric phenotype was associated with experiencing neurological symptoms during acute COVID‐19 diagnosis, suggesting that the driver of this phenotype may be ongoing neuropathology induced by acute COVID‐19, rather than a distinct, new event.

### Objective detection of subtle freezing of gait episodes in Parkinson's disease [^2179510f]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a clinically defined phenomenon of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests that subtle FOG episodes can be elicited in a gait laboratory using suddenly appearing obstacles during treadmill walking. We evaluated which quantitative gait parameters identify such subtle FOG episodes. We included 10 PD patients with FOG, 10 PD patients without FOG, and 10 controls. Subjects walked on a motorized treadmill while avoiding unexpectedly appearing obstacles. Treadmill walking was videotaped, and FOG episodes were identified by two independent experts. Gait was also analyzed using detailed kinematics. Knee joint signals were processed using time-frequency analysis with combinations of sliding fast Fourier transform and wavelets transform. Twenty FOG episodes occurred during treadmill walking in 5 patients (all with clinically certified FOG), predominantly in relation to obstacle avoidance. FOG was brief when it occurred just before or after obstacle crossing and was characterized by short, rapid steps. Frequency analysis showed a typical qualitative pattern: before the FOG episode an increase in dominant frequency in the 0 to 3 Hz band (festination), followed by decreased power in 0 to 3 Hz band and an increased power in the 3 to 8 Hz band during the FOG episode. This pattern led to an increased FOG index as a qualitative measure. These approaches detected even very brief FOG with acceptable sensitivity (75–83%) and specificity (> 95%). We conclude that time-frequency analysis is an appropriate approach to detect brief and subtle FOG episodes. Future work will need to decide whether this approach can support or even replace expert clinical opinion.

### Short rapid steps to provoke freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^10950c02]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Freezing of gait (FOG) is both common and debilitating in patients with Parkinson's disease. Due to its episodic nature, it is a challenge to provoke FOG in clinical practice and in the research setting. Turning is most sensitive to provoke FOG, particularly when performed as rapidly as possible. Walking with short steps is an alternative approach to provoke FOG. Here, we assessed a modified version of this test, consisting of the instruction to make short steps as rapidly as possible. We evaluated what the diagnostic value of this new test is compared to rapid turning. 28 patients with Parkinson's disease participated, who all had objective FOG. Patients performed the following tasks two times: (1) normal walking, (2) walking as rapidly as possible, (3) walking with short steps, (4) walking with short steps as rapidly as possible and (5) making full rapid turns in both directions. FOG was provoked in 20 subjects (71%). The most effective test to provoke FOG was rapid full turns (64% of subjects). FOG occurred more often when patients walked with rapid short steps (50%) compared to walking with short steps at normal speed (18%). The combination of 'full rapid turns' and 'walking with short steps rapidly' yielded the highest sensitivity of provoking FOG (0.71, CI 0.51–0.86). The most sensitive way to provoke FOG is by asking patients to make full rapid turns, but if negative, walking with short steps as rapidly as possible can identify further subjects with FOG.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^4903eba4]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID symptom management — commonly used medications are outlined with typical doses, indications, and notable side effects. Propranolol 5–10 mg BID to QID is used for IST (inappropriate sinus tachycardia), POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), OH (orthostatic hypotension), NCS (neurocardiogenic syncope), and episodic hypertension, with bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, depression, and asthma exacerbation noted. Midodrine 2.5–10 mg TID to QID targets POTS, OH, NCS, and hypotension and can cause supine hypertension, scalp paresthesias, and piloerection. Fludrocortisone is started at 0.05 mg QD for 1 week then increased by 0.05 mg QD every week to a max dose of 0.2 mg QD for POTS, OH, NCS, or hypotension, with hypokalemia, edema, and headache listed. Pyridostigmine 30–60 mg BID to TID is noted for POTS, OH, AN, and GI dysmotility with constipation, with diarrhea and muscle twitching reported. H1 and H2 antihistamines in combination have a sample regimen of cetirizine 10 mg daily or levocetirizine 5 mg daily plus famotidine 20 mg daily or bid for MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome) symptoms, with listed adverse effects for cetirizine and famotidine. Low‑dose naltrexone sample regimen starts 1 mg QD for 4 weeks then increases by 1 mg QD every 4 weeks to a max dose of 4.5 mg QD being studied for fatigue, PEM/PESE (postexertional malaise/postexertional symptom exacerbation), and headache, and often requires compounding with diarrhea and nausea noted. Methylphenidate 5–10 mg BID to TID is listed for POTS, OH, NCS, brain fog, and fatigue with headache, tachycardia, insomnia, and risk of PEM/PESE exacerbation during the drug's duration of action. Amantadine 100 mg QD to BID is described for fatigue and brain fog, is contraindicated for ESRD (end‑stage renal disease) with withdrawal risks if abruptly discontinued, and may cause dry mouth, OH, neuropsychiatric symptoms, livedo reticularis, nausea, and abdominal pain. Gabapentin 100–300 mg QHS to TID, then increased 100–300 mg every week, is described for neuropathic pain and poor sleep quality with need for renal dosing and brain fog, sleepiness, dizziness, and nausea. The table additionally lists COVID‑19 vaccine with an annual booster to lower risk of subsequent COVID infection sequelae and reduce the severity and duration of PASC, while vaccine reaction or worsening of symptoms is noted. A general principle states that medication use in Long COVID generally follows standard practice regarding indications and dosing with extra attention to starting doses lower and ramping up slowly, prioritizing patient preference, using caution with medications that may worsen some symptoms while improving others, and tapering off if no noticeable benefit.

### Ambient air pollution and hospitalizations for schizophrenia in China [^542a8cf7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people or 1 in 300 people (0.32%) worldwide, and this rate corresponds to 1 in 222 people (0.45%) among adults. Most patients with schizophrenia experience multiple relapses, which generally result in poorer longitudinal outcomes, including a greater risk of suicide and reduced quality of life. Ambient air pollution, the second highest risk factor for noncommunicable diseases, is likely to serve as one of the key risk factors for mental disorders.

Acute episodes of schizophrenia are often linked to acute oxidative stress, which can be stimulated by short-term exposure to ambient air pollution. Existing studies investigating this association are limited to individual cities or specific subpopulations (such as patients aged ≥ 65 years). A comprehensive study covering all age groups that could systematically elucidate the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and risk of schizophrenia episodes is still lacking.

Particularly, existing studies are primarily concentrated on the absolute concentrations of ambient air pollution, which are probably unable to capture the potential effects of short-term increases in air pollution concentrations before the onset of schizophrenia episodes. In fact, adverse mental health events (eg, acute schizophrenia episodes) may be more sensitive to air pollution increase within a short time, analogous to relocation stress syndrome, which refers to a state in which an individual experiences physiologic and/or psychosocial disturbances as a result of change in environment. However, no study has ever investigated the association of short-term increases in air pollution levels, such as relative increases in air pollution levels on the current day compared with the previous day, on risk of schizophrenia episodes. In addition, exposure to continuous increases in air pollution levels may generate accumulative oxidative damages, which supports the hypothesis that sustained increases in air pollution levels for several days are likely to be associated with a greater risk of acute schizophrenia episodes. Identifying associations of short-term relative increases in air pollution levels with schizophrenia episodes may help advance the understanding of air pollution–related risk of schizophrenia episodes and provide scientific basis for the formulation of targeted intervention strategies. Although air quality has improved considerably in China since 2013, current air pollution levels still have great health impacts. Additionally, because of the changes in the surface cyclone frequency brought on by climate change, air pollution events may become more frequent and severe and last longer. Investigation for the potential adverse health effects of short-term increases in air pollution levels is necessary.

### Examining factors associated with the length of short-term disability-free days among workers with previous short-term disability episodes [^d1ef8f85]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to examine the timing of short-term disability recurrence among workers who have previously experienced a short-term disability episode.

Methods

The dataset comes from a Canadian resource sector company's 2003 to 2006 short-term disability leave and human resource datasets. The multi-year dataset consists of the records of 3593 employees who experienced at least on short-term disability episode between 2003 and 2006.

Results

The overall 1-year disability-free rate was 72.1% ± 1.6%. About half of workers with previous disability episodes for mental/behavioral disorders were disability free for more than 800 days. In contrast, about 50% of workers with previous disability episodes for physical disorders were disability free for more than 1300 days.

Conclusions

These findings suggest the majority of workers with previous short-term disability episodes for mental/behavioral disorders remain disability free for more than 2 years. However, the duration of disability free days for these workers is half that of other workers with previous episodes.

### Recent-onset altered mental status: evaluation and management [^f375e05c]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Potential precipitating factors for the recent onset of altered mental status (AMS) include primary central nervous system insults, systemic infections, metabolic disturbances, toxin exposure, medications, chronic systemic diseases, and psychiatric conditions. Delirium is also an important manifestation of AMS, especially in older people who are hospitalized. Clinicians should identify and treat reversible causes of the AMS, some of which require urgent intervention to minimize morbidity and mortality. A history and physical examination guide diagnostic testing. Laboratory testing, chest radiography, and electrocardiography help diagnose infections, metabolic disturbances, toxins, and systemic conditions. Neuroimaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed when the initial evaluation does not identify a cause or raises concern for intracranial pathology. Lumbar puncture and electroencephalography are also important diagnostic tests in the evaluation of AMS. Patients at increased risk of AMS benefit from preventive measures. The underlying etiology determines the definitive treatment. When intervention is needed to control patient behaviors that threaten themselves or others, nonpharmacologic interventions are preferred to medications. Physical restraints should rarely be used and only for the shortest time possible. Medications should be used only when nonpharmacologic treatments are ineffective.

### How COVID-19 shaped mental health: from infection to pandemic effects [^b02399c1]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened global mental health, both indirectly via disruptive societal changes and directly via neuropsychiatric sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite a small increase in self-reported mental health problems, this has (so far) not translated into objectively measurable increased rates of mental disorders, self-harm or suicide rates at the population level. This could suggest effective resilience and adaptation, but there is substantial heterogeneity among subgroups, and time-lag effects may also exist. With regard to COVID-19 itself, both acute and post-acute neuropsychiatric sequelae have become apparent, with high prevalence of fatigue, cognitive impairments and anxiety and depressive symptoms, even months after infection. To understand how COVID-19 continues to shape mental health in the longer term, fine-grained, well-controlled longitudinal data at the (neuro)biological, individual and societal levels remain essential. For future pandemics, policymakers and clinicians should prioritize mental health from the outset to identify and protect those at risk and promote long-term resilience.

### Idiopathic hypersomnia: recognition and management in psychiatric practice [^6f595725]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective: This review of the relationship between idiopathic hypersomnia and psychiatric disorders describes considerations in recognizing and managing complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients in psychiatric clinical practice.

Data Sources: Terms including "idiopathic hypersomnia" and "psychiatric" were used to search PubMed and Embase for English-language publications of human studies from inception to July 2024.

Study Selection: Articles were manually screened for relevance to idiopathic hypersomnia pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment and EDS in psychiatric populations. Reference lists of identified articles were manually searched for additional relevant publications.

Data Extraction: Formal data charting was not performed.

Results: A total of 119 articles were included. Idiopathic hypersomnia is a central sleep disorder with the primary complaint of EDS, diagnosed prevalence of 0.037%, and estimated population prevalence up to 1.5%. Other prominent symptoms include sleep inertia, long sleep time, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, brain fog, and cognitive complaints. A high proportion of patients with idiopathic hypersomnia experience psychiatric comorbidities, including mood disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Assessing individuals with psychiatric disorders and complaints of hypersomnolence can pose diagnostic challenges. Diagnosis and treatment may be complicated by possible exacerbation of EDS by psychiatric medications and, conversely, exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms by idiopathic hypersomnia treatments.

Conclusions: Psychiatric clinicians are more likely to encounter patients with idiopathic hypersomnia than would be expected given its overall prevalence due to increased rate of psychiatric symptom comorbidity in this population. Recognizing and managing idiopathic hypersomnia for individuals with psychiatric conditions may lead to improvements in treatment outcome for patients.

### The association between the number of symptoms and the severity of post-COVID-Fatigue after SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in an outpatient setting [^a2a77150]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

In most prior investigations, fatigue was the most common or second most common post-acute symptom, even 2 months after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. As mentioned before, a comparison of symptoms with other studies is difficult. Most prior studies have collected far less than 41 symptoms. Nevertheless, our findings are largely consistent with many studies. Most symptoms decrease after the acute infection, a finding which could be confirmed in the present study. In the PCF group, the most frequently reported persistent symptoms were difficulties concentrating (55%), followed by memory impairment (49%) and muscle or joint pain (41%). These results were similar to those of other studies, including a study by Peter et al. where 30 symptoms were clustered. The most common clusters were fatigue (including: rapid physical exhaustion, and chronic fatigue), neurocognitive impairment (including: difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and confusion), and chest symptoms (including: shortness of breath, chest pain, and wheezing). In addition to these most severe symptoms, the least severe persistent symptoms were also comparable. In both studies, typical infection symptoms, such as fever and chills, greatly decreased during the acute phase of infection. In the group comparison of PCF and non-PCF, 33 symptoms showed significant differences. The typical cold symptoms were present in both groups and were not significant, such as runny nose, fever, or cough. Of all the aforementioned 33 symptoms, 30 symptoms were observed to be significantly related to the severity of PCF. The symptoms concentration difficulties and memory problems showed the strongest associations. These results are similar to the findings of the systematic review by Joli et al. In that systematic review, fatigue (by definition) was always present; anhedonia, brain fog, and difficulty concentrating (up to 81%); myalgia (up to 55%); depression/anxiety (up to 47%); insomnia, sleep problems (up to 33%); and dementia or memory loss (up to 32%). Our results are also comparable to those of a meta-analysis by Lopes-Leon et al. including 15 studies from France, Italy, USA, Australia, UK, Mexico, Ireland, China and Egypt. Here, 55 persistent symptoms related to COVID-19 were studied. The five most common manifestations were fatigue, headache, attention deficit disorder, hair loss, and dyspnea. Headache was the most commonly reported symptom during acute infection in our study, and subjects continued to report it as a persistent symptom, placing them in the top third of persistent symptoms. The outcome attention deficit disorder from the meta-analysis is comparable to the symptom difficulty concentrating, which was the most frequently reported persistent symptom in the present study. Hair loss and dyspnea were listed in our study, but both outcomes were not as common as reported in the meta-analysis.

### Dual task turning in place: a reliable, valid, and responsive outcome measure of freezing of gait [^a87b6d71]. Movement Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a complex symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) that is both elusive to elicit and varied in its presentation. These complexities present a challenge to measuring FOG in a sensitive and reliable way, precluding therapeutic advancement.

Objective

We investigated the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of manual video annotations of the turning-in-place task and compared it to the sensor-based FOG ratio.

Methods

Forty-five optimally medicated people with PD and FOG performed rapid alternating 360° turns without and with an auditory stroop dual task, thrice over two consecutive days. The tasks were video recorded, and inertial sensors were placed on the lower back and shins. Interrater reliability between three raters, criterion validity with self-reported FOG, and responsiveness to single-session split-belt treadmill (SBT) training were investigated and contrasted with the sensor-based FOG ratio.

Results

Visual ratings showed excellent agreement between raters for the percentage time frozen (%TF) (ICC [intra-class correlation coefficient] = 0.99), the median duration of a FOG episode (ICC = 0.90), and the number of FOG episodes (ICC = 0.86). Dual tasking improved the sensitivity and validity of visual FOG ratings resulting in increased FOG detection, criterion validity with self-reported FOG ratings, and responsiveness to a short SBT intervention. The sensor-based FOG ratio, on the contrary, showed complex FOG presentation-contingent relationships with visual and self-reported FOG ratings and limited responsiveness to SBT training.

Conclusions

Manual video annotations of FOG during dual task turning in place generate reliable, valid, and sensitive outcomes for investigating therapeutic effects on FOG. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

Serotonin syndrome — clinical presentation and morbidity includes severe manifestations such as high fever (up to 41.1°C) and a rapid time course, with symptom onset that is generally rapid, often within minutes of exposure, with most patients presenting within 6 to 24 hours. Agitated delirium is the most common form of mental status change, and myoclonus is the most common neuromuscular finding alongside hyperreflexia and clonus. Severe cases carry substantial risk and resource use, with approximately one-quarter of patients treated with intubation, mechanical ventilation, and admission to an ICU, and the mortality rate is approximately 11%, with the most common cause of death being inadequate management of hyperthermia.

In situations where there is continued ambiguity regarding evidence of conscious awareness despite serial neurobehavioral assessments, or where confounders to a valid clinical diagnostic assessment are identified, clinicians may use multimodal evaluations incorporating specialised functional imaging or electrophysiologic studies to assess for evidence of awareness not identified on neurobehavioral assessment that might prompt consideration of an alternate diagnosis (Level C based on assessment of benefit relative to harm, feasibility, and cost relative to benefit).

Hypomanic episode — diagnostic criteria state that during a period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more) symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) must persist, represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and be present to a significant degree, including inflated self-esteem or grandiosity; decreased need for sleep; more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking; flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing; distractibility; increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation; and excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic, and the disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization, and if there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis; however, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis. Criteria A-F constitute a hypomanic episode, and hypomanic episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

### The risk of long COVID symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled studies [^845378e2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

It is now well-established that a significant proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 go on to experience prolonged and, in some cases, debilitating symptoms for many months following recovery from the initial acute infection, which is commonly referred to as Long Covid or Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. A 2022 pooled observational analysis of 54 global studies (1.2 million individuals from 22 countries) found 3 months after infection, 6.2% reported 1 of 3 Long Covid symptom clusters, including ongoing respiratory problems (3.7%), persistent fatigue with bodily pain or mood swings (3.2%), and cognitive issues (2.2%), adjusted for pre-existing health. A large systematic review of 194 global studies published in early 2023 reported that, at an average follow-up time of 4 months, 45% of COVID-19 survivors, regardless of hospitalisation status, experienced at least one unresolved symptom. In addition, fatigue, disturbed sleep, and breathlessness were highly prevalent symptoms reported across hospitalised, non-hospitalised, and mixed cohorts. Over twenty systematic reviews on the prevalence, incidence and long-term health effects of Long Covid have been conducted –. A major limitation of these reviews is that they have largely synthesised observational studies that have not utilised a comparator or control population. This is especially important when evaluating symptoms prevalent in the general population (e.g. headache, fatigue, sleep problems), or those possibly worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The only systematic review in adults that examined prevalence in studies including uninfected controls reported that infection with SARS-CoV-2 carried significantly higher risk of fatigue (risk ratio, RR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.10), shortness of breath (RR 2.60, 95% CI: 1.96, 3.44), memory difficulties (RR 2.53, 95% CI: 1.30, 4.93), and concentration difficulties (RR 2.14, 95% CI: 1.25, 3.67) at ≥ 4 weeks following infection. This review of 33 studies however only considered fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, and quality of life outcomes, and it included studies of healthcare workers, so cannot be considered a review of general populations.

Mental health conditions and associated diagnostic criteria — major depressive episode (DSM-5-TR) includes symptoms nearly every day such as depressed mood and markedly diminished interest or pleasure, with possible significant weight change defined as "a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month", and may include recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation/plan/attempt; symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment and the episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition; criteria A–C constitute a major depressive episode. Responses to a significant loss may resemble a depressive episode, and clinical judgment based on the individual's history and cultural norms is required in this context.

### Parkinson's disease and post-COVID-19 syndrome: the Parkinson's long-COVID spectrum [^aab24adb]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Implications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection in Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly worsening of motor and non‐motor symptoms and possibly higher mortality in those with advanced disease, comorbidities, and frailty have been reported in several case series and observational studies. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 As time has evolved, the issue of long‐term sequelae in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), often referred to as "long COVID", has emerged, and recently, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has defined the "post–COVID‐19 syndrome" as "signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID‐19, continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis". 6 Here we present the prevalence of post–COVID‐19 syndrome in 27 patients with PD who were affected by COVID‐19 across several centers in the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, and Mexico from the beginning of March 2020 to present (Table 1). As some of the post–COVID‐19 symptoms may be part of the PD clinical phenomenology, we considered symptoms part of the clinical manifestations of a post–COVID‐19 syndrome only if these occurred after a confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or in case of an acute or subacute worsening of a preexisting symptom that had been previously stable. In addition, we report on motor worsening and increased levodopa equivalent daily dose requirements within the long‐COVID spectrum. In our series, 23 (85.2%) patients with PD developed post–COVID 19 symptoms (Table 1). We report that the most common long‐term effects of COVID‐19 are worsening of motor function (51.9%) and increased levodopa daily dose requirements (48.2%) followed by fatigue (40.7%); cognitive disturbances (22.2%), including "brain fog", loss of concentration and memory deficits; and sleep disturbances (22.2%), such as insomnia. Broadly these symptom complexes concur with the existing literature on long COVID in the general population. 7 Interestingly, the severity of COVID‐19, as indicated by a history of hospitalization, did not seem to be the condicio sine qua non for the development of a post–COVID‐19 syndrome in patients with PD. We also believe that in some cases the stress of a prolonged lockdown due to the pandemic and the reduced access to health care and rehabilitation interventions may contribute to the burden of the post–COVID‐19 syndrome in PD. Therefore, post‐COVID clinical manifestations may result from a combination of new symptoms and lockdown as well as viral illness‐related worsening of preexisting PD features.

### Cognitive training for freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease: a randomized controlled trial [^5296d496]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was percentage of time spent frozen (%TF) across all four trials of a TUG assessment. Percentage was chosen as the primary outcome as it was anticipated to be more sensitive than a reduction on the FOG-Q, whilst accounting for inter-individual variability in gait speed and the variable duration of freezing episodes across TUG tasks. In each task, the participant was requested to get up from a chair, walk to a square box shape taped to the floor five meters ahead and complete both a left and a right turn (see Fig. 2). TUGs were video recorded and then scored independently post-assessment. Six scorers (MG, JMH, AJM, MG, JYYS, and KAEM) were randomly distributed videos of the TUGs. Scorers were given baseline and follow-up TUG videos in a random order for the same participant, to minimize pre-post scoring variability. FoG was tagged in the video at any point when a participant made a paroxysmal and involuntary cessation of normal progression of the feet through the task. This included a typical trembling of the feet, short shuffling steps of a few centimetres in length or a complete motor block.

The %TF outcome was calculated by summing all FoG episodes across the four conditions, and dividing by the total time to complete across all conditions. Inter-rater variability amongst blinded scorers was strong, and calculated by all scorers being given a random selection of the same six videos to independently score. The intraclass correlation coefficient was.902 across all FoG episodes (average %TF: 9.56%). We note that two of the six videos by chance did not contain FoG, however they were included to confirm no false-positive scoring had occurred. As this inflated reliability across scorers however, we re-calculated the coefficient with the two videos removed to be sure. Scoring was still accurate across raters (.865) (average %TF: 14.31%).

### Evaluation and management of children with acute mental health or behavioral problems. part II: recognition of clinically challenging mental health related conditions presenting with medical or uncertain symptoms [^f441b934]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotic neurologic adverse effects — incidence, timing, and management — Acute dystonia is characterized by involuntary motor tics or spasms and can include rare, potentially life‑threatening laryngeal dystonia presenting as a choking sensation, difficulty breathing, or stridor. Akathisia generally occurs within the first few days of antipsychotic medication administration, is found in up to 25% of patients, and has been reported after a single, standard dose (10 mg) of prochlorperazine; both acute dystonia and akathisia tend to occur early (days to weeks) and are easily reversed. To minimize these adverse effects, some advocate coadministering 25 to 50 mg of diphenhydramine or 1 to 2 mg of benztropine when giving an antipsychotic, whereas others prefer anticholinergic treatment only if acute symptoms occur, followed by 2 days of oral therapy. Delayed‑onset syndromes include Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia; Parkinsonism symptoms are found in up to 13% of patients and generally occur weeks to months after starting antipsychotic therapy, and drug‑induced Parkinsonism is often treated by adding an anticholinergic agent, adding a dopaminergic agonist (eg, amantadine), or decreasing the dosage of a typical antipsychotic or switching to an atypical antipsychotic, with early diagnosis and rapid withdrawal possibly improving complete recovery. Tardive dyskinesia occurs in 5% of young patients per year and is more common with older "typical" antipsychotics, and antipsychotic‑induced seizures are rare (usually < 1%) at therapeutic doses except for clozapine, which has a 5% incidence at high doses.

Mediation analysis

Table 3 reports the direct, indirect (mediated) and total effects, as well as the overall statistical indices of the six mediation models tested between cognitive function and cognitive complaints through the four mediators. The statistical indices showed an acceptable goodness‐of‐fit with the data in the four simple models evaluated (χ²/df < 5, p > 0.05; RMSEA < 0.08, SRMR < 0.08, CFI > 0.95). Thus, these simple models for each mediator showed an indirect effect of cognitive function on FLEI via depression (β = −0.254, p < 0.01), anxiety (β = −0.116, p < 0.01) and fatigue (β = −0.340, p < 0.001), but not through sleep quality (β = −0.059, p = 0.133). Age and years of education were also not statistically significant mediators (β = −0.077, p = 0.634 and β = 0.581, p = 0.227, respectively). On the other hand, goodness‐of‐fit statistics indicated that the multiple parallel model fitted the data poorly (χ² = 257.9, χ²/df = 9.92, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.235, SRMR = 0.169, CFI = 0.643), probably due to inclusion of a nonsignificant mediator such as sleep quality. As shown by the parameter estimates in Figure 3, there was a strong positive relationship (β = 1.76, p < 0.001) between fatigue and cognitive complaints (FLEI) perceived by the patients, and although to a lesser extent, there was also a positive relationship (β = 0.28, p < 0.05) between depression and cognitive complaints (FLEI). The results showed a significant direct effect (β = −0.297, p < 0.05) between cognitive function and cognitive complaints (FLEI), but this relationship was partially mediated (total indirect effect, β = −0.394; p < 0.001) through the mediators. However, only the indirect effect of the pathway via fatigue was significant (p < 0.001) and accounted for most of the total indirect effect between cognitive functioning and FLEI (−0.317/−0.394). Finally, goodness‐of‐fit statistics indicated that the serial model between cognitive function and the FLEI pathway via the direction flow depression–anxiety–fatigue–sleep quality fitted the data correctly (χ² = 26.83, χ²/df = 1.58, p = 0.061; RMSEA = 0.059, SRMR = 0.036, CFI = 0.978). All parameters, estimated as standardized regression weights, together with their level of significance, are shown in Figure 4, while the indirect effect paths are reported in Table 4. The results revealed a significant relationship identical to those described in the previous parallel model between FLEI score and both depression (β = 1.76, p < 0.001) and fatigue (β = 0.28, p < 0.05). In addition, depression had a significantly moderate relationship with anxiety (β = 0.584, p < 0.001) and fatigue (β = 0.37, p < 0.001). Consequently, the results show that the four mediators in this serial causal order fully mediate (total indirect effect, β = −0.42, p < 0.001) the relationship between cognitive function and FLEI score, and this effect on the total was significantly greater than the direct effect (β = −0.297, p < 0.05) alone. However, as shown in Table 4, the indirect path in which fatigue and depression are involved, both separately (β = −0.069, p = 0.099 and β = −0.142, p = 0.070, respectively) and especially in serial depression–fatigue (β = −0.161, p < 0.001), explained most of this total indirect effect between cognitive function and FLEI score.

Mothers of infants in the NICU suffer higher rates of psychological distress, anxiety, and depression compared with the general population. Often, their mental health concerns remain underidentified and undertreated, which can have deleterious effects on the offspring, both in short-term outcomes while in the NICU as well as long-term neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes. In this review, we present an overview of existing empirical evidence about how maternal mental health affects the health of infants, special considerations regarding the mental health needs of NICU mothers, and the findings about existing and developing interventions to address mental health concerns in this vulnerable population.

Methods

Study design and participants

This retrospective, observational, single-centre study was conducted at the NCNP, Tokyo, Japan. Patients were included in this study when they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) long COVID diagnosis between 1 June 2021 and 31 May 2024, based on the definition of long COVID by the WHO Delphi consensus criteria (2021);(2) confirmation of past COVID-19 infection by PCR or antigen test; (3) aged older than 15 years and visited the clinic and (4) checked for positive signs as detailed below. If necessary, a diagnosis of long COVID was confirmed through additional tests, including blood tests and head MRI, to check whether a patient's condition could be explained by other diagnoses. Confirmation of past infection was necessary to exclude the so-called 'long COVID mimic condition'. Exclusion criteria were no neurological examination or no check of whether a patient had positive signs. A flow chart detailing the inclusion process is shown in figure 1.

Figure 1
Study flowchart. WHO = World Health Organization. COVID = Coronavirus disease

Clinical data assessment

At the clinic, all patients were examined by physicians certified as fellows of the Japanese Society of Internal Medicine and as board-certified neurologists of the Japanese Society of Neurology (MO, TO, HK, TS and MT). Data for this study were collected from medical records by MO. To guarantee the quality of this procedure and to address potential bias, all the information was double-checked by TO after reviewing patients' medical records. The information gathered included patient demographics, comorbidities and clinical and neurological characteristics, including positive signs. We categorised the year of acute infection as before or after 2022 because the Omicron COVID-19 variant became dominant after January 2022, and the number of patients in Japan increased markedly after 2022'. atigue' included postexercise malaise and patients who described their symptoms as 'brain fog', including 'memory or concentration disturbances'. 'Comorbidity of psychiatric diseases' covered instances when psychiatrists diagnosed patients with depression, adjustment disorder, autism spectrum disorder, Asperger's syndrome, bipolar disorder, developmental disorders, emotionally unstable personality disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or schizophrenia before COVID-19 infection. We did not use any cross-database linkage; the data were drawn solely from the NCNP medical records.

### Estimating the net benefit of a specialized return-to-work program for workers on short-term disability related to a mental disorder: an example exploring investment in collaborative care [^569f001c]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This article estimates the net benefit for a company incorporating a collaborative care model into its return-to-work program for workers on short-term disability related to a mental disorder.

Methods

Employing a simple decision model, the net benefit and uncertainty were explored.

Results

The breakeven point occurs when the average short-term disability episode is reduced by at least 7 days. In addition, 85% of the time, benefits could outweigh costs.

Conclusions

Model results and sensitivity analyses indicate that organizational benefits can be greater than the costs of incorporating a collaborative care model into a return-to-work program for workers on short-term disability related to a mental disorder. The results also demonstrate how the probability of a program's effectiveness and the magnitude of its effectiveness are key factors that determine whether the benefits of a program outweigh its costs.

### Common mental disorder and obesity: insight from four repeat measures over 19 years: prospective whitehall II cohort study [^7e8fe4e3]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Meaning of the study

The two sets of analyses provide evidence that common mental disorder is predictive of subsequent weight gain and obesity in this population of British middle aged adults. Evidence of a dose-response relation also suggests that people with chronic or repeated episodes of common mental disorder are particularly at risk of subsequent obesity. By contrast, our findings do not suggest that obesity leads to common mental disorders in this population, as the association between the two was attenuated when study members who were general health questionnaire cases at baseline were removed from the analysis.

Several plausible explanations exist for the observation that persistent common mental disorder is a risk factor for obesity. Firstly, common mental disorders are associated with eating disorders, both over-consumption and under-consumption, which could influence future changes in adiposity. Secondly, physical inactivity, a major contributing factor to obesity, is more prevalent among people with mental health problems, and some randomised controlled trials suggest that exercise reduces depressive symptoms among people with a diagnosis of depression, although in high quality trials the effect is close to the null. Thirdly, commonly used drug treatments for mental disorders have known side effects that may result in weight gain (tricyclic antidepressants), weight loss (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), or both (short term and long term effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Fourthly, biological factors, such as dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, may strengthen the link between mental disorders and obesity. For example, some evidence exists of abnormal concentrations of hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis among obese people with coexisting depressive symptoms. All these mechanisms are likely to increase the risk of obesity in a dose-response fashion such that single episodes of, for example, hormonal dysregulation would be less likely to increase risk than would two, three, or more repeated episodes or than would a continuous chronic disorder.

### Mental health impact of 9 / 11 pentagon attack: validation of a rapid assessment tool [^411c1624]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Following the tragic events of 9/11/2001, the Pentagon Post Disaster Health Assessment (PPDHA) survey was created to identify healthcare needs and concerns among Pentagon personnel and to assure that appropriate care and information was provided. The PPDHA was fielded from October 15, 2001, to January 15, 2002. Fundamental in this assessment was the evaluation of the mental health impact as a result of the attack.

Methods

Although a number of standardized instruments exist for mental health domains, most are lengthy and could not be used as a rapid health assessment. Instead, a short screening instrument consisting of 17 questions was developed that covered important mental health symptom domains, mental health functioning, and possible predictive risk factors. High-risk groups for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, panic attacks, generalized anxiety, and alcohol abuse were assessed, and validation of risk groups was assessed across functional levels.

Results

Overall, 1837 (40%) respondents met the screening criteria for any of the symptom domains of interest 1 to 4 months after the attack: PTSD (7.9%), depression (17.7%), panic attacks (23.1%), generalized anxiety (26.9%), or alcohol abuse (2.5%). Mental health risk groups were highly correlated with self-reported reduced daily functioning and use of counseling services. Additionally, risk factors known to be associated with mental health problems after traumatic events were strongly predictive of the high-risk categories identified.

Conclusions

Mental health concerns were common among Pentagon employees in the 4 months after the 9/11 attack. Data from this study suggested that the short mental health screening instrument had validity and can serve as a prototype for rapid public health assessment of the mental health impact of future traumatic events.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of fatigue-dominant long-COVID subjects: a cross-sectional study [^8a493d8d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Long COVID is defined by persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Approximately 71% of individuals with long COVID experience ongoing fatigue, postexertional malaise, and cognitive impairments, which share pathological similarities with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). This similarity has prompted studies to explore the characteristics of long COVID to gain a better understanding of ME/CFS. To gain insights, we investigated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of individuals with fatigue-dominant long COVID.

Methods

We enrolled 100 subjects (36 males, 64 females) with long COVID who had a higher score than 60 in the modified Korean version of the Chalder Fatigue Scale (mKCFQ11) and higher than 5 in a fatigue-focused visual analogue scale. To investigate fatigue symptoms, the mKCFQ11, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, a visual analogue scale for fatigue and brain fog, along with the Short-Form survey, were employed. We also measured 3 cytokines and cortisol levels for immunological and endocrinological indicators. As a cross-sectional observational study, the data were collected at a single point in time.

Results

The mean scores on the measurements showed severe fatigue, and these scores were significantly correlated, with no differences based on sex, the post-COVID period, or age. Among the laboratory tests, plasma cortisol levels had a significant negative correlation with fatigue scores and a positive correlation with living quality. The negative correlation between cortisol levels and mKCFQ11 scores appeared to be more specific to mental fatigue than physical, which conflicted with other measurements.

Conclusion

Our findings provide the first insights into the characteristics of fatigue in individuals with long COVID, particularly in terms of fatigue severity and cortisol levels. These results serve as valuable reference data for clinicians dealing with fatigue symptoms in long-COVID patients and for researchers exploring postviral fatigue symptoms, including ME/CFS, in the future.

### Symptoms and risk factors for long COVID: a cross-sectional study in primary care [^5e9c86a6]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

A significant number of patients experience heterogeneous sequelae following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, commonly known as Long COVID. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the lasting effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) as a "condition that occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID‐19, with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis". The WHO consensus definition also specifies that common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, but also others, and they may fluctuate or relapse over time.

The reported prevalence of Long COVID varies considerably. Differences in methods, population, and classification of cases (settings, severity, duration, number, and sets of symptoms) make it difficult to summarize the findings across studies. While the highest burden is among those patients with a history of mild to moderate COVID‐19 illness, the vast majority of studies following severe COVID‐19. Additionally, there is the paucity of evidence on Long COVID among nonhospitalized patients from low‐ and middle‐income countries and from primary care.

Timely diagnosis of prolonged health problems following acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is key for preventing chronic or life‐debilitating conditions. However, there is a debate about whether the list of possible symptoms reported in people who experienced Long COVID is too long to implement an effective diagnosis. Over 200 different symptoms have been identified as related to this illness, with some symptoms (e.g. fatigue, cognitive and mental dysfunction symptoms) being more frequent than others. To address the high heterogeneity of findings in Long COVID research, the Core Outcome Measurement in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative defined the core outcome set (COS), which was suggested to be measured and reported in studies of Long COVID. The authors noted that this minimum set of outcomes does not prohibit researchers from including other relevant outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence and risk factors for persistent symptoms after mild to moderate SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in patients who were presented in primary care during the 2021 pandemic. To overcome the possible heterogeneity of self‐reported Long COVID symptoms, a cross‐sectional survey was conducted using a questionnaire with a set of eighteen validated clinical outcomes.

### Brain activation underlying turning in Parkinson's disease patients with and without freezing of gait: a virtual reality fMRI study [^4ea2ad19]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Gait protocol

Each subject completed eight video recorded 5-m long timed up and go tasks, during which each turn was performed inside a 50-cm 2 taped box on the ground. The timed up and go tasks incorporated 180 and 540° turns in both directions, taking short steps around the outline of the box in both directions and two vocal dual tasks (i.e. naming multiples of nine and months of the year backwards) with 180° turns in both directions. The videos were scored offline for periods of freezing as defined by a brief, episodic absence or marked reduction of forward progression of the feet despite the intention to walk. The timed up and go tasks clinically confirmed FOG in all but one subjects in the PD+FOG group, whereas none of the PD−NF patients experienced any freezing episode. The one subject in the PD+FOG group was still included into the study based on a positive score on the FOG-Q3 and UPDRS question 3.11 and because he was seen by an experienced physician to have experienced freezing when arriving into the clinic.

### Unraveling brain fog in post-COVID syndrome: relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^76410be2]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study evaluated a large cohort of patients with PCS. They were assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, including a questionnaire on subjective perception and objective cognitive testing for the main cognitive domains. Our findings revealed that cognitive complaints were mainly focused on attention and episodic memory, while executive functions (planning) issues were less reported. It is well known that there may be significant discrepancies between subjective cognitive experiences and objective neuropsychological performance, as shown in other disorders. On the one hand, daily‐life situations may be more complex and more demanding (and more likely to be influenced by external factors such as distractions or emotional factors) than neuropsychological examinations. On the other hand, cognitive complaints may be the final outcome of several processes, including cognitive functioning but also fatigue or neuropsychiatric symptoms. In addition, mood disorders could also distort subjective cognitive perception. For this reason, in our study, patients were also assessed for fatigue, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep quality. Interestingly, subjective cognition showed statistically significant correlations with several of these factors, especially with fatigue followed by depression and anxiety. Higher levels of fatigue, depression, and anxiety were associated with poorer subjective cognitive perception. Regarding cognitive testing, cognitive complaints were mainly correlated with the Stroop test, followed by SDMT, Digit Span Forward and semantic fluency. In this case, higher levels of cognitive complaints were correlated with lower cognitive performance. These results confirm that cognitive complaints were especially correlated with attention/processing speed, the most impaired cognitive domain in PCS.

### Improving sleep quality leads to better mental health: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^3958a201]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Does improving sleep lead to better mental health? A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials

Problems sleeping are common. A review of several hundred epidemiological studies concluded that nearly one-third of the general population experience symptoms of insomnia (defined as difficulties falling asleep and/or staying asleep), between 4% and 26% experience excessive sleepiness, and between 2% and 4% experience obstructive sleep apnoea. Additionally, a recent study of over 2000 participants reported that the prevalence of 'general sleep disturbances' was 32% and Chattu et al. concluded on the basis of a large systematic review of the evidence that public and health professionals need to be more aware of the adverse effects of poor sleep. Mental health problems are also common, with around 17% of adults experiencing mental health difficulties of varying severities, and evidence from large nationally representative studies suggesting that mental health difficulties are on the increase. Sleep and mental health are, therefore, global public health challenges in their own right, with each having substantive impacts on both individuals and society. However, problems sleeping and mental health difficulties are also intrinsically linked. It was previously assumed that mental health difficulties led to problems sleeping; however, the reverse may also be true, such that poor sleep contributes to the onset, recurrence, and maintenance of mental health difficulties. Therefore, the extent to which there is a causal relation between (poor) sleep and (worse) mental health and the possibility that interventions designed to improve sleep might be able to reduce mental health difficulties warrants investigation.

Evidence on the relationship between sleep and mental health

The association between sleep and mental health is well documented. For example, people with insomnia are 10 and 17 times more likely than those without insomnia to experience clinically significant levels of depression and anxiety, respectively. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 21 longitudinal studies reported that people with insomnia at baseline had a two-fold risk of developing depression at follow-up compared with people who did not experience insomnia. Although research most commonly studies the associations between insomnia and depression and anxiety, there is also evidence that problems sleeping are associated with a variety of mental health difficulties. For example, poor sleep has also been associated with post-traumatic stress, eating disorders, and psychosis spectrum experiences such as delusions and hallucinations. Studies have also found that specific sleep disorders, such as sleep apnoea, circadian rhythm disruption, restless leg syndrome, excessive daytime sleepiness and narcolepsy, sleepwalking, and nightmares are all more prevalent in those experiencing mental health difficulties.

### Economic burden of long COVID: macroeconomic, cost-of-illness and microeconomic impacts [^42ab69b7]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite growing attention, several critical research gaps remain in understanding the global economic impacts of long COVID. Firstly, there is a dire need for comprehensive longitudinal studies that track the economic impact on individuals and healthcare systems over extended periods, ideally across diverse geographical and socioeconomic contexts. Most existing data are cross-sectional or short-to-medium term, failing to capture the chronic and fluctuating nature of the condition. Secondly, more granular analyses are required to understand the economic burden associated with specific long COVID phenotypes or symptom clusters. For example, the impacts associated with neurological long COVID (e.g. severe cognitive impairment) may differ significantly from those primarily involving fatigue or respiratory symptoms. Thirdly, there is a significant gap in research evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various interventions for long COVID, including multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes, pharmacological treatments, and mental health support. Understanding which interventions offer the best value for money is crucial for efficient resource allocation within constrained healthcare budgets globally. Finally, robust data collection and harmonisation across different healthcare settings and countries are essential to allow for meaningful comparisons and the development of best practices. The lack of standardised diagnostic codes, evidence-based biomarkers, and reporting mechanisms for long COVID also hinders accurate and comparable data aggregation for estimating prevalence and economic losses.

### Severe hypoglycemia symptoms, antecedent behaviors, immediate consequences and association with glycemia medication usage: secondary analysis of the ACCORD clinical trial data [^b9b20638]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

What potential beneficial actions might these data suggest? Confusion and loss of consciousness was often seen as consequences of severe hypoglycemia. These serious outcomes suggest the need for clinicians to help their patients develop a proactive plan for prevention which includes recognition of symptoms such as confusion or disorientation as potential signs of hypoglycemia. While ACCORD was not designed to evaluate preventative measures, we did find lower overall rates of hypoglycemia in the standard group. The more frequent use of oral medications in the standard group suggests that these medications should be considered in those experiencing severe hypoglycemia. The biguanide class of medication had the lowest risk of hypoglycemia; adjustment of medication toward biguanides where possible is an option to consider.

Perhaps the most important finding from these analyses is that over half of hypoglycemic episodes were preceded by a decrease in carbohydrate intake. With proactive planning by patients with diabetes, this behavior could be changed with a potentially large impact on the risk of severe hypoglycemia. Adding these potential tools into already existing algorithms for preventing severe hypoglycemic episodes, could provide the patient and clinician more choices for shared decision making to avoid severe events.

### Prescriptions of antidepressants and anxiolytics in France 2012–2022 and changes with the COVID-19 pandemic: interrupted time series analysis [^ed56b748]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Mental health importantly affects overall well-being, and depression and anxiety have become a major public health concern. In 2019, the WHO estimated that 280 million and 301 million individuals were suffering from depression and anxiety worldwide, respectively, and increases in the prevalence of depression and anxiety have been reported for various countries over the past years. While non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive-behavioural therapy are an important part of treatment for these conditions, management often includes the use of antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs. Antidepressant and anxiolytic prescriptions have evolved dynamically over time, reflecting changes in societal attitudes, healthcare policies, clinical practice guidelines and prevailing patterns of anxiety and depression. Overall, the consumption of antidepressants has increased, while anxiolytic use has decreased over the last decade.

The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted societies worldwide and affected healthcare delivery and mental well-being in the population, as nations grappled with stringent public health measures such as lockdowns and physical distancing. While the WHO declared an end to the global health emergency in May 2023, its longer term implications on mental health and the prevalence of depression and anxiety merit careful investigation. Several studies from various countries have shown increases in depression and anxiety diagnoses and prescriptions of antidepressants and anxiolytics in the general population early after pandemic onset. This indicated a substantial acute impact of the pandemic on mental health. However, it remains unclear whether this trend persisted throughout the pandemic, and whether greater stringency of pandemic mitigation measures was associated with a higher incidence of depression and anxiety.

This study aimed to describe the consumption of antidepressants and anxiolytics from 2012 until 2022 in France and to evaluate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific objectives were to describe antidepressant and anxiolytic sales over this timeframe, assess whether previously reported short-term changes at pandemic onset persisted and evaluate the association of drug sales with the stringency of pandemic mitigation measures.

### Editorial: mental health distress in long COVID condition among the pediatric population: a contemporary medical challenge [^26cdf48a]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

As the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, a body of emerging evidence suggests that individuals who had been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suffered from lingering adverse health consequences. Such long-term conditions, also known as "long COVID" or "post-acute COVID syndrome", are reported to bring both pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations. 1 The most common features of long COVID include fatigue and headache, which frequently occur with neuropsychiatric impairments. Given that the onset of mental disorders occurs primarily in late childhood and adolescence, it is essential to focus on the pediatric population to determine the risk of mental disorder diagnosis following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^f9d7d94f]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope — definition and core features within transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC) — is defined as a T-LOC due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery. This definition differs from others by including the cause of unconsciousness, and without that addition the definition becomes wide enough to include disorders such as epileptic seizures and concussion. T-LOC is a term meant to encompass all disorders characterized by self-limited loss of consciousness irrespective of mechanism, and distinguishing both T-LOC and syncope minimizes conceptual and diagnostic confusion. Syncope can include a prodromal period with symptoms such as lightheadedness, nausea, sweating, weakness, and visual disturbances warning that syncope is imminent, although loss of consciousness often occurs without warning. Recovery is usually accompanied by almost immediate restoration of appropriate behaviour and orientation, retrograde amnesia may be more frequent than previously thought particularly in older individuals, and the post-recovery period may be marked by fatigue.

### The impact of marijuana policies on youth: clinical, research, and legal update [^d04bc317]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Marijuana policy — opponents' concerns about legalization for youth — focus on youth-directed marketing risks and health harms, asserting that legalization could open the floodgates of marketing, including subtle messaging to youth, even if laws apply only to adults older than either 18 or 21 years; that experiences with alcohol and tobacco show such marketing is linked to high youth use and could increase adolescent use and dependence; and that newer data in adolescents indicate potential negative effects on brain development, short-term memory and learning, coordination and reaction time with concerns for motor vehicle injuries and deaths, respiratory consequences and exposure to carcinogens with a study noting elevated rates of lung cancer in adults with long-term marijuana smoking histories, and associations with mental health disorders such as anxiety and schizophrenia.

### Small fibre neuropathy frequently underlies the painful long-COVID syndrome [^39d3e6ba]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Approximately 10% to 20% of individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection may develop long-COVID syndrome, characterized by various physical and mental health issues, including pain. Previous studies suggested an association between small fibre neuropathy and pain in long-COVID cases. In this case-control study, our aim was to identify small fibre neuropathy in patients experiencing painful long-COVID syndrome. Clinical data, quantitative sensory testing, and skin biopsies were collected from 26 selected patients with painful long-COVID syndrome. We also examined 100 individuals with past COVID-19 infection, selecting 33 patients with painless long-COVID syndrome, characterized mainly by symptoms such as brain fog and fatigue, and 30 asymptomatic post-COVID-19 controls. Demographic and clinical variables were compared among these groups. Among the 26 patients with painful long-COVID syndrome, 12 had skin biopsy and/or quantitative sensory testing abnormalities compatible with small fibre neuropathy. Demographic and clinical data did not differ across patients with small fibre neuropathy, patients with painless long-COVID syndrome, and asymptomatic post-COVID-19 controls. This case-control study showed that approximately 50% of patients experiencing painful long-COVID syndrome had small fibre neuropathy. However, in our patient cohort, this specific post-COVID-19 complication was unrelated to demographic and COVID-19 clinical variables. Approximately half of our sample of patients with painful long-COVID symptoms met diagnostic criteria for small fibre neuropathy.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: an expert consensus [^f43dfde3]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Bipolar disorder is a severe and chronic mental disorder characterized by fluctuations in mood between abnormally elevated highs (known as mania or hypomania episodes) and emotional lows (known as depressive episodes), affecting approximately 45 million patients worldwide. Although the severity of symptoms varies from person to person, manic and hypomanic episodes largely share the same symptoms, which can include an exaggerated sense of self‐esteem, impulsive or reckless behavior, racing thoughts, and a decreased need for sleep. Depressive episodes involve symptoms, such as intense sadness or despair, changes in appetite or sleep, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, feelings of guilt and agitation, difficulty concentrating, and reduced energy or fatigue. Psychosis (i.e. the occurrence of hallucinations or delusions) is also a common symptom of bipolar disorder; more than half of patients living with bipolar disorder have a lifetime history of psychotic symptoms, and the presence of psychotic symptoms in bipolar disorder has been associated with poorer patient outcomes. Bipolar disorder is often first diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood after several years of symptoms, varying greatly from person to person, thus making it a difficult disorder to diagnose.

Patients living with bipolar disorder report poor quality of life and severe role impairment, impacting on their ability to function, maintain relationships and stable employment, and make sound judgments. Compared to patients without the condition, bipolar disorder is associated with more missed workdays annually on average, and many employees living with the disorder end up on short‐term disability due to the high number of missed workdays.

Bipolar disorder type I (BP‐I) is characterized by manic or mixed episodes, with or without depression, with a lifetime prevalence of 0.6%. Mania is the defining feature of BP‐I. As mentioned, diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder, including BP‐I, is challenging; of note, increasing evidence is available on mania without major depressive episodes, also known as unipolar mania, which may represent a distinct diagnostic condition.
