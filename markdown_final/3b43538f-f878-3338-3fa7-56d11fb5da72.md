## Question

What is the recommended management of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended management of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and etiologies of BOS. Then, I should verify diagnostic criteria and staging. Next, I will examine first-line therapies, followed by adjunctive and advanced options. After that, I need to consider special populations and prevention. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and future directions, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate guidelines and studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and etiologies, because management hinges on whether BOS arises after lung transplantation, after hematopoietic cell transplantation, or in non-transplant settings. BOS is the clinical correlate of chronic allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation and is also a manifestation of chronic graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic HCT; pathologically, it reflects obliterative bronchiolitis with small-airway fibrosis and fixed airflow obstruction, and it remains a major cause of late morbidity and mortality in both contexts [^197b6966] [^ee4942e9] [^57b463f1].

> I need to check the diagnostic framework next. Diagnosis is primarily physiologic, using serial spirometry to document a persistent decline in FEV1 that is not explained by other causes, with ISHLT BOS stages 0–3 defined by the magnitude of FEV1 decline from baseline; in HCT, NIH criteria require FEV1 less than 75% predicted with an irreversible decline of at least 10% and supportive imaging or volume evidence, while excluding infection and other confounders [^197b6966] [^702f6e54]. Hold on, I should verify the role of imaging and biopsy: HRCT with inspiratory and expiratory views can show air trapping and mosaic attenuation but is nonspecific, and surgical lung biopsy is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty given morbidity, particularly in pediatrics [^1707da62] [^73d314d3].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy for post-lung transplant BOS. Azithromycin is the most consistently supported intervention. Guidelines recommend a trial of azithromycin for lung transplant recipients with a decline in FEV1 consistent with BOS, and BTS suggests 250 mg three times weekly for prevention and 250 mg on alternate days for a 3-month treatment trial, with long-term data suggesting slowed progression and improved survival when started early [^197b6966] [^aab4c066] [^fe46b52a] [^59f921c3]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: although randomized data are limited, multiple observational studies and a post hoc analysis support benefit, and guidelines frame this as a conditional recommendation with low-to-moderate certainty, which aligns with practice patterns [^197b6966] [^aab4c066] [^59f921c3].

> I should confirm immunosuppression optimization as a parallel pillar. Switching from cyclosporine to tacrolimus is recommended when BOS develops on a cyclosporine-based regimen, given stronger immunosuppression and potential stabilization of decline; similarly, switching from azathioprine to mycophenolate mofetil can be considered, with RCT data showing no BOS-free survival difference but improved rejection metrics and case series suggesting stabilization in some patients [^d5dec293] [^46e0a1c6] [^964c1973]. Hold on, I should verify that these are conditional recommendations; yes, both ISHLT/ATS/ERS and consensus pharmacotherapy statements frame these as reasonable strategies rather than mandates, to be individualized by center and patient factors [^197b6966] [^964c1973].

> Now, I will examine adjunctive and advanced therapies. For confirmed gastroesophageal reflux, fundoplication can be considered in selected patients, as reflux may potentiate allograft injury; this is a conditional recommendation and should follow objective reflux documentation and multidisciplinary review [^b00596a9] [^7ddf8166]. For end-stage, refractory BOS, retransplantation is a life-saving option in highly selected, ambulatory patients without significant comorbidities, with contemporary outcomes improving but donor scarcity and selection criteria remaining stringent [^713f2486] [^32b7a031] [^c4895897]. But wait, what about extracorporeal photopheresis? ERS/EBMT suggests considering ECP for progressive pulmonary cGVHD–phenotype BOS in adults, though evidence quality is limited and access varies, so this remains a conditional strategy in specialized centers [^fdb21050].

> Let me consider HCT-associated BOS, where the evidence base differs. Systemic corticosteroids are commonly used but responses are modest and heterogeneous, with roughly half of patients showing some improvement and diminishing returns with sustained high-dose therapy; thus, steroids are often combined with other agents rather than used as monotherapy [^a9c91020]. I should double-check the role of JAK inhibition: ruxolitinib has shown promising early outcomes in a phase 2 multicenter trial, with 27.8% of new BOS achieving at least a 10% FEV1 improvement at 3 months and 92.3% of established BOS achieving stabilization, supporting its use in selected adults, albeit with infection risk monitoring [^592e9c1d]. Pirfenidone is an emerging antifibrotic option with signals of improved FEV1 trajectories in a small open-label study and 56-week extension, but larger randomized trials are needed before routine adoption [^f065339b] [^578263a8]. I need to ensure I note that these HCT-specific therapies carry conditional recommendations and require multidisciplinary oversight given infection risks and limited certainty [^fdb21050].

> Next, I should review special populations, especially pediatrics. Children after HSCT have high rates of pulmonary complications and BOS, and early detection is hampered by limited spirometry feasibility; ATS pediatric guidelines recommend structured surveillance with spirometry, static volumes, and DLCO where feasible, starting at 3 months and continuing at defined intervals for up to 10 years, with bronchoscopy and BAL to exclude infection when BOS is suspected and surgical lung biopsy considered only when diagnostic uncertainty persists and risks are acceptable [^c5c8421f] [^30921a7c] [^73d314d3]. Hold on, I should verify that these are conditional recommendations; yes, the strength is conditional due to low certainty, reflecting the paucity of pediatric-specific data and the need to balance benefits and burdens in young children [^c5c8421f].

> I will now examine prevention strategies, because early intervention may alter trajectories. In lung transplant, primary prevention with low-dose azithromycin is reasonable to consider, with BTS suggesting 250 mg three times weekly, and augmented immunosuppression for clinically significant A1 acute cellular rejection may reduce subsequent BOS risk, though evidence quality varies and decisions should be individualized [^befa2147] [^06264019] [^a80fbca5] [^14c91276]. For HCT, early and sustained PFT surveillance is the cornerstone of detection, and while no proven primary pharmacologic prevention exists, minimizing infections, optimizing immunosuppression, and maintaining vigilance for early airflow decline are prudent [^c5c8421f] [^52e80f7d].

> Let me synthesize a practical management algorithm, and I should double-check that it aligns with guideline hierarchies. For post-lung transplant BOS, confirm the diagnosis with serial spirometry and exclude infection, then initiate azithromycin and optimize maintenance immunosuppression, consider fundoplication if reflux is documented and contributory, escalate to ECP in selected refractory cases, and refer for retransplantation evaluation in end-stage disease; for HCT-BOS, confirm with PFT criteria and exclude infection, start systemic corticosteroids with early consideration of ruxolitinib in appropriate adults, consider pirfenidone in trials or specialized centers, and coordinate supportive care including oxygen, rehabilitation, and vaccination; for pediatrics, prioritize surveillance and infection exclusion, reserve biopsy for unresolved diagnostic uncertainty, and tailor therapies to feasibility and comorbidities [^197b6966] [^aab4c066] [^592e9c1d] [^c5c8421f].

> Finally, I should acknowledge evidence gaps and future directions, and I need to ensure I cite the right calls to action. There is a pressing need for randomized trials to distinguish disease-modifying effects from natural history, validated biomarkers for early detection, standardized diagnostic criteria that capture preclinical disease, and head-to-head comparisons of immunomodulatory strategies; ATS research statements emphasize revising NIH criteria, integrating longitudinal spirometric change metrics, and fostering multicenter collaboration to close these gaps [^3f0ccafb] [^9e80f97e] [^8257c2c9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single agent being curative; current therapies are best viewed as disease-modifying at best, and management should remain multidisciplinary, center-specific, and dynamically updated as new evidence emerges [^197b6966] [^fdb21050].

---

The cornerstone of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) management is **early detection with serial spirometry** [^197b6966] and **prompt initiation of azithromycin** [^aab4c066] [^59f921c3], which can stabilize or improve lung function in a subset of patients. Immunosuppression should be optimized by switching from cyclosporine to tacrolimus [^d5dec293] and considering mycophenolate mofetil [^964c1973]; long-term, high-dose corticosteroids are not recommended [^b894a8e6] [^f51271c1]. Supportive care includes smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, vaccination, and treatment of comorbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux [^b00596a9] [^7ddf8166]. For refractory cases, consider extracorporeal photopheresis [^fdb21050] or lung transplantation [^713f2486] [^c4895897]. Evidence quality varies, so management should be individualized and coordinated by a multidisciplinary team [^197b6966].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective management. The diagnostic approach includes:

- **Pulmonary function testing (PFT)**: Serial spirometry is the primary tool for detecting BOS, with a persistent decline in FEV1 ≥ 20% from baseline indicating BOS [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) may show air trapping, bronchiectasis, or mosaic attenuation, supporting the diagnosis [^notfound].

- **Exclusion of other causes**: Active infection, acute rejection, and other pulmonary complications must be excluded through clinical evaluation, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and, when necessary, lung biopsy [^c5c8421f].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Azithromycin

Azithromycin is the **first-line therapy** for BOS, with evidence of benefit in lung transplant recipients [^197b6966] [^59f921c3]. Guidelines recommend a trial of azithromycin (250 mg three times weekly) for at least 3 months [^aab4c066] [^fe46b52a]. Long-term azithromycin may slow BOS progression and improve survival [^59f921c3] [^cd715287].

---

### Immunosuppression optimization

Optimizing immunosuppression is critical. Switching from cyclosporine to tacrolimus is recommended for patients developing BOS on cyclosporine-based regimens [^d5dec293] [^46e0a1c6]. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) may be considered as an alternative immunosuppressant, particularly when switching from azathioprine [^964c1973].

---

### Corticosteroids

Long-term, high-dose corticosteroids are **not recommended** for BOS management due to limited efficacy and significant adverse effects [^b894a8e6] [^f51271c1].

---

## Supportive care and lifestyle modifications

Supportive care is essential to improve quality of life and reduce complications:

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended for all patients with BOS [^notfound].

- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Regular exercise and pulmonary rehabilitation programs improve exercise capacity and quality of life.

- **Vaccination**: Annual influenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination are recommended to prevent respiratory infections [^notfound].

- **Nutritional support**: Adequate nutrition and weight maintenance are important for overall health and lung function.

---

## Management of comorbidities

Comorbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and infections should be actively managed. GERD should be treated with proton pump inhibitors and lifestyle modifications; in selected cases, surgical fundoplication may be considered [^b00596a9] [^7ddf8166]. Infections must be promptly diagnosed and treated, with bronchoscopy and BAL performed to exclude infection in suspected cases [^c5c8421f] [^4bfeabbc].

---

## Advanced therapies

For refractory BOS, advanced therapies may be considered:

- **Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP)**: Recommended for progressive BOS refractory to standard therapies, particularly in chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) settings [^fdb21050].

- **Lung transplantation**: Retransplantation may be considered for end-stage BOS refractory to other treatments, with careful patient selection and evaluation [^713f2486] [^c4895897].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to detect progression early and adjust therapy. PFTs should be performed every 3–6 months, and patients should be monitored for signs of infection, acute rejection, and other complications [^c5c8421f] [^52e80f7d].

---

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Several emerging therapies are under investigation, including **JAK inhibitors (e.g. ruxolitinib)** [^592e9c1d], **antifibrotic agents (e.g. pirfenidone)** [^f065339b], and **biologics targeting specific inflammatory pathways** [^notfound]. Early detection strategies, biomarker development, and personalized medicine approaches are also being explored to improve outcomes [^8257c2c9] [^58470003].

### Diagnosis and treatment of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome accessible universally [^ec5cafdd]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

The incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a devastating manifestation of chronic graft-versus-host-disease, may rise globally due to steady increases in utilization of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Though some advances have occurred in the past decade regarding understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of BOS, the overall mortality and morbidity remain very high. We sought to determine the current diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, which can potentially hinder optimal management of BOS both in developed and developing countries. We performed a comprehensive systematic review of both modern diagnostic modalities and treatments and then assessed which of them would be universally accessible. The 2014 National Institutes of Health chronic GVHD criteria remains the gold standard tool for diagnosing BOS. Important elements of treatment involve early and accurate detection, as well as utilizing the treatment modalities with known (but variable efficacy) e.g. fluticasone-azithromycin-montelukast [FAM] combination, etanercept, extra-corporeal photopheresis [ECP], lung transplantation, and prompt treatment of complications including infections in sufferers of BOS. Our results indicate that optimum diagnostic tools are not readily available in some parts of the world for early detection, which include a lack of CT scanners, unavailability of pulmonary function testing tools, absence of sub-specialists, lack of certain effective treatments and late referral for lung transplant. We present a systematic review of current literature along with recommendations for available therapies to guide practitioners to optimize the long-term outcomes in HCT survivors regardless of access to experts and expensive therapies.

### Detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^e56804cc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society pediatric post-HSCT bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) detection guideline—pulmonary complications occur frequently post-HSCT, with BOS being the most common noninfectious pulmonary complication, and current international guidelines contain conflicting recommendations regarding post-HSCT surveillance for BOS; as such, this guideline provides an evidence-based approach to detection of post-HSCT BOS in children. A multinational, multidisciplinary panel of experts identified six questions regarding surveillance for, and evaluation of, post-HSCT BOS in children, a systematic review of the literature was undertaken to answer each question, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to rate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. In developing recommendations, the panel members considered the strength of each recommendation and evaluated the benefits and risks of applying the intervention, and considered patient and caregiver values, the cost of care, and feasibility. Recommendations addressing the role of screening pulmonary function testing and diagnostic tests in children with suspected post-HSCT BOS were made, and following a Delphi process, new diagnostic criteria for pediatric post-HSCT BOS were also proposed. This document provides an evidence-based approach to the detection of post-HSCT BOS in children while also highlighting considerations for the implementation of each recommendation, and further, the document describes important areas for future research.

### Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (...) [^2646f46e]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Prednisone, with its potent anti-inflammatory property, continues to be recommend as first-line treatment for patients with symptomatic and progressive disease. Patients with asymptomatic mass lesions or nonprogressive disease can be observed and treated at a later time if needed. The dosage is generally 1 mg/kg for 1 to 3 months, then 40 mg/d for 3 months, then 10 to 20 mg/d or every other day for a total of 1 year. Every-other-day scheduling can be successfully used for this disorder. A shorter 6-month course may be sufficient in certain situations. Total and permanent recovery is seen in most patients and is somewhat dependent on the cause or associated systemic disorders. Anecdotally, erythromycin, inhaled triamcinolone, and cyclophosphamide have been used to treat BOOP. 19-21 Epidemiological studies of these agents have not yet been performed for confirmation of efficacy.

Generally for these patients, there is initial improvement of the infectious pneumonia with use of appropriate antimicrobial agents, but after a few days, it becomes apparent that the symptoms and radiographic findings persist. The pneumonia process has now become organized into the BOOP lesion. Corticosteroid treatment at this point is almost always successful. Too few reports have been published to determine whether BOOP in these patients is an incidental finding or represents a complication of bone marrow transplantation. Renal transplantation BOOP has been described64 in 1 patient 12 weeks after transplantation. A rapid recovery occurred after an increase of the daily dose of methylprednisolone. There can be a dramatic improvement with corticosteroid therapy, but relapses may occur. 66, 67 Some investigators66, 68 have suggested that radiotherapy may "prime" the development of BOOP.

Bronchoalveolar lavage studies of these patients indicate an increase in lymphocytes, mast cells, CD3 cells, and CD8 cells and a decrease in CD4 cells and the CD4-CD8 ratio68; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The busy clinician will see patients with a febrile illness and patchy infiltrates who have not responded to antibiotic drug therapy. The patient might have BOOP. Sometimes this disorder is treated in the hospital, but it is generally managed on an ambulatory basis. Typical idiopathic BOOP is characterized by a flulike illness, bilateral crackles, and patchy infiltrates and can be cured in 65% to 80% of patients with prednisone therapy.

### How I treat bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^d144a136]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

In past years, a diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) conferred nearly universal mortality secondary to lack of consensus for diagnostic criteria, poorly understood disease pathogenesis, and very few studies of therapeutic or supportive care interventions. Recently, however, progress has been made in these areas: revised consensus diagnostic guidelines are now available, supportive care has improved, there is greater understanding of potential mechanisms of disease, and prospective trials are being conducted. This article describes these advances and provides suggestions to optimize therapy for patients with BOS after HCT.

### Detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^c42e7bf1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline—pediatric post–hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) conclusion states that BOS is the most common noninfectious pulmonary complication post-HSCT and can have devastating impact on children and families including prolonged hospital admissions, reduced quality of life, need for supplemental oxygen, and death. The guideline, developed by an international and multidisciplinary committee, will aid HSCT and pulmonology teams in the surveillance and diagnosis of BOS in the post-HSCT pediatric population, but this guideline has not addressed optimal treatment and support for children with BOS and additional pulmonary complications, with scope limited by the GRADE methodology to a focus limited to six key questions. Future work should aim to define BOS incidence using the surveillance strategy outlined, and improve BOS surveillance focusing on multicenter studies to develop strategies for earlier detection and a personalized approach to screening. Editor’s note indicates that Recommendation 1 is potentially suitable for performance measure development.

### Detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^90364179]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Many children undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for the treatment of malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Unfortunately, pulmonary complications occur frequently post-HSCT, with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) being the most common noninfectious pulmonary complication. Current international guidelines contain conflicting recommendations regarding post-HSCT surveillance for BOS, and a recent NIH workshop highlighted the need for a standardized approach to post-HSCT monitoring. As such, this guideline provides an evidence-based approach to detection of post-HSCT BOS in children. Methods: A multinational, multidisciplinary panel of experts identified six questions regarding surveillance for, and evaluation of, post-HSCT BOS in children. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to answer each question. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to rate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. Results: The panel members considered the strength of each recommendation and evaluated the benefits and risks of applying the intervention. In formulating the recommendations, the panel considered patient and caregiver values, the cost of care, and feasibility. Recommendations addressing the role of screening pulmonary function testing and diagnostic tests in children with suspected post-HSCT BOS were made. Following a Delphi process, new diagnostic criteria for pediatric post-HSCT BOS were also proposed. Conclusions: This document provides an evidence-based approach to the detection of post-HSCT BOS in children while also highlighting considerations for the implementation of each recommendation. Further, the document describes important areas for future research.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for lung transplantation, more specifically with respect to management of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (tacrolimus), ATS/ERS/ISHLT 2014 guidelines recommend to consider switching from cyclosporine to tacrolimus in lung transplant recipients developing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome while receiving chronic immunosuppression with a cyclosporine-containing regimen.

### Lung transplantation. bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [^e2af6f4b]. Chest Surgery Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

BOS remains a difficult problem to control following lung transplantation, largely because of uncertainties regarding the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for it. Continued work on the pathogenesis of BOS is essential. The progressive nature and poor outlook when BOS stage 3 is reached indicates that current strategies should be focused on prevention and early intervention. There is a great need for randomized, controlled trials on intervention if the international transplant community is to make progress in this area.

### A review of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and therapeutic strategies [^38b83d3c]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

For lung transplant recipients, BOS remains to be the primary cause of mortality after the first year. In the current lung allocation score era of lung transplantation, recipients have significantly fewer BOS-free days after 3-year follow-up. Further research is needed to better define the pathophysiologic mechanisms in BOS in order to either prevent or delay onset of the disorder. The therapies available for BOS currently are very limited and serve only to slow the decline in pulmonary function. Lung retransplantation continues to be controversial, but survival rates have improved in patients with BOS over the past decade and thus should be considered as a treatment option in this patient population.

### Long-term effect of azithromycin in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [^59f921c3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Key messages

Placebo-controlled trials in patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) are scarce, and long-term outcomes of such trials are generally lacking in lung transplantation.

Long-term treatment with azithromycin slows down the progression of BOS; BOS progression and long-term survival are not affected by randomisation to the placebo group.

This post hoc analysis strengthens the evidence of long-term azithromycin treatment in BOS and shows the validity and ethical appropriateness of conducting placebo-controlled trials in this difficult area.

Over the past 15 years, lung transplantation has become an established treatment for a variety of end-stage lung diseases, but medium- and long-term success has been limited by a high incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Immune mediated injury has been recognized as the leading cause of BOS, and the term is synonymous with chronic rejection. But recently, nonimmune mechanisms, such as gastroesophageal reflux, have been recognized as potential culprits. The results of various treatment options have generally been disappointing, and BOS has emerged as the leading cause of late morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation.

### Targeting allograft injury and inflammation in the management of post-lung transplant bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [^ade1a89c]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic allograft dysfunction, manifesting as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in human lung transplant recipients. While alloimmunity has a definite role, there is increasing interest in overall allograft injury and subsequent inflammation and remodeling. This review deals with nonalloimmune factors that may potentiate alloimmune injury. We discuss infection and reflux/aspiration as examples of allograft injury, which may lead to chronic loss of graft function and BOS. Surgical and nonsurgical treatments aimed at preventing these insults and improving survival are considered. The need for further evidence, including randomized-controlled trials, to evaluate the role of medical and surgical therapies is emphasized by the current literature.

### Pirfenidone for the treatment of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome related to chronic graft-versus-host disease [^a9c91020]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a highly morbid, progressive form of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) that occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), affecting ∼5% to 15% of patients,and with a 2-year and 5-year survival rate of 60% and 40%, respectively. BOS is characterized by peribronchiolar inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition, and fibrosis resulting in bronchial narrowing.Subsequent irreversible airway obstruction leads to dyspnea, poor quality of life, and often death.

Currently, the primary treatment for BOS involves inhaled corticosteroids, azithromycin, and montelukast. This regimen has not been shown to alter disease progression, and carries a conditional recommendation with very low certainty of evidence by European Respiratory Society and European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation guidelines. Systemic steroids are also used, with clinical responses estimated to occur in only 50% of patients, and sustained high-dose usage has diminishing returns in improving lung function while increasing risk of infection and other complications.Potent immunosuppressive agents provide viable alternatives, but their use is complicated by high infection rates, which can increase morbidity and nonrelapse mortality.These treatment limitations highlight the imperative to identify novel treatments for BOS.

### Bronchiolitis obliterans: an update [^6a77a416]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) occurs in both post-lung transplant and nontransplant-related individuals, and is characterized by mainly irreversible airflow obstruction that is often ultimately progressive.

Recent Findings

While post-lung transplant BO is a major cause of lung allograft dysfunction, and hence is better characterized than nontransplant-related BO, it is likely that many similarities in pathogenesis and treatment apply to both categories.

Summary

Optimal management for BO remains to be established, and the role of retransplantation in this disease requires further consensus. Minimization of risk factors for BO and earlier detection in the form of methacholine challenge testing and HRCT scans of the chest amongst other forms of detection, may help in the stabilization and possible resolution of early BO.

### Addressing knowledge gaps in the early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^e8ac22e6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Insights can be drawn from the understanding of OB of other origins, particularly as a manifestation of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (i.e. CLAD-BOS), the syndromic term for chronic rejection following lung transplant, which shares a histologic similarity and a context of alloimmunity with HCT-BOS (–). Yet the syndrome manifests differently for HCT recipients, so the clinical approach should reflect the evidence base for the specific medical and biologic context of HCT.

This project was inspired by patients who experience the consequences of delayed diagnosis and our incomplete knowledge. The goal of this research statement is to survey our current understanding of early BOS and to define the research agenda for the early detection of BOS. This document is not intended to provide clinical practice and treatment recommendations. We aimed to identify knowledge gaps, emphasize key scientific research questions, and propose a research road map to address these gaps.

Management Strategies in BOS

An important therapeutic strategy in treating BOS is initial prevention and aggressive treatment of known associated factors, as well as early identification of BOS in order to immediately begin available therapies. Initially, the clinical management of these patients should focus on risk reduction of primary graft dysfunction by decreasing mechanical ventilation time for donors and reducing allograft ischemia time, while also limiting cardiopulmonary bypass and blood product transfusions during transplantation.

Routine screening to define the onset of BOS is very important as there appears to be a therapeutic window for some of the treatment options available. Jain et al demonstrated that azithromycin treatment initiated before the development of BOS stage 2 was independently associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death. Thus, clinicians should be closely monitoring lung transplant recipients, carefully monitoring for early chronic rejection. Spirometry should be performed routinely on lung transplant recipients, looking for any changes in the FEV 1 and FEF 25-75% measurements based on the ISHLT classification system (Table 1). The use of HRCT imaging with inspiratory and expiratory views of the chest to assess for airtrapping may be helpful based on initial studies, but further research is less conclusive regarding its value [-]. Currently, radiographic imaging remains supportive in the diagnostic evaluation and management of BOS. Figure 2 demonstrates the usefulness of HRCT imaging in diagnosing BOS in a 55 year-old patient who underwent right single lung transplantation in 1992 for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency but suddenly developed a 25% reduction in FEV 1 3 years after undergoing single left lung transplantation for BOS. The right allograft clearly had significant bronchiectasis due to long-standing BOS, but the more recent allograft on the left side had signs of bronchiectasis with airtrapping, further supporting the diagnosis of BOS in that allograft.

High resolution CT scan of the chest demonstrating bilateral bronchiectasis (right more severe than left) in a patient who underwent right single lung transplantation in 1992 for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and left single lung transplantation in 2003 for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.

Aggressive treatment of GE reflux, avoidance of infection, and timely vaccinations are instrumental in managing lung transplant recipients. Experimental risk factors reported in BOS should be considered from a clinical standpoint during the evaluation of transplant recipients, including higher bronchoalveolar (BAL) neutrophilia and IL-8 levels as well as airway colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Further research is needed to better define the clinical role of these evolving factors.

Recommendation 2a—long‑term follow‑up in asymptomatic patients post‑HSCT: we suggest surveillance using spirometry and, where feasible, static lung volumes and DLco every 6 months between 2 and 3 years post‑HSCT, and yearly after 3 years, lasting until 10 years post‑HSCT (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The panel notes to begin testing at 3 months post‑HSCT and continue at tests that occur every 3 months for the first year, and as BOS can arise in the second year post‑HSCT, testing at intervals of 3 to 6 months is recommended. In patients with ongoing symptoms, more frequent (every 3–6 mo) spirometry may be necessary until stability in lung function testing has been demonstrated, and expert opinion was that any pulmonary function impairment should be persistent for at least 2 weeks before further testing should be pursued.

### The problematic 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines [^29796136]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines do not adequately serve the needs and clinical realities of front-line clinicians caring for undifferentiated wheezing infants and children. This article describes the clinical challenges of evaluating and managing a heterogeneous disease syndrome presenting as undifferentiated patients to the emergency department. Although the 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines and the multiple international guidelines that they closely mirror have made a good faith attempt to provide clinicians with the best evidence-based recommendations possible, they have all failed to address practical, front-line clinical challenges. The therapeutic nihilism of the guidelines and the dissonance between many of the recommendations and frontline realities have had wide-ranging consequences. Nevertheless, newer evidence of therapeutic options is emerging and forecasts hope for more therapeutically optimistic recommendations with the next revision of the guidelines.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of BOS is typically made by clinical, physiological, and radiographic parameters. Due to the sporadic or patchy involvement of OB, pathologic diagnosis can be missed by transbronchial biopsies (TBB), which are often performed to exclude other diagnoses including acute rejection or infection. Histologically, early lesions of BOS demonstrate submucosal lymphocytic inflammation and disruption of the epithelium of small airways, followed by an ingrowth of fibromyxoid granulation tissue into the airway lumen, resulting in partial or complete obstruction. Subsequently, granulation tissue organizes in a cicatricial pattern with resultant fibrosis and thus obliterates the airway lumen. In some instances, the only residual histologic evidence of BOS is a ring of circumferential elastin around an otherwise undetectable airway, what is termed the "vanishing airways disease".

As a result of histologic variability, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) developed standard nomenclature and made a distinction between documented OB and BOS. An ad hoc working group was established under the auspices of the ISHLT for the purpose of developing a clinically applicable system and published their original recommendations in 1993. The group concluded that the FEV 1 was the most reliable and consistent indicator of allograft dysfunction, excluding other identifiable causes with the adoption of the term BOS to describe such dysfunction, recognizing that there may or may not be pathologic evidence of OB present. The group also defined 4 stages of BOS, each with 2 subcategories to indicate whether pathologic evidence of OB had been identified.

### Detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^73d314d3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society pediatric post–HSCT bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)—We suggest surgical lung biopsy in pediatric post-HSCT patients where BOS is suspected, but uncertainty regarding the diagnosis exists and the risks of biopsy are smaller than the risks of the uncertainty (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Uncertainty regarding the diagnosis exists when: 1) clinical evidence (clinical background, CT scan, and pulmonary function testing) is discordant, 2) there is no alternate way to make the diagnosis, and 3) there is concern for an alternate/coexisting condition. Benefits include that earlier diagnosis of BO permits earlier initiation of therapy and that biopsy can also help determine alternative or coexisting diagnoses in patients in whom BO is suspected because of declining lung function; in selected situations a biopsy is the only way to make a firm diagnosis. Harms include a higher risk of complications from biopsy compared with diagnosis by means of clinical, CT, and PFT, a fourfold increased risk of death as compared with bronchoscopy with BAL, and increased morbidity and length of hospitalization postoperatively immediately after surgical lung biopsy. Most pediatric centers have access to a pediatric surgeon with expertise in surgical lung biopsy; methods discussed include open surgical biopsy, video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy, and transbronchial biopsy, but the panel strongly felt transbronchial biopsy was inappropriate, and the decision between approaches should be based on multidisciplinary input.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline—pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) surveillance and diagnosis specifies pre-HSCT assessments of spirometry, static lung volumes, and DLCO with chest CT scan (with insp/exp views), and post-HSCT surveillance with spirometry, static lung volumes, and DLCO beginning at 3 months post-HSCT, every 3 months until 12 months post-HSCT, then every 3–6 months from 13–24 months post-HSCT, then every 6 months from 24–36 months post-HSCT, then annually until 10 years post-HSCT; some children may be unable to complete pulmonary function testing (PFT), in which case they can be omitted, and multiple breath washout (MBW) can be assessed in addition to spirometry where available or as an alternate to spirometry if spirometry is not feasible (Recommendation 3B). Suspected BOS is prompted when surveillance pulmonary function shows development of obstructive lung disease which persists over at least 2 weeks or by clinical signs or symptoms of BOS; evaluation includes pulmonary function testing (can consider MBW) and a computed tomography (CT) scan, with insp and exp views, which is recommended for those with PFT results suggestive of BOS or if there are persistent clinical signs and symptoms of BOS with normal lung function (Recommendation 4b). We suggest a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to assess for infection in all cases of suspected BOS, even if the CT scan is normal (Recommendation 5); if the CT scan is normal, it is reasonable to repeat PFTs 2 weeks after the CT, and if the BAL reveals infection, this should be treated, and clinical assessment should be repeated, with ongoing symptoms or signs of lung function impairment potentially signifying BOS and the pathway followed; in cases where there is uncertainty about the BOS diagnosis or suspicion of an alternate or coexisting condition, a biopsy is suggested (Recommendation 6).

Introduction

Lung transplantation is a treatment option for patients with advanced lung disease or irreversible pulmonary failure. Despite advancements in surgical techniques, lung preservation, immunosuppression, and management of ischemia/reperfusion injury and infections, acute and chronic allograft rejection continues to be a major problem. The incidence and severity of acute rejection in lung transplantation exceeds all other solid organ transplants. Chronic rejection, more commonly called bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), is the leading cause of death beyond the first year post lung transplantation. The key clinical feature of BOS is the development of airway obstruction with a reduction of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) that does not respond to bronchodilators (Table 1). The hallmark histological findings of chronic rejection is obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), which is an inflammatory process affecting small noncartilagenous airways. Figure 1 is representative of the typical findings of OB histopathologically. The development of BOS is rare within the first year after lung transplant, but the cumulative incidence ranges from 43 to 80% within the first five years of transplantation [,-].

American Thoracic Society research statement—early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): BOS after HCT is linked to chronic respiratory impairment, increased lung infection risk, and a 50–60% 5-year survival rate, with worldwide HCT volumes and growth suggesting substantial burden. The widely used NIH definition is neither sensitive nor specific, contributing to delayed clinical recognition, and current treatment approaches, including corticosteroids, are largely ineffective in restoring lung function; in trials of targeted therapies for refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), response rate and quality of life were markedly lower for BOS than for other organ manifestations. Early recognition may mitigate morbidity and mortality, and a randomized controlled trial of new-onset BOS with inhaled budesonide/formoterol plus recent single-arm trials suggest milder disease can be halted or reversed.

Pulmonary–HCT collaboration—additional gaps and future directions: There is a need for greater interaction between pulmonary and transplant specialists to improve early diagnosis and provide guidance on diagnostic quandaries when disease is suspected, and collaboration among subspecialist pulmonologists, community pulmonologists, and transplant providers is critical because most HCT survivors return to the community for longitudinal care rather than stay at the tertiary HCT center; therefore, it is imperative that clinicians—hematologists, pulmonologists, and general practitioners—possess basic knowledge about BOS and understand the rationale behind early detection; a key role of the pulmonologist is to collaborate with HCT physicians to facilitate early detection by removing barriers to obtaining pulmonary function testing (PFT) results and to disseminate the evidence base to practitioners and patients alike; we recommend that HCT centers develop teams with specific pulmonology expertise to manage patients with BOS and other LONIPCs.

### Post-transplant bronchiolitis obliterans [^3797c67d]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, improvements in surgical techniques, lung preservation, immunosuppression, and management of ischaemia/reperfusion injury and infections have made intermediate-term survival after lung transplantation an achievable goal. However, chronic allograft dysfunction in the form of bronchiolitis obliterans remains a major hurdle that threatens both the quality of life and long-term survival of the recipients. It affects up to 50-60% of patients who survive 5 yrs after surgery, and it accounts for >30% of all deaths occurring after the third postoperative year. This article discusses the alloimmune-dependent and -independent risk factors for bronchiolitis obliterans, the current understanding of the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis obliterans based on results of animal and human studies, the clinical staging of the complication, strategies that may contribute to the prevention and/or early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans, and suggestions for future research.

### Pulmonary function testing in pediatric allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients to monitor for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome: a systematic review [^702f6e54]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) is an important modality for treating hematologic malignancies as well as many non-malignant conditions in children and young adults. Pulmonary complications are relatively common after pediatric aHSCT and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Bronchiolitis obliterans, in which immune-mediated injury to the small- and medium-sized airways results in worsening irreversible obstruction with air trapping, is the primary pulmonary manifestation of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after aHSCT. As lung biopsy may be associated with morbidity in this population, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), based on clinical criteria, is used as proxy. Current diagnostic criteria for BOS are based primarily on post-transplant changes in lung function as measured by spirometry, with supporting features from chest imaging and static lung volumes. As with the form of BOS seen in lung transplant recipients with allograft rejection, BOS due to cGVHD can be associated with rapid clinical decline.

Under current National Institutes of Health consensus criteria, pulmonary function testing (PFT) is required to diagnose BOS. This is established by (1) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) < 75% predicted and an irreversible decline ≥ 10% in under two years, (2) ratio of FEV1 to vital capacity < 0.7 or below the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval, (3) absence of infection, and (4) either: (a) cGVHD in at least one organ system, or air trapping evidenced by (b) expiratory chest computed tomography, or (c) residual volume (RV) > 120% predicted or RV/total lung capacity (TLC) > 90% confidence interval.

Monitoring aHSCT recipients with serial PFT allows for objective longitudinal assessment, with the goal of identifying pre-symptomatic BOS. A greater impairment in lung function at the time of diagnosis has been associated with worse outcomes in cohort studies including mostly adult transplant recipients. Although currently available therapies for BOS are somewhat limited, evidence from adult studies suggests that early intervention could potentially arrest or slow decline in lung function with improved outcomes. While all current pediatric guidelines recommend PFT surveillance in aHSCT recipients, the recommended frequency ranges from every three months to annually in the first year post-transplant, with variability in which specific tests are recommended. Additionally, practice patterns vary across pediatric transplant centers.

Screening and diagnosis of BOS in children and adolescents—current limitations are outlined as follows: “The current approach for screening and diagnosis of BOS in children and adolescents poses several limitations.” International guidelines “differ in terms of specific PFT maneuvers and frequency of testing,” and practice shows “a recent multinational survey highlighting significant variation in care.” Care is “largely extrapolated from adult data and relies on spirometry,” yet “many young children who undergo HSCT are unable to perform spirometry because of age and other factors.” Finally, “there is a lack of guidance for clinicians on how to respond to abnormal surveillance PFT results.”

### Pirfenidone for the treatment of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome related to chronic graft-versus-host disease [^2ac737f4]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic drug currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).Its primary mechanism of action involves attenuation of transforming growth factor-β–stimulated collagen synthesis and reduction of fibroblast proliferation.Prior case reports describe the efficacy of pirfenidone in patients with lung transplant complicated by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD),and preclinical studies suggest a potential role for pirfenidone in BOS following HCT.Together, these observations prompted the conduct of a prospective study to evaluate pirfenidone as therapy for BOS. We have previously published an interim analysis of 22 patients from a single-arm, single-center, open-labeled, 12-month, phase 1 trial of pirfenidone in persons with HCT-BOS, showing that pirfenidone was tolerated and associated with pulmonary function test (PFT) improvement for 38% of participants over a 12-month period.Here we present results from all 30 participants and a 56-month extension trial to evaluate the long-term tolerability and efficacy of pirfenidone for BOS. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability of pirfenidone at the recommended dose used for treatment of IPF. Secondary study objectives included an assessment of treatment efficacy by PFTs, quantitative computed tomography (qCT) chest scan, laboratory tests, validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, and cGVHD indices.

### Is it bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or is it chronic rejection: a reappraisal? [^f4027042]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic rejection (obliterative bronchiolitis) is the single most important cause of chronic allograft dysfunction and late mortality after lung transplantation. As this condition is difficult to prove using biopsy specimens, a clinical term, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) has been in use for >10 yrs to describe the progressive decrease of pulmonary function. However, before diagnosing a patient as having BOS, based on a sustained and progressive decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second and/or forced mid-expiratory flow between 25-75% of forced vital capacity, different confounding factors have to be eliminated. Treatment of BOS mainly consists of an increase or a change in the immunosuppressive drug regimen, which may lead to more pronounced infectious complications. Recently, two new options have become available to treat patients with BOS, treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux and azithromycin. In the present paper, the authors give an overview of the current data on these two modalities, which may lead to a restoration of the pulmonary function in some of the patients, illustrating once more the fact that bronchitis obliterans syndrome is not always a manifestation of chronic rejection.

### Addressing knowledge gaps in the early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^c8545776]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a late onset noninfectious pulmonary complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) that is often diagnosed in advanced stage with severe lung impairment. Increasing utilization of HCT for the treatment of hematologic diseases worldwide translates to an increasing burden of BOS, particularly for the community pulmonologist. Early recognition of BOS, which offers the best opportunity to mitigate morbidity and mortality, is hampered by incomplete knowledge of the clinical course and disease process. The goal of this research statement is to survey our current understanding of BOS and to define the research agenda for the early detection of BOS.

Methods

We convened a multidisciplinary panel that included community representatives for an in-depth survey of the published literature followed by an online workshop.

Results

Major knowledge gaps were identified within interrelated themes of natural history and pathogenesis, risk factors, and the clinical diagnostic approach.

Conclusions

This statement reflects the detailed assessment of identified knowledge gaps with associated key research questions, as well as a proposed research roadmap to stimulate cross-disciplinary collaborations from pre-clinical to clinical investigations.

Interventional trials for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation—The impact of early detection depends on whether it is actionable with targeted therapy, and systematic evaluation should occur in the context of a well-designed and controlled clinical trial that incorporates early detection with therapy targeting lung inflammation as well as fibrosis. Study design should be guided by lung-specific early disease biomarkers and knowledge of disease evolution, and randomized trials should differentiate the effect of the drug from the natural history of the disease. Clinical endpoints depend on disease phase and phenotype; if early disease is predominantly inflammatory and therapy is directed toward inflammatory pathways (e.g., ruxolitinib), the benchmark for efficacy should be improvement or resolution of incipient lung dysfunction within a short time frame, e.g., 1 month. For upfront agents targeted toward fibrosis, the goal should be stabilization of lung function decline in the short term and improvement in lung function trajectory in the long term, as suggested by a recent trial with pirfenidone. To date, only a handful of clinical trials specifically for HCT-BOS have been completed and all tested agents developed or approved for other indications, and rationally designed clinical trials based on updated knowledge of the natural history of HCT-BOS should be considered a research priority for the near future.

Pharmacotherapy (2022). High credibility.

Lung transplant—MMF versus azathioprine shows similar bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) outcomes in an RCT but advantages for MMF in several rejection metrics and in BOS management when switching from azathioprine. A randomized multicenter trial found 73% vs. 75% free from BOS at 3 years (p = 0.70) and a trend toward improved 1‑year survival with MMF (88% vs. 80%, p = 0.07) without a 3‑year survival difference (75% vs. 69%); more patients discontinued azathioprine (59.6% vs. 45.6%, p = 0.02). A small non-randomized cohort reported fewer acute rejection episodes with MMF (0.26 ± 0.34 vs. 0.72 ± 0.43 episodes/100 patient-days, p < 0.01), and a single-center experience observed fewer steroid-resistant episodes (0.5 ± 1.0 vs. 1.5 ± 1.9, p < 0.001), lower recurrent rejection (14% vs. 42%, p < 0.001), and less grade 3 rejection (0.93% vs. 10.4%, p = 0.01), with a trend toward better 5‑year survival (79% vs. 64%, p = 0.062). In BOS, switching from azathioprine to MMF 3 gm/day (duration: 1 week to 24 months, mean 11.4 months) led to stabilization of pulmonary function tests in a majority of patients.

Bronchoscopy and lung infection assessment in suspected BOS: given the high prevalence of occult lung infections, fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis to rule out infection is recommended as part of the diagnostic workup; the NIH BOS diagnosis is contingent on the absence of active lung infection, but fixed airflow obstruction can persist despite antiinfective therapy, suggesting that infections are concurrent with and likely promote disease progression; the impact of emerging metagenomic assays remains to be seen, and knowledge about BAL composition in HCT recipients is extremely limited and cannot be assumed to mirror healthy individuals.

### Pulmonary function testing in pediatric allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients to monitor for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome: a systematic review [^45ecd467]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) represents a significant source of morbidity and non-relapse mortality among children and young adults treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). Pulmonary function testing (PFT) pre- and post-aHSCT may allow for pre-symptomatic detection of BOS, and thus early intervention. Current guidelines and practices vary regarding which tests to perform and timing relative to transplant. A systematic review evaluating PFT before and after pediatric aHSCT was conducted to inform American Thoracic Society clinical practice guidelines on detection of BOS.

Objective

To determine the optimal approach to conducting PFT prior to and after pediatric aHSCT.

Study Design

We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify studies of PFT in human aHSCT recipients < 25 years of age to address two questions: (1) Should pre-transplant screening PFT be performed in pediatric patients who will undergo aHSCT? (2) At what frequency should pediatric patients who have had aHSCT undergo PFT? We searched in Medline through August 2022 for studies that enrolled patients < 25 years of age being treated with aHSCT for whom PFT data were reported before or after transplant.

Results

The 30 studies with pre-transplant PFT data showed a wide range of findings, with the majority demonstrating abnormalities. In studies reporting respiratory symptoms, 85–100% of patients were asymptomatic. In the 21 studies reporting post-transplant PFT, 11 used a surveillance strategy where at least one test was performed in the first year post-transplant. Median time to BOS diagnosis was 6–12 months in the regular surveillance studies, and 6–24 months in the others. Forced expiratory volume in one second at the time of BOS diagnosis was 38–84% predicted in studies with regular surveillance versus 44–57% predicted in studies with no surveillance. In the surveillance group, BOS was identified in some patients who were asymptomatic. Data quality in studies reviewed was moderate to very low.

Conclusions

Abnormalities in PFT are common in children prior to aHSCT. Regular monitoring in the first 1–2 years post-aHSCT may improve early and/or pre-symptomatic identification of BOS, but significant limitations may still be seen at the time of diagnosis. Higher quality data are needed.

### Long-term effect of azithromycin in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [^cd715287]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Lung transplantation is a preferred option in selected patients with end-stage lung disease that continues to progress.Despite improvement in quality of life, long-term survival remains poor due to the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, including bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Within 5 years, approximately 50% of the lung transplant recipients developed BOS.Previous studies have shown that azithromycin can stabilise and improve lung function in lung transplantation recipients with BOS.In addition, only one placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin in lung transplant recipients was performed with a positive effect on lung function after 3 months.A post hoc analysis was performed to assess the long-term effect on the evolution of lung function, progression of BOS and survival in patients initially randomised to placebo or azithromycin.

### Pirfenidone for the treatment of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome related to chronic graft-versus-host disease [^f065339b]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a severe form of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with five-year survival of 40%. Currently, there is no curative therapy for BOS. Pre-clinical data suggest that pirfenidone, an anti-fibrotic drug, may benefit small airway fibrosis in HCT-associated BOS. A single-arm, open-label, 56-week phase 1 trial with 56-month extension evaluated pirfenidone's tolerability, safety, and efficacy in BOS patients. Efficacy was measured using pulmonary function tests (PFT), quantitative CT (qCT) scans, patient reported outcomes (PRO), cGVHD indices, and laboratory tests. Lung function trajectory was assessed by change in regression slopes before and during treatment. Baseline qCT metrics, including percentage normal lung, air trapping, volume change (Jacobian), and heterogeneity of volume change (Jacobian variance) were analyzed by participant response. Among 30 participants, 25 completed the 56-week trial, and 10 continued into the extension. Overall, 63% tolerated the recommended dose without safety concerns. There was significant improvement in the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P=0.00267) when analyzing all participants and improvement in individual PFT trend for 41.3% of participants. Quantitative CT analysis by lobe showed healthier lungs in the upper lobes of responders. Significant improvements were noted in liver function tests, PRO related to physical functioning and shortness of breath, and cGVHD skin indices. These findings indicate that pirfenidone is safe and tolerable in BOS patients post-HCT and may improve lung function and symptoms. Further trials are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone as a treatment for BOS after HCT. (NCT03315741).

### A phase 2 multicenter trial of ruxolitinib to treat bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after allogeneic HCT [^592e9c1d]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) occurring after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a high-risk manifestation of chronic graft-versus-host disease. In this prospective, multicenter phase 2 trial, adult participants with BOS were treated with ruxolitinib 10 mg twice daily, continuously in 28-day cycles for up to 12 cycles. Participants enrolled into newly diagnosed (<6 months since BOS diagnosis, cohort A) or established (≥6 months since BOS diagnosis, cohort B) disease cohorts. The primary objective was to evaluate the early treatment effect of ruxolitinib, assessed by the change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at 3 months compared with enrollment. The primary end point differed according to cohort (cohort A, improvement, defined as ≥10% increase in FEV1; cohort B, stabilization, defined as an absence of ≥10% decrease in FEV1). Between 2019 and 2022, 49 participants meeting the criteria for BOS were enrolled and treated (cohort A, n = 36; cohort B, n = 13). The primary end point was achieved by 27.8% of participants with new BOS and 92.3% of participants with established BOS. According to the 2014 National Institutes of Health Consensus Criteria, the best lung-specific overall response rate on ruxoltinib for the 49 participants was 34.7% (16.3% complete response and 18.4% partial response), with most responses occurring in mild or moderate disease. Noninfectious severe (grade ≥3) treatment-emergent adverse events were infrequent. Nine severe infectious events occurred and were largely respiratory in nature. These results support the use of ruxolitinib in the management of BOS after allogeneic HCT. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT03674047.

Summary and key questions

Identifying HCT recipients at high risk for BOS is challenging because of the low incidence of BOS; the positive predictive value of known clinical risk factors is inconsistent. Respiratory infections, particularly RVIs, are likely a key risk factor, but these are also common nonspecific events after HCT. Key questions include how to develop a clinically useful risk assessment for early detection (Table 1).

Clinical Approach

The current NIH BOS definition and the lack of a clear definition for early disease challenge the clinical approach to the early detection of BOS. Unlike lung transplant recipients in whom the lung is the underlying chief medical concern for their ongoing medical care, allogeneic HCT recipients must contend with more common non-lung medical issues, including cGVHD of other organs and the risk of hematologic relapse. This clinical reality poses challenges for the implementation of screening strategies and early diagnostic tools.

Screening for BOS

Unlike skin or mucosal GVHD, the advent of BOS is clinically silent. It is currently assumed that the “onset” of disease is the time of diagnosis; however, with BOS, symptom-driven PFT diagnosis captures a disease state that is already well established. Despite nearly two decades of society-endorsed screening recommendations, uptake of routine PFTs at many HCT centers remains poor, with only 30–40% of allogeneic HCT recipients undergoing routine posttransplant PFTs. These data corroborate observations among the committee members that many HCT physicians at their centers are not routinely ordering PFTs after the early posttransplant period. Although optimal screening intervals still need to be determined based on a more complete understanding of BOS natural history, implementation of screening by the transplant caregiver remains a major clinical gap because of the perception that PFTs are a burden. The recent publication of clinical guidelines for the early detection of BOS in pediatric HCT recipients reflect the evidence base behind current clinical practice, but broad implementation of these guidelines remains to be seen.

Hematopoietic cell transplant–associated bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome risk identification states that patients at high risk for HCT-BOS should be identified for more intensive monitoring or preemptive therapies and organizes risk factors temporally into pre-HCT (comorbidities present >1 mo before HCT), peri-HCT (within 1 mo before, during, and after HCT, encompassing factors related to the transplant), and post-HCT (clinical events and measurements >1 mo post-HCT); pretransplant risk includes preexisting airflow limitation or obstructive lung disease, and older recipient age is a risk factor for BOS but it is uncertain if this risk exceeds the risk of increased age for GVHD in general, while a lower pretransplant FEV1 and/or FEV1/FVC ratio (even if in the normal range) can make it more likely that diagnostic criteria for BOS are reached, essentially creating a form of verification bias (“diagnostic criteria bias”) without the necessity of a causal relationship.

Considerations for risk factor analyses—bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after hematopoietic cell transplantation: We recommend the following methodological considerations: sufficient patient numbers are necessary for adequate statistical power and to minimize variation; prospective studies require careful consideration of cohort selection; we recommend a two-stage approach: first, identify preliminary risk factors with a large prospective cohort study with broad inclusion criteria, followed by validation in focused case-control studies using independent populations; risk factors may change as the treatment landscape evolves and updated diagnostic criteria for BOS that encompass a preclinical disease definition should be employed; causal inference studies should focus on purposeful variable selection within prespecified causal models, and nondichotomous variables including continuous pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters as well as combined cross-sectional and longitudinal factors should be considered for the development of risk-assessment tools.

### Pathogenesis, management, and consequences of primary graft dysfunction [^104c86fd]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Primary graft dysfunction continues to be a major contributing factor to morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation. This condition is presumed to be the result of ischemia-reperfusion injury, which is associated with the release of endogenous substances that can activate the innate immune system. Primary graft dysfunction has been shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome indicating that it can shape alloimmune responses. In this review, we focus on the classification, pathogenesis, possible prevention strategies, management and consequences of primary graft dysfunction.

### Chronic lung allograft rejection: mechanisms and therapy [^a939c58b]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation is a therapeutic option for patients with end-stage pulmonary disorders. Unfortunately, due to post-lung transplant complications, both infectious and noninfectious, it is only a treatment and not a cure. Importantly, despite induction combined with triple or quadruple maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, chronic lung rejection, in the form of obliterative bronchiolitis or its clinical correlate bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), continues to be highly prevalent and is the major limitation to long-term survival. In this review we evaluate the presentation, diagnosis, histopathology, pathologic mechanisms, risk factors, and prevention/treatment options for BOS. A better understanding of the risk factors and how it relates to the pathologic mechanisms of chronic lung allograft rejection should lead to better pharmacologic targets to prevent/treat this syndrome without increasing the recipient's risk for infections.

### Advances in understanding bronchiolitis obliterans after lung transplantation [^57b463f1]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) remains a major complication after lung transplantation, causing significant morbidity and mortality in a majority of recipients. BOS is believed to be the clinical correlate of chronic allograft dysfunction, and is defined as an obstructive pulmonary function defect in the absence of other identifiable causes, mostly not amenable to treatment. Recently, it has become clear that BOS is not the only form of chronic allograft dysfunction and that other clinical phenotypes exist; however, we focus exclusively on BOS. Radiologic findings typically demonstrate air trapping, mosaic attenuation, and hyperinflation. Pathologic examination reveals obliterative bronchiolitis lesions and a pure obliteration of the small airways (< 2 mm), with a relatively normal surrounding parenchyma. In this review, we highlight recent advances in diagnosis, pathologic examination, and risk factors, such as microbes, viruses, and antibodies. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unknown, we review the role of the airway epithelium and inflammation and the various experimental animal models. We also clarify the clinical and therapeutic implications of these findings. Although significant progress has been made, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms and adequate therapy for posttransplantation BOS remain unknown, highlighting the need for further research to improve long-term posttransplantation BOS-free and overall survival.

Conclusions for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation—Significant knowledge gaps exist for BOS after allogeneic HCT, which impede early detection. Increasing awareness of BOS is necessary because more HCT survivors return to community care. A multipronged research approach is proposed to address these gaps, and collaboration of a critical mass of pulmonologists, hematologists, and investigators from allied disciplines is necessary to conduct this research and to improve outcomes.

### Risk factors for bronchiolitis obliterans: a systematic review of recent publications [^f4ebc522]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Obliterative bronchiolitis remains the major limitation to long-term survival after lung transplantation. A thorough understanding of the factors that confer high risk of developing obliterative bronchiolitis or its physiologic surrogate bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is important to help define therapeutic strategies.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of studies published since the beginning of 1990. The review excluded non-human studies, publications before 1990, small (less than 25 patients) studies that were predominantly concerned with investigating the pathogenesis of obliterative bronchiolitis, studies solely concerned with diagnosis or treatment of obliterative bronchiolitis, and overlapping studies from the same center. Onset of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or obliterative bronchiolitis was the outcome of interest.

Results

Acute rejection plays an important role in obliterative bronchiolitis and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome onset, and late rejection is a significant risk factor. Lymphocytic bronchitis/bronchiolitis is also a risk factor, with some evidence that late onset is associated with greater risk. The effects of cytomegalovirus, other infectious organisms, and human leukocyte antigen matching are less clear and require further confirmation. There is little evidence that recipient and donor characteristics play a major role.

Conclusions

This systematic review supports the view that obliterative bronchiolitis arises from alloimmunologic injury marked by clinically apparent acute rejection episodes and that inflammatory conditions, including viral infections or ischemic injury, may also play a role. Implications for therapy are discussed.

American Thoracic Society research statement—diagnostic criteria for early bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: We recommend the following high-priority clinical and translational investigations arising from these cohorts and to revise the NIH diagnostic criteria to reflect the longitudinal nature of subacute lung function decline. Instead of a fixed threshold, an evidence-based spirometric change metric and other physiologic parameters should be emphasized, and criteria should also take into account change metrics for individuals who have preexisting lung disease, such as COPD or asthma. Revision of the physiologic definitions would encourage the implementation of routine interval PFTs as a necessary screening measure and provide data to clarify the utility of specific spirometric parameters including the FEV1/FVC ratio and associated changes in lung volume parameters such as residual volume/TLC ratio. An evidence-based refinement of BOS diagnostic criteria will harmonize definitions, improve diagnostic sensitivity for early detection, and define early disease endpoints for prospective studies and clinical trials, and criteria should be validated by nonoverlapping datasets and updated as needed with improvements in diagnostic and prognostic markers.

### Diagnosis of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in children: time for a rethink? [^ea2a6daa]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is undertaken in children with the aim of curing a range of malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Unfortunately, pulmonary complications, especially bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), are significant sources of morbidity and mortality post-HSCT. Currently, criteria developed by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) working group are used to diagnose BOS in children post-HSCT. Unfortunately, during the development of a recent American Thoracic Society (ATS) Clinical Practice Guideline on this topic, it became apparent that the NIH criteria have significant limitations in the pediatric population, leading to late diagnosis of BOS. Specific limitations include use of an outdated pulmonary function testing reference equation, a reliance on spirometry, use of a fixed forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) threshold, focus on obstructive defects defined by FEV 1 /vital capacity, and failure to acknowledge that BOS and infection can coexist. In this review, we summarize the evidence regarding the limitations of the current criteria. We also suggest potential evidence-based ideas for improving these criteria. Finally, we highlight a new proposed criteria for post-HSCT BOS in children that were developed by the authors of the recently published ATS clinical practice guideline, along with a pathway forward for improving timely diagnosis of BOS in children post-HSCT.

### Bronchiolitis obliterans after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^ee4942e9]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

With improvements in supportive care, both long-term survival following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCTs) and the indications for this procedure have increased. As a result, the number of patients living with long-term toxic effects due to HSCT has increased. A once rare condition of the donor immune cells attacking healthy host tissues, termed chronic graft-vs-host disease, has become a more common phenomenon. When chronic graft-vs-host disease affects the lung tissue, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ensues. Recent data suggest that bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome may affect up to 6% of HSCT recipients and dramatically alters survival, with overall survival of only 13% at 5 years. These statistics have not improved since the first presentation of this disease over 20 years ago. Challenges to the progress of medical management of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome include difficulties and delays in diagnosis and a paucity of data on pathogenesis to direct new therapies. This article critically evaluates the current diagnostic criteria for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and available treatments. Improvements in survival will likely require early disease recognition, allowing for therapeutic modulation of disease prior to the development of irreversible airway obliteration.

### Addressing knowledge gaps in the early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^52e80f7d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Recently updated general posttransplant care recommendations include PFT screening every 3 months for the first year after HCT, every 6 months for the second year, and then annually for 5 years after HCT. The 2020 NIH cGVHD consensus project recommended that, for patients with cGVHD, the cadence of screening should be every 3 months with spirometry for ≥1 year after diagnosis and annually with a full PFT (which includes spirometry, lung volumes, and D CO), along with spirometry or PFTs every 3–6 months until systemic immunosuppressive therapy has been weaned. Short-interval repeat testing, e.g. 2–4 weeks, is recommended for a decline in the FEV 1 of ≥10% from the patient’s baseline or Day 100 assessment. Recent pediatric guidelines also reinforce these screening recommendations. Additional high-risk categories, such as cases of recent RVI, have been suggested for more frequent interval testing, but high risk is loosely defined, and those with preexisting airflow obstruction, Day 100 FEV 1 impairment, or recent lower tract respiratory infection have not been formally incorporated into screening recommendations.

At present, conventional PFTs remain the primary screening modality for HCT-BOS. Portable or handheld spirometers offer the possibility of frequent interval lung function monitoring at home without the burden of going to a PFT laboratory. Remote monitoring by a care team is now possible with Bluetooth-enabled spirometers that synchronize to a patient’s smartphone or tablet device and transmit measurements to a cloud-based portal. Although home spirometry is routine for monitoring of acute rejection in lung transplant recipients, allogeneic HCT recipients often have significant nonpulmonary medical concerns that may limit adherence. Two prospective studies to test the feasibility of wireless home spirometry in HCT recipients at thrice-weekly to weekly intervals demonstrated reasonable adherence (>70% of required measurements). In a highly selected population with cGVHD, weekly home spirometry was able to detect FEV 1 decline antecedent to the clinical diagnosis in some cases of BOS. Clinical implementation of remote spirometric monitoring will require attention to adherence, determination of an actionable FEV 1 change threshold, and an associated care and communications plan.

### Infection-mediated asthma: etiology, mechanisms and treatment options, with focus on Chlamydia pneumoniae and macrolides [^774192c3]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1 
Proposed design for a randomized trial of azithromycin for the long-term management of asthma. Seven of nine PRECIS-2 domains are recommended as pragmatic and two as explanatory

a PRECIS-2 grades on a scale from 1 (extremely explanatory) to 5 (extremely pragmatic). Column 2 presents recommendations for which end of the spectrum is emphasized

Pragmatic trials primarily ask Does this treatment work? Explanatory trials primarily ask What is the mechanism? Addressing target groups/mechanisms in pragmatic trials of macrolides is desirable and possible as secondary aims by specifying a priori hypotheses coupled with subgroup analyses. We recommend studying a wide array of biomarkers using this approach. It is notable that RCTs of macrolides have been performed and/or macrolides are being recommended in the treatment of many chronic lung conditions (diffuse pan-bronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, COPD, post-transplant bronchiolitis obliterans). A planned trial will test the effectiveness of azithromycin in patients with the “overlap syndrome” (asthma-COPD). It is time to add asthma to the growing list of chronic respiratory conditions that are being evaluated by robust macrolide RCTs that are pragmatic in nature.

In the meantime, patients with severely uncontrolled and/or refractory asthma, or new-onset asthma are increasingly searching the Internet for new information and are sometimes better informed than their doctor about current evidence regarding macrolides for asthma (Hahn: personal observations). Pending more robust data from asthma RCTs that have yet to be performed, how should practicing clinicians respond when such patients request macrolide treatment? As stated above, the ERS/ATS guidelines on severe asthma recommend against the use of macrolides, albeit with caveats that the evidence for this recommendation is weak and provisional. Informal guidelines from a pulmonology research group state that they recommend macrolide treatment only for confirmed diagnoses of atypical lung infection. From a practical standpoint, their recommendation limits treatment only to those who have undergone bronchoscopy; even then the diagnostic sensitivity is likely to be less than perfect due to sampling issues discussed earlier. Both these recommendations have met resistance from patients who have read and understood the evidence (Hahn: personal communication). We offer a third alternative recommendation, repeated word for word from the conclusion of the sole practice-based pragmatic trial of azithromycin for asthma conducted to date :

### Detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^5f547049]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during BOS evaluation after pediatric HSCT: We suggest that bronchoscopy with BAL be performed to assess for infection as part of the BOS evaluation (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). If the pulmonary function testing result is unreliable because of technique, it is reasonable to repeat the test in 1–2 weeks and then only perform the bronchoscopy if the suspicion of BOS persists. When an infection has been diagnosed by means of a less invasive method (i.e., nasopharyngeal swab, sputum), it is reasonable to delay the bronchoscopy while treating the infection and/or waiting for the infection to resolve and then only perform the bronchoscopy if the clinical suspicion of BOS persists.
