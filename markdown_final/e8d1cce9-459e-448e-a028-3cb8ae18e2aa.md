## Question

Pain after circumcision for 5 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about post-circumcision pain management in a 5-year-old child, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the child's developmental context and how to assess pain reliably. Then, I should verify the expected pain trajectory after pediatric circumcision. Next, I will review intraoperative regional anesthesia choices and their comparative evidence. After that, I need to construct a multimodal postoperative plan emphasizing nonopioid-first care and safe opioid stewardship. I should also consider device-specific issues like the ShangRing, nonpharmacologic adjuncts, and red flags that warrant escalation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, day-by-day algorithm and confirm safety considerations and follow-up needs, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pain assessment strategy for a 5-year-old. At this age, self-report is valid; the Color Analog Scale is validated for children 5 years and older, and FLACC remains useful when self-report is not feasible or to complement it, so I should plan to use both as appropriate and reassess frequently during the first 24–48 hours when pain peaks [^111JZrGn] [^1118Vtj9]. Wait, let me verify the trajectory data in children: a prospective audit shows postoperative pain peaks on the day of or day after surgery and typically resolves within 0–2 days for most minor urologic procedures, including circumcision, which supports anticipating a short-lived acute pain course with early mobilization and return to activities once comfortable [^1118Vtj9].

> Next, I should review intraoperative regional anesthesia choices and their evidence base. Dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) is a cornerstone; randomized data in prepubertal children show ultrasound guidance did not reduce postoperative opioid requirements versus landmark technique, though it improved early pain scores and delayed first analgesic request, so either approach is reasonable if performed competently [^112q9SmK] [^117JvMkQ]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives: pudendal block has shown lower postoperative pain scores and less analgesic consumption than DPNB in 3–5 year olds, suggesting a potential advantage when expertise is available, though this is a small RCT and should be contextualized with local skill and safety considerations [^1135FDKF]. I need to ensure I mention caudal anesthesia; Cochrane reviews indicate caudal can reduce rescue analgesia versus parenteral opioids but shows no clear advantage over penile block and carries a higher risk of transient leg weakness, so in ambulatory children who will walk soon after surgery, penile techniques are often preferred to avoid motor delays [^113ypjnT] [^111AQq66].

> I will now examine the pharmacologic properties that influence block selection and duration. Bupivacaine provides longer analgesia than lidocaine for neonatal DPNB, and this longer duration likely translates to less early postoperative pain and fewer acetaminophen doses in the first 24 hours; levobupivacaine 0.5% at 0.1 mL/kg per side is a commonly used pediatric DPNB dose in contemporary RCTs, balancing efficacy and safety when administered correctly [^111maokS] [^112TMG32] [^112q9SmK]. Wait, I should double-check that I am not overstating equivalence across ages; these PK data are strongest in neonates, but the mechanistic rationale for longer blockade with bupivacaine is sound and consistent with pediatric regional anesthesia practice patterns, so it remains reasonable to favor longer-acting agents when feasible in older children as well [^111maokS].

> Now, I need to build a multimodal postoperative plan anchored in nonopioid-first care. Scheduled acetaminophen and ibuprofen, dosed by weight and given on a fixed interval for the first 24–48 hours, provide the backbone; prospective pediatric urology data demonstrate high parental satisfaction with this approach and low average pain scores, supporting scheduled rather than purely PRN use early on [^115vDRGC]. Hold on, I should verify opioid stewardship guidance; the AAP recommends acetaminophen and NSAIDs as primary therapy and reserves opioids for moderate-to-severe pain unresponsive to nonopioids, with immediate-release formulations, lowest effective doses, and supplies limited to about 3–5 days for minor procedures, which aligns with observational data showing most children use very few opioid doses after circumcision [^115ho8Va] [^111jTeEM] [^116nASMG]. I need to ensure I exclude codeine and tramadol in children under 12 years due to safety concerns, and I should provide naloxone and disposal counseling if any opioid is dispensed [^111Kufwo].

> Let me consider device-specific issues, because technique can modulate pain. The ShangRing is associated with parent-reported "reduced pain" in early infant circumcision programs, but ring removal can be painful; in a large RCT, about 0.4% required premature ring removal for pain, underscoring the need for anticipatory analgesia around device removal and careful counseling on timing and expectations [^111rXQmx] [^112DpEgj]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ring devices universally reduce postoperative pain compared with conventional methods; I should be cautious and note that most comparative pain data are from infant cohorts and may not directly generalize to older children, so shared decision-making and local experience with the specific device matter here [^112DpEgj].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic adjuncts that can meaningfully reduce pain and distress. Distraction, parent presence, and age-appropriate coping strategies are foundational; in younger children, sucrose and non-nutritive sucking reduce behavioral pain responses, and while the Cochrane data are centered on infants, the principle of multimodal comfort measures remains applicable in early childhood as developmentally appropriate [^114KApzZ]. Let me verify emerging options: a randomized trial in 5–10 year olds suggests foot reflexology reduced postoperative pain and fear after circumcision, which may be a low-risk adjunct in select settings, though replication and standardization are needed before routine adoption [^116vnSGT]. I should confirm that these are adjuncts layered onto, not replacements for, pharmacologic analgesia in a 5-year-old [^115ho8Va].

> I need to ensure I address red flags and escalation triggers. Severe pain, escalating swelling or erythema, bleeding that soaks dressings, fever, inability to void, or skin discoloration warrant urgent reassessment for complications such as hematoma, infection, wound dehiscence, or rare ischemic events; prompt contact with the surgical team is indicated, and in the interim, acetaminophen-ibuprofen rotation can continue if no contraindications exist while arranging evaluation [^1168MB1q]. Hold on, I should verify that regional block complications, though uncommon, can present with ischemia; case reports describe glans ischemia after circumcision with DPNB, reinforcing the need for meticulous technique and vigilance for vascular compromise when regional blocks are used [^1125jtEA].

> Let me synthesize a practical, day-by-day algorithm and double-check alignment with evidence. Day 0–1: scheduled acetaminophen every 6 hours alternating with ibuprofen every 6 hours, strict activity restriction to avoid tension on the wound, ice packs as tolerated for swelling, and FLACC or CAS assessments every 4–6 hours; if pain remains moderate-to-severe despite scheduled nonopioids, a short course of immediate-release opioid (e.g., oxycodone) at the lowest weight-appropriate dose can be added with clear stop criteria and disposal plans, consistent with AAP guidance and observational data showing minimal opioid needs after circumcision [^115ho8Va] [^116nASMG]. Day 2–3: transition to PRN acetaminophen and ibuprofen as pain improves, typically allowing brief outdoor activities when comfortable; most children experience meaningful pain reduction by day 2, aligning with the 0–2 day median pain duration for minor urologic procedures in pediatric audits [^1118Vtj9]. Day 4–7: most children require only occasional acetaminophen, with return to school generally feasible by day 5–7 if pain is controlled and clothing is comfortable; I should confirm that families have clear return precautions and follow-up arranged within a week [^notfound].

> But wait, what if regional anesthesia was not provided intraoperatively or is wearing off early? I should confirm whether a penile block can be offered in the recovery unit or early postoperative period if pain is significant and local expertise is available; while blocks are typically placed pre-incision, rescue regional anesthesia can be considered in select cases to reduce systemic opioid exposure, balancing procedural risk and benefit in discussion with anesthesia colleagues [^notfound]. I need to ensure documentation of any rescue interventions and reassessment of motor function if neuraxial techniques are used, given the risk of leg weakness in ambulatory children [^111AQq66].

> Finally, I should confirm safety pearls and follow-up. NSAIDs are appropriate here; concerns about bleeding with ketorolac do not appear to translate into clinically significant increases after pediatric circumcision in a large retrospective cohort, though I will still individualize risk and monitor for hematoma, especially if there is a known bleeding diathesis or concurrent medications that increase risk [^113Bx4xG]. I should double-check that families receive written dosing schedules, storage and disposal instructions for any opioids, and explicit return precautions; prospective data show high parental satisfaction with standardized nonopioid regimens and highlight the importance of education to prevent both under- and over-treatment at home [^115vDRGC].

Pain after circumcision in a 5-year-old is **common and expected** [^1118Vtj9], typically peaking in the first 24–48 hours and resolving within 3–5 days. Effective management requires a **multimodal approach** [^115ho8Va] — scheduled acetaminophen and ibuprofen, local anesthetics, and nonpharmacologic measures (distraction, cold packs, loose clothing) [^115ho8Va]. Severe or persistent pain beyond 5 days, increasing swelling, redness, discharge, fever, or difficulty urinating should prompt **urgent evaluation** for complications such as infection, hematoma, or wound dehiscence [^1168MB1q]. Most children recover well with appropriate analgesia and care, and parental education on pain control and warning signs is essential [^115vDRGC].

---

## Normal pain trajectory after circumcision

Pain after circumcision in a 5-year-old typically follows a predictable pattern:

- **Immediate postoperative period (0–24 hours)**: Pain is usually most intense during the first 24 hours, often peaking within the first 6–12 hours after the procedure [^notfound].

- **Early postoperative period (24–72 hours)**: Pain gradually decreases over the next 2–3 days, with most children experiencing significant improvement by the third day.

- **Late postoperative period (3–5 days)**: By day 3–5, most children report minimal or no pain, although mild discomfort may persist, particularly during activities such as urination or wearing tight clothing.

---

## Factors influencing pain severity and duration

Several factors can influence the **severity and duration** of pain after circumcision in children:

| **Factor** | **Influence on pain** |
|-|-|
| Surgical technique | - Sleeve technique associated with lower postoperative pain scores compared to dorsal slit technique [^1127TJCJ] |
| Anesthesia method | - Regional anesthesia (dorsal penile nerve block, pudendal nerve block) significantly reduces postoperative pain compared to topical anesthesia alone [^1179hCrF] [^111Zfb1r] |
| Individual pain tolerance | - Variability in pain perception and coping mechanisms among children [^1131HAmh] |
| Presence of complications | - Infection, hematoma, or wound dehiscence can significantly increase pain severity and duration [^113BryN3] |

## Recommended pain management strategies

Effective pain management in children after circumcision requires a **multimodal approach** combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions:

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Acetaminophen (paracetamol)**: 15 mg/kg every 6 hours as needed [^1127BmBt] [^115vDRGC].

- **Ibuprofen**: 10 mg/kg every 8 hours as needed, if not contraindicated [^1127BmBt].

- **Local anesthesia**: Regional anesthesia techniques such as dorsal penile nerve block or pudendal nerve block are highly effective in reducing postoperative pain [^11639qTw] [^1135FDKF].

- **Opioids**: Reserved for severe pain unresponsive to non-opioid medications. Commonly prescribed opioids include oxycodone or hydrocodone-acetaminophen combination. However, opioids are generally not recommended as first-line therapy due to potential side effects and risks of dependence [^115ho8Va] [^111jTeEM].

---

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **distraction techniques** — such as engaging the child in play, watching videos, or listening to music — to reduce pain perception [^112rzoDE]. Cold packs or ice packs applied to the surgical area reduce swelling and provide analgesia. Loose-fitting underwear and clothing minimize friction and irritation at the surgical site. Foot reflexology has also been shown to significantly reduce postoperative pain and fear in children following circumcision [^116vnSGT].

---

## Potential complications associated with persistent pain

Persistent pain after circumcision in a 5-year-old may indicate underlying complications, including:

- **Infection**: Localized redness, swelling, discharge, or fever may indicate infection, requiring antibiotic treatment [^notfound].

- **Hematoma**: Collection of blood under the skin, causing swelling and discomfort, may require surgical intervention if severe [^1179hCrF].

- **Wound dehiscence**: Separation of the wound edges, causing delayed healing and increased pain [^notfound].

- **Penile adhesions**: Formation of skin bridges between the glans and shaft, causing discomfort and requiring further treatment [^116o8tzY].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Parents should seek **immediate medical attention** if their child experiences any of the following:

- Severe or persistent pain beyond 5 days postoperatively.

- Increasing swelling, redness, or discharge from the surgical site.

- Fever or signs of systemic infection.

- Difficulty urinating or blood in the urine.

- Wound dehiscence or visible separation of wound edges.

---

## Long-term outcomes and psychological effects

Most children experience complete resolution of pain within 1–2 weeks after circumcision. Long-term psychological effects are **generally minimal**, especially when pain is adequately managed during the postoperative period. However, inadequate pain control may lead to anxiety, fear of medical procedures, and behavioral changes. Therefore, effective pain management and parental support are crucial for optimal recovery and psychological well-being [^11711V5u].

---

Pain after circumcision in a 5-year-old is common but typically resolves within a few days. Effective pain management involves a **multimodal approach**, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Persistent or severe pain may indicate complications and should prompt medical evaluation.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports the current position of the American Academy of Pediatrics that finds the existing evidence insufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision. Given this circumstance, parents should be given accurate and impartial information to help them make an informed decision. There is ample evidence that newborns circumcised without analgesia experience pain and stress. If circumcision is performed, analgesia should be provided.

### A prospective audit of pain profiles following general and urological surgery in children [^1118Vtj9]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative pain is frequently undertreated in children both in hospital and at home following discharge. Pain has both short- and long-term consequences for children, their families, and the healthcare system. A greater understanding of procedure-specific postoperative pain trajectories is required to improve pain management.

Aim

To determine the duration and severity of acute postoperative pain experienced by children undergoing 8 different general and urological procedures (primary outcomes). Behavioral disturbance rates, nausea and vomiting scores, and parental satisfaction were also examined during the follow-up period (secondary outcomes).

Method

Families of children (0–18 years) undergoing common general and urological procedures were invited to enroll in the study. Children's pain scores, measured using a parental proxy 0–10 numerical rating scale, were collected by telephone interview until pain was resolved. Analgesia prescribed and given, behavioral disturbance, nausea and vomiting scores, the method of medication education communication, and parental satisfaction were also measured.

Results

Of 360 patients recruited, 326 complete datasets were available. Patients underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy (57), open appendicectomy (19), circumcision (50), cystoscopy (52), hypospadias repair (22), inguinal hernia repair (51), orchidopexy (51), or umbilical hernia repair (24). Postoperative pain peaked on the day of or the day after surgery in all groups, and decreased over time. Pain lasted a median duration of 5 postoperative days following open appendicectomy, and 0–2 postoperative days for other procedures. Behavioral disturbance rates closely followed pain scores. Analgesia administration at home varied widely between and within groups.

Conclusion

Pain management was inadequate in most of the groups studied, particularly after appendicectomy or umbilical hernia repair, with most children experiencing at least moderate pain on the day of and day after surgery. There was a need for a standardized management, with increased dual analgesia prescribing, to ensure that children receive adequate postoperative analgesia in hospital and at home.

### A' snip' in time: what is the best age to circumcise? [^1112Xmqb]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Pain

Since not all men are willing to be circumcised, even when their infection risk from not doing so may be high, there are clearly barriers to an affirmative decision, particularly in high HIV prevalence settings where MC is being rolled-out to reduce infections.

In a review of 13 acceptability studies of heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa, concern about possible pain was "the major barrier" to agreeing to be circumcised. As well as pain, the long healing period, meaning no sex, and MC not being part of the local culture, were other impediments to getting a circumcision. In Pune, India 71% of men expressed this concern. Amongst MSM, fear of pain was a barrier for 62% of men in the United States and was 47% for Chinese men. An acceptability study among African-American parents found that despite high (88%) perception of pain in their child, 73% strongly believed that MC was necessary.

In practice, the pain associated with medical MC is far less than men anticipate, and many are not aware that local anesthesia is recommended. In the large RCTs, severe pain was reported in only 0.8% of 1,568 participants in the South African trial, 0.3% of 2,326 HIV-negative men and 0.2% of 420 HIV positive men in the Ugandan trial, and in the Kenyan trial, of 1,334 men, "very mild" pain was reported in 52% at postoperative day 3 and 11% at day 8, with none of the men reporting pain more severe than "very mild". In a small trial of the "Shang Ring" device used to circumcise 40 men, pain scores (graded from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain) averaged 3.5 during erections. Since erections would place the most tension on the wound during healing, erections likely contribute maximally to pain scores.

The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Postoperative pain guideline — peripheral regional anesthetic techniques: Use as part of multimodal analgesia for surgical procedures for which there is evidence of benefit (examples: thoracotomy, lower or upper extremity surgery, hemorrhoid surgery, circumcision); clinicians should be familiar with specific regional anesthetic techniques and use continuous over single injection techniques when longer duration of analgesia is required, with cautions including potential for falls.

### Caudal epidural block versus other methods of postoperative pain relief for circumcision in boys [^113ypjnT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Circumcision is a commonly performed surgical procedure in boys and caudal analgesia is frequently used to minimize discomfort of penile surgery postoperatively. For humanitarian and physiological reasons pain should be anticipated and effectively controlled while ensuring patient safety. Several non-caudal analgesic techniques can be used including: penile block, systemic opioids and topical local anaesthetic cream, emulsion or gel.

Objectives

To compare the relative efficacy and side effects of caudal epidural analgesia with other forms of postoperative analgesia following circumcision in boys.

Search Strategy

CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1966), and EMBASE are searched using MeSH headings: Circumcision, Anesthesia-Caudal, Pediatric or Child, and the text words circumcision and caudal. Bibliographies of published trials and conference proceedings are also reviewed. Date of last search: December 2002.

Selection Criteria

Published randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials in which postoperative analgesia by caudal epidural block is compared with a non-caudal method of analgesia, in boys whose mean age is between 28 days and 16 years, having elective surgery for circumcision.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials identified from searching are assessed for inclusion and data extracted independently by two reviewers. Review Manager software is used for calculation of the treatment effect, represented by relative risks (RR), using a fixed effects model with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).

Main Results

Seven trials of average quality involving 374 patients are included in this review. Only two comparisons of caudal analgesia have been investigated; parenteral analgesics in six trials, and penile block in one trial. Although some trial heterogeneity is evident this does not reach statistical significance. The need for rescue analgesia is reduced when caudal analgesia is compared with parenteral medications,((RR 0.32(0.16,0.63)). The incidence of nausea and vomiting is decreased in caudal patients compared with those receiving parenteral analgesics (RR 0.57 (0.35–0.93)) but not with those receiving penile block.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Few studies compare caudal analgesia with other commonly available methods of analgesia in boys having circumcision surgery. Although the need for rescue analgesia is reduced in the early postoperative period when caudal is compared with parenteral analgesia, evidence from trials may no longer reflect current practice and is limited by small numbers and poor methodology. There is a need for properly designed trials to study the relative efficacy of caudal epidural with other methods such as penile block, morphine, simple analgesics and topical local anaesthetic cream, emulsions or gel.

### A report of 918 cases of circumcision with the shang ring: comparison between children and adults [^111uvdqF]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcome and surgical complications in circumcision using the Shang Ring between children and adults.

Methods

Circumcision using the Shang Ring was performed on 702 adults and 216 children. Comparative analysis on indices including operative time, healing time, postoperative edema, postoperative bleeding, postoperative pain, and postoperative infection was conducted.

Results

When the ring was removed after surgery, the pain was tolerable in the adult group, but more substantial in the child group. The optimal time for removing the ring was 2 weeks after surgery.

Conclusion

Special attention to the pain management is needed when using the Shang Ring to treat redundant foreskin or phimosis in children. The timing of the ring removal is critical to avoiding complications. Surgeons' knowledge in urology is also critical to the clinical outcome.

### A' snip' in time: what is the best age to circumcise? [^1153U2gj]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Table 2
Approximate figures for benefits of circumcision in infancy versus circumcision later

See main text for references to each condition

While the medical evidence supports infancy as being the optimum time to circumcise, it is recognized that instituting infant circumcision might present a challenge to individuals in cultures in which circumcision is an important part of coming-of-age ceremonies or that are traditionally opposed to circumcision, particularly in countries in which circumcision is a mark of religious affiliation (e.g. Hindu versus Muslim).

Is infancy the best time surgically?

Evidence clearly shows that circumcision in infancy carries fewer risks of complications than circumcisions performed in childhood or later in life. In infancy, surgical complications for large published series range from 0.2% to 0.6%. Higher rates of 2–10% have been reported in much older and smaller studies. A recent systematic review found a median complication frequency of 1.5% among studies of neonatal or infant circumcision, compared to 6% among studies of children aged one year or older. Almost all of such complications are minor and can be easily - and completely - treated. In both infants and older children, severe complications (as compared to mild complications) were rare, with a median frequency close to zero.

While excluded from systematic review, the frequency of complications among adult MC patients was noted to be higher than the frequency of complications from MC in children older than 1 year. In the large RCTs of adult MC, complications were seen in 1.7–3.8%; these were virtually all mild or moderate and were effectively treated (Table 3).

Secondary outcomes

Rate of anesthesia success (MOAA/S ≤ 1 within 120 s from the start of induction, rescue allowed).
Intraoperative movement rate.
Hemodynamic changes (MAP/HR at key timepoints).
Highest PAED score in PACU. The PAED scale will be assessed by trained PACU nurses who have undergone standardized training with inter-rater reliability testing (kappa > 0.8). Assessment timepoints: arrival to PACU (0 min), then at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 min, and at discharge. If the child shows signs of agitation (PAED ≥ 12) at 30 min, assessments will continue every 10 min until resolution or discharge. The highest score observed d Management of Emergence Delirium: If PAED score ≥ 12 is observed, the following stepwise approach will be implemented: First-line: Reassurance and parental presence (if institutional policy permits); Second-line: If agitation persists > 5 min, administer low-dose propofol 0.5–1 mg/kg IV; Third-line: If severe agitation threatens patient safety, consider rescue midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV (max 2 mg); Continuous monitoring until PAED score < 12 for at least 10 min.
FLACC score upon awakening (defined as MOAA/S = 5) and then every 10 min while in PACU until discharge. Assessment continues until the score is consistently < 4 or PACU discharge criteria are met. Intervention for pain (e.g. rescue analgesia) will be guided by FLACC score ≥ 4. Pain Management Protocol: For FLACC score ≥ 4: First-line: Assess adequacy of penile block; if > 30 min since block, administer rescue analgesia with acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO/PR (max 1000 mg); Second-line: If pain persists after 20 min, administer ibuprofen 10 mg/kg PO (max 400 mg); Third-line: For severe pain (FLACC ≥ 7), consider low-dose fentanyl 0.5 µg/kg IV (max 25 µg); Document all interventions and reassess every 10 min until FLACC < 4.

### What is the medical evidence on non-therapeutic child circumcision? [^1127JL2G]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Non-therapeutic circumcision refers to the surgical removal of part or all of the foreskin, in healthy males, where there is no medical condition requiring surgery. The arguments for and against this practice in children have been debated for many years, with conflicting and conflicted evidence presented on both sides. Here, we explore the evidence behind the claimed benefits and risks from a medical and health-related perspective. We examine the number of circumcisions which would be required to achieve each purported benefit, and set that against the reported rates of short- and long-term complications. We conclude that non-therapeutic circumcision performed on otherwise healthy infants or children has little or no high-quality medical evidence to support its overall benefit. Moreover, it is associated with rare but avoidable harm and even occasional deaths. From the perspective of the individual boy, there is no medical justification for performing a circumcision prior to an age that he can assess the known risks and potential benefits, and choose to give or withhold informed consent himself. We feel that the evidence presented in this review is essential information for all parents and practitioners considering non-therapeutic circumcisions on otherwise healthy infants and children.

### Office-based procedures in children [^11711V5u]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Office-based pediatric procedures are integral to pediatric surgical care, allowing for efficient and safe management of various conditions outside the operating room and hospital. Procedures such as circumcision, frenotomy, biopsy, abscess drainage, central line removal, feeding tube exchange, toenail removal, and rectal irrigation and dilation can be safely performed in a clinic setting. Tailoring pain management, anxiolysis, and the procedural approach to each patient is crucial, considering factors such as age, anatomic considerations, and the involvement of caregivers. This article provides guidelines and recommendations for performing various minor procedures, targeting care for newborns through adolescents in the outpatient environment.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^111jTeEM]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — opioid prescribing for acute pain in children and adolescents in outpatient settings — recommends that clinicians treat acute pain using a multimodal approach that includes the appropriate use of nonpharmacologic therapies, nonopioid medications, and, when needed, opioid medications. Opioids should not be prescribed as monotherapy for children or adolescents who have acute pain. When using opioids for acute pain management, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioid formulations, start with the lowest age- and weight-appropriate doses, and provide an initial supply of 5 or fewer days, unless the pain is related to trauma or surgery with expected duration of pain longer than 5 days. Clinicians should not prescribe codeine or tramadol for patients younger than 12 years; adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, or severe lung disease; to treat postsurgical pain after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy in patients younger than 18 years; or for any breastfeeding patient.

### Pain relief for neonatal circumcision [^115UjR5L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Circumcision is a painful procedure that many newborn males undergo in the first few days after birth. Interventions are available to reduce pain at circumcision; however, many newborns are circumcised without pain management.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions for reducing pain at neonatal circumcision.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 - April 2004), EMBASE (1988–2004 week 19), CINAHL (1982 - May week 1 2004), Dissertation Abstracts (1986 - May 2004), Proceedings of the World Congress on Pain (1993–1999), and reference lists of articles. Language restrictions were not imposed.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing pain interventions with placebo or no treatment or comparing two active pain interventions in male term or preterm infants undergoing circumcision.

Two independent reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. Ten authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects information was obtained from the trial reports. For meta-analysis, data on a continuous scale were reported as weighted mean difference (WMD) or, when the units were not compatible, as standardized mean difference.

Main Results

Thirty-five trials involving 1,984 newborns were included. Thirty-three trials enrolled healthy, full term neonates, and two enrolled infants born preterm. Fourteen trials involving 592 newborns compared dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with placebo or no treatment. Compared to placebo/no treatment, DPNB demonstrated significantly lower heart rate [WMD -35 bpm, 95% CI -41 to -30], decreased time crying [WMD -54%, 95% CI -64 to -44], and increased oxygen saturation [WMD 3.2%, 95% CI 2.7 to 3.7]. Six trials involving 190 newborns compared eutectic mixture of analgesics (EMLA) with placebo. EMLA demonstrated significantly lower facial action scores [WMD -46.5, 95% CI -80.4 to -12.6], decreased time crying [WMD - 15.8%, 95% CI -20.8 to -6.8] and lower heart rate [WMD -15 bpm, 95% CI -19 to -10]. DPNB, compared with EMLA in four trials involving 164 newborns, demonstrated significantly lower heart rate [WMD -17 bpm, 95% CI -23 to -11] and pain scores. When compared with sucrose in two trials involving 126 newborns, DPNB demonstrated less time crying [MD -166 s, 95% CI -211 to -121], and lower heart rate [WMD -27 bpm, 95% CI -33 to -20]. Results obtained for trials comparing oral sucrose and oral analgesics to placebo, and trials of environmental modification were either inconsistent or were not significantly different. Adverse effects included gagging, choking, and emesis in placebo/untreated groups. Minor bleeding, swelling and hematoma were reported with DPNB. Erythema and mild skin pallor were observed with the use of EMLA. Methaemoglobin levels were evaluated in two trials of EMLA, and results were within normal limits.

Reviewers' Conclusions

DPNB was the most frequently studied intervention and was the most effective for circumcision pain. Compared to placebo, EMLA was also effective, but was not as effective as DPNB. Both interventions appear to be safe for use in newborns. None of the studied interventions completely eliminated the pain response to circumcision.

### Detrimental to public health: Royal Australasian College of Physicians' recent policy on infant circumcision [^116eckGf]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The RACP policy mentions that the AAP found " health benefits of infant male circumcision outweigh the risks ". The CDC policy (not cited by the RACP) went further by stating that benefits exceed risks by " 100:1 ". The RACP also ignored the " Evidence-based circumcision policy for Australia ", a systematic review by the Circumcision Academy of Australia, which, unlike the RACP's policy statement posted on the internet, was published in a peer-reviewed journal, and listed on PubMed in May 2022. This contained a risk-benefit analysis for Australia that found " benefits exceeded procedural risks, which are predominantly minor, by approximately 200 to 1 ", and that " more than 1 in 2 uncircumcised males will experience an adverse foreskin-related medical condition over their lifetime ". Another study found that " An increase in early MC in Australia to mid-1950s prevalence of 85% from the current level of 18.75% would avoid 77,000 cases of infections and other adverse medical conditions over the lifetime for each annual birth cohort ".

The RACP policy states that " Topical local anaesthesia is also not suitable for management of pain with circumcision ". But it failed to note that adequate time must be allowed. The AAP recommended application of topical anesthesia " 60 to 80 min before the procedure ", by which time pain levels are minimal. Although " infant [general] anaesthesia is high risk ", the RACP's statement to " delay until after 12 months " would result in a 20-fold higher incidence of procedural complications. In contrast, neonatal IMC is simple, quick, low cost, low risk, bleeding is minimal, sutures are not needed, healing is fast, and is convenient as the infant sleeps mostly, so does not disrupt feeding or other activities. Cosmetic outcome is generally good, there is no long-term memory of the procedure, and local anesthesia can be used because unlike a more mobile older infant there is little movement. Delay also exposes the infant to a 10-fold higher risk of urinary tract infections (UTI) in early infancy (see below).

### A' snip' in time: what is the best age to circumcise? [^113t6ubF]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

- The momentum amongst major international and American health and medical organizations towards encouraging circumcision, especially in infancy.

Circumcision in infancy avoids any embarrassment of having it done later, as well as anxieties about pain, complications and adverse sexual effects, even though these are minimal or not supported by evidence. It also avoids arguments about whether there might be adverse psychological consequences for MC performed later in childhood. And absence from work or school is avoided.

There are fewer barriers to MC in infancy. The infant is less mobile, so facilitating the use of local anesthesia, the procedure is simpler, healing is quicker, the cosmetic outcome is superior, and cost-effectiveness is high, as is acceptability. The neonatal period should therefore be regarded as the optimal time to perform circumcision. It is viewed as a vital component of public health strategies aimed at realizing high levels of MC in the population. The procedure should be performed by a trained professional using appropriate local anesthesia in a clean environment. Circumcision outside of such a setting is ill-advised, so explaining why clinical MC is increasingly being made available in European countries to Muslim families.

We recommend that evidence-based policies be developed regarding the availability of infant MC in all countries worldwide. It has been suggested that policies surrounding neonatal MC should be integrated into existing health systems as part of postnatal care, with adolescent and adult MC constituting "catch-up" campaigns that would be phased out over time. This should not detract from the immediate urgent need for safe voluntary adult medical MC services in high-HIV-prevalence regions in particular.

### A' snip' in time: what is the best age to circumcise? [^111jJqPc]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Circumcision is a common procedure, but regional and societal attitudes differ on whether there is a need for a male to be circumcised and, if so, at what age. This is an important issue for many parents, but also pediatricians, other doctors, policy makers, public health authorities, medical bodies, and males themselves.

Discussion

We show here that infancy is an optimal time for clinical circumcision because an infant's low mobility facilitates the use of local anesthesia, sutures are not required, healing is quick, cosmetic outcome is usually excellent, costs are minimal, and complications are uncommon. The benefits of infant circumcision include prevention of urinary tract infections (a cause of renal scarring), reduction in risk of inflammatory foreskin conditions such as balanoposthitis, foreskin injuries, phimosis and paraphimosis. When the boy later becomes sexually active he has substantial protection against risk of HIV and other viral sexually transmitted infections such as genital herpes and oncogenic human papillomavirus, as well as penile cancer. The risk of cervical cancer in his female partner(s) is also reduced. Circumcision in adolescence or adulthood may evoke a fear of pain, penile damage or reduced sexual pleasure, even though unfounded. Time off work or school will be needed, cost is much greater, as are risks of complications, healing is slower, and stitches or tissue glue must be used.

Summary

Infant circumcision is safe, simple, convenient and cost-effective. The available evidence strongly supports infancy as the optimal time for circumcision.

### Male circumcision [^116rBuPh]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Male circumcision consists of the surgical removal of some, or all, of the foreskin (or prepuce) from the penis. It is one of the most common procedures in the world. In the United States, the procedure is commonly performed during the newborn period. In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a multidisciplinary workgroup of AAP members and other stakeholders to evaluate the evidence regarding male circumcision and update the AAP's 1999 recommendations in this area. The Task Force included AAP representatives from specialty areas as well as members of the AAP Board of Directors and liaisons representing the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Task Force members identified selected topics relevant to male circumcision and conducted a critical review of peer-reviewed literature by using the American Heart Association's template for evidence evaluation. Evaluation of current evidence indicates that the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks; furthermore, the benefits of newborn male circumcision justify access to this procedure for families who choose it. Specific benefits from male circumcision were identified for the prevention of urinary tract infections, acquisition of HIV, transmission of some sexually transmitted infections, and penile cancer. Male circumcision does not appear to adversely affect penile sexual function/sensitivity or sexual satisfaction. It is imperative that those providing circumcision are adequately trained and that both sterile techniques and effective pain management are used. Significant acute complications are rare. In general, untrained providers who perform circumcisions have more complications than well-trained providers who perform the procedure, regardless of whether the former are physicians, nurses, or traditional religious providers. Parents are entitled to factually correct, nonbiased information about circumcision and should receive this information from clinicians before conception or early in pregnancy, which is when parents typically make circumcision decisions. Parents should determine what is in the best interest of their child. Physicians who counsel families about this decision should provide assistance by explaining the potential benefits and risks and ensuring that parents understand that circumcision is an elective procedure. The Task Force strongly recommends the creation, revision, and enhancement of educational materials to assist parents of male infants with the care of circumcised and uncircumcised penises. The Task Force also strongly recommends the development of educational materials for providers to enhance practitioners' competency in discussing circumcision's benefits and risks with parents. The Task Force made the following recommendations:Evaluation of current evidence indicates that the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks, and the benefits of newborn male circumcision justify access to this procedure for those families who choose it. Parents are entitled to factually correct, nonbiased information about circumcision that should be provided before conception and early in pregnancy, when parents are most likely to be weighing the option of circumcision of a male child. Physicians counseling families about elective male circumcision should assist parents by explaining, in a nonbiased manner, the potential benefits and risks and by ensuring that they understand the elective nature of the procedure. Parents should weigh the health benefits and risks in light of their own religious, cultural, and personal preferences, as the medical benefits alone may not outweigh these other considerations for individual families. Parents of newborn boys should be instructed in the care of the penis, regardless of whether the newborn has been circumcised or not. Elective circumcision should be performed only if the infant's condition is stable and healthy. Male circumcision should be performed by trained and competent practitioners, by using sterile techniques and effective pain management. Analgesia is safe and effective in reducing the procedural pain associated with newborn circumcision; thus, adequate analgesia should be provided whenever newborn circumcision is performed. Nonpharmacologic techniques (eg, positioning, sucrose pacifiers) alone are insufficient to prevent procedural and postprocedural pain and are not recommended as the sole method of analgesia. They should be used only as analgesic adjuncts to improve infant comfort during circumcision. If used, topical creams may cause a higher incidence of skin irritation in low birth weight infants, compared with infants of normal weight; penile nerve block techniques should therefore be chosen for this group of newborns. Key professional organizations (AAP, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American College of Nurse Midwives, and other midlevel clinicians such as nurse practitioners) should work collaboratively to:Develop standards of trainee proficiency in the performance of anesthetic and procedure techniques, including suturing; Teach the procedure and analgesic techniques during postgraduate training programs; Develop educational materials for clinicians to enhance their own competency in discussing the benefits and risks of circumcision with parents; Offer educational materials to assist parents of male infants with the care of both circumcised and uncircumcised penises. The preventive and public health benefits associated with newborn male circumcision warrant third-party reimbursement of the procedure. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has endorsed this technical report.

### How painful is adult circumcision? A prospective, observational cohort study [^113BryN3]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Men are particularly concerned about pain after circumcision. Concerns about pain can be a reason to refuse surgery. We assessed the severity of postoperative pain and investigated factors that may influence postoperative pain.

Materials and Methods

We performed a prospective, observational cohort study in patients undergoing circumcision. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire using a visual analog scale for pain (severity range 0 to 10) on days 1 to 3, 7 and 21, and record the analgesia used, complications and time off work. Other data recorded were patient age, clinical indication for surgery, foreskin retractility, presence of adhesions and histology.

Results

Of 211 questionnaires 112 were returned (53.1%). Mean patient age was 46.4 years. The most common clinical indication for circumcision was phimosis (75% of patients). Postoperative pain was scored as mild to moderate, including a mean of 2.4 on days 1 to 3, 2.1 on day 7 and 0.5 on day 21. Patients younger than 35 years (p = 0.025) and patients with wound infection (p = 0.036) had higher pain scores. Only 11 patients (9.8%) had severe pain at any time during recovery, including 8 with wound problems. Average ± SD time off work in the employed population was 6.6 ± 6.5 days, including 5 days for light work and 11 days for heavy physical activity.

Conclusions

Pain is mild to moderate after circumcision in adults under general anesthesia with an intraoperative penile block. Severe pain is rare and mostly related to complications. Younger patients generally have more discomfort.

### Physicians prescribe more opioid than needed to treat pain in children after outpatient urological procedures: an observational cohort study [^116nASMG]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The epidemic of nonmedical use of prescription opioids (NMUPOs) has been fueled in part by the availability of leftover, legitimately prescribed opioids. In children, outpatient urological procedures are among the most common surgeries performed, but data are lacking to guide appropriate postoperative opioid prescribing. The aim of this study was to compare the amount of prescribed opioid medication to the amount taken for acute pain after minor pediatric urological surgery and to determine the disposition of excess opioid. In addition, we explored whether distinct patient characteristics and procedure type influenced opioid prescribing and consumption.

Methods

Of the 139 families of pediatric patients enrolled, 115 were interviewed within 48 hours and/or 10–14 days of discharge to determine the amount of opioid prescribed and consumed, duration of treatment, and disposition of unconsumed opioid.

Results

The most common procedures performed were circumcision (n = 58) and orchiopexy (n = 40). Most patients (98%) were male, and 77% were < 8 years of age. All opioid prescriptions were for oxycodone dosed every 4 hours as needed (PRN). Median number of doses prescribed was 30 (interquartile range [IQR], 23–31; n = 138) for both respondents who reported doses remaining (IQR, 29–31; n = 83) and those who did not (IQR, 22–32; n = 55). Among those reporting doses remaining, median number of doses consumed was 4.2 (IQR, 0–14). Multivariable linear regression showed no significant association between doses consumed and patient age, type of procedure, discharge pain score, or use of adjuvant analgesics. Median duration of opioid therapy was 2 days (IQR, 0–5; n = 83) with each additional day of opioid use corresponding to an average increase in consumption of 2.3 doses (95% confidence interval, 1.8–2.8). An estimated 75% (95% CI, 69%-81%) of opioid dispensed was not consumed, and 86% (72/83) of patients took ≤ 18 doses. Forty-four of 65 (68%) families reported receiving no disposal instructions for leftover opioid, and only 7 families disposed of leftover medication.

Conclusions

For minor pediatric urological surgeries in young boys, a 3-day supply (18 doses) of opioid was sufficient to adequately treat acute postoperative pain in most patients. Adjusting opioid dispensing to align with consumption and better educating patients and families on opioid disposal can be used to potentially decrease availability of leftover opioids in homes and communities.

### ShangRing versus mogen clamp for early infant male circumcision in Eastern sub-saharan Africa: a multicentre, non-inferiority, adaptive, randomised controlled trial [^112DpEgj]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

The mean time to complete healing was 18.0 days (SD 6.4) in the ShangRing group and 16.9 days (5.9) in the Mogen clamp group (difference 1.1 days [95% CI 0.4 to 1.8]; p = 0.0009), favouring EIMC by Mogen clamp. By day 35, complete healing was observed in almost all infants (figure 3). In the ShangRing group, the ring need to be removed prematurely in four (0.6%) infants: for pain in three (0.4%) and swelling in one (0.1%).

Figure 3
Kaplan-Meier curve of the cumulative probability of complete healing by intervention group

A total of 1327 (96.3%; 95% CI 95.2% to 97.2%) parents and legally authorised representatives completed a satisfaction interview; 665 (96.5%) parents or legally authorised representatives of infants who underwent EIMC by ShangRing and 662 (96.1%) parents or legally authorised representatives of infants who underwent EIMC by Mogen clamp (difference 0.4% [95% CI –1.6% to 2.5%]). When parents and legally authorised representatives were asked what they liked about the procedure, top responses included less pain than expected, improved hygiene, cosmetic appearance, and short procedure time (table 4). When asked what they disliked about the procedure, most (1172 [88.3%] overall [95% CI 86.5% to 90.0%]) reported nothing. A minority of caregivers expressed concerns with pain, wound care, cosmesis, and healing times (table 4). When queried about the final appearance of the healed circumcised penis, 659 (99.0%) parents and legally authorised representatives of infants in the ShangRing group and 659 (99.5%) parents and legally authorised representatives of infants in the Mogen clamp group were satisfied (difference –0.4% [–1.4% to 0.5%]). Regardless of the circumcision method, 1319 (99.4%; 95% CI 99.2% to 99.8%) of 1327 parents and legally authorised representatives in total (659 [99.1%] of 665 in the ShangRing group and 660 [99.7%] of 662 in the Mogen clamp group) expressed that they would recommend EIMC to another parent or legally authorised representative.

### Reply to morris et al. re:' the medical evidence on non-therapeutic circumcision of infants and boys-setting the record straight' [^115KmPvs]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Concerning procedural and post-operative pain from infant circumcision, Morris et al. point to a claim by the CDC which has little evidence to back it up, as highlighted in our review. In the Freeman et al. paper that Morris et al. take exception to, 70.7% of parents reported at least some degree of pain when asked to rate 'how much pain your child suffered from the circumcision', which is clearly far different from the '93.3%' painless circumcision rate quoted in the CDC report.

As outlined in our review, the effect of circumcision on sexual function is difficult to quantify, but our balanced assessment of the evidence concluded that for this exact reason, the decision to circumcise should be left solely with the individual whose foreskin is being considered for removal. Some statements within this section of the debate can be taken as fact however, namely that any sensation felt within the foreskin itself is inherently removed following circumcision. Further to this, as it has been shown that the foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis to light touch and mild warmth sensation for non-circumcised men, it is hard to understand how it could not be involved in sexual function and experience, and thus a delayed decision for this reason seems both logical as well as ethical.

Finally, Morris et al. produce a table which attempts to compare the merits of neonatal circumcision with circumcision of 'older boys and men'. The inclusion of older boys in this comparison fails to reflect one of the key conclusions of our review, and also omits the very reasonable option of not getting circumcised whatsoever. Whether something is 'simple' or 'convenient', whether the 'cost is lower', and whether it is without 'anxiety' or 'embarrassment', leads to the obvious question of 'for whom?'. These considerations fail to hold the best interests of the child in mind, and do not seem adequate enough justification when explaining to an adult why this irreversible surgical procedure was performed on them as a child without their consent or consultation.

### Bupivacaine versus lidocaine analgesia for neonatal circumcision [^111maokS]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The mechanism of the reduced requirement of acetaminophen after bupivacaine injection is not clear. High protein binding, better lipid solubility and high pKa all contribute to the longer duration of analgesia, reported mean elimination half-life of 8.1 hours versus 3.2 hours of lidocaine. It is possible that, in addition, the longer period of blocked nociception is sufficient to blunt the hypersensitization associated with persistent postoperative pain input. This secondary hyperalgesia is mediated in the spinal cord and contributes to postoperative pain.

Some potential limitations of our study should be mentioned. The data for this study were collected retrospectively and patient allocation was in a sequential fashion. This approach may introduce a potential bias: for example, while it is theoretically possible that the performance of the analgesia improved over time, thereby resulting in a better outcome in the bupivacaine group, the study was performed during a relatively short time frame and this drawback is not very likely. Secondly, the assessment of pain in the infants was done subjectively by the parents. Crying may have been misinterpreted by the parents as pain, but could have stemmed from other reasons, and could have been managed by some of the parents by modalities other than acetaminophen (e.g. feeding, diaper changing, rocking the infant). Since the parents in both groups were instructed in an identical manner (verbal and written instructions) to give acetaminophen if they felt that their son was in pain, this potential bias was probably not significant.

American Pain Society postoperative pain guideline — regional and neuraxial analgesia: Peripheral regional anesthetic techniques — Use as part of multimodal analgesia for surgical procedures for which there is evidence of benefit (examples: thoracotomy, lower or upper extremity surgery, hemorrhoid surgery, circumcision); clinicians should be familiar with specific regional anesthetic techniques and use continuous over single injection techniques when longer duration of analgesia is required; cautions include see Lidocaine and potential for falls. Neuraxial analgesia (epidural with local anesthetic [with or without opioids] or intrathecal opioid) — Use for major thoracic, abdominal, cesarean section, and lower extremity surgery; no clear difference between continuous infusion with epidural catheter versus single dose of intrathecal morphine; cautions include see Lidocaine and Oral opioids and motor weakness and risk of falls.

Acute pain management in children and adolescents — nonopioid first-line and role of opioids: Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) "should be the primary pharmacologic strategy" for the expected duration of healing and "can be used around the clock, if needed, when treating acute pain". Opioids "should be reserved for patients who are experiencing moderate-to-severe pain despite the use of the strategies described above", and, to minimize risk, "opioids should not be used alone for analgesia". The text notes "evidence for equal analgesia with NSAIDs alone for some injuries and procedures" and "equal or superior analgesia — with fewer opioid side effects — with combination therapies of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and opioids after more painful procedures".

### Bupivacaine versus lidocaine analgesia for neonatal circumcision [^114DDrJt]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The issue of whether or not to circumcise a male infant one week after birth (when medically permissible) is essentially nonexistent in Israel. In an atmosphere of celebration and feasting, the procedure ("brit mila") has been carried out for over 4,000 years by non-physicians ("mohelim"). A mohel uses no anesthesia when performing the circumcision. The baby is given a few drops of sacramental wine and the mohel applies tight bandaging to the wound. The past few years, however, have witnessed a small but growing trend of young couples who seek to have their newborns circumcised by doctors using some kind of anesthesia in order to obviate the baby's pain and discomfort as well as their own anxiety. This cultural change has elicited interest among Israeli doctors in seeking optimal management of their newborn patients.

Anesthesia is not routinely administered for neonatal circumcision for a variety of reasons, among them the relatively short duration of the intervention, the perceived lack of importance of the pain, and concerns of toxicity from the medications. It is now recognized that neonates are capable of both perceiving and exhibiting reproducible responses to pain, and that pain in neonates may have long-term effects (e.g. "pain memories"). The routine use of analgesia during neonatal circumcision is now considered essential by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

A topical application of eutectic mixture of the local anesthetics, lidocaine and prilocaine (EMLA, Astra Pharma Inc. Sweden) had achieved considerable popularity for its ability to diminish pain associated with circumcision. In a review of the Cochrane database, however, its use was not shown to have any special advantage over other analgesic techniques with proven efficacy, such as regional nerve block with local anesthetic medications (e.g. lidocaine injection). We had been using lidocaine for dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) in our service, and recently introduced bupivacaine because it has the important advantage of a longer duration of action compared to other local anesthetics. In order to evaluate the clinical significance of this modification, we used the requirement of post-operative analgesia as a tool to assess long-term analgesic efficacy of analgesic medications in general, as well as specifically the requirement of acetaminophen after neonatal circumcision. In the current study, we evaluated the duration of the long-term analgesic effect of bupivacaine in infants undergoing neonatal circumcision. We hypothesized that infants treated with bupivacaine will require less acetaminophen than infants treated with lidocaine.

### Dorsal penile nerve block for circumcision in pediatric patients: a prospective, observer-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial for the comparison of ultrasound-guided vs landmark technique [^112q9SmK]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Circumcision is a frequently performed procedure in day case pediatric surgery. Dorsal penile nerve block has proven its effectiveness for the management of acute postoperative pain after circumcision. We investigated if the ultrasound-guided placement of a dorsal penile nerve block could reduce opioid requirement as compared to a landmark-based technique.

Methods

Three hundred and ten prepubertal children, aged between 52 weeks postconception and 11 years, were included in this prospective, observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial and received either a landmark- or an ultrasound-guided dorsal penile nerve block, using a caudal needle and injecting 0.1 mL/kg levobupivacaine 0.5% bilaterally. A single, experienced investigator performed all blocks. The primary endpoint was the number of patients in need of piritramide postoperatively as triggered by the Objective Pain Scale. Secondary outcome parameters included the cumulative dose of postoperatively administered opioids, the requirement to administer fentanyl intraoperatively, the need for paracetamol and ibuprofen during the first 24 postoperative hours, postoperative pain scores, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, the anesthesia induction time, and the time to discharge.

Results

The proportion of patients requiring postoperative piritramide did not differ significantly between both groups (Landmark: 38% vs Ultrasound: 47%, with a difference in proportion between both conditions (95% CI): 0.09 (0.2 to 0.02); p = 0.135). In addition, the cumulative doses of postoperative piritramide and intraoperative fentanyl, the postoperative need for paracetamol or ibuprofen, pain scores, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and the time to discharge were not different either. However, the anesthesia induction time was significantly longer in the ultrasound-guided dorsal penile nerve block (median time [IQR]: Landmark: 11[9; 13] min vs Ultrasound: 13[11; 15] min, P < .001).

Conclusion

Compared with the landmark-guided, the ultrasound-guided dorsal penile nerve block did not reduce the need for postoperative analgesia after circumcision in children, but was associated with an increase in the procedural time.

### Optimal time for neonatal circumcision: an observation-based study [^114gM87x]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

A detailed observation-based study to determine the ideal age for neonatal circumcision.

Patients and Methods

A prospective study of 583 neonatal circumcisions was carried out over a 3-year period (December 2005-December 2008). First a penile ring block was performed with 1% lignocaine solution, injected with a 26G needle. Formula milk, expressed breast milk or 20% sucrose solution was given to the child ad libitum as a further soothing agent. Circumcision was performed utilizing the Gomco sutureless clamp technique. Neonatal/Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was used to score the severity of pain. NIPS ≥ 2 was taken to imply a painful procedure.

Results

Only 6.5% of neonates under 1 week of age scored NIPS ≥ 2 during the procedure, but this reached 100% by the 4th week of life. There were 2 minor complications in this cohort.

Conclusion

Despite current controversy over whether it is ethical for parents to consent to a non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision, it remains a widely practiced procedure. Therefore it is important for pediatric surgeons/urologists to perform circumcision safely with minimal trauma to the neonate. This study shows that painless circumcision is possible in almost all newborns if it is performed during the first week after birth.

Results

The mean age of all included cases was 3 years (from 6 months to 12 years). The mean age at the time of examination is differed between groups; patients in group A (55 patients) were aged 8 months (6–36), but in group B (40 children) it was 4 years (3–12).

The complaints at presentation were itching and rubbing of the genitalia, which is the main complaint, as it was reported in 35 patients (20 from group A), soreness at the circumcision site in 30 (26 group A), penile bending was the main complaint in 12 (all in group B, and most of them were older than 2 years). Penile disfigurement was reported in 23 (14 group A and 9 group B), dissatisfaction of the post MC scar was reported in 46 children (32 Group B). Detection of all these complaints in group A were statistically significant when it is compared to patients in group B, except the penile dissatisfaction as it is a quiet subjective concept.

### Pain control in neonatal male circumcision: a best evidence review [^111SzSry]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Routine male infant circumcision (RMIC) is a common procedure that inadvertently causes significant but preventable pain. In this best evidence review, we examine the available pain management options and their effectiveness for RMIC.

Material and Methods

The Medline (OVID) and Cochrane library were searched for randomized controlled trials investigating pain control for RMIC. Only trials that included newborns younger than 45 days of age were included. The articles generated in the initial search were screened independently by two of the authors. A third reviewer settled any discrepancies about the inclusion. Then, trials were categorized based on the type of intervention: topical anesthetics, oral sucrose, oral acetaminophen, nerve blocks, caudal blocks, circumcision device, non-pharmacological adjuncts, and multiple combinations.

Results

Twenty-nine randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were found to address pain preventative measures in RMIC. As single agent, nerve blocks outperformed topical anesthetics and oral sucrose, as the latter two proved to be insufficient for proper pain control. Additionally, dorsal penile nerve block and ring blocks have a reasonable safety profile. The use of caudal blocks in RMIC was uncommon. Oral sucrose in association with swaddling or music are helpful and can be easily combined with other methods of pain management. Moreover, oral acetaminophen given perioperatively helps the patient recover. Ultimately, pain control should rely on a combination of anesthetics, analgesics, and kinesthetic methods to be administered before, during, and after the procedure for optimal outcome.

Conclusion

RMIC is a painful procedure in need of proper pain control. Different interventions and agents have various abilities in controlling pain; however, developing a protocol centered around multimodal pain control proves to be the most effective.

Parental/legally authorised representative (LAR) satisfaction

A total of 1650 (97.6%) parents completed a questionnaire at the 28 day follow-up, 40 (2.4%) were lost to follow-up and one with an incompletely healed penis did not complete the questionnaire. When parents were asked what they liked about the circumcision procedure with the option to choose from multiple answers, the most common answers were fast healing in 1010 (61.2%), cosmetic appearance in 796 (48.2%) and reduced pain in 756 (45.8%), no stitches in 669 (40.6%, figure 1). When asked about what they disliked about the circumcision procedure, the most common answer was nothing disliked in 1489 (90.2%), followed by more pain than expected in 84 (5.1%) and other in 42 (2.6%). A total of 1635 (99.1%) parents were satisfied with the appearance of the circumcised penis, and 1636 (99.9%) would recommend circumcision at this age to another parent.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^111Kufwo]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Key action statements — opioid prescribing for acute pain in children and adolescents — advise that pediatricians and other pediatric health care providers (PHCPs) should treat acute pain using a multimodal approach that includes nonpharmacologic therapies, nonopioid medications, and, when needed, opioid medications; PHCPs should NOT prescribe opioids as monotherapy for children and adolescents who have acute pain; when prescribing opioids for acute pain in children and adolescents, PHCPs should provide immediate-release opioid formulations, start with the lowest age- and weight-appropriate doses, and provide an initial supply of 5 days or fewer, unless the pain is related to trauma or surgery with an expected duration of pain of more than 5 days; when treating acute pain in children and adolescents younger than 12 years, PHCPs should NOT prescribe codeine or tramadol; when treating acute pain in adolescents 12–18 years of age who have obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, or severe lung disease, PHCPs should NOT prescribe codeine or tramadol; when treating postsurgical pain after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy in children and adolescents younger than 18 years, PHCPs should NOT prescribe codeine or tramadol; when treating acute pain in people of any age who are breastfeeding, PHCPs should NOT prescribe codeine or tramadol; when treating acute pain in children or adolescents who are taking sedating medications, such as benzodiazepines, PHCPs should use caution when prescribing opioids; when prescribing opioids, PHCPs should provide naloxone and counsel patients and families on the signs of opioid overdose and on how to respond to an overdose; when prescribing opioids, PHCPs should educate caregivers about safe storage and directly observed administration of medications to children and adolescents and should educate caregivers about safe disposal of unused medications, help caregivers develop a plan to safely dispose of unused medications, and, if possible, offer safe disposal in their practice setting; when treating acute, worsened pain in children and adolescents with preexisting chronic pain, PHCPs should prescribe opioids when indicated and partner with any other opioid-prescribing clinicians and with specialists in chronic pain, palliative care, and/or other opioid stewardship programs to determine an appropriate treatment plan.

### Male neonatal circumcision: indications, controversies and complications [^112oeVGW]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The debate about whether to circumcise infants in the neonatal period likely will continue. As the medical and ethical issues are discussed and studied, however, economic factors are beginning to limit the practice in the United States. As the shift in reimbursement occurs, parents who believe that circumcision is a medically necessary practice will need to be reassured that their child may lead a healthy life with an intact foreskin.

### Addition of clonidine and fentanyl: comparison between three different regional anesthetic techniques in circumcision [^117PApTC]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Several techniques have been used for alleviating post-circumcision pain with regional anesthetics being more effective than systemic opioids. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of dorsal penile block, ring block (RB) and dorsal penile block associated with RB in reducing post-circumcision pain in children.

Methods

We conducted a prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial on 100 boys aged between 1 month and 5 years undergoing elective circumcision. Each 20 mL of local anesthetic mixture contained 9 mL lidocaine 1% without epinephrine, 9 mL bupivacaine 0.5%, 1 mL fentanyl (50 microg.ml(-1)) and 1 mL clonidine (75 microg.ml(-1)). They were allocated to one of three groups: 33 boys were given a RB with 1–1.5 mL (group 1), 32 had a dorsal penile block with 1.5–4 mL (group 2) and 35 had a combined ring and dorsal penile block with 2.5–5 mL of anesthetic mixture based on the child's age.

Results

Ninety-one children (91%) completed the clinical trial (three failed blocks and six follow-up losses). The groups were similar with regard to age, weight, height, duration of surgery and hemodynamic status. The average pain scores were significantly higher with a RB compared with the other two groups (P < 0.05) for the first postoperative day. RB children and dorsal penile block children consumed significantly more analgesics for the first six postoperative hours (P < 0.05). The surgeon's satisfaction was significantly higher with the ring + dorsal penile block group (100%) compared with the other two groups (P = 0.032).

Conclusion

Dorsal penile block plus RB technique is superior to dorsal penile block alone and RB alone in reducing postcircumcision pain in children.

### Bupivacaine versus lidocaine analgesia for neonatal circumcision [^113pscao]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Circumcision was performed 4–5 minutes after analgesia administration. An additional dose of 0.3–0.5 mL 30% sucrose solution was dripped orally. The infants lay on a padded surface and circumcision was performed using the Mogen circumcision clamp (all procedures were carried out by S.D.). The infants were observed for adverse effects of analgesia or circumcision for at least 15 minutes and underwent a physical examination.

The parents were given an instruction sheet and verbally instructed by the physician to administer a dose of 30 mg/kg liquid acetaminophen 4 hours after the procedure if they subjectively felt that the infant displayed any signs they perceive as pain. One repeat dose was also recommended 4 hours after that if symptoms of pain or discomfort reappeared. The parents were instructed to contact the physician if pain persisted thereafter. A follow-up appointment was scheduled within 2–5 days after the circumcision, and the number of acetaminophen doses administered to the infants during the 24-hour period after the circumcision was routinely recorded. Consent was obtained from both parents.

Statistical methods included the t-test, Chi-square test, and regression analysis. Data are presented as mean ± SD. A P value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

### Postoperative pain and analgesia administration in children after urological outpatient procedures [^115vDRGC]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are limited data about pain patterns, analgesic requirements and factors predicting opioid requirements of children undergoing outpatient urologic surgery. This prospective study aimed to assess recovery profiles and pain medication requirements.

Methods

Patients between 6 months and 12 years of age were recruited prospectively between December 2013 and June 2014. Demographic and operative characteristics were collected. Following discharge home, the parents were asked to administer both acetaminophen and ibuprofen Q6H at a weight-adjusted dose, based on a schedule, until the end of postoperative day 2, and to administer the medication as required on postoperative day 3. Pain severity was recorded using validated pain scores (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability/Parents' Postoperative Pain Measurement). A morphine prescription was provided for breakthrough pain. A Likert scale was used to assess parent's satisfaction with the pain management.

Results

A total of 249 patients were recruited, 111 patients (45%) returned appropriately completed surveys and were included in the final analysis. Mean age was 44.1 months (SD = 37.3). The performed procedures were orchidopexy (31), hypospadias repair (26), hernia/hydrocele repair (15), Fowler-Stephens procedure (13), meatoplasty (7), phalloplasty (4), scrotoplasty (1), circumcision (7), and diagnostic laparoscopy (5). After discharge home 17 patients (15.3%) received morphine. Mean utilization of non-opioid analgesia was 79% on postoperative day 1, 67% on day 2, 36% on day 3, and 2% on day 4. Parental satisfaction was high (92.0% satisfied/very satisfied). No patient, anaesthetic or surgical factors were associated with opioid use or prolonged need for postoperative analgesia.

Conclusion

The combination of scheduled non-opioid medications for maintenance and opioids for breakthrough pain provided satisfactory pain control after outpatient urologic surgery in children. There were no specific patient, anesthetic or surgical factors that predicted postoperative opioid requirements.

### Does ultrasound guidance improve the efficacy of dorsal penile nerve block in children? [^117JvMkQ]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Penile nerve block (PNB) is a well-established technique used for circumcision; it requires the injection of local anesthetics close to the dorsal nerve of the penis. The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of ultrasound-guided PNB versus the classical landmark-based technique (LBT) in children undergoing circumcision.

Methods

Forty boys, aged 1–14 years old that were scheduled for circumcision were randomly assigned to ultrasound-guided and landmark-based groups. All patients were placed under standard anesthesia with sevoflurane. In each group, patients received the penile block with ropivacaine, 0.75 mg·kg(-1) per side, and 0.05 mg·kg(-1) at the penis base. Groups were compared for intraoperative failure rate of the block, anesthesia time, postoperative pain scale, time of first required dose of paracetamol, time to first micturition, and average duration of stay in the postanesthesia care unit.

Results

The failure rate of dorsal PNB was not statistically different between groups (P = 0.5). Ultrasound guidance improved the efficacy of the PNB compared to the LBT in terms of postoperative pain scores on arrival in the PACU (P < 0.01) and after 30 min (P < 0.01). The ultrasound-guided technique also delayed the time to the first paracetamol dose administration (P < 0.0001), but the duration of the procedure, defined as the time between anesthesia induction and the end of surgery, was increased by 10 min in the US-guided group (P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Ultrasound-guided PNB improved the efficacy of the block compared with the LBT in terms of the postoperative pain during the first postoperative hour and the time to the first requirement for postoperative analgesia.

### A comparison of pudendal block vs dorsal penile nerve block for circumcision in children: a randomised controlled trial [^1135FDKF]. Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

We compared the analgesic and anaesthetic efficacy of pudendal nerve block with that of dorsal penile nerve block in male patients aged 3–5 years of age, undergoing elective circumcision. Thirty patients had a nerve stimulator-guided pudendal nerve block with two separate injection points 1.5–2 cm from the centre of the anus, and thirty patients received a dorsal penile nerve block. The same total anaesthetic volume of 0.3 ml.kg(-1) was used in both groups. The pudendal nerve group showed significantly lower postoperative pain scores than the dorsal group (SD) (p < 0.05), and significantly fewer patients consumed analgesics in the pudendal group than the dorsal group: 0 vs 5 (17%) at 0 and 6 h, respectively. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of pudendal nerve block in comparison to the dorsal nerve block, with improved postoperative outcomes in children undergoing circumcision.

### Comprehensive description of newborn distress behavior in response to acute pain (newborn male circumcision) [^117V9rav]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

One of the most difficult challenges still facing researchers and clinicians is assessing pain in the newborn. Behaviors provide one of the most promising avenues for deepening our fundamental understanding of complex phenomenon like newborn pain, and are key to developing descriptive-level knowledge to further newborn pain assessment efforts. In this ethologically based research, we report on the duration and frequency of neonatal distress behavior to seven distinct noxious and non-noxious but distress-provoking events including baseline (diaper change, post-diaper change, application of arm and leg restraints, post-application of arm and leg restraints, circumcision, post-circumcision) associated with newborn surgical pain. Approximately 67 min of videotaped data, involving four neonates who had undergone newborn male circumcision, were coded at 1-s intervals (4010 s in total). A reliably established coding scheme was used to code behaviors as they were observed on videotape for the duration of the seven designated events. This led to the identification of (1) 40 distress behaviors as they occurred along the continuum of distress, (2) eight distress behaviors specific to surgery, (3) 11 classes of behaviors occurring within the five sub-phases of circumcision, and (4) a description of 25 distinct post-distress behaviors. Findings support the ability to distinguish distress behaviors specific to pain and the ability to detect prolonged distress as well as individual differences in distress-related pain expression. Findings also justify ongoing use of ethological approaches to further newborn pain assessment and to investigate poorly understood topics such as infant self-regulation within the context of pain (pain recovery).

### Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) consensus recommendations for opioid-minimising pharmacological neonatal pain management [^117L9FrX]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

The use of neuraxial analgesia with a caudal, epidural and/or spinal has also been studied in neonates. Bilgen et al demonstrated that a caudal approach provided adequate analgesia for neonatal circumcision without requiring additional adjunctive pain medications. In 47 patients with biliary atresia, those who underwent an epidural catheter placement had lower pain scores, decreased need for systemic opioids and were more likely to be extubated in the OR than patients managed without an epidural. A large multicentre safety analysis of the use of neuraxial catheters in neonates has shown a low risk of serious complications (0.3%) with catheter malfunction, contamination and vascular puncture being the most common adverse events. In addition to reduction in opioid exposure, neonates who underwent a combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia (CSEA) were shown to have fewer respiratory and cardiovascular adverse events than those who underwent general anaesthesia. Those who had CSEA were also shown to have a faster return of intestinal function with less abdominal distension than those who underwent general anaesthesia following intestinal surgery. Structured programme development can help introduce the routine use of regional anaesthesia in neonatal patients as part of an opioid-minimising analgesia strategy. Despite moderate-quality evidence, this is a weak recommendation based on the balance of benefits given that not all providers and facilities currently have the expertise to manage regional analgesia in neonates.

Guideline implementation

The current recommendations are based on available evidence and expert consensus. The recommendations should be considered in parallel with non-pharmacologic pain management particularly for less painful procedures. The current guideline was reviewed for feedback and feasibility by several stakeholders, and their suggestions contributed to the final product. These guidelines can be implemented individually or within a broader ERAS approach. Users are encouraged to monitor adherence and implementation using both process and outcome metrics (eg, neonatal pain scores, opioid utilisation and provider satisfaction). These guidelines do not provide specific dosing recommendations. Future studies will focus on implementation and will inform guideline updates. The GDC plans to review updated evidence and implementation trials to develop a practice guideline update in 5 years.

### Clinical implications of unmanaged needle-insertion pain and distress in children [^1131HAmh]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that pain from venipuncture and intravenous cannulation is an important source of pediatric pain and has a lasting impact. Ascending sensory neural pain pathways are functioning in preterm and term infants, yet descending inhibitory pathways seem to mature postnatally. Consequently, infants may experience pain from the same stimulus more intensely than older children. In addition, painful perinatal procedures such as heel lancing or circumcision have been found to correlate with stronger negative responses to venipuncture and intramuscular vaccinations weeks to months later. Similarly, older children have reported greater pain during follow-up cancer-related procedures if the pain of the initial procedure was poorly controlled, despite improved analgesia during the subsequent procedures. Fortunately, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic techniques have been found to reduce children's acute pain and distress and subsequent negative behaviors during venipuncture and intravenous catheter insertion. This review summarizes the evidence for the importance of managing pediatric procedural pain and methods for reducing venous access pain.

### A' snip' in time: what is the best age to circumcise? [^1164Lovv]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Sexual function and activity

The effect of an infant circumcision on sexual function and activity cannot be determined directly, but can be inferred from studies of men circumcised as adults. Numerous studies show that MC has no adverse effect on sexual function. This finding is supported by data from the large RCTs in sub-Saharan Africa which included more than 10,000 participants. A study in Turkey found no relationship between age of childhood circumcision and overall sexual function in men aged 22–44. Since all men are circumcised, mostly in childhood, in this Muslim country there was no control group of uncircumcised men to compare with. Of seven areas of sexual function examined (frequency of intercourse, communication, degree of satisfaction, avoidance, sensuality, ejaculatory function and erectile function), the only difference was lower avoidance in those circumcised between the ages of 0–2, compared to the 3–5 and 6–12 age groups. A study of MSM in Sydney reported that later circumcision was associated with erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation difficulties in some men. Such difficulties were not seen in men who had been circumcised in infancy. In developed countries, most later circumcisions tend to be for treatment of a medical condition and this could offer a partial explanation for the finding. Since men circumcised later were less likely to engage in insertive anal intercourse, psychological effects after MC for medical need, at an age where the male has cognitive awareness of his previous painful penile problems, as well as the surgery itself, seemed a probable explanation. In a large Danish study in which circumcision, mostly for medical reasons, accounted for the small proportion of circumcised men surveyed, there were no differences in a range of sexual measures, apart from a statistically questionable difference in ability to reach orgasm during intercourse in a minority of 10 circumcised men.

When circumcision is delayed beyond the onset of sexual activity, the impact of a period of abstinence must be considered. Analysis of data from three RCTs found that relatively few men engaged in sexual intercourse within 42 days of circumcision. It has been suggested, not unreasonably, that this period of complete abstinence (from both intercourse and masturbation) is "often daunting and serves as a disincentive for men to undertake the procedure", and the recommended post-surgical abstinence period was found to be a significant barrier to MC uptake in Kenya. Circumcision in infancy, or indeed at any time before puberty, eliminates such an obstacle.

### The impact of foot reflexology on postoperative pain and fear in children following circumcision: a randomized controlled trial [^116vnSGT]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative pain and fear are common in children after surgical interventions and can negatively impact the healing process. Circumcision, as a common surgical procedure, often results in both physical pain and psychological fear in children. Foot reflexology, a non-pharmacological method, is effective in reducing pain and stress by applying pressure to specific points on the feet that correspond to various parts of the body. Reflexology, especially in children, stands out as an alternative approach to managing postoperative pain and fear. The integration of such complementary methods into post-surgical care can help accelerate the healing process in children.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of foot reflexology in managing postoperative pain and fear in children following circumcision.

Materials and Methods

This study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial. The study included 84 children, aged 5–10 years, hospitalized for circumcision at a pediatric surgery clinic in a public hospital in eastern Turkey. Participants were randomized into experimental (n = 42) and control (n = 42) groups based on age. Reflexology was applied to the children in the experimental group after circumcision. Data were gathered using the Patient Descriptive Information Form, Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale, and Child Fear Scale. Number, percentage, mean, t test in independent groups and paired t test were used in the evaluation of the data.

Results

The primary source of postoperative pain in both groups was the incision site, while painful procedures were the leading cause of fear. Children who received reflexology postoperatively reported significantly lower pain and fear scores compared to those in the control group.

Conclusion

Foot reflexology is an effective non-pharmacological intervention for reducing pain and fear in children's post-circumcision. Pediatric nurses should consider incorporating reflexology into routine care to enhance pain management outcomes. Nursing education programs should consider including training in reflexology and other non-pharmacological pain management techniques to improve pediatric postoperative care.

### Parental assessment of pain control following pediatric circumcision: Do opioids make a difference? [^117N73od]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a postoperative prescription for opioids affects parental assessment of pain control following pediatric circumcision.

Methods

This postoperative survey assessed the parental assessment of pain control in 199 patients, ages < 18 years undergoing circumcision. This study was conducted at a quaternary care children's hospital in Houston, Texas from December 2018 to January 2020. Postoperative pain regimens included acetaminophen and ibuprofen or combination hydrocodone/acetaminophen in addition to ibuprofen for postoperative analgesia based on the surgical preference. The primary study outcome was identification of the proportion of parents rating their child's analgesia following pediatric circumcision as poor or inadequate based on the postoperative analgesic regimen.

Results

Of the 502 surveys sent, the response rate was 40% (199/502) of those who received the survey email, and 64% (199/308) for those who opened the email. Between the opioid and nonopioid groups, there was no difference in, race/ethnicity (Caucasian; 28% vs 37%; p = 0.43) or insurance status (insured; 51% vs 45%; p = 0.44). The proportion of parents who rated their child's pain as poor or inadequately controlled following circumcision was relatively rare:5.5% and 1.1% in the nonopioid and opioid groups, respectively. Parents rating their child's pain as excellent with regards to pain control following circumcision were 61% and 53% in the nonopioids and opioid groups, respectively.

Conclusion

The results of this study indicate that nonopioid analgesic regimens following pediatric circumcision were not associated with decreased parental satisfaction or an increasing assessment of poor or inadequately controlled pain. Limiting opioid exposure following pediatric circumcision is feasible and does not result in worse parental satisfaction with the analgesic plan.

### Neonatal infant pain scale in assessing pain and pain relief for newborn male circumcision [^111AMiLx]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Circumcision-partial or total removal of the penile prepuce-requires cutting nerve-laden, sensitive genital tissue and is therefore liable to be painful. The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence concerning pain felt by newborns during circumcision and to determine whether current analgesic methods can eliminate such pain. I performed a search in medical databases, selecting the trials published in the last 20 years that assessed pain in neonatal circumcision. Twenty-three trials have been retrieved. To get reliable findings, those trials that used validated pain scales were selected; then it was investigated which trials had comparable data for using the same pain scale. The only pain scale that was used in more than two trials was the modified Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (mNIPS) that ranges 0–6. The results of these trials show that none of the analgesic strategies used obtained the absence of pain. Some differences between circumcision techniques can be noticed, but most assessments exceed the score of 3, chosen as the clinically significant pain.

### Assessment of pain and hemodynamic response in older children undergoing circumcision: comparison of eutectic lidocaine / prilocaine cream and dorsal penile nerve block [^1179hCrF]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) or local topical anesthesia (LT) provided better postoperative analgesia and less hemodynamic stimulation during and after circumcision surgery with Plastibell in older children.

Methods

Forty-one subjects (age: 2–13 years) undergoing circumcision with Plastibell were randomly divided into LT and DPNB groups. Inhalation induction was performed with an 8% end-tidal sevoflurane concentration. In the LT group, a eutectic ointment of 5% lidocaine and 5% prilocaine was applied to the foreskin 1 h before surgery. At 10 min after anesthesia induction, the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was decreased to 2%. In the other group, a DPNB was performed with 0.5% bupivacaine (1 mg/kg). Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and involuntary movements were evaluated at anesthesia induction (T0), 1 min after DPNB (T1), 1 min after incision (T2), and 1 min after surgery (T3). Pain was evaluated at 1 and 24 h after surgery, and complications were evaluated at 24 h after surgery.

Results

The groups were homogeneous with respect to age, weight, glans diameter, penile length, Kayaba classification, and surgical duration. The LT group showed increased HR (p = 0.073) and MAP (p = 0.046) at T2 as compared to T0. No hemodynamic changes were observed in the HPDB group. The LT group showed a higher pain score at 1 h after surgery than the DPNB group, whereas the DPNB group had a higher incidence of hematoma (p = 0.02) at 24 h after surgery.

Conclusion

Anesthesia with 5% lidocaine and 5% prilocaine cream during circumcision of older children with Plastibell under general anesthesia with sevoflurane does not provide satisfactory perioperative hemodynamic stability or postoperative analgesia.

### Caudal epidural block versus other methods of postoperative pain relief for circumcision in boys [^111AQq66]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Techniques to minimize the postoperative discomfort of penile surgery, such as circumcision, include caudal block; penile block; systemic opioids and topical local anaesthetic cream, emulsion or gel.

Objectives

To compare the effects of caudal epidural analgesia with other forms of postoperative analgesia following circumcision in boys.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (to April 2008) and EMBASE (to April 2008).

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of postoperative analgesia by caudal epidural block compared with non-caudal analgesia in boys, aged between 28 days and 16 years, having elective surgery for circumcision.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out assessment of study eligibility, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies.

Main Results

We included 10 trials involving 721 boys. No difference was seen between caudal and parenteral analgesia in the need for rescue or other analgesia (relative risk (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 1.43; 4 trials, 235 boys; random-effects model) or on the incidence of nausea and vomiting (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.05; 4 trials, 235 boys). No difference in the need for rescue or other analgesia was seen for caudal compared with dorsal nerve penile block (DNPB) (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.44; 4 trials, 336 boys; random-effects model). No differences were seen between caudal block and DNPB in the incidence of nausea and vomiting (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 5.04; 4 trials, 334 boys; random effects model) or individual complications except for motor block (RR 17.00, 95% CI 1.01 to 286.82; 1 trial, 100 boys) and motor or leg weakness (RR 10.67, 95% CI 1.32 to 86.09; 2 trials, 107 boys). These were significantly more common in the caudal block groups than with DNPB. No differences were seen between caudal and rectal or intravenous analgesia in the need for rescue analgesia or any other outcomes (2 trials, 162 boys).

Authors' Conclusions

Differences in the need for rescue or other analgesia could not be detected between caudal, parenteral and penile block methods. In day-case surgery, penile block may be preferable to caudal block in children old enough to walk due to the possibility of temporary leg weakness after caudal block. Evidence from trials is limited by small numbers and poor methodology. There is a need for properly designed trials comparing caudal epidural block with other methods such as morphine, simple analgesics and topical local anaesthetic creams, emulsions or gels.

### Bleeding and ketorolac use in pediatric circumcision [^113Bx4xG]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Circumcision is a common surgical procedure performed in pediatric male patients. Ketorolac is an effective adjunct in multimodal regimens for postoperative pain control. However, many urologists and anesthesiologists refrain from administering ketorolac due to concern for postoperative bleeding.

Aims

Compare the risk of clinically significant bleeding after circumcision with and without intraoperative ketorolac administration.

Methods

A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted of pediatric patients 1–18years of age who underwent isolated circumcision by one urologist from 2016 to 2020. Clinically significant bleeding was defined as bleeding requiring intervention within the first 24h of circumcision. Interventions included use of absorbable hemostats, placement of sutures, or return to the operating room.

Results

Of 743 patients, 314 (42.3%) did not receive ketorolac and 429 (57.7%) received intraoperative ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg. Postoperative bleeding requiring intervention occurred in one patient (0.32%) in the non-ketorolac group versus four patients (0.93%) in the ketorolac group (difference 0.6%, 95% CI [-0.8%, 2.0%], p = 0.403).

Conclusions

There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative bleeding requiring intervention between the non-ketorolac and ketorolac groups. Future studies regarding the association between ketorolac and postoperative bleeding are needed.

### Safety and efficacy of the shangRing for early infant male circumcision in the routine clinical setting [^116ZGgHb]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

EIMC, though not as thoroughly examined as VMMC, presents a viable approach that could aid in achieving a higher circumcision rate. Studies have indicated that EIMC is safe, can offer protection before starting sexual activity and removes concern for resuming sexual activity during recovery. Although it has been shown to be more cost-effective at reducing lifetime HIV risks, it continues to be less accepted than VMMC primarily because of lack of knowledge, cultural attitude and assumptions. Ultimately, while adolescent and adult circumcision programmes have successfully increased coverage in some countries, maintaining these long-term results requires a task shift toward routine circumcision at younger ages to ensure each new generation is circumcised without requiring large-scale catch-up campaigns.

In various clinical trials, the ShangRing MC with adults, adolescents and early infants has been proven to be safe and to have shorter operative times, lower intraprocedural pain score, less blood loss, fewer adverse events (AEs) and higher satisfaction with penile appearance compared with conventional circumcision. Results showed promising potential to scale up EIMC in Sub-Saharan Africa. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large cohort that has studied the use of the ShangRing for EIMC by midlevel medical providers in routine clinical settings.

### A comparison of caudal bupivacaine and ketamine with penile block for paediatric circumcision [^11639qTw]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

To establish whether caudal with ketamine or penile block provide superior postoperative analgesia for paediatric circumcision.

Method

This was a single centre, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial. Forty males (aged between 18 months and 16 yr) were randomized to receive either a penile block using 0.25 mL kg(-1) 0.5% bupivacaine (Group P), or a caudal block using 0.5 mL kg(-1) 0.25% bupivacaine with 0.5 mg kg(-1) ketamine (Group C). All of them were given a standard anaesthetic and rectal paracetamol 40 mg kg(-1) and diclofenac 1–1.5 mg kg(-1). Postoperative pain scores were assessed in recovery and the time to first analgesia, micturition and walking were recorded.

Results

There were no failures in either group. The time to first analgesia was longer in Group C (C median = 459 min, interquartile range 374–553 min; P median = 374 min, interquartile range 224–507 min; P < 0.05). There was a delay in time to walking in Group C (C median = 162 min, interquartile range 119–208 min; P median = 120 min, interquartile range 92–132 min; P < 0.05). There was no difference between the groups in time to waking or micturition, or the incidence of vomiting, abnormal behaviour or bleeding.

Conclusion

Caudal bupivacaine with ketamine and penile block both provide effective postoperative analgesia for circumcision when given with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This study shows that caudal bupivacaine with ketamine provides a longer duration of analgesia than penile block, but also causes delay in walking.

### Combination analgesia for neonatal circumcision: a randomized controlled trial [^116fxsoi]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is no consensus on the most effective pain management for neonatal circumcision. We sought to compare different modalities.

Methods

This is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing 3 combination analgesics used during circumcision (EMLA + sucrose; EMLA + sucrose + dorsal penile nerve block [DPNB]; EMLA + sucrose + ring block [RB]) with the traditional topical analgesic cream EMLA alone. The trial was set in the normal nursery of a teaching hospital. The sample included 70 healthy male newborns, randomly assigned to intervention and control groups at a 2:1 ratio. Infants were videotaped (face and torso) during the procedure for assessment of pain by 2 blinded, independent reviewers. The primary outcome measure is the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale score. Secondary outcomes include heart rate, oxygen saturation, and crying time.

Results

Neonatal Infant Pain Scale scores were significantly lower in the intervention groups (EMLA + sucrose, mean [SD]: 3.1 [1.33]; EMLA + sucrose + DPNB: 3 [1.33]; EMLA + sucrose + RB: 2.45 [1.27]) compared with the control (5.5 [0.53]). Between-group analyses showed RB + EMLA + sucrose to be significantly more effective than EMLA + sucrose; EMLA + sucrose + DPNB (P = 0.009 and P = 0.002, respectively). Interrater reliability was κ = 0.843. Significant increase in heart rate (139.27 [9.63] to 163 [13.23] beats per minute) and crying time (5.78 [6.4] to 45.37 [12.39] seconds) were noted in the EMLA group.

Conclusions

During neonatal circumcision in boys, the most effective analgesia is RB combined with oral sucrose and EMLA cream.

### Comparison of local anesthetic effects of tramadol with prilocaine during circumcision procedure [^115YGnNY]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the local anesthetic effects of tramadol hydrochloride with prilocaine for circumcision procedure.

Methods

This study included 40 patients with American Surgical Association-I scores. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either 5% tramadol (2 mg/kg) plus adrenaline (0.0125/mL) (group 1, n = 20) or 2% prilocaine plus adrenaline (0.0125/mL) (group 2, n = 20). The degree of burning sensation and pain at the injection site were documented. Sensory block was assessed 1 minute after injection and the patients were asked to grade touch and pinprick sensation. Five minutes after drug administration, incision was performed and intensity of pain, felt by the patient was evaluated on a 4-point scale (0–3). Pain at the injection site and local skin reactions were also recorded.

Results

Mean ages were 9.7 and 10.3 years for groups 1 and 2, respectively. Mean duration of surgery was 19.6 minutes. In control visit, 2 of 20 (10%) in group 1 and 10 of 20 (50%) children in group 2 reported extra need for oral ibuprofen (P < .05). First analgesic medication time was 9.5 (± 2.1) hours in group 1 and 8.7 (± 3.1) hours in group 2 (P > .05). Total postoperative ibuprofen consumptions were 10 and 50 mg for groups 1 and 2, respectively (P < .05).

Conclusions

A combination of tramadol 5% plus adrenaline can provide a safe and effective local anesthesia during circumcision procedure and postoperative period in children.

### Safety and efficacy of the shangRing for early infant male circumcision in the routine clinical setting [^113ifjht]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Male circumcision (MC) has been shown to decrease transmission of HIV and is a critical strategy to decrease its incidence in countries with high rates of heterosexually transmitted HIV. Early infant MC (EIMC), with single-use MC devices, could increase rates of MC in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our objective was to determine the safety, efficacy and satisfaction of ShangRing EIMC in resource-constrained environments.

Methods

Healthy male infants aged 1–60 days underwent ShangRing EIMC performed by non-physician clinicians in 14 sites in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The primary outcomes were the safety and efficacy of ShangRing EIMC. Secondary outcomes were pain related to the procedure, wound healing and parental satisfaction. Male infants were assessed at discharge and on postoperative days 7 and 28 for wound healing and complications. This trial is registered with Clinical. Trials.gov, NCT03338699, and is complete.

Results

From the 1697 participants enrolled from February to November 2020, 1691 (99.6%) underwent ShangRing EIMC. Median duration of the procedure was 10 min (IQR 6–13). The mean Neonatal Infant Pain Scale 20 min postprocedure was 0.3 (SD 0.8), indicating no pain. At the time of discharge, 1679 (99.0%) participants had a normal-appearing wound and 1574 (93.1%) demonstrated complete wound healing at 28 days. A total of 17 (1.0%) AEs were reported, most related to bleeding. A total of 1635 (99.1%) of parents were satisfied with the appearance of the circumcised penis at 28 days.

Conclusion

ShangRing EIMC is a simple and successful MC method that non-physician clinicians can perform safely, with low AE rate, satisfactory wound healing and high satisfaction rate among parents. This indicates that the ShangRing EIMC can be considered a long-term strategic approach to accelerate the scale-up of MC in Sub-Saharan Africa.

### Age differences in perceptions of and motivations for voluntary medical male circumcision among adolescents in south Africa, tanzania, and Zimbabwe [^111r7H8p]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Perceived Level of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Protection From Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision

Age was associated with perceived level of HIV protection from VMMC (Figure 3). Younger adolescents were less likely than older ones to correctly cite that VMMC offers boys and men only "some" protection from HIV (47.8% vs 72.6%; aPR, 0.73; 95% CI,.65–.82; P < .001). Younger adolescents (15.3%) were almost twice as likely than older adolescents (8.8%) to misperceive VMMC as offering them complete protection from HIV. All adolescents had poor knowledge regarding the level of HIV protection VMMC offers to female partners (Figure 3B). Only 27.0% of younger and 23.4% of older adolescents correctly cited that VMMC does not directly provide female partners HIV protection (aPR, 1.04; 95% CI,.86–1.26; p = 0.71). Notably, 34.1% of younger adolescents and 59.1% of older adolescents misperceived that female partners had some or complete HIV protection after VMMC (Figure 3B). These data are shown by age and country in Supplementary Table S7.

Figure 3.
Age differences in the perceived level of human immunodeficiency virus protection provided by voluntary medical male circumcision.

Perceived Barriers to Undergoing Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision

The most common concern about undergoing VMMC was pain from the procedure or injection site among younger (44.5%) and older (66.4%) adolescents. Concerns about pain, however, were not independently associated with age (aPR, 0.95; 95% CI,.87–1.04; p = 0.27) (Table 3). Other less frequent concerns were related to the duration of postprocedure wound healing time, sexual abstinence during wound healing, and potential damage to the penis (Table 3). In addition, 13.1% of younger and 8.4% of older adolescents expected that their recovery would be "hard" or "very hard" (aPR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12–1.86; p = 0.004). Perceived barriers to undergoing VMMC are shown by age and country in Supplementary Table S8.

### ShangRing versus mogen clamp for early infant male circumcision in Eastern sub-saharan Africa: a multicentre, non-inferiority, adaptive, randomised controlled trial [^112oD5ko]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Procedures

All participating infants received a rectal suppository of 40 mg acetaminophen 30 mins before the procedure and a 2.0% sucrose solution as a pacifier during the procedure. A mixture of topical 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine cream was applied to the shaft and the glans of the penis before any intervention. Dwell time was measured from agent application to either the absence of response to a noxious stimulus on the foreskin or to the start of the procedure. Supplemental injectable local anaesthetic was available if inadequate analgesia was noted by the provider. The Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) score was used to standardise pain assessment. NIPS is a validated pain scale assigning points on the basis of the provider's observation of the infant's facial expression, cry, breathing pattern, arms, legs, and state of arousal.NIPS scores range from zero to ten, with a higher score correlating with higher probability of more severe pain.

Before trial initiation, all staff performing the procedure completed a training course on EIMC using both devices. The previously described no-flip techniquewas used for all infants randomly assigned to undergo circumcision by ShangRing. First, the foreskin and glans penis were separated. Second, the inner ring was inserted and adjusted to encircle the glans and frenulum (a dorsal slit was performed to facilitate this step when necessary). Third, the outer ring was affixed to the inner ring on the outside to compress the foreskin. Fourth, the excess foreskin distal to the rings was removed, leaving the device in place (figure 1). Finally, the wound was dressed and the family was instructed that the device would either fall off on its own within 1–2 weeks or be removed by the surgical team after postoperative day 7. The Mogen clamp procedure was performed as previously described. After the procedure, infants were monitored for immediate complications according to standard protocols at each site. A systematic pain assessment was conducted approximately 20 mins after the procedure, and a formal wound assessment was performed before hospital discharge. Parents and legally authorised representatives were given wound care instructions and a phone number to contact a provider for any questions or concerns 24 h a day, 7 days a week. The cadre of 1378 providers comprised nurses (1068 [77.5%]), clinical officers (303 [22.0%]), and doctors (seven [0.5%]).

### ShangRing versus mogen clamp for early infant male circumcision in Eastern sub-saharan Africa: a multicentre, non-inferiority, adaptive, randomised controlled trial [^114cqtBJ]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Pain was not only the most frequently reported but also the most challenging AE to assess in infants. We chose to use NIPS to minimise providers' subjectivity; however, this scale has only been validated for assessing acute pain in neonatal intensive care units and not in surgical settings. Although most of the severe AEs were due to an intraoperative NIPS score above 5, none of these infants required further analgesic intervention. Thus, use of NIPS for intraoperative pain assessment seemed to be suboptimal. This limitation affected the ability to assess pain in infants undergoing EIMC by ShangRing or Mogen clamp. As an analogy, pain in adolescents and adults is only considered to be severe if it requires parenteral analgesia or leads to severe disability, yet this was not the case when pain was assessed with NIPS. Multimodal analgesia regimens have been deemed to be most effective in neonates and can include local topical anaesthetic with adequate dwell times (< 80 mins), preoperative acetaminophen, adjunct methods (eg, sucrose pacifiers or music), and local injectable anaesthetic agents if adequate pain control is otherwise not achieved. In this trial, we differentiated our pain control approach from that recommended by WHO's injectable local anaesthesia regimen. We preferred to use an acetaminophen rectal suppository plus topical anaesthetic because of greater ease of use by non-medical personnel and a potentially lower risk of complications than injectable anaesthetic agents. Even though more than 97% of the EIMC procedures by ShangRing were successfully performed in infants with only local topical anaesthetics, we recommend that injectable anaesthetic agents are available for redundancy. Furthermore, providers who use local anaesthetics need to familiarise themselves with all of the precautions for safe use of these medications. For example, clinicians might need to be aware of excess absorption through unintended application or spreading of anaesthetic to other exposed areas of skin.

### Pain and analgesic use post-procedure and post-discharge after infant spinal anesthesia versus general anesthesia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^114J7gVY]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Spinal anesthesia (SA) for pediatric surgery is associated with reduced intraoperative administration of opioids and analgesics, but its impact on post‐discharge pain control and analgesic administration remains unclear.

A single‐center retrospective, secondary use, unmatched cohort study was performed on 63 patients aged 1–21 months who underwent circumcision or orchidopexy under SA or general anesthesia (GA) between January and August 2019. Caregivers received a journal to record pain control, analgesic use, and side effects after surgery and were surveyed 7 to 21 days after discharge as part of a separate QI project to assess opioid prescription patterns among providers. This QA/QI study was exempted from IRB review, and an a priori data analysis plan was approved by the departmental research committee.

All patients were male with median weight of 9.2 kg (IQR 7.9,10.5). Patient‐reported race was Caucasian (78.7%), Black (9.8%), and Asian/Other/Multiple (11.5%). Forty‐eight patients (76.2%) underwent circumcision, and 15 patients (23.8%) underwent orchidopexy by pediatric urologists or pediatric surgeons. Thirty‐three patients received GA (52.4%), and 28 patients received SA (44.4%). Two additional patients received SA but required conversion to GA with intubation due to spinal failure (3.2%); they were excluded from statistical analysis. All spinals consisted of 1 mg/kg 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine with 1:200000 epinephrine, maximum 5 mg.

### Opioid prescribing is excessive and variable after pediatric ambulatory urologic surgery [^1111yonF]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pain after surgery is one of the most frequent indications for opioid prescribing in children. Opioids are often not stored or disposed of safely after their use, placing children and others in the home at risk for accidental ingestion or intentional misuse. We currently lack evidence-based guidelines for post-operative pain management after common ambulatory pediatric urologic procedures. Thus, each surgeon must decide if and how much opioid to prescribe based on his/her own assumptions of perceived post-operative pain.

Objectives

As part of an effort to establish opioid prescribing guidelines across two academic centers, the objectives of this study were to evaluate current variability in pediatric urologists' opioid prescribing factors and identify patients at greatest risk of being prescribed high doses of opioids after common ambulatory pediatric urologic procedures.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated post-operative opioid prescribing patterns after common ambulatory pediatric urology procedures (circumcision, orchiopexy, and hernia/hydrocele) at two major children's hospitals. Specifically, we evaluated if and how much opioid was prescribed for all children (18 years or younger) between 2016 and 2017. Bivariate analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis Test and Wilcoxon Rank Sum. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine patient, surgeon, and procedural factors that predicted the prescription of a high dose of opioids (greater than the median number of doses prescribed for that procedure).

Results

Over the two-year period, 811 circumcisions and 883 inguinal surgeries (inguinal orchiopexy and hernia/hydrocele) were performed. 94% of patients undergoing circumcision and 97% of those undergoing inguinal surgery were prescribed opioid analgesia. The median number of doses prescribed for circumcision was 20; for inguinal surgeries, 23.75% of patients received 15 opioid doses or more. Patients ages 0–2 years, who represented the largest age group (41% of all patients), received significantly more opioid doses than all other age groups, followed by those > 10 years (p < 0.01). There was significant variation in opioid prescribing patterns by provider (p < 0.01) (Figure 1) On multivariable logistic regression, younger age, pill form, and earlier year were all associated with a greater number of opioid doses prescribed for all surgeries.

Conclusions

Across two institutions without a formal post-operative opioid prescribing policy for ambulatory pediatric urologic procedures, we observed considerable variability in provider prescribing patterns, with nearly all patients receiving an opioid, and those 0–2 years receiving the highest number of doses. This highlights the need for evidence-based guidelines for post-operative pain management after ambulatory pediatric urologic surgeries.

### Safety and efficacy of the shangRing for early infant male circumcision in the routine clinical setting [^112JCeJY]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Study participants and procedures

Healthy male infants aged 1 to 60 days, with a gestational age ≥ 37 weeks and birth weight ≥ 2.5 kg, were identified and screened at all study sites. Participants who followed inclusion and exclusion criteria as previously described in detail in our randomised controlled trial were deemed eligible to participate, and parent(s)/LARs were consented. Appropriate referrals were made if parents were interested in EIMC, but their children did not meet inclusion criteria for the study. Participants who were enrolled were not involved in research design or analysis.

All infants received the ShangRing EIMC performed by trained midlevel non-physician medical providers who completed a hands-on training course, following the same protocol as previously described. Topical anaesthesia (2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine mix) was applied to the glans and shaft of the penis, and dwell time was determined by absence of response to noxious stimuli. If needed, providers could use additional injectable local anaesthesia. Dwell time and need for additional anaesthesia were recorded. After EIMC, the wound was dressed, and the infant's family was instructed that the ShangRing device would either fall on its own or be removed by the healthcare provider at follow-up. Participants were assessed at discharge and on postoperative days 7 and 28, with unscheduled visits made as needed. The ShangRing was allowed to detach spontaneously or was removed at the visit on day 28 if still not detached. Infants were examined for wound healing and complications, and parents were encouraged to return to the healthcare provider at any time if there was any complication, excessive pain or any other problem. Difficulties with the procedures were reported by parents at the time of post-operative visits as needed.

### A comparison of anesthetic efficacy between dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with lidocaine and eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) cream during neonatal circumcision [^111Zfb1r]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge some limitations with this study. The duration of circumcision as well as the interval between the designated steps is relatively short to measure the changes in physiological parameters. Thus, there may have been overlap in parameters measured during the steps. In addition, being a single center study, conclusions based on a single population may not be accurate as pain perception and sensitivity varies among individuals, races, and ethnic groups.

In conclusion, better pain control and less stress are achieved with use of DPNB with lidocaine during neonatal circumcision compared with EMLA cream. In addition, both methods are safe. Finally, all neonates undergoing circumcision should have the benefit of anesthesia.

### Opioids and pediatric urology: a prospective study evaluating prescribing habits and patient postoperative pain and narcotic utilization [^112bCGfb]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Few pediatric urologists believe patients require a majority of the doses of opioids prescribed to them postoperatively. Seeking a better understanding of postoperative pain and analgesia in pediatric urology patients may help reduce opioid over prescription while still adequately managing postoperative pain.

Objective

We sought to better understand: 1) the postoperative pain levels experienced by pediatric urology patients, 2) the factors that correlate with postoperative pain and number of opioids consumed following pediatric urologic procedures, and 3) the patients who do not require opioids after surgery.

Study Design

Pediatric patients undergoing circumcision, inguinal hernia repair, orchidopexy, or hypospadias repair were eligible to participate. Patients were enrolled in the prospective cohort on the day of the procedure. For each of the first 7 postoperative days, patients' parents completed a text message-based questionnaire, quantifying their child's pain level and the doses of pain medication the child consumed.

Results

165 participants were enrolled. 57 patients underwent circumcision, 54 underwent orchiopexy, 32 underwent hypospadias repair, and 22 underwent inguinal hernia repair. For all procedure types, pain scores (p < 0.01) and doses of oxycodone consumed were highest on postoperative day one and steadily declined thereafter. Overall, average 7-day pain score (2.02; 0.86–5.14) and doses of narcotics consumed (3.50; 0–5) were low. Patients in each surgical subgroup were prescribed narcotics in excess of what was consumed. There was an average excess of 10.9 doses (0–39.0) for hypospadias repair, 8.6 (1.0–30.0) for circumcision, 9.0 (3.0–21.0) for inguinal hernia repair, and 6.1 (0–22.0) for orchiopexy.

Discussion

Overall, reported pain scores and number of narcotics consumed were low regardless of surgery type. Opioids were overprescribed regardless of surgery type.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that level of pain and opioid use varies by procedure type, but that number of narcotics prescribed greatly exceeds number needed.

### Medical male circumcision is associated with improvements in pain during intercourse and sexual satisfaction in Kenya [^115SDKuo]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Two cohort studies using data from randomized controlled trials in Africa offer the best evidence to date on the effects of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) on male sexual function and satisfaction, suggesting no significant impairments in sexual function or satisfaction and some improvements in sexual function after male circumcision.

Aim

To assess the effects of VMMC on sexual function and satisfaction in a large population-based cohort of men circumcised as adults and uncircumcised controls in Kenya.

Methods

Sexual function and satisfaction of young (median age = 20 years) sexually active men (1,509 newly circumcised men and 1,524 age-matched uncircumcised controls after 5% loss to follow-up) were assessed at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, with data collected in 2008 to 2012. Self-reported data on lack of sexual interest or pleasure, difficulty getting or maintaining erections, orgasm difficulties, premature ejaculation, pain during intercourse, and satisfaction with sexual intercourse were analyzed with mixed-effect models to detect differences between circumcised and uncircumcised men and changes over time.

Outcomes

Changes over time in sexual interest, desire and pleasure, erectile and ejaculatory function, and pain during intercourse (dyspareunia) in circumcised and uncircumcised men; group differences in time trends; satisfaction with sexual performance; and enjoyment of sex before and after circumcision.

Results

Sexual dysfunctions decreased in the two study groups from 17% to 54% at baseline to 11% to 44% at 24 months (P < .001), except dyspareunia, which decreased only in circumcised men (P < .001). Sexual satisfaction outcomes increased in the two study groups from 34% to 82% at baseline to 66% to 93% at 24 months (P < .001), with greater improvements in circumcised men (P < .001). On average, 97% of circumcised men were satisfied with sexual intercourse and 92% rated sex as more enjoyable or no different after circumcision compared with before circumcision.

Clinical Translation

Results are applicable to VMMC programs seeking to increase the acceptability of male circumcision as part of comprehensive HIV prevention.

Strengths and Limitations

Large-scale population-based longitudinal data restricted to sexually active individuals and adjusted for differences in baseline levels of outcomes and potential confounders are used. The questionnaire used, although not a standardized survey instrument, includes all major domains of male sexual function and satisfaction used in the most common standardized tools.

Conclusions

Results are consistent with large cohort studies of VMMC using data from randomized controlled trials and indicate that VMMC has no significant detrimental effect or might have beneficial effects on male sexual function and satisfaction for the great majority of men circumcised as adults.

### Bupivacaine versus lidocaine analgesia for neonatal circumcision [^112TMG32]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

Infants who were treated with bupivacaine injected as a DPNB had significantly better post-operative analgesia compared with lidocaine, as judged by their lower requirement of acetaminophen 24 hours after circumcision. Despite the recommendation to use 0.5% bupivacaine for DPNB in the previous edition of a major textbook of regional analgesia, a Medline search failed to identify any reports on the use of bupivacaine in DPNB for neonatal circumcision.

The use of bupivacaine for pediatric analgesia for circumcision was reported in two recently published studies performed on children older than 1 year. A study by Choi et al compared the use of topical EMLA cream with bupivacaine in a randomized placebo-controlled manner and concluded that, despite no difference in the score obtained using a pain scale between the two groups, bupivacaine DPNB resulted in significantly longer analgesia. A second recently published study by Gauntlett compared bupivacaine in DPNB with caudal bupivacaine with ketamine in 60 boys and reported no immediate adverse effects.

The use of bupivacaine may be potentially more hazardous than lidocaine in cases of accidental intravenous injection. Cardiac toxic effects of high doses or unintentional intravascular injection may lead to high plasma levels and related depression of the myocardium, decreased cardiac output, heart block, hypotension, bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Adverse central nervous system effects include restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision or tremors and sometimes convulsions. The safety of DPNB was recently studied in 3,909 pediatric patients undergoing circumcision. The authors did not report the type of medication and dosage that had been used and also failed to note if there had been any patients with accidental intravenous injection of the local anesthetic medication. An additional study of neonatal circumcision with DPNB in 491 patients found that the only complication was bruising at the injection site in 11% of patients. The type of drug used in this study was not specified in this study.

### Moments that matter: childhood pain treatment shapes pain for life-we can do better every time in every child [^115SJk7Y]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We can do better every time in every child

Parents are dissatisfied with their experience of childhood vaccinations: of 1485 parents, as many as 32% were dissatisfied with the information they received, and 27% were concerned about pain, distress, or side effects caused by the vaccination. It is troubling, yet not surprising, that pain and distress are often cited as a primary parental concern. A recent survey of 255 UK practising nurses (where the majority had > 10 years' experience administering 5–20 childhood immunisations per week) highlights that only 13% received pain management training and that pain management policies were in place in < 5% of practices. Consequently, pain-relieving techniques are infrequently used; a consistent approach to always using topical local anaesthetics (0% of practices), sucrose (0%), breast-feeding (6%), or parent (6%) and nurse-led (13%) distraction techniques does not happen or is extremely rare. Worryingly, a frequent reason cited for not providing pain relief was that 'parents didn't request it'. How can parents request analgesia, if they were not told that it is their child's right to expect pain relief during routine medical procedures? The data described here is not consistent with the 'Comfort Promise', which is an international initiative where participating institutions ' promise to do everything possible to prevent and treat needle pain. For every child. Every time '. Given we have evidence-based tools to treat pain caused by intramuscular injections as well as other procedures, why does it remain under-treated in children? What are the barriers to implementation? And how do we motivate healthcare professionals and families to expect this level of care? This article addresses these questions and identifies solutions.

### Lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5% (PRILOVIX plus) [^114MsYan]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Lidocaine and prilocaine cream alone was compared with lidocaine and prilocaine cream followed by lidocaine infiltration and lidocaine infiltration alone prior to cryotherapy for the removal of male genital warts. The data from 121 patients demonstrated that lidocaine and prilocaine cream was not effective as a sole anesthetic agent in managing the pain from the surgical procedure. The administration of lidocaine and prilocaine cream prior to lidocaine infiltration provided significant relief of discomfort associated with local anesthetic infiltration and thus was effective in the overall reduction of pain from the procedure only when used in conjunction with local anesthetic infiltration of lidocaine.

Lidocaine and prilocaine cream was studied in 105 full term neonates (gestational age: 37 weeks) for blood drawing and circumcision procedures. When considering the use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream in neonates, the primary concerns are the systemic absorption of the active ingredients and the subsequent formation of methemoglobin. In clinical studies performed in neonates, the plasma levels of lidocaine, prilocaine, and methemoglobin were not reported in a range expected to cause clinical symptoms.

Local dermal effects associated with lidocaine and prilocaine cream application in these studies on intact skin included paleness, redness and edema and were transient in nature (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

The application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream on genital mucous membranes for minor, superficial surgical procedures (eg, removal of condylomata acuminata) was studied in 80 patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial (60 patients received lidocaine and prilocaine cream and 20 patients received placebo). Lidocaine and prilocaine cream (5 to 10 g) applied between 1 and 75 minutes before surgery, with a median time of 15 minutes, provided effective local anesthesia for minor superficial surgical procedures. The greatest extent of analgesia, as measured by VAS scores, was attained after 5 to 15 minutes' application. The application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream to genital mucous membranes as pretreatment for local anesthetic infiltration was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 44 female patients (21 patients received lidocaine and prilocaine cream and 23 patients received placebo) scheduled for infiltration prior to a surgical procedure of the external vulva or genital mucosa. Lidocaine and prilocaine cream applied to the genital mucous membranes for 5 to 10 minutes resulted in adequate topical anesthesia for local anesthetic injection.

### Adolescent wound-care self-efficacy and practices after voluntary medical male circumcision – A multicountry assessment [^1121UfDF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Self-Management of Complications and Unsafe Practices

Parents/guardians and adolescents reported behaviors that went against recommendations, such as adolescents exposing their fresh wounds to prove to others they had been circumcised or ignoring symptoms of infection and not returning to the clinic for review when an AE had occurred.

Ah, one will be saying his organ [penis] has grown bigger… Three of my friends, they will be showing me how different it [penis] has become. We will be showing each other… One will say, 'Look at the head [glans] and how it is now'. (16-year-old male, Mt Darwin, Zimbabwe).

A parent described what she observed:

You would see them showing the others at the bus stop. I don't know if it was stitches [sutures], because I saw it in passing… It was very scary the way they were showing each other after coming back from the clinic. (FGD female parents, KwaMashu, South Africa).

Despite strong advice to consult a provider in the case of postprocedure complications, adolescents' accounts insinuated that some had opted to manage these on their own.

When it [wound] formed pus, I drained it… The next day, I also drained it. That is when it was about to heal, when I removed the stitches… I removed them on my own. (16-year-old male, Iringa, Tanzania).

Another older adolescent reported avoiding clinical care despite bleeding, swelling, and pain — all of which could be considered either moderate or severe post-VMMC AEs:

The stitches separated and I started bleeding. I went back home and wrapped the wound. My penis then got swollen and I felt pain. I then decided to pull the stitches that I could see… I was very scared [of going to facility]. I knew they would stitch [suture] me again. (16-year-old male, Mbeya, Tanzania).

For some adolescents, self-management of complications was a strategy to avoid repeating what they believed were painful VMMC procedures.

### Sweet-tasting solutions for needle-related procedural pain in infants one month to one year of age [^114KApzZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Administration of oral sucrose or glucose with and without non-nutritive sucking is frequently used as a non-pharmacological intervention for needle-related procedural pain relief in infants.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of sweet-tasting solutions for needle-related procedural pain in infants one month to one year of age compared with no treatment, placebo, other sweet-tasting solutions, or pharmacological or other non-pharmacological pain-relieving methods.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012); MEDLINE via Ovid (1966 to 2012); CINAHL via OVID (1982 to 2012). The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform was also searched for any ongoing trials. Clinical trial registries, conference proceedings and references for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were also searched. An updated search was run to capture any new publications before finalising the review in April 2012 and no new included studies were identified. Two review authors (MK & JF) independently abstracted data and assessed quality using a standard form. Authors have been contacted for missing data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised-controlled trials using a sweet-tasting solution to treat pain in healthy term infants (gestational age 37 weeks and over), between one month and 12 months of age who required needle-related procedures. These procedures included but were not limited to: subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, venepuncture, and heel lance. Studies in which the painful procedure was circumcision, lumbar puncture or supra-pubic bladder aspiration were not included as they are more severe and painful than needle-related procedures. Control conditions included no treatment or placebo (water) or any other identical intervention (same appearance and consistency) without active ingredient, another sweet-tasting solution, a pharmacological pain-relieving method (e.g. paracetamol, topical anaesthetic cream), non-pharmacological pain-relieving method (e.g. distraction method, non-nutritive sucking).

Data Collection and Analysis

Assessment of trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data were performed using standard methods of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group. We report mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effect models as appropriate for continuous outcome measures. We planned to report risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes. The Chi(2) test and I(2) statistic were used to assess between-study heterogeneity.

Main Results

Sixty-five (65) studies were identified for possible inclusion in this review. Fourteen published RCTs with a total of 1551 participants met the inclusion criteria. Duration of cry was significantly reduced in infants who were administered a sweet-tasting solution [MD -13.47 (95% CI -16.80 to -10.15)], P < 0.00001 compared with water. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 94%) that we were unable to explain. Meta-analysis was not able to be undertaken for any of the other outcome measures, except for cry duration, because of differences in study design. However, most of the individual studies that measured pain found sucrose to significantly reduce pain compared with the control group. One study compared sucrose and Lidocaine-prilocaine cream and no significant difference was found between the two treatments for the outcomes pain and cry duration. Due to the differences between the studies, we were unable to identify the optimal concentration, volume or method of administration of sweet-tasting solutions in infants aged one to 12 months. Further large RCTs are needed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confidently judge the effectiveness of sweet-tasting solutions in reducing needle-related pain in infants (one month to 12 months of age). The treatments do, however, appear promising. Data from a series of individual trials are promising, as are the results from a subset meta-analysis of studies measuring duration of crying. Further well controlled RCTs are warranted in this population to determine the optimal concentration, volume, method of administration, and possible adverse effects.

### Pain and analgesic use post-procedure and post-discharge after infant spinal anesthesia versus general anesthesia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^113r1P2d]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, post‐hospital survey results (Table 1) showed no significant difference between SA and GA groups in parental opinion of pain control, reported as "good, adequate, or poor" (p = 0.867). Post‐hospital, patients with GA used significantly more NSAIDs (SA: 35.7% vs. GA: 60.6%, p = 0.046). Post‐hospital acetaminophen (SA: 92.9% vs. GA: 97%) and opioid (SA: 0% and GA: 3%) use did not significantly differ between groups (p > 0.999 and p = 0.589, respectively). There was no difference in parental‐reported side effects.

TABLE 1
Postoperative home survey results.

In the circumcision subgroup analysis, the SA group experienced significantly fewer painful days with pain resolution within 1–3 days for 80% versus 52.4% for those receiving GA (p = 0.047) and significantly less nausea/vomiting (SA: 0% vs. GA: 19.1%, p = 0.037).

In this study, we examined the effect of implementation of a SA program on perioperative opioid administration and post‐hospital analgesic use and pain control. Our study has four main findings: Compared with those receiving GA, patients receiving SA received less in‐hospital perioperative opioids, had lower PACU pain scores and shorter stays, consumed fewer analgesic medications, and, in the circumcision subgroup, experienced less nausea and vomiting after discharge.

SA may reduce hemodynamic, metabolic, hormonal, inflammatory, and immune responses to surgical stress as well as poorly controlled operative pain, which is associated with delayed recovery time, impaired functionality, development of chronic pain, and increased morbidity. These effects may have contributed to our findings.

Shorter time to feeding for infants receiving SA may be indicative of less nausea, resulting in quicker acceptance of formula or breastmilk. Fewer side effects (e.g. sleepiness, nausea/vomiting, and itchiness) resulting from avoidance of GA and opioids may decrease the time to discharge and improve recovery at home.

### Effect of two surgical circumcision procedures on postoperative pain: a prospective, randomized, double-blind study [^1127TJCJ]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Male circumcision (MC) is one of the most commonly used surgical procedures worldwide for medical and traditional reasons. No studies have compared the postoperative pain advantages of conventional techniques (i.e., sleeve and dorsal slit).

Objective

In this prospective randomized double-blind study, we investigated the effect of two surgical techniques (i.e., sleeve and dorsal slit) on postoperative pain and emergence agitation.

Study Design

This prospective study was conducted between January and July 2013. Approval was obtained from the local Ethical Committee on 17 December 2012, 06/23 (CLINICAL TRIALS IDENTIFIER: NCT 01909765). We compared two surgical techniques (i.e., the dorsal slit incision technique (Group A) and the double incision (i.e., sleeve) technique (Group B) in 60 children who were subjected to MC surgery under general anesthesia. All children received dorsal nerve blocks with bupivacaine. The modified objective pain scale (MOPS) was used for pain assessment, and the Ramsey Sedation Scale was used for the assessment of agitation during anesthesia emergence.

Results

The MOPS scores were lower in Group B than in Group A in the post-anesthesia care unit and during the 4th hour post-surgery (p = 0.01 and p = 0.037, respectively). Twelve children (40%) in Group A and 23 children (76.6%) in Group B required no additional analgesia on postoperative day one (p = 0.004). The Ramsey sedation scores were lower in Group A (p = 0.018).

Discussion

Dorsal slit is often the primary method in cases with paraphimosis; during this procedure, the frenulum frequently cannot be preserved at the 6-o'clock position of the mucosa, because of traction applied to skin and mucosa. As a result, the frenular artery is injured. In contrast, the sleeve technique protects the frenulum and the anatomic structures of the glans. In the sleeve technique, providing hemostasis and preventing partial ischemia by protecting the frenular artery reduces postoperative pain and complications. This present study demonstrated that the sleeve technique, which preserved the frenular artery, caused less bleeding, reduced electrocautery use and less ischemia than the dorsal slit technique. The sleeve technique effectively reduces early postoperative pain and agitation after circumcision, provided that adequate postoperative analgesia has been achieved. While all variables except the employed surgical techniques were similar, Group B had advantages with respect to analgesic requirement and pain control during the first 8 h after the operation.

Conclusion

The sleeve technique provides lower pain scores and a reduced incidence of agitation after elective MC.

### Medical male circumcision is associated with improvements in pain during intercourse and sexual satisfaction in Kenya [^1134vhvp]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Most studies comparing sexual function and satisfaction in circumcised and uncircumcised men have used self-reported cross-sectional survey data. Some large nationally representative cross-sectional surveys, have included countries with high and low male circumcision rates, controlling for demographic factors that might influence attitudes toward circumcision. Several studies have compared intravaginal ejaculatory latency time, and a few small studies have reported direct physiologic measurements of penile sensitivity and sexual response, in circumcised and uncircumcised men, finding no evidence for detrimental physiologic effects of male circumcision. Two cohort studies using data from RCTs, in Africa offer the best evidence to date on the effects of VMMC on male sexual function and satisfaction, suggesting no significant impairments in sexual function or satisfaction and some improvements in sexual function after male circumcision. The most recent and comprehensive systematic review thus far, published in 2013 by Morris and Krieger, found no evidence for differences between circumcised (n = 20, 931) and uncircumcised (n = 19, 542) men in any component of sexual function, satisfaction, or sensitivity and pleasure. The cumulative evidence from cross-sectional, case-control, and pre-post circumcision studies suggests that medical circumcision might have little or no effect on male sexual function and satisfaction, but there is need for additional, large-scale, population-based evidence in the context of a national program to scale-up VMMC for HIV prevention.

### Pre-emptive penile ring block with sucrose analgesia reduces pain response to neonatal circumcision [^115XnWMa]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare retrospective use of oral sucrose (SUC) vs oral sucrose plus lidocaine ring block (SUC + RB) in the management of pain during neonatal circumcision.

Methods

A retrospective review of medical records of newborns circumcised using the "Neonatal Infant Pain Scale" was done.

Results

With regard to pain, the SUC group had a significantly greater percentage of those with pain than the SUC + RB group at 1 minute (77.7% vs 69.4%; p = 0.01) and 5 minutes (65.7% vs 55.7%; p = 0.004). There was no significant pain difference at 30 minutes. In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, those in the SUC group had significantly greater odds for pain at 1 minute than those in the SUC + RB group (odds ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.04–2.02; p = 0.03). No significant difference was noted at 5 minutes. Each of the SUC and SUC + RB groups had significant decreases in pain percentages at 5 minutes and 30 minutes (P < .001). In addition, post-term gestational age had significantly greater odds for pain at 5 minutes (odds ratio 3.67, 95% confidence interval 1.51–8.93; p = 0.004).

Conclusion

We found that sucrose use alone as compared with sucrose and ring block combined had greater odds for pain at 1 minute but not at 5 minutes. In addition, those with post-term gestational age had greater odds for pain at 5 minutes as compared with those with regular gestational age. We recommend for hospital-based circumcision using clamps, the use of combined sucrose and ring block for increased analgesia. In addition, for post-term neonates, we recommend greater focus on pain levels, including considering higher dosages of pain medications.

### Dorsal penile nerve block for male pediatric circumcision – randomized comparison of ultrasound-guided vs anatomical landmark technique [^111Q3JDJ]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) is a commonly performed regional anesthetic technique for male circumcision. Traditionally, DPNB is based on an anatomical landmark technique. Recently, an ultrasound-guided technique for DPNB has been described.

Objectives

The aim of our study was to compare the anatomical landmark technique with this ultrasound-guided technique. The hypothesis to be tested was that ultrasound guidance of DPNB would lead to less administration of opioid when compared to the anatomical landmark technique.

Methods

Boys of ASA status I/II scheduled for day case circumcision were prospectively recruited and randomized. DPNB was performed under general anesthesia using the anatomical landmark technique or ultrasound guidance. Fentanyl was administered intraoperatively and immediately postoperatively if patients demonstrated signs of pain. Similarly, oral codeine was given prior to discharge if required. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients requiring fentanyl. Secondary outcome measures included initial pain score on emergence from general anesthesia, requirement for codeine predischarge, and time to perform block.

Results

A total of 32 patients were recruited to the landmark group and 34 to the ultrasound group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of fentanyl administration. The ultrasound technique took longer to perform but was associated with a reduction in codeine requirement prior to discharge.

Conclusions

This study does not support the routine use of ultrasound for the performance of DPNB in male pediatric circumcision. Nonetheless, an associated reduction in codeine administration postoperatively suggests some benefit in terms of postoperative pain.

### Medical male circumcision is associated with improvements in pain during intercourse and sexual satisfaction in Kenya [^1166phZ5]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The lower baseline rates of sexual satisfaction we found in the VMMC group suggest that some sexual problems not detected during enrollment or through our survey instrument might have been more prevalent in this group, contributing to some self-selection bias. VMMC programs could address this issue by providing medical screening and diagnosis of sexual dysfunctions to men in their communities, regardless of intent to be circumcised, and referring men for therapeutic circumcision when appropriate.

Improvements in sexual function and satisfaction in the two study groups could be due in part to participants becoming older and more sexually experienced during the course of the study.

### Caudal anaesthesia as a treatment for penile ischaemia following circumcision [^1125jtEA]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

We report an ischaemic penile glans following circumcision and a dorsal penile nerve block in a 9-year-old boy. Ischaemia of the glans penis is a rare complication associated independently with both circumcision and dorsal penile nerve blocks. There are a number of pathophysiological mechanisms of this ischaemia and its management is varied and not well recorded. We report the successful management of this complication using a caudal epidural block and also discuss technical aspects of penile nerve blocks.

### Spectrum and the management of glanular-preputial adhesions after ritual male circumcision [^116o8tzY]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Adhesions between the glans penis and prepuce in uncircumcised boys or the preputial remnants in circumcised ones are not rare and they may acquire different forms with or without manifestations, Kim et al. reported penile adhesions as being the majority of post MC complications (84.6%), especially in patients weighing > 5.1 kg.

Herein, we are concerned only about the preputial adhesion following MC whether it is early or late; generally, these adhesions are fibrous bands that form between different tissues and organs, often as a sequala of injury during surgery, or after a subsequent inflammatory process either physical, chemical or infectious. These adhesions may be thought as an abnormal or pathological scar tissue that connects two different raw tissues, which are not connected normally.

The term "adhesion" is applied when the scar extends from within one tissue across to another, it is usually across a virtual space. The process of adhesion starts firstly with fibrin deposition which leads to fibrous connections between different tissues or organs. These adhesions can occur in any part of the body, depending on the cause and location, they can be beneficial in tissue healing or could be harmful causing complications. Applying some sort of adhesion barriers during surgery may help to prevent its formation. In penile adhesion the cohesive adhesion ends with skin bridges formation with a variable diversity as described in this study. Some researchers nominate GPA as a post-circumcision corona obliteration. Others terming the dorsal skin bridge wrongly as a dorsal frenulum, but this is an acquired lesion either after or even without circumcision. Ponsky et al. classified the post MC penile adhesion to grades from 0 to 3 (in grade 3 a 50% of the glans was covered). Roughly, the GPA could be proximal; confined to the coronal sulcus or a distal adhesion extended to cover variable extensions of the glans penis. Van Howe found that the circumcised boys under 3 years of age were significantly more likely to have a partially or completely covered glans, and less likely to have a fully exposed glans than those who were circumcised boys of 3 years or older. Among the 238 boys he studied under 3 years, those circumcised were significantly had non-cosmetic problems, including coronal adhesions, he founded that only 35% of the examined children had a fully exposed glans after circumcision, and he reported that coronal adhesions develop in circumcised boys at 2–6 months of age and it usually resolves by 24 months.

### Medical male circumcision is associated with improvements in pain during intercourse and sexual satisfaction in Kenya [^115s5Y1Y]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Although specific outcomes vary among studies, results from this study and from other comparable prospective cohort studies conducted in African countries indicate that medical male circumcision has no significant detrimental effect or might have beneficial effects on male sexual function and satisfaction for the great majority of men circumcised as adults. These results are applicable to VMMC programs seeking to increase the acceptability of male circumcision as part of comprehensive HIV prevention. In addition, the high baseline rates of sexual dysfunctions we found in the two study groups and lower baseline rates of sexual satisfaction in men seeking circumcision services compared with controls suggest that medical screening for sexual dysfunctions and recommendation for therapeutic circumcision or other appropriate treatment also might be beneficial to men in these communities.

### Excision of an epidermal inclusion cyst: correction of a long-term complication of female genital circumcision [^112z7UAA]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Epidermal inclusion cysts are a late complication of female genital circumcision, which is a practice that affects 125 million women primarily from Africa and the Middle East. A 30-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 1, presented to our clinic with an 8-year history of a slowly enlarging periclitoral mass. The patient had undergone female genital circumcision at the age of 5 years. We describe and video-illustrate the surgical technique of excising the 8-cm epidermal inclusion cyst. Using this technique, the entire cyst was resected intact, excess vulvar skin removed, and defect repaired. Postoperatively, she had minimal pain, no dyspareunia, and good cosmesis. Restoration of anatomy for this late complication of female genital circumcision is achievable with knowledge of anatomy, adherence to basic surgical principles that include tension-free closure, and close postoperative follow up.

### ShangRing versus mogen clamp for early infant male circumcision in Eastern sub-saharan Africa: a multicentre, non-inferiority, adaptive, randomised controlled trial [^115YCXGK]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Use of medical devices represents a unique opportunity to facilitate scale-up of early infant male circumcision (EIMC) across sub-Saharan Africa. The ShangRing, a circumcision device prequalified by WHO, is approved for use in adults and adolescents and requires topical anaesthesia only. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the ShangRing versus the Mogen clamp for EIMC in infants across eastern sub-Saharan Africa.

Methods

In this multicentre, non-inferiority, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled healthy male infants (aged < 60 days), with a gestational age of at least 37 weeks and a birthweight of at least 2.5 kg, from 11 community and referral centres in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated text message service to undergo EIMC by either the ShangRing or the Mogen clamp. The primary endpoint was safety, defined as the number and severity of adverse events (AEs), analysed in the intention-to-treat population (all infants who underwent an EIMC procedure) with a non-inferiority margin of 2% for the difference in moderate and severe AEs. This trial is registered with Clinical. Trials.gov, and is complete.

Findings

Between Sept 17, 2018, and Dec 20, 2019, a total of 1420 infants were assessed for eligibility, of whom 1378 (97.0%) were enrolled. 689 (50.0%) infants were randomly assigned to undergo EIMC by ShangRing and 689 (50.0%) by Mogen clamp. 43 (6.2%) adverse events were observed in the ShangRing group and 61 (8.9%) in the Mogen clamp group (p = 0.078). The most common treatment-related AE was intraoperative pain (Neonatal Infant Pain Scale score ≥ 5), with 19 (2.8%) events in the ShangRing and 23 (3.3%) in the Mogel clamp group. Rates of moderate and severe AEs were similar between both groups (29 [4.2%] in the ShangRing group vs 30 [4.4%] in the Mogen clamp group; difference –0.1%; one-sided 95% CI upper limit of 1.7%; p = 0.89). No treatment-related deaths were reported.

Interpretation

Use of the ShangRing device for EIMC showed safety, achieved high caregiver satisfaction, and did not differ from the Mogen clamp in other key measures. The ShangRing could be used by health systems and international organisations to further scale up EIMC across sub-Saharan Africa.

### Neonatal circumcision… [^113DNbpW]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion Sucrose on a pacifier is an inexpensive and effective method for pain relief in neonatal circumcision when DPNB is not desirable. CIRCUMCISION, an operation performed on more than 80% of newborn males in the United States, 1 is usually undertaken without administering an analgesic agent. Although it is widely acknowledged that neonates experience pain during circumcision, as documented by cardiovascular, hormonal, and behavioral changes, 2 physicians have been reluctant to use analgesics for a variety of reasons. 3 Dorsal penile nerve block has been used effectively for pain relief in neonatal circumcision since 1978, 4 but the American Academy of Pediatrics has not endorsed its use. Response to pain was assessed by the change in infant heart rate and oxygen saturation from baseline. For every infant, the mean heart rate and oxygen saturation for each interval of the circumcision were calculated. Mean values between groups were compared.

Frequencies of missing oxygen saturation data due to excessive motion of the infants in the 3 comparison groups were analyzed separately. We have confirmed and extended the work of Blass and Hoffmeyer7 that oral sucrose on a nipple is effective in reducing the pain of circumcision. When compared with a group receiving a nipple dipped in water or a no-treatment control group, these investigators showed that sucrose treatment resulted in a statistically significant overall reduction in the percentage of time crying, but they did not present their data according to specific intervals of the operation. Nor did they compare sucrose with DPNB. We have shown the treatment effects during each interval of the procedure and compared sucrose with DPNB and no-treatment control. Two groups of investigators have reported the putative effectiveness of the topical combination lidocaine-prilocaine cream compared with placebo control for circumcision.

11, 16 The most recent report16 concludes that the topical combination lidocaine-prilocaine cream is safe and that it reduces the pain of circumcision, as measured by the facial activity score, during 4 of 9 intervals of the surgical procedure. We have confirmed the well-known superiority of DPNB for relieving the pain of circumcision. However, as a result of our findings, we recommend oral sucrose on a nipple as a safe and inexpensive method of pain relief for neonatal circumcision in the instances when either physicians or parents are not comfortable with DPNB. We have confirmed the effectiveness of oral sucrose in reducing the signs of pain and have shown its benefits as compared with DPNB and with no-treatment control.

### Male circumcision… [^113LFBdG]. publications.aap.org (2012). Low credibility.

Male circumcision does not appear to adversely affect penile sexual function/sensitivity or sexual satisfaction. It is imperative that those providing circumcision are adequately trained and that both sterile techniques and effective pain management are used. Significant acute complications are rare. In general, untrained providers who perform circumcisions have more complications than well-trained providers who perform the procedure, regardless of whether the former are physicians, nurses, or traditional religious providers. Parents of newborn boys should be instructed in the care of the penis, regardless of whether the newborn has been circumcised or not. Elective circumcision should be performed only if the infant's condition is stable and healthy. Male circumcision should be performed by trained and competent practitioners, by using sterile techniques and effective pain management.

Analgesia is safe and effective in reducing the procedural pain associated with newborn circumcision; thus, adequate analgesia should be provided whenever newborn circumcision is performed. Nonpharmacologic techniques alone are insufficient to prevent procedural and postprocedural pain and are not recommended as the sole method of analgesia. They should be used only as analgesic adjuncts to improve infant comfort during circumcision. If used, topical creams may cause a higher incidence of skin irritation in low birth weight infants, compared with infants of normal weight; penile nerve block techniques should therefore be chosen for this group of newborns.
