## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option correctly lists types of non-random (non-probability) samples. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing probability versus non-probability sampling. Then, I should verify which methods in the options are actually non-probability. Next, I will check the provided sources to confirm examples like convenience and quota sampling. Finally, I will eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer, making sure I don't misclassify methods like systematic or cluster sampling as non-probability when they are probability methods.

> Let me first confirm the core distinction. Probability sampling gives every member of the population a known, non-zero chance of selection and includes methods like simple random, systematic, stratified, and cluster sampling, whereas non-probability sampling does not and includes convenience, quota, purposive, and snowball sampling, which carry greater risk of selection bias and limited generalizability [^c4345bbe] [^da3c28c4].

> Wait, let me verify the options carefully. Options A, B, C, D, and E all pair "random" with another method; that already looks suspicious because "random" signals probability sampling, not non-probability, so those are likely incorrect. I should double-check the remaining options that mention convenience and quota to see if they align with non-probability examples in the sources [^c4345bbe] [^da3c28c4].

> I will now examine the non-probability examples in the documents. Convenience sampling is repeatedly described as a non-probability approach used when participants are selected based on availability or ease of access, and it is commonly flagged for limited generalizability; quota sampling is likewise categorized as non-probability and is distinct from probability quota sampling in some survey panels, so both belong on the non-probability list [^c54afacf] [^9f6d6ad2] [^e70e5863].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about systematic and cluster sampling. I initially wondered if they might be non-probability because they sound "structured", but wait, I should verify their classification. Systematic sampling selects every kth element from a list after a random start, and cluster sampling selects groups with probability proportional to size; both are probability methods despite their structure, so they do not belong in a list of non-random samples, which means options B, C, D, and E are incorrect [^c54afacf] [^dee21931].

> Let me consider the remaining candidates. Option H pairs convenience and quota, both confirmed non-probability methods, which fits the question. Option I pairs stratified and convenience; stratified sampling is a probability method, so that mix is incorrect. Option F pairs systematic and quota; again, systematic is probability, so that option is wrong despite quota being correct [^c4345bbe] [^c54afacf].

> I should confirm there isn't a trick with quota being misclassified. The meta-analysis explicitly groups quota sampling with non-probability methods alongside convenience, judgment, and snowball sampling, reinforcing that quota is indeed non-random, while noting that some internet panels use quota-based recruitment that still yields non-probability samples unless adjusted, which doesn't change the classification here [^9f6d6ad2] [^e70e5863].

> Putting this together, the only option that lists two authentic non-probability sampling types is H, convenience and quota samples. Therefore, the correct answer is H [^c54afacf] [^9f6d6ad2].

---

The correct answer is **H. Convenience and quota samples**. Convenience sampling selects participants based on availability or ease of access, while quota sampling selects non-randomly to meet predefined subgroup proportions. Both are **non-probability methods** that do not give every individual a known chance of selection, unlike probability methods such as random, stratified, cluster, or systematic sampling [^c4345bbe] [^da3c28c4].

---

## Definitions and characteristics

### Convenience sampling

Convenience sampling selects participants based on availability, accessibility, or ease of recruitment. It is **practical and cost-effective** but prone to selection bias because the sample may not represent the population [^c54afacf]. Examples include recruiting patients at a clinic, students on campus, or online survey respondents [^8e0d4736] [^7f72f711].

---

### Quota sampling

Quota sampling selects participants to match predefined proportions of subgroups (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity) but does so **non-randomly** within those subgroups. Like convenience sampling, it is non-probability and can introduce bias if the selection within quotas is not random [^9f6d6ad2].

---

## Comparison with probability sampling methods

Probability sampling methods, such as random, stratified, cluster, and systematic sampling, ensure every individual has a known, non-zero chance of selection, enabling **statistical inference and generalization** to the population [^c4345bbe]. In contrast, convenience and quota sampling are non-probability methods that do not provide equal selection chances, limiting generalizability and increasing the risk of bias [^da3c28c4].

| **Sampling method** | **Type** | **Description** | **Generalizability** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Convenience | Non-probability | Participants selected based on availability | Low |
| Quota | Non-probability | Participants selected to match subgroup proportions non-randomly | Low |
| Random | Probability | Participants selected randomly from the population | High |
| Stratified | Probability | Population divided into subgroups, then randomly sampled | High |
| Cluster | Probability | Population divided into clusters, randomly selected clusters sampled | High |
| Systematic | Probability | Participants selected at regular intervals from a list | High |

---

## Limitations and biases

Convenience and quota sampling are susceptible to **selection bias**, as participants are not randomly selected. This can lead to over- or under-representation of certain groups and limit the generalizability of findings [^8cb7392b]. Researchers should acknowledge these limitations and consider using probability sampling when feasible [^c4345bbe].

---

## Examples from the literature

- A study on parental knowledge and attitudes regarding antibiotic use in Palestine used convenience sampling to recruit parents attending primary healthcare centers, acknowledging the method's limitations [^caa75527].
- A meta-analysis on age-related macular degeneration explicitly categorized quota sampling as a non-probability method alongside convenience sampling [^9f6d6ad2].
- Emergency department studies frequently use convenience samples, highlighting the need for caution when generalizing results [^8e0d4736] [^6ccfe1d8].

---

## Conclusion

Convenience and quota sampling are **non-probability methods** that select participants non-randomly, limiting generalizability and increasing the risk of bias. They are distinct from probability methods such as random, stratified, cluster, and systematic sampling, which provide equal selection chances and support population inference [^c4345bbe].

### Implications of the paradigm shift in management ofinfections [^fdd9948f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The recent availability of susceptibility testing for Helicobacter pylori infections in the United Sates has resulted in paradigm shifts in the diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up of H. pylori infections. Here, we reviewed the English literature concerning changes in H. pylori diagnosis and therapy with an emphasis on the last 3years. We focus on the new methods that offer rapid and convenient susceptibility testing using either invasive (endoscopic) or noninvasive (stool) methods of obtaining test material. We also discuss the implications of this availability on therapy and follow-up after therapy. The approach to therapy was categorized into four groups: (1) therapies that can be used empirically, (2) therapies that should be restricted to those that are susceptibility-based, (3) potentially effective therapies that have yet to be optimized for local use, and (4), therapies that contain unneeded antibiotics that should not be prescribed. The most convenient and efficient method of susceptibility testing is by using reflexive stool testing in which if the sample is positive, it is automatically also used for determination of susceptibility. Reflexive testing can also be done via reflexive ordering (e.g., for all positive urea breath tests). The post therapy test-of-cure has emerged as a critical component of therapy as it not only provides feedback regarding treatment success but when combined with susceptibility testing also provide evidence regarding the cause of failure (e.g., poor adherence versus emergence of resistance during therapy. Susceptibility testing has made even the most current H. pylori guidelines for diagnosis and therapy generally obsolete. Clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin triple therapies should only be administered as susceptibility-based therapy. Regimens containing unneeded antibiotics should not be given. We provide recommendations regarding the details and indications for all current therapies.

Duodenal Ulcer

Active Duodenal Ulcer: Clinical studies have indicated that suppression of nocturnal acid is the most important factor in duodenal ulcer healing (see Clinical Pharmacology-Antisecretory Activity-Acid Secretion). This is supported by recent clinical trials (see Clinical Pharmacology-Clinical Trials Duodenal Ulcer-Active Duodenal Ulcer). Therefore, there is no apparent rationale, except for familiarity with use, for treating with anything other than a once-daily at bedtime dosage regimen (h.s.).

In a U.S. oral dose-ranging study of 400 mg h.s., 800 mg h.s. and 1600 mg h.s., a continuous dose response relationship for ulcer healing was demonstrated.

However, 800 mg h.s. is the dose of choice for most patients, as it provides a high healing rate (the difference between 800 mg h.s. and 1600 mg h.s. being small), maximal pain relief, a decreased potential for drug interactions (see Precautions-Drug Interactions) and maximal patient convenience. Patients unhealed at 4 weeks, or those with persistent symptoms, have been shown to benefit from two to four weeks of continued therapy.

It has been shown that patients who both have an endoscopically demonstrated ulcer larger than 1 cm and are also heavy smokers (i.e., smoke one pack of cigarettes or more per day) are more difficult to heal. There is some evidence which suggests that more rapid healing can be achieved in this subpopulation with cimetidine 1600 mg at bedtime. While early pain relief with either 800 mg h.s. or 1600 mg h.s. is equivalent in all patients, 1600 mg h.s. provides an appropriate alternative when it is important to ensure healing within four weeks for this subpopulation. Alternatively, approximately 94% of all patients will also heal in eight weeks with cimetidine 800 mg h.s.

### Endoscopic mucosal tissue sampling [^fbc75201]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2013). Medium credibility.

Stomach — Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) gastritis testing depends on clinical situation, cost considerations, and local expertise; endoscopic options include tissue urease activity, histologic examination, and microbial culture. Sensitivity may be decreased by proton pump inhibitors, bismuth compounds, antibiotics, and acute gastrointestinal bleeding; when sensitivity is reduced, a negative urease test result should be confirmed with a different test for H pylori infection, with histology being a convenient alternative. Culture allows identification of bacterial strain and antimicrobial resistance patterns but is difficult to obtain and performed at only a few centers, and there are limited data on the optimal biopsy protocol.

Duodenal Ulcer

Active
Duodenal Ulcer: Clinical studies have indicated that suppression
of nocturnal acid is the most important factor in duodenal ulcer healing (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY − Acid Secretion).
This is supported by recent clinical trials (see Clinical
Trials − Active Duodenal Ulcer). Therefore, there is no apparent rationale,
except for familiarity with use, for treating with anything other than a once-daily
at bedtime oral dosage regimen (h.s.).

In a U.S. oral
dose-ranging study of 400 mg h.s., 800 mg h.s. and 1600 mg h.s., a continuous
dose response relationship for ulcer healing was demonstrated.

However,
800 mg h.s. is the dose of choice for most patients, as it provides a high
healing rate (the difference between 800 mg h.s. and 1600 mg h.s. being small),
maximal pain relief, a decreased potential for drug interactions (see PRECAUTIONS − Drug Interactions) and maximal

### American College of Sports Medicine expert consensus statement to update recommendations for screening, staffing, and emergency policies to prevent cardiovascular events at health fitness facilities [^6359a84b]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2020). High credibility.

Therapeutic implications of physical activity (PA) and fitness indicate that low-fit individuals are approximately two to three times more likely to die during follow-up than their more fit counterparts. The absolute risk associated with each bout of exercise is relatively low and regular exercise, including high-volume endurance activity (> 1 h·d−1), reduces the long-term risk of acute cardiovascular events by up to 50%. Accordingly, a habitually sedentary lifestyle appears to be far riskier than a physically active one, and it is probably more important that individuals exercise regularly at a convenient time of day, regardless of the hour.

### Cimetidine and sodium chloride (cimetidine in sodium chloride) [^c5e44ac1]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Other
cimetidine oral regimens in the U.S. which have been shown to be effective
are: 300 mg four times daily, with meals at bedtime, the original regimen
with which U.S. physicians have the most experience, and 400 mg twice daily,
in the morning and at bedtime (see Clinical Trials − Active Duodenal Ulcer).

Concomitant
antacids should be given as needed for relief of pain. However, simultaneous
administration of oral cimetidine and antacids is not recommended, since antacids
have been reported to interfere with the absorption of oral cimetidine.

While healing with cimetidine
often occurs during the first week or two, treatment should be continued for
4 to 6 weeks unless healing has been demonstrated by endoscopic examination.

Maintenance Therapy for Duodenal Ulcer: In those
patients requiring maintenance therapy, the recommended adult oral dose is
400 mg at bedtime.

Active
Benign Gastric Ulcer

The recommended adult
oral dosage for short-term treatment of active benign gastric ulcer is 800 mg
h.s., or 300 mg four times a day with meals and at bedtime. Controlled clinical
studies were limited to six weeks of treatment (see Clinical
Trials). 800 mg h.s. is the preferred regimen for most patients
based upon convenience and reduced potential for drug interactions. Symptomatic
response to cimetidine does not preclude the presence of a gastric malignancy.
It is important to follow gastric ulcer patients to assure rapid progress
to complete healing.

### Seven-day genotypic resistance-guided tripleeradication therapy can be highly effective [^0976daa7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, this pilot study reveals that a simple molecular susceptibility testing method guiding 7-day triple therapy can achieve a high H. pylori eradication rate, regardless of prior treatment history. Our findings deserve further validation in randomized controlled trials and countries with different patterns of antibiotic resistance.

Summary Box

What is already known:

The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) resistance to antibiotics is steadily increasing worldwide
H. pylori eradication rates with empirical therapies are rapidly declining
There is still paucity of data concerning the applicability of molecular tests to guide the treatment of H. pylori infection

What the new findings are:

A genotypic-resistance-guided modified triple regimen is highly effective (per protocol efficacy > 95%) for H. pylori eradication
Tailored triple therapy, based on a simple and relatively affordable molecular assay, is an alternative approach, both convenient and highly efficacious, for the treatment of H. pylori infection

### Avoiding misleading estimates using mtDNA heteroplasmy statistics to study bottleneck size and selection [^98be39a0]. G3 (2023). Medium credibility.

The various nonlinearities involved in these expressions and distributions mean that even small differences in individual heteroplasmy measurements — and certainly in estimated parameters — can have dramatic differences in the P -values from the analysis (as in Fig. 1b, and several examples in Table 1). Because of this, rounding and binning heteroplasmy values before the WCS-K analysis can have strong effects on the consequent findings (as in some examples in Table 1). The other approaches outlined here are more robust to such small deviations (which will always arise due to measurement noise).

More generally, mtDNA (and plastid DNA) heteroplasmy is a remarkably awkward quantity. If we use the near-universal definition h = m /(w + m) where m is the mutant copy number and w wildtype copy number, h can strictly only take values where w and m are integers, and where w + m is the cellular copy number. So steps smaller than 0.01 are not permitted for a cell with 100 mtDNAs: we can have h = 0.05 or h = 0.06 but not h = 0.054. As the ratio of two random variables, the variance (and mean) of h does not have a convenient closed-form representation, even if we have a perfect theory for how w and m change. The WCS-K model is one attempt to work with h by employing a particular set of simplifying assumptions (which have been critically discussed, for example, in). Other approaches include attempting to develop predictions for w and m and then using our approximating for a complicated sum over all possibilities or a Taylor expansion approximation for h. These approaches have merit (and shortcomings) when attempting to build a bottom-up theory from microscopic dynamics; the Kimura model is convenient for top-down, data-driven analysis. For this reason, it is a valuable approximation of use in heteroplasmy analysis — providing the estimator used is appropriate for the statistical task at hand.

### Australian experience of a modified schedule of FOLFOX with high activity and tolerability and improved convenience in untreated metastatic colorectal cancer patients [^c89b998a]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

This study determined the efficacy and safety of a modified FOLFOX regimen that improved patient convenience without compromising oxaliplatin dose intensity. A total of 62 patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer were enrolled to receive, entirely as outpatients, 2-weekly cycles of oxaliplatin 100 mg m⁻² i.v. over 2 h, together with leucovorin 400 mg m⁻² over 2 h, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg m⁻², bolus, followed by a 46-h infusion of 5-FU at 2.4 g m⁻². Treatment was given until progression or unmanageable toxicity. In all, 61 patients received ≥ one oxaliplatin dose and a median of 11 treatment cycles (range 1–20 cycles); 22 (36%) reported grade 3/4 neutropenia and 13 patients (21%) experienced grade 3 neurotoxicity; 16 patients (26%) discontinued treatment due to disease progression or death, 15 (25%) due to neurotoxicity and six (10%) due to haematological toxicity. Of the 56 eligible patients, complete or partial responses were observed in 29 or 52% (95% confidence interval 38–65%). Median progression-free survival was 8.2 months (7.1–9.9) and median overall survival was 18.7 months (14.0–23.4). In our experience, a modified schedule of FOLFOX improves convenience without compromising efficacy or toxicity.

### Efficacy and safety of 2-hour urokinase regime in acute pulmonary embolism: a randomized controlled trial [^d53ef0a5]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that UK-2 h (20 000 IU/Kg) regimen displayed similar efficacy and safety as the UK-12 h regimen in treating acute PE with either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction. Given the convenience, lower cost and the similar efficacy and safety as the UK-12 h regime, we suggest that body weight adjusted UK-2 h regimen could be used for PE treatment. Further studies are required to evaluate the short and long-term outcomes of these different UK thrombolytic regimens.

### Prebiotic condensation through wet-dry cycling regulated by deliquescence [^658924a6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Selection of cycling conditions

When choosing conditions for model prebiotic experiments, it is necessary to balance historical plausibility with experimental convenience. Although an Earth day was shorter at 4 Ga, we selected cycles that lasted 24 h as a reasonable approximation that was also convenient to monitor over many days. The hot-and-dry phases were set to 100 °C or 120 °C, temperatures in line with those found in previous studies. While several previous studies relied on longer drying times — which generally produce higher yields of condensation — long periods of heat (> 6 h) seem unlikely given the 24-h diurnal cycle on Earth. We therefore limited our heating periods to 4–6 h per cycle.

For the cool phase of each cycle, the relative humidity (%RH) was varied from 30–70%RH. Given the wide range of %RH values on modern Earth — from single digits in desert climates to 100% when raining — these values are both reasonable in a historical context and convenient, as they are easily simulated in the laboratory. Values of %RH much higher or lower are considerably more difficult for a humidity chamber to maintain with precision.

We maintained the temperature at 40 °C for the cool phase of the wet–dry cycles. A temperature slightly elevated from room temperature was necessary to ensure that a constant temperature, and relative humidity could be maintained despite daily fluctuations in the ambient conditions of the laboratory, e.g. a particularly warm or humid day. The higher cool temperature seems relevant to early Earth, as there is geological evidence it was generally warmer than today.

Selection of model reaction and substrates

We targeted the oligomerization of amino acids into peptides as a model condensation reaction for our study for its obvious relevance to prebiotic chemistry. Glycine is the simplest and most prebiotically relevant amino acid. It is produced in the highest yields in simulated prebiotic syntheses of amino acids. and a multifactor analysis by Trifonov suggests that glycine was the most prevalent amino acid in the earliest proteins. As a matter of experimental rigor, yields of oligoglycines can be measured quantitatively by liquid chromatography. Glycine is the only canonical amino acid that produces achiral oligomers, which simplifies their analysis relative to other amino acids. Chromatographic analysis is crucial because the high quantity of salts present greatly complicates quantitative analysis by mass spectrometry (see Supplementary Fig. 30, Supplementary Table 25, and related discussion in the Supplementary Discussion). The results from our experiments are summarized in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

### Preference for rizatriptan 10-mg wafer vs. eletriptan 40-mg tablet for acute treatment of migraine [^768d0a7d]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Preference is a composite, patient-oriented endpoint incorporating efficacy, tolerability, formulation, and convenience of medications. The objective of this study was to compare patient preference for rizatriptan 10-mg wafer vs. eletriptan 40-mg tablet for acute treatment of migraine. In this multicentre, open-label, two-period, crossover study, out-patients were randomly assigned to treat the first of two moderate to severe migraines with rizatriptan or eletriptan and the second with the alternate therapy. Patients completed diary assessments at baseline and up to 24 h after taking study medication. At the last visit, patients completed a psychometrically validated preference questionnaire. A total of 372 patients (mean age 38 years, 85% female) treated two migraine attacks, and 342 patients (92%) expressed a preference for treatment. Significantly more (P ≤ 0.001) patients preferred rizatriptan 10-mg wafer [61.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 55.7, 66.3] to eletriptan 40-mg tablet (38.9%; 95% CI 33.7, 44.3). The most common reason given for preference of either treatment was speed of headache relief. At 2 h, 80% and 69% of patients reported that rizatriptan and eletriptan, respectively, was convenient or very convenient to take (mean convenience score 1.99 vs. 2.31, respectively; P ≤ 0.001). Both triptans were well tolerated. In this head-to-head study designed to evaluate global patient preference, significantly more patients preferred the rizatriptan 10-mg wafer to the eletriptan 40-mg tablet for acute treatment of migraine. The single most important reason for preference was speed of relief, consistent with results from previous preference studies.

### Sampling methodology | CASPER… [^c54afacf]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance CASPER uses a two-stage cluster sampling methodology. In the first stage, clusters are selected with a probability proportional to the estimated number of households in the clusters. A cluster is a non-overlapping section in a geographic area with a known number of households. In the second stage, interview teams use systematic random sampling to select seven households from each of the selected clusters. Note: Choose all clusters without substitution. This means that clusters originally selected are those that are assessed with no changes or modifications. Any departure from this design is not considered a CASPER. In situations where the 30×7 design may not be feasible or ideal, and a change in methodology is warranted, modified CASPERs may be acceptable but. Systematic random sampling To select the seven households to interview, conduct systematic random sampling.

To do this, count the number of households within the selected cluster. Divide that number by 7. Starting at a random point, travel through the cluster in a serpentine method to select every nth household for interview. Walk up one side of the street. Then, turn and walk down the other side in such a manner that every house within the selected cluster is passed. Things to avoid Convenience sampling Convenience sampling is a form of non-probability sampling that involves selection based on:

- Availability
- Opportunity
- Convenience Examples include going to households where there are people outside or where another interviewee told you to go since they know they would answer. Target sampling Target sampling is a form of non-probability sampling that involves intentionally sampling a certain population or group. An example is going to the household that looks the most damaged or like it will get "best" results.

Sequential sampling Sequential sampling is going to one house after another in order. This will likely bias your sample to one section of your cluster. Note that there are some circumstances which may predetermine sequential sampling as necessary. This includes clusters with less than 10 households. Another circumstance is when your clusters are difficult to navigate. In such a case, sequential sampling is the only way to successfully complete the CASPER in the time allowed. In these circumstances, it is extremely important to select a random starting point prior to going into the field.

### 2022 AHA / ACC key data elements and definitions for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular complications of COVID-19: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards [^9d3429ca]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Invasive coronary/vascular/neurovascular revascularization — percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) data elements define PCI per the "2020 AHA/ACC Key Data Elements and Definitions for Coronary Revascularization", with permissible values "Yes", "No", or "Unknown", and specify that any attempt to treat a stenosis, including failed wire or device crossing, "should be counted as PCI at any time point". Time of PCI captures the "Time that PCI was performed" using "Time, hh:mm (using 24-h clock)". PCI status is the "Classification of the urgency of PCI procedure at the time the operator decides to perform the PCI" with values "Elective", "Urgent", "Emergency", and "Salvage". Elective is when the procedure "can be performed on an outpatient basis or during a subsequent hospitalization without significant risk of infarction or death" and, for stable inpatients, is "for convenience and ease of scheduling and NOT because the patient's clinical situation demands the procedure before discharge". Urgent is performed "on an inpatient basis and before discharge because of significant concerns that there is risk of ischemia, infarction, or death", and outpatients or emergency department requests "would warrant an admission based on their clinical presentation".

### Probiotic supplementation for neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions: guidelines for future research [^56402ee9]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Care immediately after administering the trial supplements

We administered the trial medication as a single daily dose for convenience. Many infants with CGISC will have nasogastric tubes (NGTs) on free drainage or suction for gastric decompression. We clamped the NGT for at least 1 h and preferably 3–4 h to prevent the retrograde flow of the administered probiotics/placebo into the free-drain container.

### NHANES tutorials-sample design modulewwwn.cdc.gov › nchs › nhanes › tutorials › sampledesign… [^dee21931]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

The NHANES samples are not simple random samples. Rather, a complex, multistage, probability sampling design is used to select participants representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population. Oversampling of certain population subgroups is also done to increase the reliability and precision of health status indicator estimates for these particular subgroups. For NHANES datasets, the use of sampling weights and sample design variables is recommended for all analyses because the sample design is both a clustered design and incorporates differential probabilities of selection. If you fail to account for the sampling parameters, you may obtain biased estimates and overstate significance levels. NHANES Sampling Procedure The NHANES sampling procedure consists of four stages, shown and described below.

Four Stages of NHANES Sampling Procedure Although this general description of the four-stage sampling procedure applies to all cycles of Continuous NHANES, some details of the sample design have changed over time. Detailed technical information can be found in the Sample Design documents, available on the NHANES Survey Methods and Analytic Guidelines page. What is a Sample Weight. A sample weight is assigned to each sample person. It is a measure of the number of people in the population represented by that sample person in NHANES, reflecting the unequal probability of selection, an adjustment for sample person non-response, and adjustment to account for differences between the final sample and the total population based on independent population control totals. When unequal selection probability is applied, as in the Continuous NHANES samples, the sample weights are used to produce an unbiased national estimate.

More information about sample weights and how they are created can be found in the Weighting module of the tutorial and in the Estimation and Weighting Procedures documentation. NHANES visited 12 PSUs in 1999 and 15 PSUs in each year since 2000. In stage one of our sampling procedure, these PSUs were selected from strata defined by geography, metropolitan statistical area status, and various population demographics. Two PSUs were selected from most strata. Together, these strata and the PSUs represent the variance units. Statistical software procedures used to analyze complex survey data need information about the first stage sampling procedure in order to properly estimate the variance. See the Variance Estimation module for more information about variance estimation and an overview of how to specify sampling design parameters in some common statistical packages.

### Clopidogrel as a donor probe and thioenol derivatives as flexible promoieties for enabling HS biomedicine [^88339275]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The model studies demonstrate that the H 2 S promoieties of masked thioenols can be conveniently installed on a minimal vehicle structure of ketone with an α-hydrogen (enolizable ketone), and the preparation sequence can be fully reversed upon bioactivation, leading to triggered H 2 S release and vehicle recovery, without generating much side products or additional functionalities. Since this minimal structure of enolizable ketone is widely present in clinical drugs or their metabolites (e.g. donepezil), benign substances (e.g. curcumin) and intrinsic biomolecules (e.g. testosterone), a large pool of vehicle structures are available for developing diversified H 2 S donors. It is interesting to note that in the CPG metabolism studies of human subjects, upon H 2 S release from the thioenol metabolite M15, the desulfurized ketone metabolite M18 is quickly reduced to a secondary alcohol metabolite, M18H (Fig. 4a, c). This supports that in addition to the structure of ketone with an α-hydrogen, its reductive form, secondary alcohol with a β-hydrogen, can also serve as a minimal vehicle structure for conveniently installing these H 2 S promoieties. Given that the structure of secondary alcohol with a β-hydrogen is even more widely present in clinical drugs or metabolites, benign substances and intrinsic biomolecules, the generality of this methodology can be significantly expanded. Since the vehicle molecules themselves might have well-established clinical therapeutic effects and can be fully recovered concomitant to triggered H 2 S release, this chemical strategy can be applied to develop co-drugs of synergistic pharmacological pathways.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^373cf587]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 guideline — ATTR cardiac amyloidosis diagnostic evaluation states that LV thickening (wall thickness ≥ 14 mm) along with fatigue, dyspnea or edema should trigger consideration of ATTR-CM, especially with discordance between wall thickness on echocardiogram and QRS voltage on ECG, and that ATTR-CM is prevalent in severe aortic stenosis, HFpEF, carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and autonomic or sensory polyneuropathy. For testing, screening for the presence of a monoclonal light chain and technetium pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP) scan can be ordered at the same time for convenience, but the results of the 99mTc-PYP scan are interpreted only on the context of a negative monoclonal light chain screen; serum free light chain concentration and serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis are assessed to rule out AL-CM, IFE is preferred, and together serum IFE, urine IFE, and serum FLC is > 99% sensitive for AL amyloidosis. In the absence of a light-chain abnormality, the 99mTc-PYP scan is diagnostic of ATTR-CM if there is grade 2/3 cardiac uptake or an H/CL ratio of > 1.5, and SPECT is assessed in all positive scans to confirm myocardial tracer retention rather than blood pool or rib uptake.

### Effect of sample time on urinary lithogenic risk indexes in healthy and stone-forming adults and children [^1a3d7906]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Calculation of renal lithiasis risk indexes is easy and may facilitate the decision-making process for treatment of stone-forming patients because the indexes, which integrate the results of multiple urinary parameters, have shown higher values in stone forming patients that in healthy subjects. These differences have been more evident in the 12 h overnight urine sample. Our results indicate that use of a 12-h overnight urine sample should be considered as a complementary information to that provided by the analysis of 24-h samples when evaluating lithogenic risk, because collection of the overnight sample is more convenient and has higher values in all tested indexes.

### Nutritional requirements and antibiotic resistance patterns of Helicobacter species in chemically defined media [^7023944a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

The growth of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori in the absence of serum remains challenging, and nutritional requirements have only partially been defined, while almost nothing is known about nutritional requirements of other Helicobacter spp. Although previous data showed that H. pylori grows in the chemically defined medium F-12, but not in other tissue culture media examined, the specific components responsible for growth were not entirely understood. Here we describe the optimization of amino acids, metals, and sodium chloride for H. pylori. Iron, zinc, and magnesium were critical for growth; copper was not required. Optimization of sodium chloride was further beneficial. Nutritional requirements and antibiotic resistance patterns of several other Helicobacter spp. revealed that all except H. felis grew in serum-free, unsupplemented F-12. All Helicobacter spp. were resistant to at least six antimicrobial agents when cultured in the presence of serum. However, in the absence of serum, H. pylori, H. mustelae, and H. muridarum became sensitive to polymyxin B and/or trimethoprim. Much of the data were obtained using a convenient ATP assay to quantify growth. H. pylori has surprisingly few absolute requirements for growth: 9 amino acids, sodium and potassium chloride, thiamine, iron, zinc, magnesium, hypoxanthine, and pyruvate. These data suggest that H. pylori and other Helicobacter spp. are not as fastidious as previously thought. The data also suggest that chemically defined media described herein could yield the growth of a wide range of Helicobacter spp., allowing a more detailed characterization of Helicobacter physiology and interactions with host cells.

### A prospective study of protein excretion using short-interval timed urine collections in patients with lupus nephritis [^4a502346]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

The 24-h urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is the gold standard in evaluating proteinuria in lupus nephritis; however, the urine collection is inconvenient to the patient. Random spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratios, although convenient, have poor agreement with the 24-h ratios in these patients. Here, we sought to define a timed collection interval providing accurate and precise data and patient convenience. Urine from 41 patients, in 2 medical centers, with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis was collected at 6-h intervals for 24 h. The protein-to-creatinine ratio of each short collection was then compared with that of a 24-h collection made by combining the 6-h samples. A first morning void and spot urine samples were collected before and after the 24-h collection, respectively. There was significant diurnal variation with peak proteinuria at 6–12 h and nadir at 18–24 h. Each 6-h collection showed excellent correlation and concordance with the 24-h protein-to-creatinine ratio, but the 12-24-h interval had the best agreement. In contrast to the random spot urines, the first morning void also had excellent correlation and concordance, but underestimated the 24-h protein-to-creatinine ratio. Our study shows that a 12-h overnight urine collection is the best surrogate, with excellent agreement with the 24-h protein-to-creatinine ratio, and it is convenient for patients. There was little variability between centers, an important feature for clinical trials.

### Are the view of Helicobacter pylori colonized in the oral cavity an illusion? [^3c3c18b5]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

What is the best test for detecting H. pylori of the oral cavity in clinical settings?

PCR is a method often used for detecting oral H. pylori, but its results have high variation. Some articles report the detecting rate were zero, but some articles report with 90% of positive response on the oral sample. Naturally, the scientific community very confused on the large variation of PCR testing results. We should find out why such discrepancies exist. In term of the requirement of the sample, expensive equipment required and technician for operating PCR testing. So PCR method is not a good and convenient way to detecting oral H. pylori for clinical settings. Therefore, a diagnostic method has a high sensitivity and specificity for oral sample should be established. We believe that HPS is a good and convenient test for diagnosis of H. pylori in the oral cavity. As long as we have an easy, accrue test, then the clinical trial can be carried out on a large number of patients to obtain a good size of clinical data, which will help to understand the strong links between oral and stomach H. pylori infection. We are able to establish the principles of evidence regarding oral H. pylori infection.

HPS is a lateral flow immunochromatographic test device that uses saliva as testing sample detecting oral H. pylori within few minutes. The principle of HPS is based on monoclonal antibody react with oral urease produced by H. pylori.

A laboratory study was conducted to determine its specificity. The following common bacteria of oral cavity were applied: Streptococcus gordonii, S. mutans (major pathogen of dental caries), S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and Veillonella parvula, Porphyromonas gingivalis (major pathogen of periodontitis), Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Campylobacter rectus (major pathogen of periodontitis, species related to Helicobacter), Corynebacterium matruchotii, Bifidobacterium dentium, Actinomyces naeslundii, A. odontolyticus. All the above bacteria did not show interference or cross-reactivity with HPS test.

The sensitivity of the tests was 10 ng mL⁻¹ H. pylori antigen.

### Effect of sample time on urinary lithogenic risk indexes in healthy and stone-forming adults and children [^6b7c20e2]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Use of the Ca/Cit ratio to assess the risk of renal lithiasis is widespread in the literature and in clinical practice. Calculation of AP indexes allows integration of information on additional components of urine, as well as urine volume. Regarding cut-off points for the different indexes, the overlap of index values in the healthy and stone-forming groups means it is difficult to establish precise values to discriminate subjects with and without risk. Despite this, we believe these indexes provide relevant information, because higher index values indicate higher risk of crystallization in urine.

Some researchers have recommended that supersaturation be assessed in 24-h urine samples before treatment, 4–6 weeks afterwards, and in subsequent follow-ups. However, collection of urine over 24 h can be cumbersome, so a simpler sampling method would be more convenient for patients. Our results show that the AP(CaOx) and Ca/Cit in 12-h overnight urine samples were significantly different in stone-forming and healthy individuals. Moreover, the overnight samples had higher values for both risk indexes than the 12-h daytime samples and the 24-h samples. These findings support previous evidence that averaging results from the whole day masks peaks of lithogenic risk that occur at nighttime. Therefore, the analysis of a 12-h overnight sample is more convenient for patients and appears to be more sensitive in detection of increased risk of crystallization of urine. Considering that the night is a period of high urinary crystallization risk, the advice of increasing fluid intake at the late evening should be strongly encouraged in order to decrease urinary supersaturation degree.

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^8e0d4736]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency department analgesia — ketorolac versus acetaminophen-codeine randomized controlled trial (RCT) enrolled a convenience sample of 122 at 6 EDs, with patients receiving either ketorolac 10 mg orally or acetaminophen-codeine 600mg acetaminophen, 60mg codeine; subjects were evaluated at 30 and 60 min and then hourly until 6 h, study medication was given every 4 to 6 h, and pain and functional capacity were assessed for up to 7 days with telephone follow-up on day 3 or 4 and final in-person assessment at 7 to 9 days; calculated sample size was n = 70 per group to discern a 20% difference. Ketorolac patients completed diaries for 4.4 days versus 5.2 days for acetaminophen-codeine; after day 1, 24% versus 31% reported "a lot" or "complete" relief of pain, and time to peak relief was 2.6 days for both groups. Adverse events occurred in 21 of 62 (34%) ketorolac patients and 38 of 59 (64%) acetaminophen-codeine patients, and neither agent was superior in terms of analgesic efficacy. Limitations included convenience sampling, target sample size not reached, no adjustment for within-subject correlations repeated-measures outcomes, and no intention-to-treat analysis.

### Estimation of 24-h sodium excretion from a spot urine sample using chloride and creatinine dipsticks [^71b69cbc]. American Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Despite its clinical relevance, sodium intake is seldom monitored by physicians, largely because of shortcomings of the 24-h urine collection for sodium excretion. In a prior study, sodium excretion was shown to be accurately estimated from a late afternoon/early evening spot urine sodium/creatinine ratio, adjusted for 24-h creatinine excretion. In this study, we assessed a more convenient and inexpensive method, using chloride and creatinine dipsticks.

Methods

Subjects submitted 24-h urine collections along with an "AM sample", collected at the beginning, a "PM sample" collected in the late afternoon/early evening before dinner, at roughly the midpoint, and a "random sample", collected after completion, of the 24-h collection. Predicted 24-h sodium excretion was then determined from the spot urine dipstick chloride/creatinine ratio, measured by two independent observers, and from the spot urine laboratory sodium/creatinine ratio. Both ratios were adjusted for 24-h creatinine excretion.

Results

For PM samples, predicted sodium excretion correlated strongly with actual 24-h sodium excretion, both for the dipstick method (r = 0.71; observer 1 and r = 0.65; observer 2; both P < 0.001), and the laboratory method (r = 0.86, P < 0.001). PM samples also differentiated subjects with sodium excretion < 100 mEq/day vs. ≥ 100 mEq/day (sensitivity and specificity: dipstick method: 83 and 82%, respectively for observer 1, 89 and 77%, respectively, for observer 2; laboratory method: 100 and 82%, respectively). AM samples and random samples correlated less strongly.

Conclusion

The dipstick method appears promising as a convenient and inexpensive means to serially assess sodium excretion.

### Prevalence of age-related macular degeneration in iran and its projections through 2050: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9f6d6ad2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

The following data were extracted from each included study: the first author, year of publication, study design, sampling method, study location (province/city), sample size, mean age and age group of the participants, male to female (M/F) ratio, the severity of vision impairment and the vision assessment method (best corrected visual acuity [BCVA] or presenting visual acuity [PVA]). Studies with random, stratified, and systematic sampling were categorized as random sampling, while studies with convenience, quota, judgment, and snowball sampling were classified as non-probability sampling. In Shirzadi et al. study, nearly 88% of the participants had vision impairment, which is much higher than the prevalence of visual impairment in Iran (5.57%). The sample of this study was much more representative of a visually impaired population than a general population. The human development index (HDI) of the study location was retrieved from the Subnational Human Development Index (4.0). HDI of the study location was categorized into 5 groups, very high, high, medium, low, and very low. As the HDI of some locations and cities were not provided on the mentioned website, we also consulted an experienced epidemiologist for better determination of the HDI categories of the cities. The number of AMD patients among males, females, visually impaired candidates, and all participants was extracted to calculate the prevalence of AMD. Finally, we used the data provided by United Nations Population Division (UNPD) to import the age-specific population of Iran from 1990 to 2020 in 5-year intervals for each 10-year age group (40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, > 80). Similarly, we obtained the estimated age-specific population of Iran for each of these 10-year age groups from 2020 to 2050. Data extraction of the included studies was accomplished by two independent reviewers (A.R. and R.R.) and disagreements were discussed with a third author (H.M.V.).

### Depression and anxiety in older adults: a comparison between online convenience and conventional representative sampling [^7f72f711]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Depression and anxiety are among the most common mental health issues of older populations, and as such they are frequently monitored covariates. The possibilities for collecting research data has grown with the recent emergence of user-friendly online survey platforms. However, to what extent the populations of older persons who participate in such research are similar to the general population remains unclear. We investigated the affective health of an open online sample of older adults (65+) in contrast to a representative randomised in-person interview sample. Methods: The surveys were conducted in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic after the second wave of anti-COVID-19 vaccination. The online sample (N = 389) was recruited via the Internet. Participants of the in-person study (N = 633) were randomly approached according to quotas for representativeness. The administered questionnaires included a health status self-report, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory - Short form (GAI-SF). Results: Online participants reported better mental and general health; that is, they reported fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms than the randomised representative sample. In both samples, women showed higher levels of anxiety than men. Subjective general health was associated with mental health. In the randomised representative sample, in contrast to the online sample, the level of depression increased significantly with age. The open non-randomised calls for participants attracted a higher percentage of women and people with higher education than are in the general older population. Conclusions: Older research volunteers recruited online can be expected to be subjectively healthier and to differ largely from the general population in their sociodemographic characteristics.

### Role of exhaled hydrogen sulfide in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer [^d479730c]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is often accompanied by increased excretion of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). This study aimed to explore the value of exhaled H 2 S in the diagnosis of CRC.

Methods

A total of 80 people with normal colonoscopy results and 57 patients with CRC were enrolled into the present observational cohort study. Exhaled oral and nasal H 2 S were detected by Nanocoulomb breath analyser. Results were compared between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analysed and area under the curves (AUCs) were calculated to assess the diagnostic value of exhaled H 2 S. Meanwhile, the clinicopathological features, including gender, lesion location and tumour staging of patients with CRC, were also collected and analysed.

Results

The amount of exhaled H 2 S from patients with CRC was significantly higher than that of those with normal colonoscopy results. The ROC curve showed an AUC value of 0.73 and 0.71 based on oral and nasal H 2 S detection, respectively. The exhaled H 2 S in patients with CRC was correlated with gender, lesion location and tumour progression, including depth of invasion, lymphatic metastasis and TNM (Tumor, Lymph Nodes, Metastasis) staging.

Conclusion

Exhaled H 2 S analysis is a convenient and non-invasive detection method for diagnosing CRC, suggesting a potential role in population screening for CRC.

### Convenience samples and caregiving research: how generalizable are the findings? [^8cb7392b]. The Gerontologist (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

We contrast characteristics of respondents recruited using convenience strategies with those of respondents recruited by random digit dial (RDD) methods. We compare sample variances, means, and interrelationships among variables generated from the convenience and RDD samples.

Design and Methods

Women aged 50 to 64 who work full time and provide care to a community-dwelling older person were recruited using either RDD (N = 55) or convenience methods (N = 87). Telephone interviews were conducted using reliable, valid measures of demographics, characteristics of the care recipient, help provided to the care recipient, evaluations of caregiver-care recipient relationship, and outcomes common to caregiving research.

Results

Convenience and RDD samples had similar variances on 68.4% of the examined variables. We found significant mean differences for 63% of the variables examined. Bivariate correlations suggest that one would reach different conclusions using the convenience and RDD sample data sets.

Implications

Researchers should use convenience samples cautiously, as they may have limited generalizability.

### Measurement invariance of brief forms of the schizotypal personality questionnaire across convenience versus random samples [^eb439ff1]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Schizotypy, a multifaceted personality construct that represents liability for schizophrenia, is generally measured with self-report questionnaires that have been developed and validated in samples of undergraduate students. Given that understanding schizotypy in non-clinical samples is essential for furthering our understanding of schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathologies, it is critical to test whether non-clinically identified undergraduate and other convenience samples respond to schizotypy scales in the same way as random samples of the general population. Here, 651 undergraduates, 350 MTurk workers, and two randomly selected high school samples (n = 177, n = 551) completed brief versions of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ-BR or SPQ-BRU). Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was used to test whether measurement invariance was present across samples. Tests were made for all samples together and for each pair of samples. Results showed that a first-order nine-factor model fit the data well, and this factor structure displayed configural and metric invariance across the four samples. This suggests that schizotypy has the same factor structure, and the SPQ-BR/BRU is measuring the same construct across the different groups. However, when all groups were compared, results indicated a lack of scalar invariance across these samples, suggesting mean comparisons may be inappropriate across different sample types. However, when randomly selected high school students were compared with undergraduate students, scalar invariance was present. This suggests that factors such as culture and form type may be driving invariance, rather than sampling method (convenience vs general population).

### Validity of rapid urease test using swab of gastric mucus to mucosal forceps and 13 C-urease breath test: a multicenter prospective observational study [^394d72ad]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, Swab-RUT has a good accuracy rate for H. pylori infection with high safety. Since Swab-RUT is a convenient, universal, safe, and inexpensive method, it is suitable for screening for H. pylori infection during EGD. Swab-RUT could be a reliable option to Forceps-RUT, when biopsy samples are not available or not preferred.

### Developing a new pragmatic tool for assessing contextual fit and feasibility of evidence-based interventions towards effective implementation in global health [^6156612c]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Second is the problem of a lack of consensus on the minimum acceptable number of implementation outcomes and their constructs that need to be evaluated to adequately inform policy decisions about an EBI in each implementation stage. For instance, concerning the preimplementation phase of any EBI implementation, the selection of implementation outcomes (eg, contextual fit, feasibility) and their respective constructs (eg, preference, acceptability, resource availability) measured are largely subjective depending on the choice, convenience or competency of the researchers or policy makers involved in the EBI implementation. Thus, leading to the assessment of many implementation outcomes and constructs at the expense of the other, which may jeopardise the accuracy of the research conclusions about the contextual fit or feasibility of such EBI. This inadequacy can further contribute to the complexity of EBI implementation by limiting the ability of policy makers and relevant stakeholders to make holistic and meaningful interpretations for effective decision-making in translating evidence into practice.

### Equivalence of afternoon spot and 24-h urinary hydration biomarkers in free-living healthy adults [^cacff744]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

U Osm and U SG in spot urine samples obtained in the afternoon and early evening (1401–2000 hours) were equivalent to corresponding 24-h values in free-living healthy young adults and may therefore represent a convenient alternative to 24-h urine samples to monitor daily hydration in real-life conditions. In particular, U SG measured in afternoon spot samples appears to be a practical, inexpensive and a simple tool to monitor daily hydration.

### Monitoring population sodium intake using spot urine samples: validation in a New Zealand population [^2969df74]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Although 24-h urine collection is widely considered the 'gold standard' for estimation of population sodium intake, spot urine collection is increasingly used as a convenient and affordable alternative. We used four published formulae to convert spot urine sodium into estimates of 24-h sodium excretion in order to establish which (if any) formula would be suitable for use in the New Zealand population. A convenience sample of 101 healthy volunteers provided two spot urine samples and a 24-h urine collection. Two formulae (one proposed by the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) and one derived from INTERSALT data) were most accurate, and provided estimates of key population indicators (mean, range and proportion above nutrient reference values) that were close to those of the measured 24-h urine excretion. Estimates using these formula were in closer agreement with 24-h excretion than the other formulae estimates using the Bland-Altman method. We conclude that spot urine sampling is a suitable alternative to 24-h urine collection in population surveys when spot urine sodium results are converted into estimates of 24-h sodium excretion using either the PAHO or INTERSALT formulae. However spot urine is a poor predictor of 24-h urinary sodium excretion for individual assessment.

### Comparison of posttherapy 4-and 24-hour [Lu] Lu-PSMA SPECT / CT and pretherapy PSMA PET / CT in assessment of disease in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^34f64333]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

[177 Lu]Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an effective treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA SPECT/CT 24h after injection has shown potential as a response biomarker for [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy but is not convenient for patients. This study investigated 4-h [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA SPECT/CT as an alternative to 24-h [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA SPECT/CT for evaluation of treatment response. Methods: This prospective analysis enrolled 23 patients diagnosed with mCRPC commencing [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T therapy. Two patients were excluded because of incomplete imaging data. Posttherapy SPECT/CT was performed at 4 and 24h after the first dose and 4h after the second dose. Baseline [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 4- and 24-h [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA SPECT/CT were analyzed both visually and semiquantitatively. Bland-Altman plots assessed agreement of semiquantitative parameters from the 4- and 24-h scans. Quantitative assessment of the change in the total tumor volume (TTV) on the 4-h [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA SPECT/CT after the first and second doses was correlated to patient outcomes. Results: All patients had mCRPC previously treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor, and 11 (52%) received prior taxane chemotherapy. Median age was 78y, and median prostate-specific antigen level was 54ng/mL. On visual analysis, disease distribution was unchanged among the 3 imaging methods. Eleven patients (52%) had a median of 1 lesion not identified on 4-h [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA SPECT/CT compared with 24-h [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA SPECT/CT. All missed lesions on the 4-h [177 Lu]Lu SPECT/CT were smaller than 2 cm. Mean differences and agreement between 4- and 24-h SPECT/CT quantitative parameters were within acceptable bounds for lesion number, SUV max, and SUV mean, with higher variation observed for TTV. The change in TTV between dose 1 and 2 [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA SPECT/CT predicted prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival. Conclusion: [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA SPECT/CT at 4h after injection appears a promising alternative to 24-h [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA SPECT/CT for treatment response assessment, with improved patient convenience.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^53727d4a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Emergency department (ED) seizures — serum level attainment and seizure control with fosphenytoin, phenytoin, and benzodiazepines are detailed across observational cohorts and a randomized trial. In a meta-analysis of fosphenytoin, 108 patients received IV and 101 received IM (> 15 mg/kg), and therapeutic levels were achieved within 10 min of rapid IV loading and within 30 min of slow IV or IM loading. In a convenience sample dosed 15–18 mg/kg, 159 doses to 139 patients included 28 (100%) of 28 with an undetectable level achieving a therapeutic level after infusion. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of status epilepticus among 78 adult ED or ICU patients, 85% versus 76% of seizures were controlled with lorazepam versus diazepam (P, NS), with adverse events in 13% and 12%, respectively. With phenytoin loading, at 12 h after the loading doses 9 (64%) of 14 patients had a therapeutic level and 9 (90%) of 10 had cessation of status epilepticus with a phenytoin level > 10 mg/L within 30 min. With oral loading, 44 patients were studied; 94% had a seizure within 24 h of presentation, loading used 18-mg/kg capsules or suspension, 20 (48%) of 41 had a therapeutic level at 3–5 h and 21 (55%) of 38 at 6–10 h, with no seizure recurrence in any patient > 8 h postingestion observation period. In a retrospective series, 20 patients received 15.4–22.8 mg/kg in 2–4 divided doses over 6–12 h, and 16 (80%) of 20 had a documented serum level > 10 mg/L at a mean of 10.75 h after the last dose.

### Assessing representativeness of sampling methods for reaching men who have sex with men: a direct comparison of results obtained from convenience and probability samples [^7d89b67c]. AIDS and Behavior (2007). Low credibility.

Convenience samples are used to determine HIV-related behaviors among men who have sex with men (MSM) without measuring the extent to which the results are representative of the broader MSM population. We compared results from a cross-sectional survey of MSM recruited from gay bars between June and October 2001 to a random digit dial telephone survey conducted between June 2002 and January 2003. The men in the probability sample were older, better educated, and had higher incomes than men in the convenience sample, the convenience sample enrolled more employed men and men of color. Substance use around the time of sex was higher in the convenience sample but other sexual behaviors were similar. HIV testing was common among men in both samples. Periodic validation, through comparison of data collected by different sampling methods, may be useful when relying on survey data for program and policy development.

### Comparative clinical evaluation of neoPlex RB-8 with seeplex pneumoBacter ACE for simultaneous detection of eight respiratory bacterial pathogens [^8bc4f20e]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several convenient and accurate molecular assays to detect respiratory bacterial infection. The NeoPlex RB-8 detection kit (NeoPlex RB-8) is a new multiplex real-time PCR assay that simultaneously detects Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Moraxella catarrhalis in a single test. This study compared the clinical concordance of NeoPlex RB-8 with another method, Seeplex PneumoBacter ACE detection assay (Seeplex PB ACE), which simultaneously detects S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, H. influenzae, and B. pertussis We tested 2,137 nasopharyngeal swab and sputum specimens using both assays. For discordant Bordetella parapertussis and M. catarrhalis specimens, we also performed bidirectional sequencing. For S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, H. influenzae, and B. pertussis, which are detected by both NeoPlex RB-8 and Seeplex PB ACE, the positive and negative agreement between the two assays ranged from 91.7 to 100% (κ = 0.918 to 1). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were the most discordant targets and measured with higher sensitivity and specificity by NeoPlex RB-8 than Seeplex PB ACE. For Bordetella parapertussis and M. catarrhalis, which are not detected by Seeplex PB ACE, NeoPlex RB-8 sensitivity and specificity were > 99%. Overall, NeoPlex RB-8 was highly comparable to Seeplex PB ACE, but NeoPlex RB-8 was more clinically accurate, with higher throughput and more convenience.

### Screening for gestational diabetes; past, present and future [^1cbbedd9]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes is carbohydrate intolerance, with onset or first recognition of hyperglycaemia during pregnancy. Several studies have suggested that gestational hyperglycaemia is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, promoting the case for screening. Conversely, others argue that screening for gestational diabetes may colour the clinical judgement, influencing further management, e.g. more 'unjustified' caesarean sections. Additionally, the lack of definitive data either on a clear-cut glycaemic threshold for the development of adverse outcomes or on the impact of intervention is emphasized by opponents of screening. This review attempts to evaluate the available data on screening for gestational diabetes. Oral glucose tolerance test is promoted on the basis that the diabetogenic stress of pregnancy is encountered during late gestation and is best recognized in the fed state. There are different tests, including the 1 h/50-g, 2 h/75-g and 3 h/100-g tests, with practical limitations, including the time and cost involved and the unpleasant supra-physiological glucose load that is unrelated to body weight, and issues of reproducibility and sensitivity/specificity profiles. Despite its convenience, the poor sensitivity of random glucose has precluded its routine use for screening. Fasting glucose appears to be promising but further testing is required to ensure satisfactory sensitivity/specificity in different populations. Despite its limitations, the oral glucose tolerance test has become established as the 'most acceptable' diagnostic test for gestational diabetes. More convenient methods, e.g. fasting or random or post-load glucose, have to be validated therefore against the oral glucose tolerance test to gain acceptance for routine screening.

### Association between regular arrangement of collecting venules and Helicobacter pylori status in routine endoscopy [^2bcdfd83]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study had several limitations: Firstly, our study only explored the relationship between RAC and H. Pylori infection in gastric corpus mucosa, and H. pylori status of gastric antrum mucosa was not evaluated. Therefore, H. Pylori status of gastric corpus cannot be represented the entire stomach. Secondly, histological detection of H. pylori can reduce the accuracy because of patchy distribution of the bacteria. Combination of multiple methods was helpful to more accurate detection of H. Pylori such as urea breath test, serological examination, PCR and culturing. However, PCR and H. pylori culturing was not convenient in daily clinical practice. In addition, urea breath test and serological examination cannot distinguish the patients in which the gastric body was only affected, and not be performed in the present study. Thirdly, RAC accuracy may be affected by patient age. We did not conduct age stratification analysis due to the limited sample size. Lastly, this was a single-center study, with a limited number of cases and a short time span. In future, more patients can be included to analyze different detective methods of H. pylori and different patient subgroups to strengthen our results.

### Time-dependent effect of nitrate-rich meals on exhaled nitric oxide in healthy subjects [^8f68615a]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) is a convenient noninvasive marker for airway inflammation in several pulmonary diseases. However, external factors such as nitrate-rich nutrition can affect the levels of eNO and thus compromise its diagnostic value.

Study Objectives

The objective of this investigation was to have a better understanding of the time-dependent effect of nitrate-rich meals on eNO in healthy subjects.

Study Design

Forty-two healthy, nonsmoking volunteers (age range, 25 to 62 years) were recruited for the study. They had no recent respiratory tract infections and were free of pulmonary history, rhinitis, and atopic disorders. eNO was measured before, and 0.5, 2, 4, 12, 15, and 20 h after the intake of a nitrate-rich meal equivalent to 230 mg of nitrate.

Results

The intake of a nitrate-rich meal increased eNO by 60% 2 h after the meal. Even after 15 h, the mean eNO value was still 22% higher than the baseline value. Only after 20 h did eNO return to the normal baseline level.

Conclusion

This finding stresses the importance of advising patients to avoid nitrate-rich nutrition at least 20 h before a scheduled measurement of eNO.

### Use of a combination of brushing technique and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method as a novel, rapid, and safe system for detection of Helicobacter pylori [^3827469a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Gastric mucosal biopsy is widely used in the detection of Helicobacter pylori but is associated with a number of problems, including false-negative results due to sampling error and massive bleeding after biopsy. Given the extended period required to culture H. pylori, detection would be further improved by the use of rapid detection methods such as PCR. Here, we developed a rapid, safe, and convenient method for collecting H. pylori which combines endoscopic brushing with the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method. The specificity and sensitivity of LAMP were examined using nine urease-generating non-H. pylori bacterial species, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter hepaticus, and 51 H. pylori strains. Results showed that H. pylori-specific LAMP primers amplified H. pylori DNA only and that the lowest detection limit of the LAMP reaction was 10² CFU. Brushing and biopsy samples taken from 200 patients with peptic ulcer at Nagoya University Hospital and a regional health care center were subjected to both LAMP and culturing. No adverse effects such as severe bleeding or penetration occurred during the procedure. By LAMP assay, 123 patients were confirmed as H. pylori positive when brushing technique samples were assayed, whereas only 100 were positive when biopsy samples were assayed. Culture assay detected H. pylori in 117 patients when it was combined with the brushing technique and in 96 when it was combined with biopsy. Combination of the endoscopic brushing technique with LAMP is considered a useful and safe system for identifying H. pylori infection.

### Telemedicine and other care models in pediatric rheumatology: an exploratory study of parents' perceptions of barriers to care and care preferences [^6c4ad948]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Pairwise comparison revealed a statistically significant difference in arranging care for other children, with families whose child was less than six years old reporting a higher score (median 1.50, IQR 0.00–6.00) compared to families whose child was 13 years or older (0.00, 0.00–0.50; p = 0.016). Those with non-private insurance scored travel time/distance as a greater barrier than those with private insurance (median 3.75, IQR 0.75–5.50 vs 2.00, 0.50–5.00; p = 0.0398). Other pairwise comparisons between barrier scoring and patient factors (age, insurance, ethnicity, and diagnosis) revealed no significant differences.

Those who indicated travel as inconvenient vs convenient reported significantly greater difficulty with several barriers: travel time/distance (median 5.00, IQR 2.50–6.00 vs 1.00, 0.00–2.50; p < 0.0001), need for lodging/housing (0.25, 0.00–4.00 vs 0.00, 0.00–0.50; p = 0.0047), driving in the metropolitan (2.75, 0.00–5.00 vs 0.00, 0.00–1.00; p < 0.0001), indirect costs (2.50, 0.00–5.00 vs 0.00, 0.00–1.00; p < 0.0001), parent missing work (3.00, 1.00–6.00 vs 1.00, 0.00–3.00; p < 0.0001), child missing school (4.00, 1.25–6.25 vs 2.00, 0.50–3.50; p = 0.0008), and arranging care for other children (0.25, 0.00–5.00 vs 0.00, 0.00–0.50; p = 0.0219). The overall distribution of travel times was different depending on whether care was perceived as inconvenient vs convenient (p < 0.0001). For those reporting travel as convenient, 71% traveled an hour or less, 17% traveled more than an hour to 3 h or less, 10% traveled more than 3 h to 6 h or less, and 1% traveled more than 6 h. For those reporting travel as inconvenient, 18% traveled an hour or less, 34% more than an hour to 3 h or less, 37% more than 3 h to 6 h or less, and 11% more than 6 h.

### Factors influencing the intention of Indonesian nursing students to work in rural areas [^bdea1543]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

The study used a cross-sectional approach. The participants were nursing students at a public nursing school in urban Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. The study site was selected conveniently with consideration that it was one of a few nursing schools in Indonesia which still provided both regular and transfer programmes. The total population was 927 students from four different programmes, namely undergraduate regular, undergraduate transfer, profession regular and profession transfer (table 1). The participants were selected using simple random sampling with the randomisation performed viaAll of the students were included in the randomisation process except for those who were on academic leave. The sample size was determined using the statistical G power test which required at least 714 samples. All of the recruitment and data collection processes were conducted in December 2017.

Table 1
Description of the class programmes in Indonesia

Data collection

The data were collected using a self-developed questionnaire consisting of 13 questions based on the literature review. The questions were divided into three groups (personal factors, environmental factors and policy factor), with an intention question with 'yes' or 'no' answers. The personal factor items included (A) sex, (B) age and (C) current education programme. The environmental factor items consisted of (D) childhood residence, (E) place of origin, (F) parent's income based on regional minimum wages in each respondent's hometown, (G) father's and (H) mother's occupation, (I) father's and (J) mother's education, and (K) working experience. The policy factors were assessed through (L) knowledge on Nusantara Sehat — a team-based assignment from the Indonesian government to remote areas for young health professionals. Five questions were dichotomy or binary questions with two possible answers (A, D, E, K and L). Seven items were close-ended questions with multiple-choice answers (B, C, F, G, H, I and J) and there was one intention question with a dichotomous answer. We tested the instrument among nursing students to reduce the bias of the instrument. The instrument was deployed among 10 students to fill out and to give feedback to the researchers.

### Neonatal umbilical arterial catheter removal is accompanied by a marked decline in phlebotomy blood loss [^c27c384d]. Neonatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical arterial catheters (UACs) are frequently used in critically ill neonates. UAC are convenient, reliable, and allow for caregiver convenience in performing painless arterial blood sampling. We hypothesized that UAC removal in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates will result in significantly less phlebotomy blood loss (PBL) after correcting for severity of illness.

Study Design and Methods

PBL was measured at a single center in 99 ELBW infants who survived to day 28. Individual infant's paired daily PBL for the two 24-h periods before and after UAC removal were compared using the paired t test. Daily PBL up to 7 days before and 7 days after UAC removal were compared using a logistic regression with mixed model analysis for repeated measures. Cumulative 28-day phlebotomy loss was evaluated by multiple linear regression analysis.

Results

PBL 24 h before and after UAC removal were 1.7 mL (95% CI 1.5–1.9) and 0.9 mL (95% CI 0.8–1.0; p < 0.0001), respectively. Cumulative 28-day PBL increased by 2.2 mL (± 0.7) per day that a UAC was present with or without correction for severity of illness (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

UAC removal is independently associated with a marked decline in PBL. We speculate the ease and convenience of UAC blood sampling lead to more frequent blood testing and greater PBL.

### Scalable watermarking for identifying large language model outputs [^9ade55d4]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Repeated context masking

To generate a full response, we could simply apply Algorithm 2 on every decoding step, using the sliding-window random seed generator ('Random seed generator' section) to generate the random seed r t for each step. However, it is possible that the same window of context, and thus the same random seed might occur more than once (particularly if the sliding-window size H is small or the response is long). It has been shown that in this scenario, the watermark can introduce a repeated bias that affects the quality of the text, for example, causing repeating loops. One way to avoid this problem is to apply repeated context masking, which prevents the watermark from being applied on step t if the context window (x t − H, …, x t −1) has been used to watermark previously.

We present the method in Algorithm 3, which we call K -sequence repeated context masking. The integer parameter K ≥ 1 controls for how long context windows are held in the history. In the simplest case of K = 1, we only hold the context history for the duration of generating a single response. For larger integers K > 1, we check against a history of contexts used in the last K responses. In the extreme case, we could set K = ∞ and retain the context history indefinitely. In Supplementary Information section G.2, we show that applying K -sequence repeated context masking achieves K -sequence non-distortion, an important property for quality preservation. In Supplementary Information section G.3, we discuss the trade-offs of smaller and larger K. For most of our experiments we use K = 1.

### Ultrafast water sensing and thermal imaging by a metal-organic framework with switchable luminescence [^56cbdfb2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Here we report assembly of a Zn-MOF (LIFM-CL1) as a unique water sensor from a purposely designed H 2 hpi2cf ligand with dual-emission behaviour originated in excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). The as-prepared hydrated LIFM-CL1-H 2 O [Zn(hpi2cf)(DMF)(H 2 O), DMF = N, N -dimethylformamide, H 2 hpi2cf = 5-(2-(5-fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1 H -imidazol-1-yl)isophthalic acid] features amphipathic microporosity (< 3 Å) with surprisingly facile and reversible removal/uptake of coordinating water molecules under mild conditions (dry gas blowing or gentle heating), giving rise to the dehydrated form LIFM-CL1 [Zn(hpi2cf)(DMF)] via a single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SC–SC) transformation (LIFM-CL1-H 2 O↔LIFM-CL1+H 2 O) and simultaneously ESIPT-related two-colour luminescence switching. This swift water-driven structural transformation and PL-switching property makes the present Zn-MOF one of the most powerful water sensors known so far owing to its hypersensitive response towards water molecules on a molecular level, showing the following characteristics: the fastest PL responsiveness on the order of seconds, solely water interaction, easy stimulation and nondestructive regeneration, convenient material utilization from either hydrated or dehydrated forms, and multiply detection ways including emission wavelength, intensity or Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate. Therefore, ultrafast and highly sensitive real-time and on-site detection of a trace of water (< 0.05% v/v) in various organic solvents and gas humidity (relative humidity (RH) < 1%) is achievable. Furthermore, this microporous Zn-MOF can be fabricated into paper-based or in situ ZnO precursor-supported hybrid films for convenient water sensing and thermal imaging for practical purposes.

### Systematic review of the use of online questionnaires of older adults [^5b42a8f7]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe methodological approaches to population targeting and sampling and to summarize limitations of Internet-based questionnaires in older adults.

Design

Systematic literature review.

Setting

Studies using online questionnaires in older adult populations.

Participants

English-language articles using search terms for geriatric, age 65 and over, Internet survey, online survey, Internet questionnaire, and online questionnaire in PubMed and EBSCO host between 1984 and July 2012. Inclusion criteria were study population mean age 65 and older and use of an online questionnaire for research. Review of 336 abstracts yielded 14 articles for full review by two investigators; 11 articles met inclusion criteria.

Measurements

Articles were extracted for study design and setting, participant characteristics, recruitment strategy, country, and study limitations.

Results

Eleven articles were published after 2001. Studies had populations with a mean age of 65 to 78, included descriptive and analytical designs, and were conducted in the United States, Australia, and Japan. Recruiting methods varied widely from paper fliers and personal e-mails to use of consumer marketing panels. Investigator-reported study limitations included the use of small convenience samples and limited generalizability.

Conclusion

Online questionnaires are a feasible method of surveying older adults in some geographic regions and for some subsets of older adults, but limited Internet access constrains recruiting methods and often limits study generalizability.

### Methods for identifying health research gaps, needs, and priorities: a scoping review [^ab75beb7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Well-defined, systematic, and transparent processes to identify health research gaps, needs, and priorities are vital to ensuring that available funds target areas with the greatest potential for impact.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to characterize methods conducted or supported by research funding organizations to identify health research gaps, needs, or priorities.

Method

We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Web of Science up to September 2019. Eligible studies reported on methods to identify health research gaps, needs, and priorities that had been conducted or supported by research funding organizations. Using a published protocol, we extracted data on the method, criteria, involvement of stakeholders, evaluations, and whether the method had been replicated (i.e., used in other studies).

Results

Among 10,832 citations, 167 studies were eligible for full data extraction. More than half of the studies employed methods to identify both needs and priorities, whereas about a quarter of studies focused singularly on identifying gaps (7%), needs (6%), or priorities (14%) only. The most frequently used methods were the convening of workshops or meetings (37%), quantitative methods (32%), and the James Lind Alliance approach, a multi-stakeholder research needs and priority setting process (28%). The most widely applied criteria were importance to stakeholders (72%), potential value (29%), and feasibility (18%). Stakeholder involvement was most prominent among clinicians (69%), researchers (66%), and patients and the public (59%). Stakeholders were identified through stakeholder organizations (51%) and purposive (26%) and convenience sampling (11%). Only 4% of studies evaluated the effectiveness of the methods and 37% employed methods that were reproducible and used in other studies.

Discussion

To ensure optimal targeting of funds to meet the greatest areas of need and maximize outcomes, a much more robust evidence base is needed to ascertain the effectiveness of methods used to identify research gaps, needs, and priorities.

### Development and validation of assistance needs assessment scale of the home-dwelling older adults [^b9ba7a5e]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Method

This study adhered to the established principles and methodologies for scale development, combining literature review, qualitative research, and expert consultation. By employing a qualitative descriptive design, the study aimed to minimize researcher bias, allowing findings to emerge directly from the data. An initial item pool was created based on the literature review and qualitative research findings. Subsequently, expert consultations were conducted to formulate a preliminary version of the Home-Dwelling Older Adults Assistance Needs Assessment Scale. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using convenience sampling in four communities across four cities in central China (Wuhan, Ezhou, Zhengzhou, and Xinxiang). The selection of these sites was guided by several considerations, including their alignment with national development strategies for the central region, geographic accessibility, feasibility of collaboration with local institutions, and the research team's established connections with community organizations. Based on the data collected, the scale was further refined and finalized through item screening as well as reliability and validity analyses. Participant Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria were: (1) aged 60 years or older; (2) currently residing in an urban community in China and having lived there for more than one year; (3) informed of the research purpose and voluntarily participating. Exclusion criteria: individuals with communication barriers.

Stage 1: item pool generation

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using keywords such as "older adult", "home-dwelling", "community-dwelling", "assistance", "need", "questionnaire", and "scale" across multiple databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, Scopus, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP). This search informed the development of the qualitative interview guide and the questionnaire item pool.

A descriptive qualitative research design was employed. Purposive sampling (including criterion-based and maximum variation sampling) was used to recruit home-dwelling older adults from two geographically distant communities in Wuhan, China. Maximum variation sampling ensured representation of older adults with diverse life difficulties (e.g. living alone, chronic illnesses) and various age groups. Data collection continued until saturation was achieved. Textual data were managed and analyzed using NVivo 11.0 Plus software, employing traditional content analysis methods. The interview guide is detailed in Appendix 1. Findings from this qualitative study have been presented in a previously published study.

The initial structure and content of the scale were determined using thematic analysis based on the literature review and semi-structured interviews.

### Assessment and validation of spot urine in estimating the 24-h urinary sodium, potassium, and sodium / potassium ratio in Chinese adults [^6d122eb1]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study results reconfirmed that using SU to estimate 24-h UNa, the K-method, I-method, and T-method were inadequate at the Chinese population level. Our validation and assessment in Zhejiang Province showed a low accuracy for these common methods. One of the important reasons for this low accuracy may be the dietary lifestyle difference. In general, the K-method and T-method were based on the Japanese population, and the I-method was based on the European and North American population. In brief, these methods were not specifically established for the Chinese population. When these formulas were applied in the Chinese population, the bias is foreseeable. Moreover, the K-method was established using a second morning urine sample. Considering the large sample-size investigation convenience, in our study, we just collected the first morning urine instead of the second morning urine to estimate 24-h UNa. Therefore, validation studies in different populations, especially in the Chinese population, would be required. However, it might be uneasy to establish this kind of method to estimate population mean sodium intake under diverse dietary lifestyle available among nationwide China.

Our study found that the correlation coefficient for the 24-h Na/K ratio and SU Na/K ratio was 0.43, and the bias between the Na/K ratio of 24-h urine and spot urinary Na/K ratio by the Bland–Altman method was −0.22. The correlation coefficient in East Asian individuals from the INTERSALT study was r = 0.64, and the bias was 0.65. The reason for the lower correlation coefficient in our study may be we just collected the first morning urine for investigation convenience. Iwahori et al. found that the Na/K ratio of the first morning urine did not show a strong correlation with that of 7-day 24-h urine. Although the bias reflecting diurnal variability is exists in estimation of the Na/K ratio in casual urine specimen, the Na/K ratio in SU may also be a useful proxy for 24-h values if repeated measurements are available to reduce measurement error and increase precision. Therefore, our findings suggest that the SU Na/K ratio may be a useful and alternative method to 24-h urine collection for the estimation of the urinary Na/K ratio in the Chinese population.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^998f41e5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Emergency department s-EVS prevalence and vascular risk — among ED patients with vertigo or dizziness, s-EVS comprised 32.1% (n = 136/424) and 16.6% (n = 101/610). In 136 s-EVS patients, any migraine-related symptom correlated with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine (OR 3.97, 95% CI 3.2–490.8), while unilateral auditory symptoms increased the likelihood of Ménière disease (OR 140.3, 95% CI 9.8–2015). TIA was very rare in the s-EVS group but accounted for half (16/32) of patients with a single transient episode that lasted < 24 h. In another cohort, transient symptoms were associated with a reduced likelihood of a central cause (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.6). Clinicians should be aware of vestibular migraine, as it is the most common cause of the s-EVS; in that study, 90% had a prior history of migraine and in the other 10% headache followed a first episode of dizziness. Across broader ED cohorts with dizziness, a TIA diagnosis occurred in just 1% (9/907), and among adult ED patients with isolated dizziness, 0.7% were diagnosed with stroke or TIA; in that cohort, 3.2% overall were attributed to stroke with a stroke-to-TIA ratio about 2:1. One convenience sample found that half (16/32) of patients with a single episode of dizziness that resolved were diagnosed with a TIA.

### Silver-catalyzed site-selective C (sp)-H benzylation of ethers with N-triftosylhydrazones [^a7004a44]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The insertion of carbenes into the α-C-H bonds of ethers represents one of the most powerful approaches to access polysubstituted α-branched ethers. However, intermolecular carbene insertions remain challenging, since current approaches are generally limited to the use of toxic and potentially explosive α-diazocarbonyl compounds. We now report a silver-catalyzed α-C-H benzylation of ethers using bench-stable N-triftosylhydrazones as safe and convenient carbene precursors. This approach is well suited for both inter- and intramolecular insertions to deliver medicinally relevant homobenzylic ethers and 5-8-membered oxacycles in good yields. The synthetic utility of this strategy is demonstrated by its easy scalability, broad scope with valuable functional groups, high regioselectivity, and late-stage functionalization of complex oxygen-containing molecules. The relative reactivities of different types of silver carbenes and C-H bonds were also investigated by experments and DFT calculations.

### [DOC] 7125… [^66c3ee08]. HHS (2025). Medium credibility.

03–92 SAMPLING METHODS 7130. 5 o Structure of the selection lists. If the selection list is not organized according to case, specify the method employed in identifying a case so an unbiased random selection of cases can be made. Specify these characteristics for each category of a Medicaid case for which a minimum number of reviews has been established. Use either systematic random or simple random sampling procedures for selecting cases to be reviewed except for the 25 percent targeted review. Systematic sampling is preferred. It provides a system or pattern of selection of individual cases from the sample selection list, e.g., a file, computer tape, or listing, at equally spaced intervals, with the starting point determined by random selection. It is important that cases with a similar probability of error are not also placed on equally spaced intervals.

Otherwise, a systematic sample does not yield a truly random sample. The pattern of the sample frame must be such that the probability of case errors is unrelated to the sample selection list structure. Simple random sampling or other more complex sampling methodologies are, in most cases, more difficult to administer. In simple random sampling, assign each case a unique identifying number. Select numbers at random, and include cases having the identifying numbers corresponding to the random numbers. E. Use a random start, and apply the secondary sampling interval obtained in Step D to select cases from the list of sample cases already selected.

GUIDELINES FOR FURTHER STRATIFICATION The basic MEQC sample design requires that the Medicaid population in a State be stratified by AFDC cash and MAO cases. You may choose to further stratify into substrata any MEQC sample stratum which you independently select and review. For example, a 209 State may divide its MAO caseload into three substrata, each of which represents a different region of the State, and select sample cases independently from regional sample selection lists.

### National survey of the Portuguese elderly nutritional status: study protocol [^d957a969]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Fig. 2
Phases of random sampling

We expect to collect data from more than 2000 individuals over 65 years, living in the community and in nursing homes across Portugal. This number is based on the 27% estimated prevalence for nutritional risk in the community and 67% for residents in nursing homes. Taking into account 3% of overall error, we calculated the sample size of 2077 individuals aged 65 and over (979 in the community and of 1098 in nursing homes). In order to calculate sample size per age and sex group, we took into consideration the Portuguese population distribution (based on the numbers from the Statistics Portugal, 2011). The 85 and over age group will be over-sampled, thus guaranteeing a maximum error of 10% per strata.

In the community sample, accounting for 50% of response rate, due to non-contactable individuals, incomplete questionnaires, non-responses, 1470 individuals will be selected and invited to participate in the study. Selected individuals that refuse to participate will be characterized on basis of the available socio-demographic information.

Any individual aged 65 and over who meet the inclusion and do not meet the exclusion criteria are eligible (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria

Selected individuals will be personally invited to enroll in the study. This invitation will be done by phone (primary care units) or by face-to-face contact (nursing homes). In the first contact, a brief presentation of the study and research team will be carried out. For the elderly living in residential homes will be invited by the interviewers to participate in the study. Should the individual accept to enroll in the study, an appointment will be made to his/her convenience in order to conduct the interview, either at his/her primary healthcare unit or at home (for those participants with accessibility difficulties).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder [^a105391d]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Algorithm — VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder — states that this clinical practice guideline's algorithm is designed to facilitate understanding of the clinical pathway and decision-making process used in managing patients with PTSD and represents a simplified flow that helps foster efficient decision making by providers; it includes steps of care in an ordered sequence, decisions to be considered, decision criteria recommended, and actions to be taken. The algorithm is a step-by-step decision tree in which standardized symbols display each step and arrows connect the numbered boxes indicating the order in which the steps should be followed; sidebars 1–11 provide more detailed information to assist in defining and interpreting elements in the boxes. The legend specifies that rounded rectangles represent a clinical state or condition, hexagons represent a decision point in the process of care formulated as a question that can be answered Yes or No, rectangles represent an action in the process of care, and ovals represent a link to another section within the algorithm, and Appendix H contains alternative text descriptions of the algorithms.

### A mixed-method systematic review and meta-analysis of mental health professionals' attitudes toward smoking and smoking cessation among people with mental illnesses [^cbe07819]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Quality appraisal

All studies included stated clear research questions or objective, and in all but one study (which did not provide the requisite information in the published report 36), data were judged to be sufficient to address the stated research questions or objectives (however, this study provided relevant for the current review and was therefore included here).

Quantitative studies (including the quantitative aspect of the mixed‐methods study)

Twenty‐two quantitative studies were judged to have used an adequate random (stratified or non‐stratified) sampling strategy. The remainder used convenience or unclear sampling. For most studies (n = 30) the sample representativeness could not be determined, either because the inclusion/exclusion criteria were unclear or because reasons for non‐response or differences between responders and non‐responders were unknown. Two studies were judged to have unrepresentative samples: in one study the sample was attendees at a smoking cessation training programme 3, and in the other the authors stated that their sample was not representative 38. The majority of studies (n = 28) used established measures which were clearly reflective of the variable of interest. For the remainder, the source and/or wording of measures was unclear. Fewer than half (n = 15) of the studies had a response rate of ≥ 60%.

Qualitative studies (including the qualitative aspect of the mixed‐methods study)

All qualitative studies used data sources (i.e. participants/recruitment settings) that were relevant to the research question, and used relevant approaches to data collection and analysis. Four of the seven qualitative studies discussed their findings in consideration of the research context, but only one explicitly considered the researchers' influence on their findings.

### Respondent driven sampling – where we are and where should we be going? [^d35c86e2]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2012). Low credibility.

Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a novel variant of link tracing sampling that has primarily been used to estimate the characteristics of hard-to-reach groups, such as the HIV prevalence of drug users'. eeds' are selected by convenience from a population of interest (target population) and given coupons. Seeds then use these coupons to recruit other people, who themselves become recruiters. Recruits are given compensation, usually money, for taking part in the survey and also an incentive for recruiting others. This process continues in recruitment 'waves' until the survey is stopped. Estimation methods are then applied to account for the biased recruitment, for example, the presumed over-recruitment of people with more acquaintances, in an attempt to generate estimates for the underlying population. RDS has quickly become popular and relied on by major public health organisations, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Family Health International, chiefly because it is often found to be an efficient method of recruitment in hard-to-reach groups, but also because of the availability of custom written software incorporating inference methods that are designed to generate estimates that are representative of the wider population of interest, despite the biased sampling.

As demonstrated by RDS's popularity, there was a clear need for new methods of data collection on hard-to-reach groups. However, RDS has not been without its critics. Its reliance on the target population for recruitment introduced ethical w1 and sampling concerns. w2 If RDS estimates are overly biased or the variance is unacceptably high, then RDS will be little more than another method of convenience sampling. If these errors can be minimised however, then RDS has the potential to become a very useful survey methodology.

In this editorial we highlight that 'RDS' includes both data collection and statistical inference methods, discuss the limitations of current RDS inference methods for generating representative estimates, highlight other applications of RDS for which it may be more reliable, propose and request feedback on a draft RDS reporting checklist, and finally suggest priority areas for RDS research.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute heart failure syndromes: approved by ACEP board of directors, June 23, 2022 [^6ccfe1d8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Acute heart failure syndromes — Levitt prospective randomized controlled trial (N = 38) enrolled severe respiratory distress and suspected congestive heart failure (CHF) (respiratory rate ≥ 30, diaphoreses, access muscle use, rales, distended neck veins, peripheral edema, or a history of CHF) and compared nose or face mask BiPAP (8/3 but adjustable;? FiO2) (N = 21) versus mask O2 (N = 17) plus medical management; the primary outcome was intubation within 24 h, and there was no significant difference in hospital length of stay, intubation, vital signs, pH or pCO2, PO2, BiPAP vs O2, with a note that Bersten et al's power analysis of 40 patients was possibly too small; limitations included convenience sample, no known FiO2 for BiPAP, and more women in the O2 group.

### A method for obtaining an unbiased sample of family medicine patients for research purposes [^96fb4c44]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Obtaining a representative patient sample for research purposes can be challenging. Classic probability sampling can be trusted, but these approaches are not always feasible; yet alternatives may introduce bias. We summarize relevant literature, the need for new approaches, and illustrate a practical hybrid approach that could consistently produce representative patient samples.

Methods

Valid approaches shift sampling decisions from fallible interviewers to less fallible reproducible processes. In lieu of the interviewer's inclination to select particular patients, we used the day of the week, the appointment time, and the sequence of the patient's last name in the alphabet to select a sample for a consent process and a survey. ILLUSTRATIVE USE: Characteristics of the study sample (n = 225) were compared with the characteristics of the population (N = 1964) that had an office visit during the recruiting period. The data suggested that the study sample was highly representative of the population in this illustrative case.

Discussion

A hybrid sampling approach, in the context of a brief consent process, and a nonthreatening interview produced a representative study sample, but formal evaluation via simulation is needed to validate the hybrid approach. Convenience samples of consecutive patients should be avoided to minimize bias.

### Participation in staff engagement campaigns at large healthcare organisations: a focus group study [^a6cb696c]. BMJ Leader (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

This research involved smaller-than-intended focus groups and is unlikely to be fully representative of the diversity of the whole Trust. Non-attendance was an issue in some groups, resulting with as few as four participants per group. However, given the discussion that groups generated, this was not thought to have compromised results. The research prioritised deeper exploration over generalisability, as qualitative research is suited to, hence the choices around convenience sampling (and the potential for self-selection bias), collecting data to the point of saturation and not collecting additional demographic information. Accordingly, the results do not form a simple recipe for success but provide leaders with starting-off points to be developed further through contextual knowledge and additional evaluation.

### HPV self-sampling for cervical cancer screening: a systematic review of values and preferences [^ebebf39d]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review, we found general consensus that self-sampling is a highly acceptable method for HPV testing, regardless of study location and sampling method, device, setting or participant demographics. Our findings align with previous reviews, such as one by Nelson et al, which reported a pooled estimate prevalence of women preferring self-sampling of 59% (95% CI 48% to 69%). Similarly, high levels of acceptability were consistent among vulnerable and underscreened subpopulations. Women generally preferred self-sampling over clinician sampling, citing ease of use, privacy, convenience and physical and emotional comfort as major reasons for their preference. Women who preferred clinician sampling expressed concerns about the reliability of self-sampled specimens, which was also the most common reason women reported for disliking self-sampling in the review by Nelson et al. Another common reason identified uniquely in this review is end user concern that they would not get face time with a clinician if needed. Counselling prior to the invitation to self-sample as well as clear instructions and availability of trustworthy clinical staff to assist with self-sampling could remedy some of these concerns.

A number of studies examined acceptability of self-sampling in different settings, such as the clinic, home or community. More than half of home-based self-sampling studies took place in high-income countries, since a quick and reliable postal system was necessary for mailing the samples for processing. In some low-income and middle-income countries, community health workers collected specimens self-sampled by participants for processing during home-visits. Across studies, the home was regarded as a highly acceptable and convenient setting for self-sampling. However, women expressed that they would prefer clinic-based sampling if home-based sampling meant they would not have access to a healthcare provider. Ensuring that women have access to a healthcare provider to answer questions about screening or a potential positive result is an important consideration for the expansion of home-based testing programmes.

### Preferences and feasibility of long-acting technologies for the treatment of hepatitis C virus: a survey of patients in diverse low-and middle-income countries [^a7d5ffce]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common issue for all modalities for which respondents were 'very concerned' was that they might not be effective. This result underscores the need for education as part of the rollout strategy for any new LA modality. Education strategies should consider end users of varying ages education levels and be available in multiple languages. Furthermore, as some modalities hold the potential for self‐administration (MAPs for example), patient education could require hands‐on technical training and the availability to ask questions later as needed.

A strength of our study was representation from 3 LMICs with high HCV burdens. Respondents had either current or past HCV infection with varying HCV treatment experience or were at high‐risk for HCV acquisition and therefore the potential target of new LA treatment modalities. These stakeholders were well situated to identify preferences for future HCV treatment developments. Our study also captured the diversity among LMICs; indeed, these differences challenged comparisons between sites given the differences in respondent characteristics. Our study aimed to identify preferences overall, yet the diversity of our sites was evident.

The limitations of this study include that the study population does not necessarily reflect the reality of HCV treatment access globally, and the HCV treatment landscape differed in the three countries included. Although 61% of survey respondents diagnosed with HCV had received treatment, globally only 20% diagnosed with HCV have received treatment. Also, we cannot exclude the possibility that individuals choosing to respond to the survey were particularly interested in LA treatment for HCV, which may have resulted in overestimation of acceptability and feasibility. The sample size in our study was based on convenience, and our analyses may not have been sufficiently powered to detect significant differences among respondent characteristics for LA preference.

Availability of a new LA HCV treatment could improve access, reduce stigma and offer individuals in LMICs a treatment choice. An LA modality would be administered less frequently than DAAs, which could benefit many individual lifestyles and offer a side benefit of improved adherence. Beyond individual benefits, such an HCV treatment may also simplify the health care delivery burden, especially if a single administration LA formulation is developed. Coupled with a point of care diagnostic, a one‐shot cure could simplify efforts to expand HCV treatment access across LMICs and progress towards global goals of HCV elimination.

### Sampling: linking evidence to practice [^c4345bbe]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Because it is usually not possible to include the entire population in a study, researchers must find a way to recruit some people from the population into their study-the participants who become the sample. The goal of any sampling method is to recruit a representative sample that is the same as the population in every way, except with fewer individuals, but recruitment is costly, resource intensive, and challenging in lots of ways. Representativeness is never perfect, which can lead to selection bias. It is important to remember that generalizability is a continuum; study findings are not a dichotomy of "generalizable" or "not", but, rather, more or less generalizable.

### Conducting clinical trials to establish drug efficacy in chronic pain [^597ebbc4]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Design of clinical trials to establish drug efficacy in chronic pain is a complicated issue, and numerous factors must be considered in identifying an optimal study design. Investigators should begin by identifying a focused and testable research question, with the outcome variables operationalized in a way that allows appropriate quantitative analysis. The prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, doubled-blind study using validated quantitative measures is considered the optimal clinical trial design. Within this general study type, the between-subjects design has less statistical power than does the crossover design, in which the patient serves as his or her own control. However, potential problems with the drug effects from the first condition carrying over into, and confounding, the second drug condition present a noteworthy limitation that must be addressed through adequate washout periods and statistical control if crossover designs are used. Retrospective designs may be useful primarily to take advantage of samples of convenience for development of pilot data that provide the basis for conducting better-controlled prospective studies. Sample selection issues must be considered during study design, including the sample size required (based on statistical power analysis), appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria, and likely availability of qualifying patients. There are numerous statistical options for analyzing data that must be selected based on whether data are parametric or nonparametric, whether within-subject (crossover) or between-subject comparisons are used, and whether baseline values of outcome measures affect the degree of change in these measures over the course of the study. Involvement of a biostatistical consultant is recommended during all phases of clinical trials.

### Implementation evaluation of multiple complex early years interventions: an evaluation framework and study protocol [^6d4eac34]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Sample size & selection

Quantitative process and demographic data will be collected for all participants who consent for their data to be shared with the evaluation team. Sample sizes will not be determined in advance as this will be dependent on the uptake of interventions.

For qualitative evaluation, a purposive sampling method will be used to identify and recruit participants representing key characteristics including ethnicity, number of children and primary language to represent the different ethnic and cultural groups in Bradford. Other characteristics will be included based on the key objectives of the intervention as defined during the service design process, for example, maternal mental well-being for interventions relating to social and emotional health, and body mass index for interventions relating to nutrition. We will continue to recruit until we reach data saturation, with an estimate of 20–30 interview participants per intervention. Where focus groups are undertaken, we would aim to recruit 8–10 participants per group, with potentially separate focus groups depending on participants' ethnicity, gender, primary language and/or neighbourhood area. For staff/volunteers, we aim to interview a minimum of 5/6 people per intervention, depending on the size of the intervention delivery team.

Recruitment

Quantitative intervention data and satisfaction questionnaires

Quantitative data will be collected from all participants as a part of the standard service provision.

Qualitative studies

Participants will be identified and approached by one of two methods:

1. By researchers directly from the BiBBS cohort

As part of the consent process for our experimental BiBBS cohort study, expectant parents consent to being contacted in the future to learn about participation in further studies. Researchers will write to consenting parents, attaching a cover letter and information sheet about qualitative studies and contact them via telephone within 2 weeks. Where a participant speaks a language other than English, the initial phone call will be made by a bilingual researcher or an interpreter.

2. By intervention delivery staff/managers

Intervention coordinators will be asked to circulate the study information sheet to all participants who have enrolled onto an intervention. Coordinators will share the names and contact details of those individuals who are willing to be interviewed with the research team. Staff and volunteers will first be approached by their service managers, and if they agree, their contact details will be passed onto the research team.

In both methods of approach, for those interested in taking part, we will check their eligibility (as described above) and check they have read and understood the information sheet. A convenient date/time/place for an interview will be confirmed if agreed.

### Measuring patients' experiences and views of the emergency and urgent care system: psychometric testing of the urgent care system questionnaire [^a1f7d371]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients seeking emergency and urgent care tend to experience a system, making choices about which service to use and making use of a number of services within a healthcare episode. The aim was to psychometrically test the Urgent Care System Questionnaire (UCSQ) for the routine measurement of the patient perspective of the emergency and urgent care system.

Methods

The UCSQ was developed based on qualitative research with recent users of the system. It consisted of a screening question to identify recent users and questions on the patient experience of, and satisfaction with, their most recent event. The acceptability, validity and reliability of the UCSQ were tested in a postal survey of 900 members of the general population and a telephone survey of a quota sample of 1000 members of the general population.

Results

The response rate to the postal survey was 51% (457/893). In the telephone survey, 11604 calls were made to obtain a quota sample of 1014 people. These surveys identified 250 system users in the previous 3 months. A principal-components analysis identified three satisfaction components with good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha between 0.7 and 0.93): 'progress through the system' (10 items), 'entry into the system' (three items) and 'patient convenience' (five items). These components varied as expected by age and overall rating of the system.

Conclusion

Preliminary testing suggests that the UCSQ has reasonable acceptability, validity and reliability. Further testing is required, particularly its responsiveness to changes in emergency and urgent care systems.

### Use of a hand-held bladder ultrasound scanner in the assessment of dehydration and monitoring response to treatment in a paediatric emergency department [^0d8d700d]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dehydration is a common concern in paediatric emergency care. Limited tools are available to assess reduced urine production, which is commonly cited as a reliable marker of dehydration.

Objectives

To evaluate the utility of a hand-held bladder ultrasound scanner in monitoring urine production in children attending the emergency department with suspected dehydration.

Methods

A prospective pilot study was undertaken on a convenience sample of patients presenting with suspected dehydration. Serial bladder ultrasound scanning was performed to monitor urine output. Dehydration was assessed clinically using the WHO guide to dehydration assessment. Decisions about treatment and admission were made independently of the urine output measurements obtained using the bladder scanner.

Results

45 children were studied. Using the WHO guide, 33 (73%) had mild dehydration, 8 (18%) had moderate dehydration and 4 (9%) had severe dehydration. There was a significant difference in estimated urine production between those admitted and those discharged (0.9 ± 1.2ml/kg/h vs 1.8 ± 1.5ml/kg/h, p = 0.01) and between those with mild dehydration versus moderate/severe dehydration (2.3 ± 1.5ml/kg/h vs 0.6 ± 0.7ml/kg/h, p = 0.0011). Urine output had been significantly reduced in those who had received an intravenous fluid bolus compared with those who had not (0.4 ± 0.46ml/kg/h vs 1.9 ± 1.6ml/kg/h, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

The hand-held bladder scanner is a convenient, non-invasive and objective adjunct in the assessment and management of children attending the emergency department with suspected dehydration.

### Assessment of communication strategies for mitigating COVID-19 vaccine-specific hesitancy in Canada [^53072bd8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Ensuring widespread uptake of available COVID-19 vaccinations, each with different safety and efficacy profiles, is essential to combating the unfolding pandemic.

Objective

To test communication interventions that may encourage the uptake of less-preferred vaccines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This online survey was conducted from March 24 to 30, 2021, using a nonprobability convenience sample of Canadian citizens aged 18 years or older, with quota sampling to match 2016 Canadian Census benchmarks on age, gender, region, and language. Respondents completed a 2-by-2-by-2 factorial experiment with random assignment of brand (AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson), information about the vaccine's effectiveness against symptomatic infection (yes or no), and information about the vaccine's effectiveness at preventing death from COVID-19 (yes or no) before being asked about their willingness to receive their assigned vaccine and their beliefs about its effectiveness.

Exposures

Respondents were randomly assigned a vaccine brand (AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson) and information about the vaccine's effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 infection (yes or no) and at preventing death from COVID-19 (yes or no).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Respondents' self-reported likelihood of taking their assigned vaccine if offered (response categories: very likely, somewhat likely, not very likely, or not at all likely, scaled 0–1) and their beliefs about their assigned vaccine's effectiveness (response categories: very effective, somewhat effective, not very effective, or not at all effective, scaled 0–1) were measured.

Results

A total of 2556 Canadian adults responded to the survey (median [IQR] age, 50 [34–63] years; 1339 women [52%]). The self-reported likelihood of taking an assigned AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson vaccine was higher for respondents given information about their assigned vaccine's effectiveness at preventing death from COVID-19 (b,0.04; 95% CI,0.01 to 0.06) and lower among those given information about its overall effectiveness at preventing symptomatic transmission (b,-0.03; 95% CI,-0.05 to 0.00), compared with those who were not given the information. Perceived effectiveness was also higher among those given information about their assigned vaccine's effectiveness at preventing death from COVID-19 (b,0.03; 95% CI,0.01 to 0.05) and lower among those given information about their assigned vaccine's overall efficacy at preventing symptomatic infection (b,-0.05; 95% CI,-0.08 to -0.03), compared with those who were not given this information. The interaction between these treatments was neither substantively nor statistically significant.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that providing information on the effectiveness of less-preferred vaccines at preventing death from COVID-19 is associated with more confidence in their effectiveness and less vaccine-specific hesitancy. These results can inform public health communication strategies to reduce hesitancy toward specific COVID-19 vaccines.

### Research priorities for noninvasive sampling of the lower respiratory tract during acute respiratory failure: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^ab0f2737]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — noninvasive lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling during acute respiratory failure (ARF) is outlined with method attributes, reporting guidance, and research priorities. All noninvasive sampling methods offer advantages and limitations compared with standard fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and the choice of sampling technique should be an informed decision based on those advantages and limitations. Nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (NBBAL) provides high-fidelity sampling of the distal airspaces, endotracheal aspirate (ETA) collection is a common and minimal-risk procedure that is convenient and scalable with identified biological signals that associate with clinical outcomes, and heat moisture exchange filter fluid (HMEF) collection is a noninvasive method sampling proteins and other acellular components that correlate with alveolar fluid. Sputum and upper respiratory tract (URT) sampling methods (e.g., nasal swabs) provide the potential for longitudinal sampling of patients with or without mechanical ventilation, including before intubation and during recovery. Normalization strategies to control for intersample variability during analysis of cellular and acellular components of LRT samples are acceptable but not required, and we encourage reporting whether samples were collected by clinical practice or through a research protocol for all sampling methods. We recommend several future research priorities including: Additional rigorous head-to-head comparison of LRT sampling methods for specific research purposes; examination of the feasibility and benefit of serial LRT sampling; investigation of how LRT biomarkers are related to pathophysiology and patient-centered clinical outcomes during ARF; defining the suitability of URT sampling as a surrogate for LRT sampling.

### Psychological characteristics associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and resistance in Ireland and the United Kingdom [^e70e5863]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Study limitations

These findings should be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, quota sampling was used to recruit both non-probability-based samples via the internet. This opt-in mode of recruitment employed by the survey company who facilitated the data collection (Qualtrics), albeit being a cost-effective method for gaining fast access to a large and diverse sample (and largely the only feasible method of recruitment during the pandemic), inevitably meant that it was not possible to generate a response rate for the baseline survey due to the lack of a known denominator or sampling frame. Whilst more research is required to fully investigate the strengths and weaknesses associated with internet-based panel surveying, it has been suggested that the composition of non-probability internet-based survey panels differs from that of the underlying population. Indeed, the American Association for Public Opinion Research (APPOR) asserts that when non-probability sampling methods are used, there is a higher burden of responsibility on investigators to describe the methods used to draw the sample and collect the data, so that users can make an informed decision about the usefulness of the resulting survey estimates. We support the APPOR's position that it is useful to think of different non-probability sampling approaches as falling on a continuum of expected accuracy of the survey estimates; at one end are uncontrolled convenience samples that produce risky survey estimates by assuming that respondents are a random sample of the population, whereas at the other end, there are surveys that recruit respondents based on criteria related to the survey subject matter and then the survey results are adjusted using variables that are correlated with the key study outcome variables. The design of the current studies ensures that it falls towards the latter end of this continuum.

### 2022 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for management of the difficult airway [^527ec6e6]. Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

Practice Guidelines for Difficult Airway Management — evidence grading and study selection are specified, with literature classifications reported for each intervention as follows: Category A, level 1, meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials; Category A, level 2, multiple randomized controlled trials; Category A, level 3, a single randomized controlled trial; Category B, level 1, nonrandomized studies with group comparisons; Category B, level 2, nonrandomized studies with associative findings; Category B, level 3, nonrandomized studies with descriptive findings; and Category B, level 4, case series or case reports. Statistically significant outcomes (P < 0.01) are designated as either beneficial (B) or harmful (H) to the patient; statistically nonsignificant findings are designated as equivocal (E), and when available, Category A evidence is given precedence over Category B evidence for any particular outcome. The lack of sufficient scientific evidence in the literature is reported in the text of the guidelines as "insufficient evidence". Criteria for literature acceptance included randomized controlled trials, prospective nonrandomized comparative studies (e.g., quasiexperimental, cohort), retrospective comparative studies (e.g., case control), observational studies (e.g., correlational or descriptive statistics), and case reports or case series from peer-reviewed journals, and exclusion criteria encompassed items such as articles with no original data and retracted publications as listed. All meta-analyses are conducted by the ASA methodology group and meta-analyses from other sources are reviewed but not included as evidence in this document; a minimum of five independent randomized controlled trials (i.e., sufficient for fitting a random-effects model) is required for meta-analysis. Survey findings from task force–appointed expert consultants and samples of the memberships of ASA and participating organizations are reported in appendix 2, and survey responses for each recommendation are reported using a five-point scale based on median values from strongly agree to strongly disagree.

### Accuracy prompts are a replicable and generalizable approach for reducing the spread of misinformation [^e813af43]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Experimental designs

In each study, only participants who indicated that they use social media were allowed to participate (there were no inclusion or exclusion criteria based on the types of content people reported sharing online – all participants indicated informed consent). Participants were presented with a set of actual true and false news headlines taken from social media one at a time and in a random order (these were presented in the format of a Facebook post; see Ref.for a detailed explanation of the methodology behind headline selection). All of the false headlines were found using popular fact-checking sites such as snopes.com and factcheck.org and all of the true headlines came from reputable mainstream news sources. In most cases, headlines were selected for inclusion based on prior pre-testing; for all experiments using political headlines, the headlines were balanced on partisan lean based on the pre-test results (i.e. there were both Pro-Democratic and Pro-Republican headlines, and they were equally partisan based on pre-test ratings). Furthermore, there was an attempt in each case to select headlines that were "up to date" or relevant for when the study was run.

As detailed in Table 2, key dimensions of variation across included studies were the subject pool from which the participants were recruited (convenience samples from Amazon Mechanical Turk; samples from Lucid that were quota-matched to the national distribution on age, gender, ethnicity, and region; or samples from YouGov that use sample matching to select representative samples from non-randomly selected pools of respondents), the topic of the headlines about which the participants were make sharing decisions (politics versus COVID-19), the specific set of headlines shown (and thus the baseline level of sharing discernment between true versus false headlines), and the particular set of accuracy prompts employed (see Table 1 for a description of each accuracy prompt). We examine how the effect of the accuracy prompts varies across these dimensions.

### Sampling strategies for assessing male clients of female sex workers in public health research: a compilation of global evidence [^af02cbff]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Medium credibility.

Clients of Female Sex Workers (FSWs) are major bridge population in HIV transmission. Any research among them remains challenging because they are hidden within society. The objective of this review was tocompile the global evidence on different sampling strategies used to access male clients of female sex workers for research purpose, the challenges faced during the sampling process andpossible sources of bias. Original articles and reports published globally in last 10 years, in English language and those with full text freely available online were included in this scoping review. A comprehensive search was carried out among the electronic peer-reviewed literature database (Pubmed and Web of Science) using a pre-designed peer reviewed search strategy. Narrative synthesis was applied out across all such articles. A total of 36 articles were finally included in this review. The common sampling techniques used include convenience sampling, referral by FSWs/ pimp/brothel manager/clients, time location cluster sampling, use of virtual network, anonymous telephone survey, referred by clinicians of STI clinic etc. Overall response rate varied between 35 and 90%. Major challenges in participant recruitment included non-response, feasibility issue specially to cater non-brothel-based clients, safety issue for investigators, over-representation of clients with lower socio-economic status, higher refusal rate for known HIV positive clients to provide biological sample etc. As different sampling techniques have comparable response rate, it can be recommended that a pilot study should be carried out in local context to finalise appropriate participant recruitment technique for a given population.

### Heterogeneity in individual preferences for HIV testing: a systematic literature review of discrete choice experiments [^691d5391]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A significant limitation of several studies we assessed is generalizability to the population of interest. Four of the 14 DCEs recruited participants from STI clinics, most of whom were seeking HIV testing. For example, a study in Kenya that enrolled long distance truck drivers from roadside clinics found that services provided were well-aligned with participant preference and HIVST distribution was unlikely to increase testing coverage. This result is not surprising given the men in the study were seeking HIV testing at a clinic. Further, their preferences are unlikely to generalize to truck drivers not accessing clinic testing likely due to differences in testing preferences. Two DCEs assessed utilized convenience samples, making generalizability difficult to determine. A study of MSM recruited from a social media platform in the UK found that most men preferred standard-of-care clinic testing. However, over 90% of the sample was White, half had a college degree or higher, and 80% had tested for HIV in the past. Further only 50% of those who started the survey completed it, and those who did not complete it were more likely to be never testers and have lower education. It is likely that the preferences of highly educated, White MSM do not generalize to other sub-groups of MSM, who may be less comfortable accessing the health system. Indeed, if current testing modalities were well-aligned with the preferences of key populations, HIV testing rates would likely be higher in these groups. Although it is difficult to obtain representative samples of key populations, studies using snowball or venue-based sampling may have greater generalizability. In addition, four DCEs utilized household-based surveys; over 60% of the samples were female suggesting then men who work long hours or travel for employment may be missed. These men likely have distinct HIV testing preferences due to their mobility and may be less likely to access clinic testing. Further, several studies recruited participants from HIV testing or HIVST trials or provided instructional materials on HIVST use prior to DCE administration. Lack of familiarity with HIVST may be a barrier to acceptability so participants who receive information on HIVST may no longer be representative of the target population. Most participants recruited from HIV testing trials had already demonstrated willingness to test using existing strategies so their preferences may not be generalizable to the rest of the population. Additionally, acceptance rate is an important indicator of generalizability — low acceptance overall or among subpopulations could indicate selection bias, as those willing to complete a DCE about HIV testing may have different preferences than those who decline. Only four studies reported acceptance rates. Further, although there was substantial heterogeneity in testing preferences, many studies were not powered to detect differences among sub-populations. Finally, there was a lack of studies in underserved populations including men, migratory populations, never-testers, female sex workers (FSWs), and persons who inject drugs (PWIDs). We found no DCEs among MSM in SSA and only one clinic-based DCE among transgender women. Globally, over half of new HIV infections occur in key populations and MSM, FSWs, and PWID have > 20-times the HIV risk of the general population. With effective scale-up of ART, the epidemic is increasingly concentrating among key populations and assessing their HIV testing preferences is critical to informing prevention. Finally, our search yielded only 14 studies so our conclusions are limited by the small number of papers included.

### Post-processing peak oxygen uptake data obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing in individuals with spinal cord injury: a scoping review and analysis of different post-processing strategies [^7603fc09]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review the evidence regarding the most common practices adopted with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), with the following specific aims to (1) determine the most common averaging strategies of peak oxygen uptake (V̇o 2peak), (2) review the endpoint criteria adopted to determine a valid V̇o 2peak, and (3) investigate the effect of averaging strategies on V̇o 2peak values in a convenience sample of individuals with SCI (between the fourth cervical and sixth thoracic spinal segments).

Data Sources

Searches for this scoping review were conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and Web Science.

Study Selection

Studies were included if (1) were original research on humans published in English, (2) recruited adults with traumatic and non-traumatic SCI, and (3) V̇o 2peak reported and measured directly during CPET to volitional exhaustion. Full-text review identified studies published before April 2021 for inclusion.

Data Extraction

Extracted data included authors name, journal name, publication year, participant characteristics, and comprehensive information relevant to CPET.

Data Synthesis

We extracted data from a total of 197 studies involving 4860 participants. We found that more than 50% of studies adopted a 30-s averaging strategy. A wide range of endpoint criteria were used to confirm the attainment of maximal effort. In the convenience sample of individuals with SCI (n = 30), the mean V̇o 2peak decreased as epoch (ie, time) lengths increased. Reported V̇o 2peak values differed significantly (P < .001) between averaging strategies, with epoch length explaining 56% of the variability.

Conclusions

The adoption of accepted and standardized methods for processing and analyzing CPET data are needed to ensure high-quality, reproducible research, and inform population-specific normative values for individuals with SCI.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Preferences and feasibility of long-acting technologies for the treatment of hepatitis C virus: a survey of patients in diverse low-and middle-income countries [^2f06ef10]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Materials and Methods

We administered a descriptive, cross‐sectional survey designed to measure facilitators and barriers to LA HCV treatment and preferred administration methods (see Supporting Information). Our diverse survey administration sites included three LMICs with high HCV prevalence: Egypt, Ethiopia and India. These sites were selected to provide varied target end‐user populations in LMICs, including HCV treatment experience and PWID populations. Training of outreach staff conducting survey administration was completed before collection commenced at each site. In‐person recruitment occurred at all sites. Individuals invited to participate were 18 years of age or older and had been diagnosed with HCV infection or were individuals at risk for HCV infection. See Supporting Information for full study instrument.

The University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Review Board and the WHO Ethics Review Committee classified the research as exempt; however, all sites received local IRB approval and participants provided written informed consent. A participant stipend equivalent to $10 USD was provided. After pilot testing at two sites, surveys were conducted between February and July 2023.

Convenience sampling was used to recruit patients at health facilities that monitor and treat patients with HCV, and while conducting community outreach among PWID. We collected deidentified respondent demographics, history of HCV diagnosis and treatment and current medication intake and adherence. Data on HIV co‐infection and current or past intravenous drug use were collected. We included questions about patient experience with two potential HCV treatment methods, including an intramuscular injection and subdermal implants. We provided an illustration and written description about each administration method prior to asking questions about the modality. Due to low familiarity with implants as an LA modality, we provided an optional video link to demonstrate how an implant is inserted. Respondents were asked closed‐ended questions about any prior experience with these modalities, and impressions regarding effectiveness, perceived risks and benefits, and willingness to use the modality if it worked just as well as taking pills. For injections, we also captured preferences for different dosing schedules.

### Quality of antidiabetic medicines in 13 sub-saharan African countries: a cross-sectional survey [^fbb8871a]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has limitations. We only collected samples of essential medicines for diabetes and did not have data on newer drugs. This choice was discussed with local investigators who are experienced physicians in the care of diabetic patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and they identified drugs that were commonly being used. Indeed, we did not distinguish between substandard and counterfeit drugs; our methodology focused on identifying the quality of drugs, not pathways to bad medicines. However, discussions between African investigators highlighted that the final target was to determine the quality of the drugs taken by their patients, not whether the drug had been produced fraudulently or was the result of mediocre production. To assess quality according to content of active ingredient, we applied the most stringent acceptance criteria across all APIs (95–105%) based on EP standards. This may lead to higher non-compliance rates than would be reported using broader compendial limits, such as those of the USP (see Supplementary Table S4). Quality analysis did not include criteria such as dissolution of the oral antidiabetics. We also acknowledged the absence of cold-chain verification.

The study was based on a convenient sample of drugs collected in licensed and unlicensed places of sales, used a hybrid design (randomly and non-randomly selected places of sales), in capital cities and border cities, and included a limited number of insulins. Therefore the study findings should not be considered as being necessarily representative of the considered 13 sub-Saharan countries.

However, our study has several strengths. We collected almost 5000 samples of antidiabetic drugs across 13 African countries, which makes this study unprecedented. The planning and launching of the DIABDAF study were aided by the team, which comprises members with extensive prior research experience and existing collaborations with a network of physician-scientists in Africa in the field of drug quality analysis. Our African Research Network (ARNncd) worked to obtain robust data on non-communicable disease. The noteworthy basis of this research is driven by questions from the field by African physicians combined with a solid methodology, following a recommended and published method to collect samples, namely the MEDQUARG guidelines.

### Parental knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding antibiotic use for acute upper respiratory tract infections in children: a cross-sectional study in palestine [^caa75527]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study area and study design

A cross-sectional survey was performed in Primary Health Care (PHC) centres in selected areas in Nablus governorate. The study was carried out from June, 1st to the end of October in 2012. The PHC centre's selection was based on geographic clustering sampling to obtain a representative sample of parents. Previously published studies about knowledge and attitudes toward antibiotics have been mostly carried out among physicians in primary healthcare centres. For the purpose of this study, four primary health care centres were chosen. These centres have the followings in common which made them suitable as a study area: (1) they provide a full package of primary health care services; (2) they serve a large number of patients; and (3) they cover the three types of communities within this region (rural, urban, and Palestinian refugee camps). To the best of our knowledge, limited such studies were conducted on consumers such as parents.

Study population

The population of the study was the parents of children attending PHC centres aged between 18 and 50 years.

Sampling procedure and sample size calculation

Sample size was calculated using a Raosoft sample size calculator. The calculation was based on 50% response distribution, 5% margin of error and 95% confidence interval. The assumption that the response rate is 50% was based on the idea that both responses and response rates were completely unknown since there are no previously published similar studies from Palestine. The calculated sample size was 377. To ensure accuracy, the sample size was increased to 400 to account for any missing data or non-response rate. Ultimately, parents were selected using a convenience sampling method because it saves time, cost, and ease of accessibility to the researchers.

### Prehospital to emergency department handoff: can team-based reporting improve markers of clinical efficiency in an adult emergency department? [^9dee3d9b]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

The inclusion criteria included patients who arrived via EMS to the ED between 07:00 and 19:00 hours, were immediately roomed in a treatment area designated for medically complex, non-traumatically injured patients and subsequently had a complete blood count (CBC) ordered, drawn and resulted. CBC was picked as the serum lab of choice, as it is the most routinely ordered lab in the ED. For the first three cycles, we included only patients seen by a third year (ie, postgraduate year 3 (PGY-3)) resident physician. For the second three cycles, we expanded to include patients seen by a second year (ie, PGY-2) resident physician. The resident and nursing composition varied for each cycle depending on the rotation schedule.

Exclusion criteria included patients seen by non-PGY-3 or non-PGY-2 providers (eg, PGY-1 residents, off-service residents or advanced practice providers), patients who came in as an 'alert' (eg, trauma alert, stroke alert, ST-elevation myocardial infarction alert, sepsis alert) and patients initially seen and evaluated at our affiliated free-standing EDs and subsequently transferred to the main ED via EMS for a higher echelon of care.

To minimise Hawthorne effect, the control cycles were randomly initiated throughout the year, so the ED staff had no pre-emptive warning when they were being observed. With each successive intervention cycle, implemented changes included a combination of: (1) varying the resident and nursing cohort composition for each cycle, (2) expanding the number and types of residents and nurses for each cycle, (3) identifying performance outliers and providing targeted feedback and (4) recognising and correcting poor TBR adoption.

Based on power calculations conducted during study design, we needed 55 patients in each cohort to demonstrate statistical significance. Therefore, for the study population, the control cohort consisted of a convenience sample of 248 randomly selected patients who met inclusion criteria in the control group. The intervention group consisted of all patients who met inclusion criteria and for whom patient care was transferred using the TBR method during the intervention cycles of the study.

Patient and public involvement

Our quality improvement study was developed and executed entirely by the research team without prior or direct input or feedback from the general public or patient representatives. Both patients and the public were not involved in study design, execution or dissemination of this QIP.

### Comparing the effectiveness of virtual and semi-attendance stress inoculation training [SIT] techniques in improving the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress of pregnant women with psychological distress: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^03495ea4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Design

The present study is a multicenter randomized clinical trial with two parallel intervention groups. It was registered in the Iranian Clinical Trial registry under the number IRCT.20200122046228N1.

Participant recruitment

The study population consisted of all pregnant women of 14–32 weeks' gestation referred to selected hospitals. It was performed in two educational and therapeutic centers affiliated with the Babol University of Medical Sciences in Iran between November 2020 and January 2022.

The sample consisted of women meeting the eligibility criteria to enter the study during the trial. A total of 96 individuals who obtained the necessary scores based on the relevant questionnaires were enrolled through the convenience sampling method. Afterward, an independent midwife outside the research team randomly assigned samples into two intervention groups [SIT and VSIT], using the blocking method and computer-generated randomization. Randomization was based on a 1: 1 ratio of four blocks [balanced block randomization] using a computer random number generator. After the creation of two groups of 4 blocks with 96 participants, 24 random blocks were created using the company computer. The allocation order was kept confidential and was not available to any participant or researcher. A midwife in the selected hospital who was unaware of the treatment allocation and was not involved in the recruitment of the women assessed the consequences. Similarly, the statistical analyzer was not informed about the coding of the semi-attendance intervention and virtual intervention groups.

Inclusion criteria included the willingness to participate in the study, 14–32 weeks of gestation, obtaining a score higher than 0.5 based on the BSI-18 questionnaire, not attending similar classes, no severe psychiatric disorders [such as bipolar] based on self-report, the educational level of at least the third year of middle school, age over 16, and access to the Internet and WhatsApp messenger. Exclusion criteria included inactive and irregular attendance, unwillingness to continue attending meetings, a pregnancy accompanied by high-risk situations [such as bleeding, miscarriage, preterm delivery] and migration.

Sample size calculation

The sample size was calculated at 48 participants for each group using G-Power and Mohammadi et al.'s article.

First type errors (α):0.05 s type error (β): 0.1

To implement the intervention, the researcher first provided the necessary explanations about the study objectives to the subjects and obtained their informed written consent if they agreed to participate in the study. Participants were also reassured about the right to withdraw from the study in case of reluctance to participate.

### Data selection… [^da3c28c4]. ori.hhs.gov (2004). Low credibility.

Data selection is defined as the process of determining the appropriate data type and source, as well as suitable instruments to collect data. Data selection precedes the actual practice of data collection. This definition distinguishes data selection from selective data reporting and interactive/active data selection. The process of selecting suitable data for a research project can impact data integrity. Types/Sources of Data Depending on the discipline, data types and sources can be represented in a variety of ways. The two primary data types are quantitative, and qualitative.

Although scientific disciplines differ in their preference for one type over another, some investigators utilize information from both quantitative and qualitative with the expectation of developing a richer understanding of a targeted phenomenon. Data sources can include field notes, journal, laboratory notes/specimens, or direct observations of humans, animals, plants. Questions that need to addressed when selecting data type and type include: Methodological Procedures to Obtain a Representative Sample The goal of sampling is to select a data source that is representative of the entire data universe of interest. Depending on discipline, samples can be drawn from human or animal populations, laboratory specimens, observations, or historical documents. Failure to ensure representativeness may introduce bias, and thus compromise data integrity.

A variety of sampling procedures are available to reduce the likelihood of drawing a biased sample, and some of them are listed below: These methods of sampling try to ensure the representativeness from the entire population by incorporating an element of 'randomness' to the selection procedure, and thus a greater ability to generalize findings to the targeted population. These methods contrast sharply with the 'convenience' sample where little or no attempt is made to ensure representativeness. Random sampling procedures common in quantitative research contrasts with the predominant type of sampling conducted in qualitative research. Since investigators may be focusing on a small numbers of cases, sampling procedures are often purposive or theoretical rather than random. According to Savenye and Robinson, "For the study to be valid, the reader should be able to believe that a representative sample of involved individuals was observed.

The "multiple realities" of any cultural context should be represented.

### Engineering and characterization of gymnosperm sapwood toward enabling the design of water filtration devices [^3c96722e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Field studies

Information on user needs and preferences for water filtration devices and feedback on xylem filtration device prototypes was gathered through 600 individual semi-structured interviews, 53 focus group discussions, and 2 hands-on co-design workshops with over 1000 potential users. The research sample for the field studies included low-income rural households in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand, India, and the urban slum households from Bengaluru and Delhi and other stakeholders in the water filter supply chain, including, filter vendors, manufacturers, NGO staff, and local health officials. The 'National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants' guidelines published by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) were followed while conducting user research in India. These guidelines suggest that social and behavioral research for health applications should be approved by the ethics committee for the researchers' institution, which in our case would be the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Committee on the Use of Human Subjects (MIT COUHES). All human-subjects research procedures were approved by MIT COUHES under protocol 1612798762. Informed consent of the participants was obtained prior to data collection.

Different sampling strategies were followed for different data collection methods. Potential segments with potentially different needs were stratified based on a variety of factors including the geography, types of water sources, proximity to town, and heterogeneity of the population in terms of water-related practices. Villages were selected based on these criteria with the assistance of local partner NGOs. For semi-structured interviews, simple random sampling was used within the selected villages. In general, 20–30 subjects were interviewed for each segment. For focus group discussions and design workshops, a combination of non-probability sampling techniques such as convenience sampling and snowball sampling techniques were used. For key informant interviews, a purposeful sampling strategy was used to select participants. Data saturation was also considered in the studies. The homogeneity of the population with regards to water usage practices was assessed with the help of local experts and data was considered saturated when no new information or themes were observed. Pen and paper were used to record the data. Photos were taken and voice recorders were also used with participant consent. A translator was present during data collection. Researchers were not blind to experimental condition and study hypothesis. No data points were omitted while performing data analysis.

### Survey design: to ask or not to ask? That is the question [^a93395c9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Surveys are one of the most frequent modes of observation and measurement. Survey research can be exploratory, descriptive, and/or explanatory. Modes of survey administration vary and include face-to-face, telephone, mail, and Internet. There are numerous considerations that that must be taken into account when designing and conducting a survey. Deciding what information is needed and why is important when developing questions for a survey; it is essential to define the purpose of the survey and to be as specific as possible in terms of the data to be collected. Response rate varies by target audience and is influenced by a number of factors such as incentives, survey length, and perceived burden. From question development to survey construction, the goal is to minimize measurement error with systematic planning and execution.

### Psychological mediators of the associations between pandemic-related stressors and suicidal ideation across three periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada [^51e302c8]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic's mental health impact is well-established. While early evidence suggested suicide deaths remained stable or declined, suicidal ideation (SI) became more prevalent than before the pandemic. Our study: (1) examined the prevalence and distribution of SI among Canadian adults, (2) compared SI among those with and without pre-existing mental illnesses, and (3) evaluated associations between pandemic-related stressors (i.e., unemployment, insecure employment, loss of income, medical vulnerability, COVID-19 exposure) with SI, and whether such associations were mediated by depression, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, or perceived discrimination.

Methods

The sample was comprised of data gathered at three timepoints (Wave 1 08/18/2020–10/01/2020, n = 6629; Wave 2 12/21/2020–03/31/2021, n = 5920; Wave 3 09/07/2021–12/07/2021, n = 7354). Quota-based responses from survey research panels which matched the geographic, age, and sex distribution of the Canadian population were supplemented with convenience-sampled responses.

Results

The prevalence of SI was 4.1% (Wave 1), 5.3% (Wave 2), and 5.8% (Wave 3). Odds of SI were higher for respondents under the age of 35 years and with pre-existing mental illnesses. SI was associated with quarantining due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 exposure, potential COVID-19 exposure at work, medical vulnerability toward COVID-19, insecure employment or unemployment, and income loss. These associations were mediated by psychological experiences, particularly depression and thwarted belongingness.

Limitations

This cross-sectional, observational study cannot establish temporality or causality.

Conclusion

Results highlight groups who may benefit from enhanced screening for depression and suicide risk. Reducing depression and increasing sense of belonging should be prioritized.

### A survey of primary care practices on their use of the intensive behavioral therapy for obese Medicare patients [^2e7c66ea]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To fill the gap in knowledge on systematic differences between primary care practices (PCP) that do or do not provide intensive behavioral therapy (IBT) for obese Medicare patients.

Methods

A mixed modality survey (paper and online) of primary care practices obtained from a random sample of Medicare databases and a convenience sample of practice-based research network practices.

Key Results

A total of 287 practices responded to the survey, including 140 (7.4% response rate) from the random sample and 147 (response rate not estimable) from the convenience sample. We found differences between the IBT-using and non-using practices in practice ownership, patient populations, and participation in Accountable Care Organizations. The non-IBT-using practices, though not billing for IBT, did offer some other assistance with obesity for their patients. Among those who had billed for IBT, but stopped billing, the most commonly cited reason was billing difficulties. Many providers experienced denied claims due to billing complexities.

Conclusions

Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services established payment codes for PCPs to deliver IBT for obesity in 2011, very few providers submitted fee-for-service claims for these services after almost 10 years. A survey completed by both a random and convenience sample of practices using and not using IBT for obesity payment codes revealed that billing for these services was problematic, and many providers that began using the codes discontinued using them over the past 7 years.
