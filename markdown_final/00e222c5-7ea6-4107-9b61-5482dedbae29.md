what is noac

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about NOACs: what the acronym means, which agents are included, how they work, their pharmacologic features, indications, comparisons with warfarin, special considerations, and a final synthesized definition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and nomenclature. Then, I should verify the specific drugs in the class and their mechanisms. Next, I will review pharmacologic characteristics and approved indications. After that, I need to compare benefits and risks versus warfarin, including efficacy and bleeding. Finally, I should consider dosing in renal impairment, perioperative management, reversal, monitoring nuances, adherence and cost, and synthesize a concise definition, confirming each point against the literature as I go [^112dqrCa].

> Let me first confirm the acronym and its evolution in usage. NOAC originally stood for "novel oral anticoagulants" but is commonly defined as "non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants", and is often used interchangeably with DOAC (direct oral anticoagulants) or TSOAC (target‑specific oral anticoagulants); I should double‑check that contemporary clinical literature now favors DOAC to avoid confusion while maintaining the same class definition that excludes warfarin and other VKAs, which aligns with their preferential use over VKAs due to lower intracranial bleeding risk [^112dqrCa] [^115fJxv8] [^114BeCbo].

> I need to verify the specific agents in current clinical use. The approved NOAC/DOACs are dabigatran (direct thrombin inhibitor) and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban; earlier investigational agents like ximelagatran and others are not used clinically, which I should note to avoid mistakenly including them in the class definition [^112CpLiu] [^116hokiJ].

> Let me consider the mechanism of action to ensure precision. Dabigatran directly inhibits thrombin (factor IIa), whereas rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban inhibit factor Xa; this targeted blockade contrasts with VKAs, which decrease synthesis of multiple vitamin K–dependent factors, and helps explain the more predictable PK/PD profiles seen with NOACs [^115fJxv8] [^1117KbrW].

> Next, I should review key pharmacologic characteristics. These agents have rapid onset/offset, predictable PK allowing fixed dosing without routine coagulation monitoring, fewer food and drug interactions than VKAs, and no dietary vitamin K restrictions; however, Wait, let me verify half‑life ranges because adherence implications hinge on them: typical half‑lives are shorter than warfarin (e.g., ~6–17 hours for most NOACs vs ~40–60 hours for warfarin), which means missed doses matter more clinically, and specialized assays (e.g., anti‑Xa activity, dilute thrombin time) may be needed in select scenarios despite the lack of routine monitoring [^115fJxv8] [^114zrT3G] [^115cTzmA].

> I will now examine the principal approved indications. I should confirm that NOACs are approved for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), and VTE prophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery; Hold on, I should verify regional labeling nuances, but broadly these indications are consistent across major markets [^115fJxv8] [^116smKPH] [^112dqrCa].

> Now, comparing with VKAs, I initially thought NOACs reduced stroke or systemic embolism by about one‑third versus warfarin; Wait, let me verify because that may overstate efficacy as a uniform class effect. High‑quality data show NOACs are at least as effective as warfarin for stroke prevention in AF, with consistent and clinically important reductions in intracranial hemorrhage; some analyses suggest modest improvements in composite stroke/SE and mortality versus warfarin, but the most robust and consistent advantage is lower ICH, so I should correct the earlier overstatement and emphasize safety, while acknowledging comparable or improved effectiveness depending on the agent and population [^1165tqqE] [^116NMbo6] [^112dqrCa] [^116dopcv].

> For acute VTE treatment, I should double‑check equivalence and bleeding profiles across agents. Meta‑analyses of randomized trials show NOACs are noninferior to VKAs for preventing recurrent VTE, with rivaroxaban demonstrating reduced major bleeding compared with conventional therapy in pooled analyses; let me confirm there is no consistent mortality difference in these trials, which aligns with the data [^114E5r44] [^116smKPH] [^1175sS2C].

> I need to ensure I capture limitations and trade‑offs. GI bleeding risk can be higher with dabigatran 150 mg and rivaroxaban relative to warfarin in some AF cohorts, renal function strongly influences dosing and safety, and advanced kidney disease (e.g. CrCl < 15 mL/min) remains a major constraint; additionally, adherence is crucial due to shorter half‑lives, and cost is substantially higher than warfarin, which can affect persistence and access in routine care [^113539MM] [^113Z2m2a] [^11415NaN] [^114zrT3G] [^114hty2c].

> Next, I should review special clinical considerations systematically. Let me first confirm renal dosing adjustments across all NOACs and the need for periodic renal function monitoring; then, I should verify the valvular heart disease carve‑outs — avoid NOACs in mechanical valves and moderate‑to‑severe mitral stenosis but consider them in other valve lesions, bioprostheses after the early postoperative period, and TAVI with caution; for perioperative care, timing of interruption depends on renal function and bleeding risk, and "bridging" is generally not required; for drug interactions, I need to consider P‑gp and CYP3A4 modulators; for laboratory assessment in special situations, anti‑Xa assays or dilute thrombin time can be informative; and regarding reversal, idarucizumab reverses dabigatran and andexanet reverses factor Xa inhibitors, though evidence for improved clinical outcomes over standard care remains limited, as highlighted by NOAC‑associated ICH studies and ongoing debates about optimal hemostatic strategies [^113Z2m2a] [^1176E2p1] [^114xBEs7] [^115GWqZC] [^115cTzmA] [^1114rEd5] [^113JXjSz].

> Hold on, I should verify real‑world dosing pitfalls because they materially affect outcomes. In AF patients with renal indications for dose reduction, failing to reduce dose increases major bleeding risk, whereas off‑label underdosing without indication increases stroke risk; systematic reviews corroborate that inappropriate dosing is common and associated with worse clinical and economic outcomes, and some regional datasets (e.g. East Asian cohorts) show high rates of underdosing with heterogeneous outcome signals by agent, which underscores the need for label‑concordant dosing [^113Z2m2a] [^112PqkuP] [^113WQr2L] [^1179JB6B].

> But wait, what about emergency bleeding and ICH on NOACs, as clinical teams often ask for pragmatic guidance. I need to emphasize that while targeted reversal agents exist, robust randomized evidence for superiority in hard outcomes is limited, guidelines often recommend NOAC‑specific reversal when available alongside PCCs, and antifibrinolytics like tranexamic acid have been explored in NOAC‑associated ICH with uncertainty about functional outcomes, so individualized risk‑benefit assessment and institutional protocols remain critical pending stronger trial data [^1114rEd5] [^1117KbrW].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically oriented definition. NOACs (non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants), often termed DOACs, are targeted oral anticoagulants that directly inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban), used primarily for stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF, for treatment of acute VTE, and for orthopedic VTE prophylaxis; they provide fixed dosing without routine monitoring, rapid onset/offset, predictable PK, fewer dietary interactions, and significantly lower ICH than warfarin, but require attention to renal function, drug interactions, perioperative interruption, access and cost, adherence due to short half‑lives, and context‑specific reversal strategies, with selection and dosing tailored to patient characteristics and evidence for each agent [^115fJxv8] [^112dqrCa] [^116smKPH] [^1114rEd5].

---

NOACs are **non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants** (also called direct oral anticoagulants, DOACs) that include dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban [^115fJxv8]. They are used for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism [^116smKPH], offering **fixed dosing without routine INR monitoring** [^115cTzmA] and a lower risk of intracranial bleeding compared to warfarin [^116dopcv]. NOACs have a rapid onset/offset, predictable pharmacokinetics, and fewer drug–food interactions [^115fJxv8], but require dose adjustment in renal impairment [^113Z2m2a] and have specific reversal agents (idarucizumab [^113JXjSz] for dabigatran; andexanet alfa [^1114rEd5] for factor Xa inhibitors).

---

## Mechanism of action

NOACs act by **directly inhibiting** key coagulation enzymes: **dabigatran** is a **direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor** that prevents fibrin formation [^115fJxv8], whereas **rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban** are **direct factor Xa inhibitors** that block thrombin generation [^1117KbrW].

---

## Clinical indications

NOACs are indicated for:

- **Stroke prevention**: in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) [^116dopcv].
- **Venous thromboembolism**: treatment and prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) [^1175sS2C].
- **Orthopedic prophylaxis**: after hip or knee replacement surgery [^116kySPE].

---

## Advantages over traditional anticoagulants

NOACs offer several advantages over warfarin:

- **No routine INR monitoring**: due to predictable pharmacokinetics [^115cTzmA].
- **Fewer interactions**: reduced drug–food interactions [^1111SqC1] [^114svfRp].
- **Lower intracranial bleeding**: compared to warfarin [^116dopcv].
- **Rapid onset/offset**: enabling quicker anticoagulation and perioperative management [^114xBEs7].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Despite their advantages, NOACs have limitations:

- **Renal impairment**: dose adjustment or avoidance required [^113Z2m2a].
- **Bleeding risk**: especially gastrointestinal bleeding [^113539MM].
- **Adherence**: short half-lives make missed doses risky [^114zrT3G].
- **Cost**: higher than warfarin, though monitoring costs are lower [^114hty2c].

---

## Reversal agents

Specific reversal agents include **idarucizumab** for dabigatran reversal [^113JXjSz] and **andexanet alfa** for factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) [^112aeptK] [^1114rEd5].

---

## Clinical outcomes

NOACs demonstrate **favorable clinical outcomes**, providing effective stroke prevention in NVAF [^1165tqqE]. They are associated with lower rates of intracranial bleeding than warfarin [^112dqrCa] and offer comparable efficacy to warfarin for VTE treatment [^114E5r44].

---

NOACs are a major advance in anticoagulation, providing **effective, convenient alternatives** to warfarin with fewer interactions and no routine monitoring, but require careful use in renal impairment and adherence to dosing.

### Tranexamic acid for intracerebral hemorrhage in patients on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (TICH-NOAC): A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^1114rEd5]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease with high mortality and morbidity. Oral anticoagulation is a well-defined complicating factor of ICH, resulting in an increased risk of hematoma expansion (HE), mortality, and morbidity compared with patients with ICH without anticoagulation therapy. Novel, non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) are the mainstay of oral anticoagulation and have largely replaced vitamin K antagonists over the past decade. With the increasing use of NOAC, the proportion of NOAC-associated ICH is steadily increasing, too. Knowledge about NOAC-associated ICH is scarce, but retrospective observational studies reported high rates of HE (40%) and high rates of in-hospital mortality (25%) and acknowledged substantial disability.

Currently, no evidence-based hemostatic treatment exists for NOAC-associated ICH. NOAC-specific reversal agents (idarucizumab for direct thrombin inhibitors as well as andexanet alfa for direct factor Xa inhibitors) have been approved by medical authorities but lack clear evidence from randomized controlled trials to be superior to any other standard of care. While guidelines recommend the use of NOAC-specific reversal agents and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4fPCC) to restore coagulation in NOAC-associated ICH, no robust evidence exists that these treatments limit HE or improve clinical outcomes.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) — an antifibrinolytic drug — has been investigated in non–NOAC-associated ICH, most notably in the recent TICH-2 trial. Although its efficacy with regard to functional outcome has not been established, it may offer potential benefits.

### Idarucizumab for reversal of dabigatran-associated bleeding: Misnomer or miracle [^113JXjSz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The development of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) has revolutionized oral anticoagulation. Rapid incorporation of NOACs into general practice has heightened the demand for directed reversal agents. Idarucizumab is a targeted reversal agent that is approved for the urgent reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. While it is a welcome addition to reversal strategies for dabigatran, a number of clinical questions exist regarding its place in therapy.

We describe controversies regarding the use of idarucizumab therapy in patients with dabigatran-associated bleeding. Although existing clinical studies show a rapid reversal of coagulation assays, these studies did not describe a corresponding improvement in mortality or rapid cessation of hemorrhage. It is questionable how heavily clinicians can rely upon the use of the surrogate endpoints in clinical studies, such as ecarin clotting time and dilute thrombin time. Another issue is whether patients exhibiting re-elevation of coagulation assays would benefit from an additional dose of idarucizumab, because this has not been studied. It is currently unclear if blood products must be given in addition to idarucizumab or if it can be used as monotherapy.

The initial data suggest a definite role for idarucizumab in the treatment of bleeding associated with dabigatran. As more clinical practice experience is gained with the agent and the remaining data on its use are released, clinicians can better guide the clinical use of idarucizumab. At present, there is currently not enough evidence to fully ascertain its efficacy.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^114svfRp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

- **Conclusion**: DOACs have revolutionized anticoagulant management and are becoming the cornerstone treatment for stroke prevention in AF and VTE prophylaxis and treatment, with the list of other indications expanding. There are many factors that affect appropriate efficacy and safety endpoints when prescribing DOAC therapy, and this review aims to address these scenarios. Patient comorbidities must be considered when selecting the most appropriate anticoagulant.

	- It is now recognized that routine monitoring of renal and hepatic function, signs/symptoms of bleeding, and parameters of compliance should be considered for all patients. Clinicians should incorporate patient preferences, clinical outcomes data, patient characteristics, and quality‐of‐life considerations when recommending an anticoagulant. Cost can play a critical role in this decision, with DOAC affordability for individual patients varying based on medication benefit copayment tiers. As the future of anticoagulant therapies continues to evolve, DOACs will remain a critical therapy for preventing thrombotic events.

### Pivotal trials testing the efficacy of novel anticoagulants for preventing emerging cardioembolic risk entities [^112dqrCa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of ischemic stroke and accounts for about one quarter of all ischemic strokes worldwide. It is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Oral anticoagulation can reduce the stroke risk in nonvalvular AF by two-thirds using vitamin K antagonists or non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants (NOACs). NOACs are now preferentially used, as they were superior to warfarin in reducing the risk of intracranial bleeding. This viewpoint discusses whether NOAC use is beneficial in stroke prevention in other patient populations, based on ongoing or published randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant dosing in patients with atrial fibrillation and renal dysfunction [^113Z2m2a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Dose reduction of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is indicated in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and renal impairment. Failure to reduce the dose in patients with severe kidney disease may increase bleeding risk, whereas dose reductions without a firm indication may decrease the effectiveness of stroke prevention.

- **Objectives**: The goal of this study was to investigate NOAC dosing patterns and associated outcomes, specifically stroke (ischemic stroke and systemic embolism) and major bleeding in patients treated in routine clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Using a large U.S. administrative database, 14,865 patients with AF were identified who initiated apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban between October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2015. We examined the use of a standard dose in patients with a renal indication for dose reduction (potential overdosing) and the use of a reduced dose when the renal indication is not present (potential underdosing). Cox proportional hazards regression was performed in propensity score-matched cohorts to investigate the outcomes.

- **Results**: Among the 1,473 patients with a renal indication for dose reduction, 43.0% were potentially overdosed, which was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 4.46) but no statistically significant difference in stroke (3 NOACs pooled). Among the 13,392 patients with no renal indication for dose reduction, 13.3% were potentially underdosed. This underdosing was associated with a higher risk of stroke (hazard ratio: 4.87; 95% confidence…

### Management of haemarthrosis in patients on oral anticoagulants [^114ui6Qn]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

Use of oral anticoagulation therapy continues to increase. Anticoagulants are important in both the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolic complications. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which inhibit thrombin or activated factor X, are licensed for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, treatment of venous thromboembolism, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following orthopaedic surgery.

The incidence of haemarthrosis associated with warfarin and NOACs ranges from 0 to 1.5% of patients. Although the incidence is low, as the use of NOACs and warfarin continues to rise, it is likely to increase in the future.

The management of haemarthrosis in this patient group is challenging, presenting several questions to the clinician: When should the anticoagulants be held? What is the role of joint aspiration? What adjunctive therapies are available? The literature available to guide practice is limited to case reports and small case series. According to recommendations, a single episode of acute haemarthrosis associated with oral anticoagulants should be managed by rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) principles, temporary cessation of anticoagulation where possible, and potential aspiration of the joint.

Our aim was to investigate the approach to these patients in the Orthopaedic Department at a central London District General Hospital over four years and highlight the outcomes of different management strategies.

### Novel oral anticoagulants and reversal agents: Considerations for clinical development [^1129SxDt]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

This white paper provides a summary of presentations and discussions held at an Anticoagulant-Induced Bleeding and Reversal Agents Think Tank, co-sponsored by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the FDA's White Oak Headquarters on April 22, 2014. Attention focused on a development pathway for reversal agents for the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs). This is important because anticoagulation is still widely underused for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. Undertreatment persists, although NOACs, in general, overcome some of the difficulties associated with anticoagulation provided by vitamin K antagonists.

One reason for the lack of a wider uptake is the absence of NOAC reversal agents. As there are neither widely accepted academic and industry standards nor a definitive regulatory policy on the development of such reversal agents, this meeting provided a forum for leaders in the fields of cardiovascular clinical trials and cardiovascular safety to discuss the issues and develop recommendations. Attendees included representatives from pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies, endpoint adjudication specialist groups, contract research organizations, and active, academically based physicians.

There was wide and solid consensus that NOACs overall offer improvements in convenience, efficacy, and safety compared with warfarin, even without reversal agents. Still, it was broadly accepted that it would be helpful to have reversal agents available for clinicians to use.

### Outcomes and drivers of inappropriate dosing of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112PqkuP]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines and in accordance with the Centre for Review and Dissemination Handbook. The protocol was preregistered on the PROSPERO register of systematic reviews.

Published literature was captured through searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Econlit, PubMed, and NHS EEDs databases. The searches were conducted on 12 October 2020 and included material from 2008 (see online supplemental S1, Search strategy for the full search strategy).

Conference proceedings were date-limited to 2018–2020. The Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (Clarivate Analytics) and the Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research conference databases were searched alongside a search of Embase limited to conference proceedings. The European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association were hand-searched by a researcher (CC).

Studies were screened by two researchers independently (AW and HS) based initially on study title and abstract and subsequently on full text. Disagreements over study eligibility were resolved by a third researcher (AC).

English language studies were included if they examined outcomes of, or factors associated with, inappropriate NOAC dosing (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) for adult patients with…

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-Vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^114zrT3G]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The effect of medication adherence among patients prescribed NOACs has not been adequately assessed at the time of writing. Medication nonadherence is a very common and perplexing issue. Approximately 50% of patients fail to comply with their prescribed medication regimen, independent of sex, age, and medical condition. Most NOACs have a short half-life, ranging from 6 to 8 hours (apixaban and edoxaban) to 12 to 17 hours (dabigatran and rivaroxaban). The half-life of betrixaban is 37 hours. Warfarin has an average half-life of 40 to 60 hours. For this reason, medication nonadherence will be less tolerated with NOACs compared to warfarin.

In a small cohort of 347 patients studied over a year, 36% of out-of-range INRs were caused by nonadherence. Warfarin nonadherence is associated with increased health-related costs. In a recent real-world analysis of over 36,000 patients with nonvalvular AF, there was concerningly low adherence to NOAC therapy with the proportion of days covered ranging between 69.2% and 80% over 6 months of follow-up. The cost of treatment is directly associated with medication nonadherence. NOACs are significantly more expensive compared to VKAs; the annual cost for NOACs is estimated to be around $3000 to $3500, compared to warfarin, which is around $50.

In clinical trials, given the strict protocols and close follow-up, medication nonadherence is infrequently an issue. However, adherence outside of this structured setting can be problematic.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^116xk4G9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence of NOAC use in these patients. In three single-center, single-arm, nonrandomized, open-label cohorts of 200 to 400 patients with cancer-associated VTE, treatment with rivaroxaban for 3 to 6 months was associated with VTE recurrence in 3.3% to 4.4% of cases, and major bleeding occurred in 2.2% to 2.5% of participants. There are currently several ongoing trials evaluating NOACs in the treatment of VTE in patients with cancer. Before these trials conclude, LMWH will remain the standard treatment for cancer-associated VTEs.

### Non-vitamin-K-antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after acute myocardial infarction: A network meta-analysis [^116hokiJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

We were interested in the following experimental interventions: dabigatran-based therapy (i.e. dabigatran in combination with SAPT or DAPT), rivaroxaban-based therapy (i.e. rivaroxaban in combination with SAPT or DAPT), apixaban-based therapy (i.e. apixaban in combination with SAPT or DAPT), and edoxaban-based therapy (i.e. edoxaban in combination with SAPT or DAPT). Eligible controls were placebo, an antiplatelet-based antithrombotic strategy (SAPT/DAPT), or both.

We included trials comparing any type of NOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) with control, and head-to-head trials of different NOACs. Our assessment involved both direct and indirect comparisons. For direct comparisons, we investigated the efficacy and safety of each individual NOAC when compared to placebo. For indirect comparisons, we explored how NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) performed relative to one another.

We excluded NOACs that were not licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) due to lack of safety or effectiveness (e.g. betrixaban, darexaban, eribaxaban, letaxaban, nokxaban, AZD-0837, fidexaban, LY517717, odiparcil, otamixaban, TTP889, and ximelagatran), as they were not clinically relevant. We assumed that people who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were equally eligible to be randomized to any of the interventions we planned to compare.

### Efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: direct and adjusted indirect meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114E5r44]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

Patients' characteristics: There were 16,701 patients in the efficacy analysis (recurrence of acute venous thromboembolism) and 16,611 in the safety analysis (major bleeding and all-cause mortality). The mean age of patients ranged from 54–60 years, and 47–54% were men. Trauma/surgery and previous acute venous thromboembolism were the most common associated risk factors described, though not all studies reported the same risk factors. In the comparison arms, the international normalised ratio (INR) was moderately well controlled, with 50–63% of measurements in the target range.

- **Primary analysis: Stratification by drug name**: For acute venous thromboembolism, we found no evidence of difference between any of the novel oral anticoagulants and the vitamin K antagonists for each comparison. In the major bleeding meta-analysis, the only drug associated with a decreased risk of major bleeding was rivaroxaban (relative risk 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.84), with no evidence of heterogeneity between studies (I² = 0%). For all-cause mortality, there was no evidence of differences in outcome between any of the novel oral anticoagulants and conventional treatment, with no evidence of heterogeneity between studies.

### The status of new anticoagulants [^1133Gdny]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Currently available anticoagulants include heparin, low-molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux, and warfarin. Despite advances with low-molecular weight heparin and fondaparinux, these currently available agents have limitations, which have provided the impetus for the development of new drugs for the prevention and treatment of both venous and arterial thromboembolism. Novel anticoagulants targeting specific steps in coagulation are in various stages of development. This paper reviews the pharmacology of these new agents and describes the results of clinical trials with new anticoagulants in more advanced stages of clinical testing.

### Effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111E5b6k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In this meta-analysis of four RCTs comparing NOACs and warfarin in over 70,000 AF patients, we found that one-fifth of patients with "nonvalvular" AF had moderate or severe VHD. AF patients with VHD were at modestly higher risk of all-cause mortality and major bleeding than those without VHD. Importantly, the benefits of NOACs in comparison with warfarin in reducing stroke or systemic embolism were consistent in AF patients with or without VHD.

Prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with AF cannot be overemphasized. Traditionally, the vitamin K antagonists, notably warfarin, have been the cornerstone for stroke prevention in patients with AF; however, warfarin has a narrow window of therapeutic benefit, marked variation in its effect in different patients, a need for a long-term coagulation monitor, and increased risks of major bleeding, especially devastating intracranial hemorrhage.

Although the original individual NOAC trials were designed as noninferiority trials and not superiority, this meta-analysis of the pooled trials shows the NOACs, in aggregate, to be superior to warfarin for patients both with and without VHD. We observed substantial heterogeneity in major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage endpoints among AF patients with VHD for which dabigatran, edoxaban, and apixaban reduced major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage versus warfarin, whereas rivaroxaban appeared to increase major bleeding and did not reduce intracranial hemorrhage. Although rivaroxaban significantly reduced intracranial hemorrhage overall in the ROCKET trial, this effect was not consistent across all cases studied.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^115GWqZC]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Why assess anticoagulant activity?

When a patient presents in the ED and is known or suspected to be on oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, it is often helpful to measure the level of anticoagulation. This need arises in various situations:

- **Overdose scenarios**: The patient has unintentionally or intentionally overdosed on the OAC. There are no related symptoms; for example, in the case of warfarin, the patient's routine monitoring might show an overly elevated INR value due to an overdose or a pharmacological interaction.

- **Bleeding episodes**: The patient is experiencing a spontaneous episode of external or internal bleeding, or the latter may be suspected. Alternatively, the patient has suffered an injury causing external or internal bleeding.

- **Pre-surgical assessments**: An urgent surgical or other invasive procedure is deemed necessary because of trauma or acute illness. It is essential for the surgical team to know the level of anticoagulation in the patient.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: Propensity weighted nationwide cohort study [^1165tqqE]. BMJ (2016). High credibility.

In this large comparative effectiveness and safety analysis of NOAC drugs and warfarin from a routine care setting, we found that non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (novel oral anticoagulants, NOACs) are overall safe and effective alternatives to warfarin treatment.

We observed differential prescribing of different non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in relation to patient characteristics. For example, dabigatran was preferentially prescribed in younger patients with a lower risk of stroke and less renal impairment. For ischemic stroke only, no significant differences were evident between NOACs and warfarin; however, for the combined endpoint of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, rivaroxaban was associated with a lower risk than warfarin, with dabigatran and apixaban showing no significant differences. Apixaban and dabigatran were associated with a significantly lower risk of death compared with rivaroxaban or warfarin. The endpoints of any bleeding or major bleeding were significantly lower for apixaban and dabigatran than for rivaroxaban or warfarin; the last two drugs had similar profiles for bleeding risk.

### Pattern and impact of off-label underdosing of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation who are indicated for standard dosing [^1179JB6B]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

With safety concerns about increasing bleeding, off-label underdosing of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants (NOACs) is common in East Asian patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated the pattern of NOAC underdosing and associated clinical outcomes in patients with AF who are indicated for standard dosing. Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, we evaluated 16,568 patients with a new prescription of NOAC who are indicated for standard NOAC dosing and compared 4,536 patients with warfarin with respect to thromboembolic events (ischemic stroke or systemic embolization), all-cause mortality, and major bleeding.

Of the 16,568 patients indicated for standard NOAC dosing, 8,549 (51.9%) received off-label underdosing (50.6% rivaroxaban, 53.0% apixaban). During a median follow-up of 15.0 months, compared with warfarin, underdosing of rivaroxaban was associated with lower risks of major thromboembolic events (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41 to 0.69) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.82), and a similar risk of major bleeding (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.46). However, underdosing of apixaban was associated with similar risks of major thromboembolic events (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.16), all-cause mortality (HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.24), and major bleeding (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.17).

In conclusion, in this Korean population with AF who are indicated for standard NOAC dosing, off-label underdosing is common, and its clinical benefit over warfarin was inconsistent according to types of NOAC.

### Primary and secondary prevention with new oral anticoagulant drugs for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: Indirect comparison analysis [^116dopcv]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

- **Overall effect of novel oral anticoagulants versus warfarin**: In the secondary prevention cohort, for any novel oral anticoagulant (dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, apixaban, rivaroxaban) versus warfarin, we found significant reductions in hemorrhagic stroke (P = 0.001), major bleeding (P = 0.012), and intracranial bleeding (P < 0.001).

In the primary prevention cohort, for any novel oral anticoagulant (dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, apixaban, rivaroxaban) versus warfarin, we found significant reductions in stroke/systemic embolism (P = 0.019), stroke (P = 0.022), hemorrhagic stroke (P < 0.001), disabling/fatal stroke (P = 0.005), and death (P = 0.03). In terms of safety endpoints, less major bleeding and intracranial bleeding occurred (both P < 0.001).

When we used dabigatran 150 mg twice daily for this pooled analysis — that is, novel oral anticoagulant (dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, apixaban, rivaroxaban) versus warfarin — we still found significant reductions in stroke/systemic embolism and stroke (both P < 0.001).

### Efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: Direct and adjusted indirect meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116smKPH]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to critically review the effectiveness of novel oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, ximelagatran, and apixaban) in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism.

- **Design**: Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis. Data were extracted independently by two investigators. An adjusted indirect comparison was performed to compare novel oral anticoagulants.

- **Data sources**: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to April 2012), along with hand searching relevant scientific works and contact with experts.

- **Study selection**: Randomised controlled trials of novel oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists for acute venous thromboembolism. Selected outcomes included re-events, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, involving 16,701 patients evaluated for efficacy and 16,611 for safety. Data were stratified according to different novel oral anticoagulants. For recurrent acute venous thromboembolism, there were no significant differences in event rates between any of the anticoagulants and conventional treatment: rivaroxaban (four studies): relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.31; dabigatran (two studies): 1.09, 0.76 to 1.57; ximelagatran (two studies): 1.06, 0.62 to 1.80; and apixaban (one study): 0.98, 0.20 to 4.79. Rivaroxaban reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with conventional treatment (0.57, 0.39 to 0.84), whereas other novel oral anticoagulants did not (0.76, 0.49 to 1.18 for dabigatran; 0.54, 0.28 to 1.03 for ximelagatran; 2.95, 0.12 to 71).

### Effectiveness and safety of contemporary oral anticoagulants among Asians with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^115kW5Yw]. Stroke (2019). Low credibility.

Limited evidence exists on the effectiveness and safety of warfarin and all four available non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) from clinical practice in the Asian population with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of warfarin and four NOACs.

We studied a retrospective nonrandomized observational cohort of oral anticoagulant-naïve nonvalvular patients with atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin or NOACs (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, or edoxaban) from January 2015 to December 2017, based on the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. For the comparisons, warfarin to four NOACs and NOAC to NOAC comparison cohorts were balanced using the inverse probability of treatment weighting. Ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, major bleeding, and a composite clinical outcome were evaluated.

A total of 116,804 patients were included (25,420 with warfarin; 35,965 with rivaroxaban; 17,745 with dabigatran; 22,177 with apixaban; and 15,496 with edoxaban). Compared with warfarin, all NOACs were associated with lower risks of ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, major bleeding, and composite outcome. Apixaban and edoxaban showed a lower rate of ischemic stroke compared with rivaroxaban and dabigatran. Apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban had a lower rate of gastrointestinal bleeding and major bleeding compared with rivaroxaban. The composite clinical outcome was not significantly different for apixaban.

### Effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulants among nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients [^112rmjqG]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Some literature has proposed hypotheses on potential differences in clinical outcomes between patients with different NOAC treatments based on existing pharmacological differences across NOACs. A pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study suggested that once-daily dosing may potentially increase absolute patient adherence, but twice-daily dosing regimens may be more forgiving among patients with suboptimal adherence because of lower peak levels and higher trough levels of drug concentration. Rivaroxaban should be taken together with an evening meal, as this increases bioavailability. In a recent US real-world study, about one-third of rivaroxaban users did not take rivaroxaban with an adequate meal. Apixaban and dabigatran do not demonstrate the same degree of food effect. However, no study has formally tested the causal relationship between pharmacological differences and clinical outcomes.

- **Clinical pharmacology of oral anticoagulants**: Please note that our NOAC versus NOAC comparisons are for hypothesis generation only. Those results should be interpreted with caution and need to be confirmed by findings from NOAC versus NOAC RCTs, which are expected to be released in the upcoming years. For example, the DARING-AF trial (Comparison of Efficacy and Safety Among Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, and Apixaban in Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation; Unique identifier: NCT02666157) in Taiwan and the DANNOAC-AF trial (The Danish Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulation Study: A Cluster Randomized Study Comparing Safety and Efficacy of Edoxaban, Apixaban, Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran) are anticipated.

### Outcome of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with different oral anticoagulants [^111YP3X5]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Our study has important strengths. We include a large cohort of patients with both NOAC-ICH and VKA-ICH. The use of detailed individual patient clinical and radiologic data allowed us to describe baseline characteristics and key clinically relevant outcomes beyond the acute phase of hospital admission, and to adjust for important potential confounding factors. Because we included prospectively collected clinical data from Europe, North America, East Asia, and Australasia, our findings are likely to be more generalizable to a real-life OAC-ICH population in a broad range of healthcare settings. We reduced bias from secular treatment trends by only including NOAC-ICH and VKA-ICH recruited during the same time period, and from the same patient population, from each participating center. Our primary outcome of 90-day mortality is unlikely to be substantially confounded by premorbid functional status.

We also acknowledge limitations. Functional outcome at 90 days would have been a preferable secondary outcome to discharge mRS, as it is less confounded by length of stay, but these data were not available. We do not know how widely NOAC adoption was within each source population, which could lead to confounding by indication. Although we compared and adjusted for baseline characteristics between NOAC-ICH and VKA-ICH patients, there might be unmeasured confounding factors, including clinician judgment used in choosing between a VKA or a NOAC, alcohol intake, blood pressure variability, or comorbidities such as renal disease, which we could not fully account for.

### New oral anticoagulants in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^113539MM]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The choice of an oral anticoagulant (OAC) for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a major and complex clinical decision, taking into account the individual risk-benefit ratio while considering the chronic nature of therapy. This review focuses on the safety and efficacy of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared with conventional vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with NVAF. Data suggest that NOACs are at least as effective and safe as VKAs for most NVAF patients. Unlike VKAs, NOACs do not require dietary restrictions or regular pharmacodynamic monitoring and appear to have a lower incidence of intracranial or fatal bleeding.

However, both dabigatran 150 mg twice daily and rivaroxaban have a slightly higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding compared to VKAs. The article delineates the knowledge and scientific gaps related to the choice and dosage of anticoagulation regimens for various NVAF subsets and addresses certain common clinical scenarios requiring special considerations. Additionally, the article highlights the shortcomings of NOACs: lack of therapeutic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets, absence of tools to assess compliance and efficacy, rigid and limited dosage options, and the absence of effective and inexpensive reversal agents.

### Defining nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: A quest for clarification [^1176E2p1]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are currently recommended for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation since the publication of the four major pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of factor IIa and factor Xa inhibitors. The definition of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is unclear, varying from one trial to another and even between North American and European guidelines, which is a source of uncertainties in clinical practice. However, many patients with atrial fibrillation present signs of valvular involvement, and clarification of this term is needed to ensure NOACs are not denied to patients based on the incorrect perception that they may have valvular atrial fibrillation.

The currently unique contraindications to NOACs are patients with mechanical heart valves and those with moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, as stated by the recent 2015 position paper of the European Heart Rhythm Association. Patients with native heart valve involvement, regardless of their severity, are suitable for NOAC therapy. Patients with bioprosthetic heart valves and mitral valve repair may be suitable for NOACs except for the first 3 and the first 3–6 months postoperatively, respectively. Patients with transaortic valve implantation or percutaneous transluminal aortic valvuloplasty are also considered eligible for NOACs, although the bleeding risk must be carefully considered in this population often requiring a combination with antiplatelet therapy.

Future studies are warranted to increase the level of evidence for the use of NOACs, particularly in patients with transaortic valve interventions.

### Efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: Direct and adjusted indirect meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116kySPE]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

The novel oral anticoagulants have been tested in clinical trials for other indications, including thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation, medical and surgical inpatients, and acute coronary syndromes. These studies often used different doses than those used in the acute venous thromboembolism studies. In addition, the comparator arm might have been placebo, parenteral anticoagulants, or vitamin K antagonists, depending on the study.

For example, patients with acute coronary syndromes were at a higher risk of bleeding (2.2% for rivaroxaban in the ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial) as they were typically treated with antiplatelet agents. In contrast, in atrial fibrillation studies, the novel oral anticoagulants were associated with a similar risk of major bleeding (relative risk 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.09). In our study, the rate of major bleeding in the included studies ranged from 0.4% to 1.73%.

Similarly, after lower limb orthopedic surgery, patients have a lower risk of first acute venous thromboembolism (0.5–1.0%) than the higher risk of recurrent acute venous thromboembolism seen in the trials analyzed in our study (1.4–4.6%). Thus, we believe that comparison of our results with these prophylaxis studies would be invalid. In line with the results from these studies, however, it seems that novel oral anticoagulants might be an effective and safe alternative to conventional treatment for acute venous thromboembolism.

### Efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: Direct and adjusted indirect meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113BAKpi]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

This systematic review, meta-analysis, and adjusted indirect comparison of the novel oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism showed no significant differences in the risk of recurrence and the risk of all-cause mortality. There was a significant reduction in major bleeding with rivaroxaban. The magnitude of the reduction in major bleeding was less apparent for other novel oral anticoagulants and did not reach significance. Importantly, the sample sizes of the individual randomised controlled trials included in our meta-analysis were too small to provide reliable conclusions about the efficacy and safety of the novel oral anticoagulants. By pooling data across trials, we reduced the uncertainty surrounding the treatment effects and obtained more precise 95% confidence intervals.

- **Novel findings**: As far as we know, this study is the first overall analysis of the novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. The clinical trials in our systematic review were all funded by industry and powered for dose finding or for non-inferiority compared with conventional treatment. The non-inferiority design has certain advantages, such as potentially reducing the sample size, and the results can often be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval, but there are important nuances to their interpretation. The most important factor is the size of the "margin of inferiority", which in the aforementioned studies was the upper confidence limit for the target event's hazard ratio (2.0 in EINSTEIN).

### New oral anticoagulants vs. warfarin treatment: No need for pharmacogenomics [^1111SqC1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

For patients requiring long-term anticoagulation, oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin have overwhelming efficacy data but present significant challenges. In addition to the potential exposure to numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions, patients receiving warfarin require frequent monitoring. It had been hoped that the integration of pharmacogenomic with clinical information would improve anticoagulation control with warfarin, but trials have not supported this aim. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer both advantages and disadvantages and deserve consideration in appropriate patients.

### New oral anticoagulants: Which one should my patient use [^113GEt11]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacologic and clinical features that distinguish them from warfarin.

- **Pharmacology comparison**: This paper compares the pharmacology of the new oral anticoagulants with that of warfarin.
- **Class effects and differentiating features**: It identifies the class effects of these drugs and their differentiating features.
- **Indications review**: It reviews their indications, helping clinicians make informed decisions.

### Managing novel orally administered anticoagulants in patients undergoing urogynaecological surgery [^113Lzvoq]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Use of novel orally administered anticoagulant agents (NOACs) presents new challenges to clinicians in the perioperative care of patients undergoing urogynaecological surgery. We aimed to assess evidence for managing patients taking NOACs before and after urogynaecological surgery. A literature search was conducted in CINAHL, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, and PubMed for original research articles in English on this topic. Despite initially identifying 556 articles, no articles pertained specifically to the use of NOACs in urogynaecological surgery. Therefore, we reviewed national and international guidelines on managing patients prescribed NOACs and created a concise guideline to assist urogynaecologists in the perioperative care of these patients. Consensus is needed on the perioperative optimization of anticoagulation in urogynaecological patients using NOACs.

### Managing new oral anticoagulants in the perioperative and intensive care unit setting [^114xBEs7]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Managing patients in the perioperative setting who are receiving novel oral anticoagulation agents for thromboprophylaxis or stroke prevention with atrial fibrillation is an important consideration for clinicians. The novel oral anticoagulation agents include direct Factor Xa inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. In elective surgery, discontinuing their use is important, but renal function must also be considered because elimination is highly dependent on renal function.

- **Bleeding management**: If bleeding occurs in patients who have received these agents, common principles of bleeding management, as with any anticoagulant (including the known principles for warfarin), should be considered.

This review summarizes the available data regarding the management of bleeding with novel oral anticoagulation agents. Hemodialysis is a therapeutic option for dabigatran-related bleeding, while in vitro studies have shown that prothrombin complex concentrates can be useful for rivaroxaban-related bleeding. Additional clinical studies are needed to determine the best method for reversal of the novel oral anticoagulation agents when bleeding occurs.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: A network meta-analysis [^116NMbo6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of individual antiembolic interventions in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF): novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban; vitamin K antagonists (VKA); aspirin; and the Watchman device.

- **Methods and results**: A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was performed. RCTs that included patients with prosthetic cardiac valves or mitral stenosis, had a mean or median follow-up of less than 6 months, included fewer than 200 participants, lacked a published report in English, or were NOAC phase II studies were excluded. The placebo/control arm received either placebo or no treatment.

	- The primary efficacy outcome was the combination of stroke (of any type) and systemic embolism. All-cause mortality served as a secondary efficacy outcome. The primary safety outcome was the combination of major extracranial bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. A total of 21 RCTs (96,017 nonvalvular AF patients; median age, 72 years; 65% males; median follow-up, 1.7 years) were included. Compared to placebo/control, the use of aspirin (odds ratio [OR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.60–0.95]), VKA (0.38 [0.29–0.49]), apixaban (0.31 [0.22–0.45]), dabigatran (0.29 [0.20–0.43]), edoxaban (0.38 [0.26–0.54]), rivaroxaban (0.27 [0.18–0.42]), and the Watchman device (0.36 [0.16–0.80]) significantly reduced the risk of any stroke or systemic embolism in nonvalvular AF patients, as well as all-cause mortality (aspirin: OR, 0.82 [0.68–0.99]; VKA: 0.69 [0.57–0.85]; apixaban: 0.62 [0.50–0.78]; dabigatran: 0.62 [0.50–0.]).

### Laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effects of the next generation of oral anticoagulants [^115cTzmA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

In contrast to vitamin K antagonists, which reduce the functional levels of several coagulation factors, the new oral anticoagulants specifically target either thrombin or factor Xa. These new agents have such predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that routine coagulation monitoring is unnecessary. However, there are still some situations in which measurement of anticoagulant effect may be required. The coagulation assays that are used to monitor heparin derivatives or vitamin K antagonists may not always accurately reflect the anticoagulant activity of the new oral anticoagulants, and specialized assays may be needed.

- **Identification of situations**: Situations in which assessment of anticoagulant effect may aid treatment decisions are identified.

- **Effects on coagulation tests**: The effects of the new oral anticoagulants on the various coagulation tests are described.

- **Review of specialized assays**: Specialized coagulation assays that have been developed to measure the anticoagulant effects of the new oral anticoagulants are reviewed.

- **Clinical perspective**: A clinical perspective on the role of coagulation testing in the clinical management of patients treated with the new oral anticoagulants is provided.

### Overview of the new oral anticoagulants: Opportunities and challenges [^115fJxv8]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are replacing warfarin for many indications. These agents include dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin, and rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, which inhibit factor Xa. All four agents are licensed in the United States for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Additionally, rivaroxaban and apixaban are approved for thromboprophylaxis after elective hip or knee arthroplasty. The NOACs are at least as effective as warfarin and are more convenient to administer because they can be given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. They are also safer due to their association with reduced intracranial bleeding.

As part of a theme series on the NOACs, this article:

- **Compares the pharmacological profiles**: Examines the differences between the NOACs and warfarin.
- **Identifies the doses**: Lists the NOACs' approved doses for each indication.
- **Provides an overview of phase III trials**: Summarizes completed trials involving NOACs.
- **Discusses ongoing studies**: Reviews current research on NOACs for new indications.
- **Reviews emerging real-world data**: Highlights recent observational data on NOACs.
- **Highlights opportunities and challenges**: Explores the potential benefits and remaining challenges associated with NOACs.

### Reversing targeted oral anticoagulants [^1117KbrW]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2014).

Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are orally active anticoagulants approved in many countries. Dabigatran inhibits thrombin, whereas rivaroxaban and apixaban are factor Xa inhibitors. In clinical trials, these novel oral anticoagulants were at least as effective as warfarin for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but had a lower rate of serious bleeding. However, the lack of true antidotes for these agents has caused concern when patients suffer life-threatening bleeding or trauma or require emergent invasive procedures. True antidotes are under development for all of these agents.

In the meantime, activated and nonactivated prothrombin complex concentrates have been used as reversal agents. Factor VIIa may also be effective for reversal of the factor Xa inhibitors. Reversal of novel oral anticoagulants by these hemostatic agents has not been studied in bleeding human patients, so their true efficacy and appropriate dosing are not known.

### Comparison of the effectiveness and safety of apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin in newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation [^117VYEnb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

No studies have performed direct pairwise comparisons of the effectiveness and safety of warfarin and the new oral anticoagulants (NOACs): apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban. Using claims data from 2013 to 2014, derived from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, we identified patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who initiated treatment with apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, warfarin, or no oral anticoagulation therapy during that period.

Outcomes included the composite of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism (SE), and death, any bleeding event, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and treatment persistence. We constructed Cox proportional hazard models to compare outcomes between each pair of treatment groups. The composite risk of ischemic stroke, SE, and death was lower for NOACs than for warfarin: hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.98 for apixaban; 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86 for dabigatran; and 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89 for rivaroxaban, all compared with warfarin. There were no differences in effectiveness across NOACs.

The risk of any bleeding was lower with apixaban than with warfarin, but higher with rivaroxaban than with warfarin. Apixaban (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79) and dabigatran (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92) were associated with a lower bleeding risk than rivaroxaban. Treatment persistence was highest for apixaban (82%) and lowest for dabigatran and warfarin (64%) (p < 0.001). Compared with warfarin, NOACs are more effective in preventing stroke, but their risk of bleeding varies, with rivaroxaban having a higher risk than warfarin.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^114hty2c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

- **Cost analysis**: DOACs have quickly gained popularity as an alternative anticoagulation strategy and have surpassed VKAs as first‐line agents due to improved clinical outcomes, simplicity of dosing, lack of monitoring requirements, and an expanding list of indications. All DOACs are currently branded medications; therefore, cost remains a significant barrier to access. Apixaban was recently granted generic approval at the end of 2019, but product availability is not expected for several more years. The cost and generic status of the other DOACs remain unknown. While DOACs are substantially more expensive than VKA, laboratory monitoring costs are reduced since INR monitoring is not required. US cost analyses have shown that apixaban has the highest quality‐adjusted life year for stroke prevention in NVAF patients, followed by dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and the lowest being warfarin. A recent study demonstrated that dabigatran was associated with lower all‐cause costs and healthcare resource use compared with rivaroxaban, while having similar all‐cause costs and hospitalizations compared with apixaban, but higher outpatient and pharmacy healthcare resource use.

In the United States, commercially insured patients are eligible for time‐limited programs to reduce out‐of‐pocket expenses using manufacturer copayment cards, often limiting patient costs to ≤ $10 per month. Federally funded patients (Medicare, Medicaid, etc) are ineligible for these programs. Despite the cost, from 2010 to 2017 there was a dramatic increase in the use of DOACs for NVAF.

### Outcomes and drivers of inappropriate dosing of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113WQr2L]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to assess both the clinical and economic outcomes of inappropriate NOAC dosing, as well as the drivers of inappropriate NOAC dosing.

- **Strengths and limitations**: While observational studies are a valuable source of information for understanding NOAC dosing in clinical practice, the summary effects reported may be biased due to the limitations of the primary studies in controlling for both measured and unmeasured confounders. For key variables, this review applied definitions used by the included studies. There was often a lack of clarity over definitions such as 'history of minor bleed', while definitions for inappropriate NOAC dosing may vary according to local guidelines. The outcome 'all-cause mortality' offers no further insight into specific causes of mortality driving observed trends. Understanding the causes of death in the underdosed group is an important avenue for further research to fully understand the potential detrimental impacts of inappropriate NOAC dosing.

### Efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: Direct and adjusted indirect meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1175sS2C]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

To critically review the effectiveness of the novel oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, ximelagatran, and apixaban) in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, a systematic review and random effects meta-analysis were conducted. Data were extracted independently by two investigators. An adjusted indirect comparison was performed to compare the novel oral anticoagulants.

The data sources included Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to April 2012, supplemented by hand searching of relevant scientific works and consultation with experts. The study selection involved randomised controlled trials of novel oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists for acute venous thromboembolism. Selected outcomes were recurrent events, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality.

Results from nine studies met the inclusion criteria, with 16,701 patients evaluated for efficacy and 16,611 for safety. Data were stratified according to different novel oral anticoagulants. For recurrent acute venous thromboembolism, there were no significant differences in event rates between any of the anticoagulants and conventional treatment: rivaroxaban (four studies) (relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.31); dabigatran (two studies) (1.09, 0.76 to 1.57); ximelagatran (two studies) (1.06, 0.62 to 1.80); and apixaban (one study) (0.98, 0.20 to 4.79). Rivaroxaban reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with conventional treatment (0.57, 0.39 to 0.84), whereas other novel oral anticoagulants did not: 0.76 (0.49 to 1.18) for dabigatran; 0.54 (0.28 to 1.03) for ximelagatran.

The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the anti-Xa agents rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban represent a new generation of oral anticoagulants. Their primary advantage over vitamin K antagonists is the lack of a need for monitoring and dose adjustment. However, their main disadvantage is the current absence of a specific reversal agent.

Dabigatran's absorption, unlike the anti-Xa agents, can be reduced by activated charcoal if administered shortly after ingestion, and it can be removed from the blood through hemodialysis. Prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, and recombinant factor VIIa all show some activity in reversing the anticoagulant effect of these drugs, based on ex vivo, animal, and volunteer studies. It remains unclear which, if any, of these drugs is the most suitable for emergency reversal.

Three novel molecules — idarucizumab, andexanet, and PER977 — may offer the most effective and safest way of reversal. These agents are currently in premarketing studies.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111c959K]. Circulation. Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2012). Low credibility.

Dabigatran, an oral thrombin inhibitor, and rivaroxaban and apixaban, oral factor Xa inhibitors, have been found to be safe and effective in reducing stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of the three new agents based on data from their published warfarin-controlled randomized trials, using the method of adjusted indirect comparisons.

- **Methods and results**: We included findings from 44,535 patients enrolled in three trials of the efficacy of dabigatran (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy [RELY]), apixaban (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE]), and rivaroxaban (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation [ROCKET-AF]), each compared with warfarin. The primary efficacy endpoint was stroke or systemic embolism; the safety endpoint we studied was major hemorrhage. To address a lack of comparability between trial populations caused by the restriction of ROCKET-AF to high-risk patients, we conducted a subgroup analysis in patients with a CHADS(2) score ≥ 3. We found no statistically significant efficacy differences among the three drugs, although apixaban and dabigatran were numerically superior to rivaroxaban. Apixaban produced significantly fewer major hemorrhages than dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

- **Conclusions**: An indirect comparison of new anticoagulants based on existing trial data indicates that in patients with a CHADS(2) score ≥ 3, apixaban produced significantly fewer major hemorrhages than dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

### The periprocedural management of novel oral anticoagulants in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: Rationale and a summary of the available evidence from phase 3 clinical trials [^115poxqg]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have rapidly emerged as an alternative therapy to warfarin. Several recent phase 3 randomized control trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the NOACs in the treatment for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. As NOACs are incorporated into clinical practice, questions have begun to arise concerning their optimal use in commonly encountered situations.

In this review, we provide a summary of the available evidence from the phase 3 randomized control trials specifically with regard to one such scenario: the periprocedural management of NOACs. Our goal is to provide guidance for practicing clinicians.

### What surgeons should know about non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants: A review [^112CpLiu]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly prescribed for patients to treat or prevent arterial or venous thromboembolism. The following four NOAC agents are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for clinical use: dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, edoxaban tosylate, and rivaroxaban. A good understanding of these agents' pharmacologic properties is important for surgeons given their marked differences compared with warfarin sodium. This review highlights key practical issues surrounding the use of NOACs in the perioperative setting.

The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English-language studies from May 1, 2009, until May 1, 2017, for randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, observational studies, and clinical guidelines. From a systematic review of the published literature that included 70 articles and 166,404 patients, this study identified five key practical issues surrounding the use of NOACs in the perioperative setting. These include patient populations for which NOAC use is indicated and contraindicated, the timing of NOAC treatment cessation before invasive interventions, management of NOAC-treated patients requiring urgent interventions, the need for "bridging", and the timing of NOAC treatment's reinitiation after invasive interventions.

Important findings are as follows: NOAC agents are not recommended for patients with mechanical heart valves or advanced kidney disease (creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min); minimal to no anticoagulant effect remains when therapy with a NOAC is w

### New anticoagulants: Moving beyond the direct oral anticoagulants [^116H6o4p]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants have been in use for more than 80 years, with heparin and vitamin K antagonists being the sole options until recently. While these agents revolutionized the prevention and treatment of thrombotic diseases, their use has been hampered by the necessity for coagulation monitoring and bleeding complications, resulting in part from their multiple sites of action.

Owing to advances in basic science, animal models, and epidemiology, the arsenal of available anticoagulants has expanded in the past two decades. This evolution has yielded many novel compounds that target single coagulation enzymes. Initially, thrombin and factor Xa were targeted due to their critical roles in coagulation. However, attention has shifted to compounds targeting upstream reactions, particularly those catalyzed by factors XIIa and XIa, which are part of the contact system.

This shift is predicated on epidemiological and experimental evidence suggesting that these factors are more important for thrombosis than for hemostasis. With the goal of developing a new class of anticoagulants associated with a lower risk of bleeding than currently available agents, dozens of drugs targeting the contact system are now in development. This article focuses on the rationale, development, and testing of these new agents, concentrating on those that have reached or completed phase 2 evaluation for at least one indication.

### New oral anticoagulants and the cancer patient [^111VqvWr]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

Indications for anticoagulation are common in patients with malignancy. Cancer patients have an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolic events or may have other indications for anticoagulation, such as atrial fibrillation. New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are now available that offer increased options for anticoagulation beyond the traditional vitamin K antagonists and low molecular weight heparins that have long been the cornerstone of treatment. This review will focus on the three NOACs that are currently approved for use in the U.S.: the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban. Oncologists are likely to encounter an increasing number of patients taking these agents at the time of their cancer diagnosis or to have patients who develop indications for anticoagulation during the course of their disease. The basic pharmacology, clinical indications, and approach to the use of NOACs in the cancer patient will be reviewed.

### Is there a role for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic-guided dosing for novel oral anticoagulants [^115zT2yG]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The novel direct oral anticoagulants (NOACs) represent a major advance in oral anticoagulant therapy and are replacing vitamin K antagonists as the preferred options for many indications. Given in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring, they have been shown to be at least as effective in reducing thromboembolic stroke as dose-adjusted warfarin in phase 3 randomized trials and are less likely to cause hemorrhagic stroke.

Pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic subanalyses of the major NOAC trials in patients with atrial fibrillation have established relationships between clinical characteristics, and drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic responses with both efficacy and safety. Based on these analyses, pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulatory authorities have provided contraindications and dosing recommendations based on clinical characteristics that are associated with drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic responses, stroke reduction, and bleeding risk to optimize the risk-benefit profile of the NOACs in the real world.

The fixed-dosing strategy of NOACs has triggered discussions about the potential value of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment in customizing drug exposure to further improve the safety and efficacy of the NOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation. As there is neither high-quality evidence nor consensus about the potential role of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment for the NOACs, a Cardiac Research Safety Consortium "Think Tank" meeting was held at the American College of Cardiology Heart House in December 2015 to discuss these issues.

### Effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113DUepq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The original non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) trials in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) enrolled patients with native valve pathologies. The object of this study was to quantify the benefit-risk profiles of NOACs versus warfarin in AF patients with native valvular heart disease (VHD).

- **Methods and results**: Trials were identified by exhaustive literature search. Trial data were combined using inverse variance weighting to produce a meta-analytic summary hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of efficacy and safety of NOACs versus warfarin. Our final analysis included four randomized controlled trials that enrolled 71,526 participants, including 13,574 with VHD. Pooling results from included trials showed that NOACs versus warfarin reduced stroke or systemic embolism (HR: 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60–0.82) and intracranial hemorrhage (HR: 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24–0.92) in AF patients with VHD.

	- However, risk reduction of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage was driven by apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran (HR for major bleeding: 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69–0.91]; HR for intracranial hemorrhage: 0.33 [95% CI, 0.25–0.45]) but not rivaroxaban (HR for major bleeding: 1.56 [95% CI, 1.20–2.04]; HR for intracranial hemorrhage: 1.27 [95% CI, 0.77–2.10]).

- **Conclusions**: Among patients with AF and native VHD, NOACs reduce stroke and systemic embolism compared with warfarin. Evidence shows that apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban also reduce bleeding in this patient subgroup, whereas major bleeding (but not intracranial hemorrhage or mortality rate) is significantly reduced.

### Oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation at low stroke risk: a multicentre observational study [^115xufEb]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic treatment

We considered three levels of anticoagulant treatment status: no treatment, NOAC treatment, and VKA treatment. A patient's baseline treatment status was defined in the 90 days prior to the cohort entry date. If a patient did not claim a NOAC or VKA during this period, the patient was considered untreated at baseline.

We excluded all patients claiming both a VKA and a NOAC prescription in the 90 days prior to cohort entry date, as well as patients claiming a prescription for antiplatelet treatment in the 90 days prior to the index date. In addition, we excluded patients who claimed either a VKA or a NOAC between 1 year prior to cohort entry date and 90 days prior to cohort entry date to only include new users of VKAs and NOACs.

Study design

The main analysis in this study allocated patients to a treatment arm when they claimed at least one prescription of an OAC, mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis. The person-time prior to the first claim is considered as untreated status to avoid immortal time bias. After a patient claimed their first treatment, the patient remained on that treatment status throughout the study period. If a patient did not claim any NOAC or VKA during follow-up, the patient would maintain the untreated status until the end of the study. Besides the main analysis, we also used a time-varying exposure approach mimicking an as-treated analysis. In this approach, patients could switch between treatment statuses during follow-up. A patient would switch between NOAC and VKA status after claiming a different prescription.

### Efficacy and safety considerations with dose-reduced direct oral anticoagulants: A review [^114pb5s3]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Dose-reduced regimens of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be used for two main purposes: dose-adjusted treatment intended as full-intensity anticoagulation (e.g. stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [AF] in patients requiring dose reduction) or low-intensity treatment (e.g. extended-duration treatment of venous thromboembolism [VTE]). This review examines randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to understand the scenarios in which dose-adjusted or low-intensity DOACs were tested. It also reviews the labeled indications by regulatory authorities, using data from large registries to assess whether the use of dose-reduced DOACs in routine practice aligns with the findings of RCTs.

Among 4,191 screened publications, 35 RCTs utilizing dose-adjusted DOACs were identified for dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban. Of these, 29 RCTs were related to stroke prevention in AF. Efficacy and safety results for dose-adjusted DOACs in large RCTs of AF were similar to those found for full-dose DOACs. To our knowledge, dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have not been studied as dose-adjusted therapy for acute VTE treatment.

Low-intensity DOACs were examined in 37 RCTs. These may be used for extended-duration treatment of VTE (apixaban and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in orthopedic surgeries (dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in ambulatory high-risk cancer patients (apixaban and rivaroxaban), or high-risk medical patients post-discharge (rivaroxaban). Additional applications include stable atherosclerotic vascular disease or following a recent revascularization effort.

### Comparison of novel oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116e32kX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, have been approved by international regulatory agencies to prevent venous thromboembolism and to treat atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, alterations in their metabolism in the setting of CKD may impact their efficacy and lead to an increased risk of bleeding. This review summarizes the literature on the efficacy and safety of these agents in individuals with moderate CKD.

In clinical trials, the use of NOACs in patients with moderate CKD has demonstrated efficacy and safety similar to those seen with vitamin K antagonists. However, no universal reversal agent for the anticoagulant effect of NOACs exists in the setting of bleeding. Limited data have shown that hemodialysis has been effectively used to aid in reversing the effects of dabigatran, and the use of prothrombin complex concentrate has also been used for serious and major adverse bleeding events with some success.

As the use of NOACs in patients with CKD increases, it will be important to monitor their safety. Clinicians who prescribe them should carefully monitor kidney function and recognize the potential for adverse effects.

### Novel anticoagulants and the future of anticoagulation [^114w4iNK]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Since its discovery during the first half of the 20th century by biochemists at the University of Wisconsin, warfarin (along with other vitamin K antagonists) has remained the only oral anticoagulant available to patients at risk for thromboembolism. After nearly six decades in clinical practice, we have learned much about warfarin. Although it is highly effective for most patients, warfarin has a number of undesirable attributes: significant inter- and intra-patient variability in dose-response, a narrow therapeutic index, a slow pharmacodynamic response, and numerous interactions with both diet as well as other medications.

The negative characteristics associated with warfarin have inspired many clinicians, patients, and researchers to wonder if a better alternative can be discovered. To that end, at least three novel anticoagulant compounds are in the late stages of development and several others are progressing through earlier phases of investigation. This review will summarize the latest clinical trial data pertinent to several newer antithrombotic agents and discuss recent developments that impact the safety and challenges associated with warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists (VKA).

### Novel oral anticoagulants to prevent stroke in atrial fibrillation [^113ngdqd]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Warfarin reduces the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation by around 60%, while antiplatelet therapy is much less effective. However, bleeding is a notable adverse effect with warfarin. Another major drawback of warfarin is the need for frequent clotting assessment. Oral agents have been developed that directly inhibit the activity of thrombin (factor IIa), as well as drugs that directly block activated factor X (factor Xa), which is the first enzyme in the final common pathway to the activation of thrombin. These drugs have a fast onset and offset of action, and anticoagulation does not seem to need monitoring.

These new agents for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation are being investigated in ongoing phase III trials. In one of these trials, an oral thrombin blocker has so far shown superiority to warfarin in efficacy and safety. This review addresses the potential of modern oral anticoagulants to improve stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.

### The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients-a systematic review [^11415NaN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are used for the prevention of thromboembolic events, but their use in dialysis patients is debatable. This study investigated the available evidence for the use of NOACs in dialysis patients. Online databases were systematically searched for eligible studies, including pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, cohort studies, and randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing NOACs with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or no anticoagulant treatment. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool were used for quality assessment.

Twenty studies were identified: nine PK studies, two RCTs, and nine cohort studies. Most of the studies investigated apixaban or rivaroxaban. In dialysis patients, less accumulation was reported with apixaban and rivaroxaban compared to dabigatran and edoxaban. PK studies indicate that high doses of apixaban or rivaroxaban should be avoided. The two RCTs (rivaroxaban/apixaban vs. VKA) were small and underpowered regarding stroke and bleeding outcomes.

Most cohort studies found apixaban superior to VKA, whereas the comparison of rivaroxaban with VKA yielded conflicting results. Cohort studies comparing apixaban high dose (5 mg twice daily) with low dose (2.5 mg twice daily) suggest a lower risk of stroke with the high dose, but also a higher risk of bleeding with the high dose. Apixaban versus no anticoagulation was compared in one cohort study and did not lower the risk of stroke compared with non-treated patients, regardless of apixaban dosage. Widespread use of NOACs in dialysis patients is limited by the availability of adequately sized RCTs. Available evidence suggests a potential…

### Practical considerations for using novel oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116Vbbk6]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, represent new options for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, as shown by the results from large, randomized Phase III trials. Because of their greater specificity, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics, the novel oral anticoagulants address several limitations of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists in day-to-day clinical practice.

However, a range of practical questions relating to the novel oral anticoagulants has emerged. These include topics such as patient selection, treatment of patients with renal impairment, risk of myocardial infarction, drug interactions, switching between anticoagulants, and management of bleeding. Additional considerations involve the use of these agents in patients requiring antiplatelet drug treatment or undergoing cardioversion or percutaneous interventions (e.g. ablation).

In this review, practical aspects of the use of novel oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation are discussed, with reference to available data and guidance from prescribing information.

### Novel horizons in anticoagulation: The emerging role of factor XI inhibitors across different settings [^113KQJYg]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants have long been fundamental in preventing and treating thromboembolic disorders, with a recent shift of focus towards direct oral anticoagulants, thanks to their ease of use, efficacy, and safety. Despite these advancements, bleeding complications remain a major concern with any anticoagulant, highlighting the need for safer drugs. Factor XI (FXI) inhibitors have emerged as promising agents in this regard, offering a novel approach by targeting upstream factors in the coagulation system. Phase II trials have shown encouraging outcomes, indicating a reduced bleeding risk compared to that associated with traditional anticoagulants, particularly in the context of cardiovascular disease management when combined with antiplatelet therapy. However, the variability in findings and limited efficacy data call for a cautious interpretation pending insights from phase III trials. These trials are essential for validating the potential of FXI inhibitors to balance bleeding risk reduction and maintain anticoagulant efficacy.

This review explores the pharmacology, potential indications, clinical data, and future directions of FXI inhibitors, providing a perspective on their evolving role in anticoagulant therapy. It also provides a detailed analysis of data from published clinical trials on FXI inhibitors in various indications. Preliminary data from ongoing trials are also outlined. As the field moves forward, a cautiously optimistic outlook can be expected, focusing on comprehensive data from phase III trials to define the role of FXI inhibitors in various clinical scenarios.

### Practical aspects of the oral new anticoagulants [^111bSqFZ]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

After years of relying solely on oral vitamin K antagonists, many new antithrombotic agents are in development and entering the marketplace. This review analyzes clinical trial results for these new agents, especially dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. The practical aspects of using these new agents, such as monitoring, reversal, and use before procedures, are also discussed.

### The target-specific oral anticoagulants: practical considerations [^114BeCbo]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

More than four years have passed since the first approval of a target-specific oral anticoagulant (TSOAC) in the United States, and the number of clinicians who have prescribed (or considered prescribing) one or more of these medications is increasing. Although these agents may, in properly selected patients, offer advantages over more traditional therapies, their lack of familiarity can be intimidating.

Clinicians who are prescribing the TSOACs face a number of management questions not definitively answered by the registration trials. This chapter reviews some of these situations, including updated information on the periprocedural management of TSOACs and the latest evidence about how to best measure TSOAC effect. The lack of an antidote and other considerations that may be relevant when deciding between newer and more traditional anticoagulant medications are also discussed.

### Special considerations for therapeutic choice of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^114ERxnt]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Characteristics of the NOACs**: The characteristics of the four NOACs (edoxaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) have been compared with those of warfarin and reported in numerous studies. In brief, NOACs have shorter half-lives and take less time to reach maximum blood concentration than warfarin. Unlike warfarin, NOACs have a specific target (either thrombin or factor Xa), do not require coagulation monitoring, and can be administered with fixed doses.
