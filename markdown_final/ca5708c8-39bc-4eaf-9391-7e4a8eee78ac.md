## Question

differential for suspicous lesion to the back

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate a suspicious lesion on the back, including the stepwise approach to history and physical examination, identifying key clinical features that raise suspicion for malignancy, constructing a prioritized differential diagnosis by likelihood and danger, outlining the diagnostic workup (such as dermoscopy, biopsy technique, and imaging), and considering special populations, documentation, and follow-up planning in accordance with guidelines and evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of the initial assessment: a focused history and a complete skin examination are mandatory, and I should not jump to conclusions before documenting evolution, symptoms, risk factors, and a full-body skin check, because incidental malignancies are common and change management plans [^1138uu1s] [^116fzSdn] [^1133vhcK].

> Wait, let me verify the history components I must capture: onset and rate of change, symptoms such as bleeding, pain, or pruritus, prior trauma or treatment, sun exposure and tanning bed use, personal or family history of skin cancer or atypical nevi, immunosuppression, and medications that could alter morphology or risk. I should also ask about systemic symptoms that might suggest paraneoplastic or inflammatory etiologies, and I need to ensure I document laterality and precise anatomic location for the back lesion because this affects both biopsy planning and pathologic staging if malignant [^1138uu1s] [^116fzSdn] [^1121RJTK].

> Hold on, I should verify the physical examination priorities: measure diameter, document shape and borders, characterize color variegation, surface features, and whether there is ulceration, bleeding, or satellite papules. I will also palpate for fixation or induration and examine regional lymph nodes, and I should perform a total body skin examination to look for additional suspicious lesions, because patients with an index suspicious lesion have a higher yield of incidental malignancies on TBSE [^1133vhcK] [^117PGGFo].

> I need to check which features heighten suspicion for malignancy: asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, diameter greater than 6 mm, and evolution over time are classic ABCDE cues. The ugly duckling sign, ulceration, bleeding, rapid growth, and new symptoms also raise concern. Dermoscopy improves diagnostic accuracy for melanoma and keratinocyte cancers, but I should remember that visual inspection alone is insufficient and can miss melanomas, so I must maintain a low threshold for biopsy when in doubt [^116gHjL8] [^113TQ7M6] [^113Bz15F].

> Let me consider the most likely malignant diagnosis first: melanoma remains the most dangerous and must be excluded early. I should confirm that any evolving pigmented lesion with atypical features undergoes excisional biopsy with 1–3 mm margins to allow accurate Breslow thickness and staging, and I must provide the pathologist with age, sex, exact location, size, clinical impression, and dermoscopic features to optimize clinicopathologic correlation [^1155GuEZ] [^1121RJTK] [^116F7Bd1].

> Next, I should review basal cell carcinoma on the differential: on the back, BCC may present as a pearly papule or nodule with telangiectasias, a scar-like plaque, or even a pigmented variant. I need to ensure biopsy samples include deep reticular dermis because infiltrative or micronodular patterns often lie at deeper margins and can be missed by superficial shaves, and after diagnosis I should perform a complete skin examination to identify additional lesions [^116poSa1].

> I will now examine squamous cell carcinoma: keratotic, crusted, or ulcerated lesions on sun-exposed back skin raise concern, and I should confirm that any suspected SCC undergoes biopsy that captures the dermis. In high-risk patients or when lesions are clinically atypical, I should maintain a low threshold for biopsy and consider nodal evaluation if risk features are present [^116fzSdn] [^114r3Dik] [^111Qzh4f].

> But wait, what if the lesion is benign yet worrisome in appearance? I should double-check for seborrheic keratosis, which can mimic melanoma with warty texture and variable pigmentation, and for keratoacanthoma, which can be indistinguishable from SCC clinically and histologically in limited samples. In both cases, if the diagnosis is uncertain or the lesion is changing, excision with appropriate margins is prudent to secure a definitive diagnosis and exclude malignancy [^114t8Qg9].

> Let me reconsider inflammatory and infectious mimics that can present on the back: urticarial vasculitis and other urticarial syndromes can produce persistent, burning or painful wheals that leave hyperpigmentation. Sarcoidosis can present with papules, plaques, or nodules and is a great imitator. In immunocompromised hosts, Sweet syndrome, drug eruptions, and infection-related dermatoses must be considered early, and I should confirm that biopsy with clinicopathologic correlation is pursued when the presentation is atypical or refractory [^111Qcgrx] [^112XVbHw] [^115rug7p].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic workup sequence: start with dermoscopy when available to refine the differential and guide biopsy choice, but do not delay biopsy for a lesion suspicious for melanoma or SCC. Choose excisional biopsy for pigmented lesions suspicious for melanoma, punch or saucerization for suspected BCC or SCC to adequate depth, and avoid transecting the base. If melanoma is confirmed, I should perform a complete skin and nodal examination and consider sentinel lymph node biopsy when indicated by thickness and other risk factors [^113TQ7M6] [^1155GuEZ] [^114r3Dik].

> I need to ensure I document thoroughly for the pathologist: include patient demographics, precise anatomic location with laterality, lesion size, clinical impression and differential, biopsy intent and technique, and any dermoscopic or photographic findings. For suspected SCC, I should also note recurrence, immunosuppression, and prior radiation or scars, because these factors influence risk stratification and management [^1121RJTK] [^112jPusb].

> Next, I should review when imaging is warranted: for BCC or SCC, imaging is not routine but should be considered if clinical examination is insufficient to determine extent, if there is concern for perineural spread, deep soft tissue or bone involvement, or if the disease is locally advanced. MRI is preferred for perineural disease and CT for bone involvement, and modality selection should be individualized by the treating team [^1145SUxu] [^114r3Dik].

> Let me think about special populations and contexts: in immunocompromised patients, I should broaden the differential to include infection, drug eruptions, and infiltration by malignancy, and maintain a low threshold for biopsy. In pregnancy, the approach to changing nevi should mirror nonpregnant patients. In children, dermoid cysts warrant excision due to potential intracranial extension. And in patients with multiple lesions, I should consider syndromic associations and plan genetic counseling when indicated [^115rug7p] [^1179NyPp] [^1167EwAo] [^112mv3hu].

> I should double-check the role of teledermatology and AI tools: while teledermatology and dermoscopy can aid triage, evidence shows variable accuracy and a risk of missing melanomas. Therefore, these tools should supplement, not replace, in-person clinical judgment and biopsy when suspicion persists, and I must counsel patients accordingly to avoid false reassurance [^11731o2L] [^116GQ2zF] [^1111dTgv].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and prevention are addressed: after treatment of a malignancy, arrange surveillance for recurrence and new primaries, counsel on sun protection, and consider total body photography for high-risk patients. For benign lesions managed conservatively, provide clear return precautions for change in size, shape, color, symptoms, or bleeding, and reinforce self-examination of hard-to-see areas like the back with assistance from family members [^116c9PnM].

A suspicious lesion on the back has a broad differential, but the most critical diagnoses to exclude are **melanoma** and **non-melanoma skin cancers (BCC, SCC)** [^116TNXya]. Other important considerations include **benign neoplasms** (seborrheic keratosis, nevus, lipoma, epidermal inclusion cyst) [^111Cgh9r] [^116e5Ety], **infectious or inflammatory mimics** (cellulitis, abscess, herpes zoster, sarcoidosis, urticarial vasculitis) [^115uKspM] [^111Qcgrx] [^112XVbHw], and **metastatic or hematologic lesions** (cutaneous metastases, lymphoma, leukemia cutis) [^114gLRHz] [^1168kjyc]. Evaluation should follow the **ABCDE criteria** [^116TNXya], dermoscopy [^113TQ7M6], and a **low threshold for biopsy** [^114r3Dik] [^1145SUxu]; imaging is reserved for suspected deep or metastatic disease [^114r3Dik] [^1145SUxu].

## Malignant neoplasms

Key characteristics of common malignant skin neoplasms:

| **Aspect** | **Melanoma** | **Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)** | **Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clinical features | Asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, diameter > 6 mm, evolution (ABCDE) [^116TNXya]; dermoscopy aids diagnosis [^113TQ7M6]. | Pearly, translucent papule or nodule with telangiectasias; rolled borders; ulceration in advanced lesions [^notfound]. | Keratotic papule or plaque, ulceration, crusting; rapid growth raises concern [^notfound]. |
| Risk factors | Sun exposure, atypical nevi, family history, fair skin, immunosuppression [^notfound]. | Chronic sun exposure, fair skin, immunosuppression [^notfound]. | Chronic sun exposure, immunosuppression, chronic wounds, HPV [^notfound]. |
| Diagnosis | Excisional biopsy with 1–3 mm margins; document size, location, and clinical impression for pathology [^1155GuEZ] [^1121RJTK]. | Punch, shave, or excisional biopsy [^1138Fxri]; include deep reticular dermis to assess infiltrative pattern [^116poSa1]. | Punch, shave, or excisional biopsy; include deep dermis for accurate grading [^notfound]. |

### Cutaneous lymphoma

Cutaneous lymphoma presents with persistent, often erythematous **plaques or nodules** that may mimic eczema or psoriasis. Diagnosis requires **punch or excisional biopsy with immunophenotyping** [^1168kjyc].

---

### Cutaneous metastases

Cutaneous metastases present as firm, **indurated nodules** or plaques, often in patients with a known history of internal malignancy. Diagnosis relies on **biopsy with immunohistochemistry** [^notfound].

---

## Benign neoplasms

### Seborrheic keratosis

Seborrheic keratosis presents as a waxy, stuck-on, **verrucous plaque** with a greasy surface and variable pigmentation. It is a **common benign lesion** that can mimic melanoma; biopsy is indicated if features are atypical or the lesion has changed [^114t8Qg9].

---

### Epidermal inclusion cyst

An epidermal inclusion cyst presents as a mobile subcutaneous **nodule** with a central punctum. It is a **benign keratin-filled cyst** that can become inflamed or infected; excision is curative [^114t8Qg9].

---

### Lipoma

A lipoma is a soft, lobulated, **subcutaneous mass** that is mobile and non-tender. It is a **benign fatty tumor**; excision is indicated for cosmetic reasons or if symptomatic [^116e5Ety].

---

### Nevus (mole)

A nevus presents as a symmetric, uniformly pigmented **macule or papule** with regular borders. It is a **benign melanocytic lesion**; biopsy is indicated if atypical features or changes are present [^113TQ7M6].

---

## Infectious and inflammatory conditions

### Cellulitis/abscess

Cellulitis or abscess presents with erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain, often with **systemic symptoms**. It is a **bacterial infection** of the skin or subcutaneous tissue; management includes antibiotics and drainage if fluctuant [^115rug7p].

---

### Herpes zoster

Herpes zoster presents as a unilateral, dermatomal **vesicular eruption** with neuropathic pain. It is a **reactivation of varicella-zoster virus**; diagnosis is clinical, with PCR or culture if uncertain [^117MRT4u].

---

### Sarcoidosis

Sarcoidosis presents as papules, plaques, or nodules, often with **systemic involvement**. It is a **granulomatous disease**; biopsy reveals non-caseating granulomas [^112XVbHw].

---

### Urticarial vasculitis

Urticarial vasculitis presents with persistent urticarial lesions, often with **systemic symptoms** and low complement. It is a **small-vessel vasculitis**; biopsy shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis [^111Qcgrx].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History and physical examination**: Use ABCDE criteria [^116TNXya]; assess risk factors, evolution, and symptoms [^notfound].
- **Dermoscopy**: Improves diagnostic accuracy for melanoma and keratinocyte cancers [^113TQ7M6] [^116gHjL8].
- **Biopsy**: Low threshold; choose technique based on suspected diagnosis and lesion size/location [^111sNLPf].
- **Imaging**: Reserve for suspected deep involvement, perineural spread, or metastasis [^114r3Dik] [^1145SUxu].

---

A suspicious lesion on the back requires a **broad differential**, prioritizing melanoma, BCC, and SCC, while also considering benign neoplasms, infectious or inflammatory mimics, and metastatic or hematologic disease. A structured approach with **ABCDE assessment, dermoscopy, and a low threshold for biopsy** ensures timely and accurate diagnosis [^116TNXya] [^113TQ7M6] [^1138uu1s].

### Basal cell skin cancer, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116poSa1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Clinical presentation and workup of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) — On clinical presentation of a lesion suspicious for skin cancer, workup for BCC begins with a history and physical examination, biopsy, and if applicable a shave removal. A skin biopsy is then performed on any suspicious lesion, and the biopsy should include deep reticular dermis because infiltrative histology may be present only at deeper, advancing margins and superficial biopsies will frequently miss this component. After BCC diagnosis, a full skin examination is recommended since individuals with skin cancer often have additional, concurrent precancers or cancers at other sun-exposed sites and are also at increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma.

Learning Objectives

After reading this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Clinically describe various cutaneous neoplasms. 2. Identify the corresponding histopathologic findings. 3. Discuss the optimal treatment approach for each entity.

Summary

Cutaneous neoplasms are broadly viewed as benign, premalignant, or malignant. In dermatology, lesions are classified based on the primary cell of origin or the component of the skin predominantly affected by the pathologic change (epidermis, dermis, or subcutaneous fat). The diagnosis and treatment of skin lesions rely on understanding the clinical presentation and corresponding histopathology. Surgical treatment is not always indicated and is dependent on multiple variables. This review discusses several benign and premalignant neoplasms frequently encountered by the plastic surgeon. The emphasis is on clinical presentation, histopathologic correlation, and management approach.

### Clinical diagnosis of skin cancer: enhancing inspection and early recognition [^117RD3nV]. Dermatologic Clinics (2017). Low credibility.

The annual incidence rate for melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer continues to rise and morbidity and deaths from skin cancer are increasing. Despite advances in therapeutics, the factors that most impact prognosis remain early recognition and removal of neoplasms before deep invasion or metastatic disease can occur. There are numerous public health and screening initiatives that have been introduced to help recognize disease earlier and to increase patients' awareness of signs or changes of lesions that may represent skin cancers. Early recognition and removal of suspicious lesions remains critical in significantly reducing morbidity and mortality associated with skin cancers.

### Obtaining an adequate specimen for the diagnosis of pigmented lesions [^111sNLPf]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Melanoma is a common, potentially deadly disease but is curable if caught early. A specimen of a pigmented lesion must capture the entire width and depth of the lesion to evaluate the lesion's size, symmetry, and circumscription. Saucerization shaving, punching, and excision biopsy are 3 techniques that can be used to achieve a satisfactory specimen. Physicians should have a low threshold to biopsy a suspicious atypical pigmented lesion, but acceptable specimens are key in following through with an accurate diagnosis.

Importance

The incidence of skin cancer is increasing and evaluation of the utility of total body skin examination (TBSE) in detecting incidental skin cancers is warranted.

Objectives

To evaluate the proportion and rate of incidental skin cancer detection in urgent skin cancer clinics and investigate the rate of incidental skin cancer detection in 2 groups based on the degree of clinical suspicion of the index lesion for malignancy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter retrospective cohort study with a case note review of consecutive secondary care consultations was conducted using data from 2 urgent suspected skin cancer screening clinics in UK National Health Service trusts. The study was performed from January 1, 2015, to March 31, 2016, and data analysis was performed from October 14, 2018, to February 1, 2019. Patients included those presenting with a skin lesion suspicious of malignancy who were referred to the urgent suspected skin cancer clinic (N = 5944) over 15 months. Patients who accepted and received a TBSE were subsequently included in the analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The proportion and rate of incidental skin cancer detection through TBSE and whether a clinically suspicious (malignant) index lesion was associated with a higher chance of having a malignant incidental lesion.

Results

Of the 5944 patients referred to the clinic, 4726 individuals (79.5%) were evaluated. In the cohort included in the analyses, the median age was 57 years (interquartile range, 39–73 years); 2567 patients (54.3%) were women. A total of 1117 skin cancers were identified; of these, 242 lesions (21.7%) were detected incidentally through TBSE, including 197 of 570 (34.6%) basal cell carcinomas, 16 of 250 (6.4%) squamous cell carcinomas, and 25 of 215 (11.6%) melanomas. The detection rate of incidental malignant lesions was 5.1 lesions per 100 patients examined (5.1%; 95% CI, 4.5%-5.8%). There was a higher detection rate of histologically confirmed incidental malignant lesions in individuals with clinically suspicious index lesions requiring biopsy (10.9%; 95% CI, 9.5%-12.5%) compared with those presenting with clinically benign index lesions (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.6%-2.5%) (P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study support the use of TBSE for urgent skin cancer referrals, highlighting the potential harms of solitary lesion assessment in a subgroup. Individuals presenting with a clinically suspicious index lesion requiring biopsy are most likely to benefit from TBSE and should be counseled regarding the benefit.

### Diagnostic challenges in the mature patient: growing old gracefully [^117W65yN]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Skin diseases in the elderly are frequent and sometimes misleading, due to age-related changes that alter the clinical presentation. Clinicopathologic correlation is often the clue for distinguishing among various pathologies for which clinical signs are more striking than the histopathologic findings. Pitfalls are always lying in wait to ambush inexperienced dermatologists, but usually the microscope provides subtle hints to solve the quandary. In an attempt to familiarize physicians with emerging skin care demands of older patients, we have reviewed major diagnostic challenges in this group of patients: age-related changes, more common skin pathologies in mature patients, manifestations of comorbidity, skin tumors, and paraneoplastic syndromes.

### Australian general practitioners' confidence in dermatology diagnosis and management: cross-sectional survey [^112vZxEu]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Earlier research has indicated that, despite the high prevalence of skin cancer in Australia, dermoscopy is frequently underutilized in primary care. A study revealed that only 42.6% of GPs without a special interest in skin employed dermoscopy, and another study reported that 66% of GPs never incorporate dermoscopy into their practices. This suggests a critical observation: there appears to be a substantial emphasis on skin surgery training for GPs, which may not be matched by equivalent training in diagnosis. This disparity highlights a significant patient safety issue and underscores the necessity for a balanced approach to dermatology education that equally addresses both diagnostic and management skills.

Furthermore, our participants identified melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers as their greatest learning priorities. This may reflect anxiety about missing these high-risk conditions, given the potentially severe consequences of delayed or missed diagnoses. Additionally, some incongruence was noted in confidence diagnosing versus managing benign, pre-cancerous, and cancerous skin lesions. Benign skin lesions had the greatest reported confidence in diagnosis, encompassing lesions such as skin tags, seborrhoeic keratoses, and common naevi. Yet, the diagnosis of benign lesions must also involve the consideration of, and exclusion of, other potential malignant differential diagnoses. This is often a particularly challenging component of assessment. The discrepancy between confidence in diagnosing benign lesions versus identifying malignant lesions underscores the importance of structured dermatology education that emphasizes the assessment of suspicious lesions, including dermoscopic evaluation and biopsy decision-making.

### Features of regression in dermoscopic diagnosis: a confounding factor? Two clinical, dermoscopic-pathologic case studies [^114XmbZh]. Dermatologic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In dermoscopy, the presence of regression areas is generally associated with melanocytic lesions and is often considered a clue of malignancy. However, some lesions included in the differential diagnosis of melanoma may show dermoscopic regression parameters. Regression may indeed be one of the most confounding dermoscopic parameters because it tends to cover, or rather to destroy, other parameters, thus often hindering a correct diagnosis.

Objective

We propose to raise the issue of the actual diagnostic role of this parameter.

Methods

We discuss two clinical cases (melanoma and basal cell carcinoma) with major dermoscopic regression features.

Conclusion

Dermoscopic regression parameters should not be regarded as almost pathognomonic signs of melanocytic lesions. Rather, they should be taken into account only after having considered other dermoscopic parameters of greater diagnostic significance and just as signs that may better typify the lesion.

### Biopsy techniques. diagnosis of melanoma [^117FUzZW]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The biopsy of a suspicious pigmented lesion is critical to establishing a correct and complete diagnosis. It allows the dermatopathologist accurately to diagnose melanoma and to gauge maximum depth of invasion (and other histologic criterion). This, in turn, influences the extent of further necessary surgery or other adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, choosing the appropriate biopsy technique provides adequate cosmetic results, bearing in mind that the excisional technique is ideal because it removes the suspicious lesion en toto. Excisional biopsies should extend to the subcutaneous fat by means of a punch biopsy, a fusiform ellipse, or a saucerization. Incisional biopsies can be performed in certain circumstances, but should be done so with caution because sampling error may lead to missed diagnosis or inaccurate histologic criterion, such as depth.

### Distinguishing breast skin lesions from superficial breast parenchymal lesions: diagnostic criteria, imaging characteristics, and pitfalls [^117JxcaT]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Superficial lesions are commonly encountered in the breast and may be located in the dermis, hypodermis (subcutaneous fat), or parenchyma. The differential diagnosis varies for each anatomic layer. Dermal lesions that are seen by breast imagers are usually benign skin cysts. Hypodermal lesions, although usually benign, may include lesions that arise from anterior terminal duct lobular units and include papilloma, adenosis, fibroadenoma, and breast cancer. To avoid misclassifying a small superficial breast cancer as a benign dermal lesion, it is necessary to understand superficial breast and skin anatomy and the mammographic, ultrasonographic (U.S.), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging signs that indicate that a lesion is dermal. Mammography is the optimal modality for localizing calcifications to the dermis or hypodermis. However, U.S. typically has higher resolution for localizing masses than mammography and MR imaging. At US, a lesion may be categorized as dermal (a) if it is contained entirely within the dermis, (b) if a tract that extends from the lesion to the skin is seen, or (c) if a claw of tissue surrounding the margin of the lesion is present. As with other breast lesions, suspicious imaging features should be sought in addition to determining the anatomic origin. If histologic analysis is necessary to characterize lesions with an unknown cause or origin, precautions must be taken to decrease patient morbidity.

### Updated techniques for melanoma diagnosis [^116UooYe]. Dermatologic Clinics (2025). Medium credibility.

Melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer, requires timely diagnostics for improved patient outcomes. The ABCDE criteria-assessing asymmetry, borders, color, diameter, and evolution-serve as foundational guidelines for early detection. Non-invasive tools like dermoscopy, total body photography, and advanced imaging techniques enhance visualization of skin lesions, while artificial intelligence-driven algorithms improve diagnostic accuracy. Despite these advancements, biopsy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis. This multifaceted approach highlights the need for integrating traditional methods with innovative technologies to optimize melanoma evaluation and management, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

### A case of neutrophilic superficial eccrine ductitis [^113xJVM8]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The differential diagnoses of our patient's lesions included scabies, irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), miliaria, neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH), and psoriasis. The clinical and histopathologic characteristics of each skin disorder were compared with those observed in our case to confirm the diagnosis of NSED.

Scabies lesions are characterized by small, extremely pruritic, erythematous papules, vesicles, and/or pustules with a predilection for the hands, feet, and genitalia. In infants and toddlers, nodules and eczematous lesions of the axilla or trunk can be observed. Although our patient's lesions were intensely pruritic, scabies lesions typically spare the back. Additionally, histopathologic findings related to scabies have shown the presence a mixed infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and histiocytes, without neutrophils, in the dermis as well as mites or eggs in skin scrapings. The patient's lack of response to permethrin further provided evidence against the diagnosis of scabies.

ICD in response to permethrin was suspected because of the worsening of the patient's symptoms after the application of permethrin cream 5%. ICD typically presents as erythema, edema, vesicles, bullae, and oozing at the sites of contact within minutes to hours. The histopathology of ICD is characterized by a perivascular mononuclear infiltrate with intraepidermal vesicles, bullae, and necrosis of keratinocytes. The patient's failure to improve with the topical corticosteroids and pimecrolimus further argued against the diagnosis of ICD.

Miliaria was also a part of the differential diagnoses. A rash of miliaria is typically papulovesicular or pustular, with background erythema, similar to our patient's erythematous papules. Although periductal inflammation in miliaria pustulosa is predominated by neutrophils, the additional epidermal changes in intracorneal spongiotic vesicles that characterize miliaria were absent in our case. The sparing of the folds and prolonged disease course further argued against the diagnosis of miliaria.

### Identification of incidental skin cancers among adults referred to dermatologists for suspicious skin lesions [^1133vhcK]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the rate of incidental skin cancer detection in urgent skin cancer clinics, and are incidental cancers more likely to be detected in patients with a clinically suspicious index lesion than in those without?

Findings

In a cohort study including 4726 patients, 1117 malignant lesions were detected, 22% of which were identified incidentally by total body skin examinations corresponding to an incidental lesion detection rate of 5.1%. Detection of a malignant incidental lesion by total body skin examinations was significantly more likely in patients presenting with an index lesion suspicious for malignancy, compared with patients who presented with index lesions judged to be clinically benign.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that total body skin examinations may be useful for detecting incidental skin cancers and that patients with suspicious index lesions should be prioritized.

### Biopsy of the pigmented lesions [^113w43BL]. Dermatologic Clinics (2012). Low credibility.

Although new technologies are becoming available to aid in diagnosis, the skin biopsy continues to be the fundamental tool of the dermatologist to evaluate the nature of a pigmented lesion. There are 3 major techniques for the biopsy of a pigmented lesion: shave biopsy, punch/incisional biopsy, and excisional biopsy. This article discusses when to biopsy a pigmented lesion and reviews the different biopsy techniques, with reference to specific clinical scenarios.

### Urticarial lesions: if not urticaria, what else? The differential diagnosis of urticaria: part II. systemic diseases [^111Qcgrx]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

There are a number of systemic disorders that can manifest with urticarial skin lesions, including urticarial vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, hematologic diseases, and autoinflammatory syndromes. All of these conditions may enter into the differential diagnosis of ordinary urticaria. In contrast to urticaria, urticarial syndromes may manifest with skin lesions other than wheals, such as papules, necrosis, vesicles, and hemorrhages. Lesions may have a bilateral and symmetrical distribution; individual lesions have a long duration, and their resolution frequently leaves marks, such as hyperpigmentation or bruising. Moreover, systemic symptoms, such as fever, asthenia, and arthralgia, may be present. The most important differential diagnosis in this group is urticarial vasculitis, which is a small-vessel vasculitis with predominant cutaneous involvement. Systemic involvement in urticarial vasculitis affects multiple organs (mainly joints, the lungs, and the kidneys) and is more frequent and more severe in patients with hypocomplementemia. Clinicopathologic correlation is essential to establishing a correct diagnosis.

Learning Objectives

After completing the learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish urticarial lesions suggesting diagnoses other than common urticaria; assess patients with urticarial lesions, and suspect systemic diseases presenting with urticarial skin lesions.

### Cutaneous sarcoidosis: differential diagnosis [^1116ZirE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease with cutaneous lesions present in 20%-35% of patients. Given the wide variability of clinical manifestations, it is one of the "great imitators", making it necessary to consider clinical, epidemiological, radiographic, laboratory, and histopathological criteria to make the diagnosis. Cutaneous lesions have been classified as specific and nonspecific, depending on the presence of noncaseating granulomas on histologic studies. Specific lesions include maculopapules, plaques, nodules, lupus pernio, scar infiltration, alopecia, ulcerative lesions, and hypopigmentation among others. Nail, mucosal, and childhood sarcoidosis represent a distinct subset of the disease process. The most common nonspecific lesion is erythema nodosum. Others include calcifications, prurigo, erythema multiforme, nail clubbing, and Sweet syndrome. The importance of considering cutaneous sarcoidosis in the clinical differential diagnosis of a given skin lesion relies on the association with systemic involvement and the convenience of the skin as a tissue source for histologic analysis.

### Artificial intelligence in mobile health for skin cancer diagnostics at home (AIM HIGH): a pilot feasibility study [^116raSRa]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

From November 22nd, 2021 to June 9th, 2022, we conducted a within-subject pilot feasibility study with a mixed-method design to include both quantitative and qualitative data. The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility through the inclusion and successful participation rate of patients with suspicious skin lesions and their general practitioners (GPs) (as defined in Supplemental Table S1). The first secondary objective was to identify reasons, facilitators, and barriers for successful participation. The second secondary objective was to evaluate the impact of the mHealth app for sample size calculations of the intended future study. This was done by: 1) evaluating the impact as a triaging tool in the hands of patients by specifically looking at the potential reduction of visits for benign skin lesions and the number of false negative assessments by the app, and 2) by evaluating the impact of the app as a diagnostic aid for GPs.

All patients older than 18 years who contacted their GP because of a suspicious skin lesion were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, inability to give informed consent and skin lesions that had been treated or biopsied before. The study took place in three distinct GP practices in the Netherlands (in Rotterdam, Leiden and Katwijk) and lasted for 3.5 months per practice. A total of 13 GPs participated in the study.

Patients who met the eligibility criteria were offered to use an mHealth app (SkinVision, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) on their own at home or in the GP practice prior to their consultation, and were asked to fill in a questionnaire related to how this app would affect their need to visit their GP (Phase 1) (Supplemental Fig. S1). The GP would then see the patient, blinded to the outcome of the app (care as usual) after which they filled in their working diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment plan in the electronic health record of the patient. Immediately after the consultation, GPs were unblinded and asked whether they would change their diagnosis and/or treatment based on the app's assessments (Phase 2). If a step from either of the phases was not successfully completed, this was registered.

Study outcomes and data collection

Firstly, the agreement between the referral diagnosis made by GPs (primary diagnosis mentioned in the referral letter) and the final diagnosis made by the dermatologist was assessed. In cases in which no diagnosis was mentioned in the referral letter, letters were excluded from this specific analysis. When available, a histopathological diagnosis was used as the final diagnosis. In cases of no histopathological diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis made by the dermatologist was used as the final diagnosis. In addition, the positive predictive values were also assessed by comparing the full differential diagnosis provided by GPs in the referral letter with the final diagnosis made by the dermatologist.

Secondary outcomes were: (1) the proportion of proper dermatological descriptions used in the referral letters; (2) the number of diagnostic procedures (dermoscopy, punch biopsies) performed by the GPs; (3) the number of additional (pre)malignant lesions found by the dermatologist; and (4) the proportion of potentially unnecessary referrals.

The description of the lesion(s) was evaluated using the generally accepted Dutch model to describe skin lesions (PROVOKE), in which a skin disorder is supposed to be described by mentioning seven characteristics (anatomical localization, distribution, size, shape, border, colour and lesion morphology). Firstly, the description of all seven characteristics were separately analysed. In addition, the aggregated description was analysed on completeness. For this, a 'proper description' was defined as the description of three or more characteristics in the referral letter.

Potentially unnecessary referrals were lesions that probably could have been treated in primary care, namely low‐risk basal cell carcinoma (BCC), low‐risk Bowen disease (BD), actinic keratosis (AK) and all benign diagnoses without any complicating factors (see below) in accordance with the guideline of the Dutch College of General Practitioners and regional project guidelines. 10 A full overview of referral criteria is provided in Appendix S1 (see Supporting Information).

Data were collected using both the referral letters and medical records (including histopathology reports). Data extraction was performed by the same researcher in all cases in both hospitals (E.M.). Data verification on accuracy and inconsistencies was performed by a separate researcher (S.F.K.L.) in 10% of the cases. In cases of inconsistency (0.19%) a consensus meeting was planned and the full dataset was additionally checked on this specific inconsistency.

### Smartphone applications for triaging adults with skin lesions that are suspicious for melanoma [^1111dTgv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Melanoma accounts for a small proportion of all skin cancer cases but is responsible for most skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection and treatment can improve survival. Smartphone applications are readily accessible and potentially offer an instant risk assessment of the likelihood of malignancy so that the right people seek further medical attention from a clinician for more detailed assessment of the lesion. There is, however, a risk that melanomas will be missed and treatment delayed if the application reassures the user that their lesion is low risk.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone applications to rule out cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with concerns about suspicious skin lesions.

Search Methods

We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles.

Selection Criteria

Studies of any design evaluating smartphone applications intended for use by individuals in a community setting who have lesions that might be suspicious for melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants versus a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow-up and expert opinion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS-2). Due to scarcity of data and poor quality of studies, we did not perform a meta-analysis for this review. For illustrative purposes, we plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity on coupled forest plots for each application under consideration.

Main Results

This review reports on two cohorts of lesions published in two studies. Both studies were at high risk of bias from selective participant recruitment and high rates of non-evaluable images. Concerns about applicability of findings were high due to inclusion only of lesions already selected for excision in a dermatology clinic setting, and image acquisition by clinicians rather than by smartphone app users. We report data for five mobile phone applications and 332 suspicious skin lesions with 86 melanomas across the two studies. Across the four artificial intelligence-based applications that classified lesion images (photographs) as melanomas (one application) or as high risk or 'problematic' lesions (three applications) using a pre-programmed algorithm, sensitivities ranged from 7% (95% CI 2% to 16%) to 73% (95% CI 52% to 88%) and specificities from 37% (95% CI 29% to 46%) to 94% (95% CI 87% to 97%). The single application using store-and-forward review of lesion images by a dermatologist had a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI 90% to 100%) and specificity of 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%). The number of test failures (lesion images analysed by the applications but classed as 'unevaluable' and excluded by the study authors) ranged from 3 to 31 (or 2% to 18% of lesions analysed). The store-and-forward application had one of the highest rates of test failure (15%). At least one melanoma was classed as unevaluable in three of the four application evaluations.

Authors' Conclusions

Smartphone applications using artificial intelligence-based analysis have not yet demonstrated sufficient promise in terms of accuracy, and they are associated with a high likelihood of missing melanomas. Applications based on store-and-forward images could have a potential role in the timely presentation of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating active self-management health practices and early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions; however, they may incur a significant increase in resource and workload. Given the paucity of evidence and low methodological quality of existing studies, it is not possible to draw any implications for practice. Nevertheless, this is a rapidly advancing field, and new and better applications with robust reporting of studies could change these conclusions substantially.

### Multilevel spinal lesions beyond metastases [^114y2k3N]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To review multi-level spinal lesions where metastasis was a possible differential diagnosis.

Materials

A series of anonymised patients who presented with multilevel spinal lesions were reviewed. Some patients presented with contiguous, multilevel, or diffuse spinal changes which ultimately proved to not be metastases despite initial suspicion. All these spinal lesions were evaluated with extensive imaging. If imaging features were suspicious for metastases or showed aggressive features, biopsy was performed. All data was anonymised.

Results

Despite not being metastases, some of these lesions can appear aggressive in nature. Differential diagnosis of multilevel spinal lesions included bone infarcts, Paget's, extra-medullary haematopoiesis, treatment related and axial spondyloarthropathy.

Conclusions

To help readers gain experience and confidence in assessing the differential diagnosis of multi-level spinal lesions which could be metastases.

Cutaneous melanoma (CM) and nevi in pregnancy — evaluation and biopsy guidance: The approach to melanocytic nevi in the pregnant woman should be identical to that in the nonpregnant patient, and any changing nevus during pregnancy should be evaluated and subjected to biopsy if clinically and/or dermoscopically concerning. Pregnancy itself does not require more vigilance for development of CM, and evidence is lacking that melanocytic nevi darken or enlarge during pregnancy except for those on the breast and abdomen that may appear larger because of stretching of the skin; melanocytic nevi on the back and legs of pregnant women have not been reported to change. Transient dermoscopic changes have been reported in nevi during pregnancy, but the nevi returned to normal postpartum, and none was suggestive of CM. The WG recommends that any changing or otherwise concerning melanocytic nevus in a pregnant woman (not as a result of stretching on the breasts or abdomen) be evaluated clinically (optimally with dermoscopy), and if worrisome, be subjected to biopsy as in standard practice, and appropriate sun-protective measures for pregnant women should be similar to those for nonpregnant patients.

### Update in dermatopathology [^117CcgBQ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Inflammatory skin disease is a diagnostic challenge for both dermatologists and pathologists. Unlike the diagnosis of cutaneous neoplasms, biopsies of inflammatory disorders generally present a differential diagnosis for the pathologist. Similarly, the dermatologist is also presented with a clinical differential diagnosis prompting the biopsy. Assimilating all of the information is challenging yet rewarding when an accurate diagnosis is made. In this review we present several "newer" inflammatory diseases of the skin and discuss the differential diagnosis. Many of these entities are associated with underlying systemic disease, making early recognition and diagnosis critical. Pathologists should be familiar with these histopathologic findings to assist with the optimal clinical-pathological diagnosis.

### Noninvasive imaging tools in the diagnosis and treatment of skin cancers [^1142oPqt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Specific features of skin lesions have been uncovered by the dermatoscope and organized into 'dermoscopic patterns' to allow benign and malignant lesions to be distinguished with more than 90% accuracy, depending on the lesion type and the experience of the dermatologist. Nevertheless, missing or ambiguous dermoscopic patterns may lead to false or misdiagnosis in some cases, such as in patients with featureless melanomas. Although the guidelines still recommend histopathologic analysis, suspicious lesions may now be examined further using an advanced noninvasive technique, such as reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) or optical coherence tomography (OCT). Examination with these techniques increases the accuracy of diagnosis and allows unnecessary biopsies to be avoided. These techniques rely on medical devices that offer different levels of analysis in vivo — the deeper the observation, the lower the resolution (Table 1). The parameters of each medical device will thus determine the most suitable technique to assess the equivocal lesion. In this review, we describe the parameters and applications of each technique, according to their role in skin cancer diagnosis, patient monitoring, treatment choice. and patient response to treatment.

### Visual inspection and dermoscopy, alone or in combination, for diagnosing keratinocyte skin cancers in adults [^116gHjL8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is important to guide appropriate management, to reduce morbidity and to improve survival. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is almost always a localised skin cancer with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, whereas a minority of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs) and invasive melanomas are higher-risk skin cancers with the potential to metastasise and cause death. Dermoscopy has become an important tool to assist specialist clinicians in the diagnosis of melanoma, and is increasingly used in primary-care settings. Dermoscopy is a precision-built handheld illuminated magnifier that allows more detailed examination of the skin down to the level of the superficial dermis. Establishing the value of dermoscopy over and above visual inspection for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC in primary- and secondary-care settings is critical to understanding its potential contribution to appropriate skin cancer triage, including referral of higher-risk cancers to secondary care, the identification of low-risk skin cancers that might be treated in primary care and to provide reassurance to those with benign skin lesions who can be safely discharged.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection and dermoscopy, alone or in combination, for the detection of (a) BCC and (b) cSCC, in adults. We separated studies according to whether the diagnosis was recorded face-to-face (in person) or based on remote (image-based) assessment.

Search Methods

We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles.

Selection Criteria

Studies of any design that evaluated visual inspection or dermoscopy or both in adults with lesions suspicious for skin cancer, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS-2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic thresholds were missing. We estimated accuracy using hierarchical summary ROC methods. We undertook analysis of studies allowing direct comparison between tests. To facilitate interpretation of results, we computed values of sensitivity at the point on the SROC curve with 80% fixed specificity and values of specificity with 80% fixed sensitivity. We investigated the impact of in-person test interpretation; use of a purposely-developed algorithm to assist diagnosis; and observer expertise.

Main Results

We included 24 publications reporting on 24 study cohorts, providing 27 visual inspection datasets (8805 lesions; 2579 malignancies) and 33 dermoscopy datasets (6855 lesions; 1444 malignancies). The risk of bias was mainly low for the index test (for dermoscopy evaluations) and reference standard domains, particularly for in-person evaluations, and high or unclear for participant selection, application of the index test for visual inspection and for participant flow and timing. We scored concerns about the applicability of study findings as of 'high' or 'unclear' concern for almost all studies across all domains assessed. Selective participant recruitment, lack of reproducibility of diagnostic thresholds and lack of detail on observer expertise were particularly problematic. The detection of BCC was reported in 28 datasets; 15 on an in-person basis and 13 image-based. Analysis of studies by prior testing of participants and according to observer expertise was not possible due to lack of data. Studies were primarily conducted in participants referred for specialist assessment of lesions with available histological classification. We found no clear differences in accuracy between dermoscopy studies undertaken in person and those which evaluated images. The lack of effect observed may be due to other sources of heterogeneity, including variations in the types of skin lesion studied, in dermatoscopes used, or in the use of algorithms and varying thresholds for deciding on a positive test result. Meta-analysis found in-person evaluations of dermoscopy (7 evaluations; 4683 lesions and 363 BCCs) to be more accurate than visual inspection alone for the detection of BCC (8 evaluations; 7017 lesions and 1586 BCCs), with a relative diagnostic odds ratio (RDOR) of 8.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5 to 19.3; P < 0.001). This corresponds to predicted differences in sensitivity of 14% (93% versus 79%) at a fixed specificity of 80% and predicted differences in specificity of 22% (99% versus 77%) at a fixed sensitivity of 80%. We observed very similar results for the image-based evaluations. When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions, of which 170 are BCC (based on median BCC prevalence across studies), an increased sensitivity of 14% from dermoscopy would lead to 24 fewer BCCs missed, assuming 166 false positive results from both tests. A 22% increase in specificity from dermoscopy with sensitivity fixed at 80% would result in 183 fewer unnecessary excisions, assuming 34 BCCs missed for both tests. There was not enough evidence to assess the use of algorithms or structured checklists for either visual inspection or dermoscopy. Insufficient data were available to draw conclusions on the accuracy of either test for the detection of cSCCs.

Authors' Conclusions

Dermoscopy may be a valuable tool for the diagnosis of BCC as an adjunct to visual inspection of a suspicious skin lesion following a thorough history-taking including assessment of risk factors for keratinocyte cancer. The evidence primarily comes from secondary-care (referred) populations and populations with pigmented lesions or mixed lesion types. There is no clear evidence supporting the use of currently-available formal algorithms to assist dermoscopy diagnosis.

### Epiluminescence microscopy for the diagnosis of doubtful melanocytic skin lesions. comparison of the ABCD rule of dermatoscopy and a new 7-point checklist based on pattern analysis [^1176yWfp]. Archives of Dermatology (1998). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "7-point dermoscopy checklist for melanoma" for cutaneous melanoma.

The 7-point dermoscopy checklist for melanoma is a diagnostic probability tool designed to assess the likelihood of melanoma in patients presenting with suspicious skin lesions. This tool aids in the early detection of melanoma, thereby facilitating timely intervention and improving patient outcomes.

The checklist comprises seven key dermoscopic features, each assigned a specific point value. These features include an atypical pigment network, gray-blue areas, an atypical vascular pattern, radial streaming or streaks, irregular diffuse pigmentation or blotches, irregular dots and globules, and a regression pattern. The points for each feature are summed to yield a total score, which is then used to estimate the probability of melanoma.

A score of 4 or more suggests a high likelihood of melanoma, with a reported sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 78%. Conversely, a score of 3 or less indicates a low risk of melanoma. This scoring system thus provides a structured approach to the dermoscopic evaluation of skin lesions, enhancing the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis and reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions.

The 7-point dermoscopy checklist offers a systematic way to evaluate the likelihood of melanoma by examining specific features of a skin lesion. By answering seven yes-or-no questions about distinct lesion characteristics, the checklist produces a score and interpretation that estimate melanoma risk.

The checklist assesses the following seven features:

- Atypical pigment network
- Gray-blue areas
- Atypical vascular pattern
- Radial streaming or streaks
- Irregular diffuse pigmentation or blotches
- Irregular dots and globules
- Regression pattern

Each detected feature contributes to a score based on its significance:

| **Feature** | **Score** |
|-|-|
| Atypical pigment network | 2 |
| Gray-blue areas | 2 |
| Atypical vascular pattern | 2 |
| Radial streaming, streaks | 1 |
| Irregular diffuse pigmentation, blotches | 1 |
| Irregular dots and globules | 1 |
| Regression pattern | 1 |

The checklist's algorithm adds up the scores for each present feature. This cumulative score provides an overall assessment of melanoma risk.

The resulting interpretation depends on the total score:

- A score of 4 or more suggests "Melanoma is likely" with 93% sensitivity and 78% specificity. This indicates a high probability of the lesion being melanoma.

- A score of 3 or less implies "The risk of melanoma is low", suggesting a lower probability of the lesion being melanoma.

The process results in a straightforward summary that aids clinicians in evaluating the risk of melanoma, delivering both the numerical score and the pertinent interpretation.

Risk stratification and imaging for local basal cell carcinoma (BCC) based on risk factors for recurrence — After the complete skin examination, a risk assessment should be performed to determine the treatment plan. Any high-risk factor places the skin lesion in the high-risk category and imaging should be considered if a clinical exam is insufficient to determine disease extent, and a low threshold for performing skin biopsies in these patients is necessary. For locally advanced disease, which is defined as primary or recurrent extensive disease where surgery and/or radiation therapy (RT) may not result in a cure or would potentially yield a significant functional limitation, patients should consider imaging to determine disease extent. If perineural disease is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with or without contrast is preferred, whereas if bone disease is suspected, computed tomography (CT) with contrast is preferred unless contraindicated. Imaging modality and targeted area should be at the discretion of the treating team based on the suspected extent of disease (local, regional, metastatic). Histologic confirmation is sufficient to diagnose local recurrence, but MRI can be considered to assess extent of local disease; for nodal or distant metastases, histologic analysis and/or CT imaging can be used for confirmation and to gauge the extent of disease.

Patient's perspective

The experience I had during the process of this disease was like a shock to me since I had never been through a situation like this. It all started with a small lesion located on the infraorbital right side, at first, I believed it was something normal or insignificant, not paying attention to it. As time passed by, that small lesion started to increase its size, not other symptoms were related, with all this I started to believe it was something else, like an abscess or a papule, yet not giving it a lot of importance since I reckon — at some point this will decrease — it did not. Against all my thoughts, the lesion kept growing, it was until then that I decided to look for medical attention.

I visited a general practitioner who prescribed antibiotics and tried to drain the lesion, it seemed to be the right management. Still, my surprise was great when the only thing it drained was blood, instead of a purulent material as I thought it would be. At that point, when the uncertainty and fear were greater, I decided to visit a specialist in dermatology.

Six months later, the size of the lesion was bigger at the point that it partially occluded my vision when I looked down. I attended to my first medical consultation in dermatology, the doctor performed my medical history and explained to me that a biopsy test procedure was necessary to analyse those cells located in the suspicious area in order to confirm or rule out the presumptive diagnosis that was lymphocytoma cutis.

Afterward, when the biopsy procedure was finished, I went through a rough moment because there was an incision on my face, something that suddenly appeared there, something new that had never been there before, aesthetically talking it was acceptable, however, it was not easy to accept the change in my face. Despite all the explanations doctor gave to me, lots of doubts were rising: will I have an ugly scar? Will my face look the same? Which is the diagnosis? Is my life endangered? Is all this my fault for being overexposed to the sun without any protection?

### Alternative uses of dermoscopy in daily clinical practice: an update [^117XRfU6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that is currently being used for neoplastic skin lesions, several inflammatory and infectious diseases, and skin appendage disorders. As the clinical applications of dermoscopy beyond pigmented lesions are constantly increasing, the aim of this article is to provide an update on this topic. This comprehensive review substantiates how several diseases may show peculiar dermoscopy features so as to enhance the diagnosis and avoid (in selected cases) unnecessary histologic confirmation. In other cases, dermoscopy features may be shared with other conditions, with the advantage of narrowing down the differential diagnosis by ruling out those dermatoses with similar clinical aspect but different dermoscopic presentation.

### Cutaneous sarcoidosis: the "great imitator": etiopathogenesis, morphology, differential diagnosis, and clinical management [^112XVbHw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease that can involve almost any organ system. The underlying cause of the disease remains unknown. Immunopathologically and histologically, cutaneous sarcoidosis is characterized by a macrophage/T helper-1 cell-mediated, non-caseating, granulomatous inflammation process. An imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines plays an important role in the development of cutaneous granulomas. Recognition of cutaneous sarcoidosis lesions is very important because they provide a visible clue to the diagnosis and are an easily accessible source of tissue for histologic examination. Because skin lesions of patients with the disease can exhibit many different morphologies, cutaneous sarcoidosis is known as one of the "great imitators" in dermatology. Specific manifestations can include patches (sometimes hypopigmented), papules, scar sarcoidosis, ulcers, ichthyosis, and alopecia. The treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis is often frustrating because some of the skin lesions may be refractory to treatment or may recur following successful treatment. Systemic and topical corticosteroids are the most effective treatments for cutaneous sarcoidosis. This article focuses on the dermatologic aspects of sarcoidosis and includes a review of the most recent literature, which includes new data on the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of the disease.

### The 5 P's of pyoderma gangrenosum [^112wArhb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is often difficult to establish based on a clinical presentation, which can mimic other dermatologic conditions. The formation of a mnemonic that incorporates the most prevalent clinical features of PG could aid in accuracy and speed of diagnosis. The 5 P's of PG: Painful, Progressive, Purple, Pretibial, Pathergy, and systemic associations, incorporate parameters recognizable on the first encounter with a patient with PG without reliance on histopathology and laboratory findings or treatment response. We postulate that this simple mnemonic will have the most utility with non-dermatology clinicians encountering a lesion suspicious for PG. By assisting in differential diagnosis formation, this mnemonic may lead to timelier biopsies and treatment initiation. The limitations of this approach mirror those of other studies and include lower sensitivities in patients with an atypical PG presentation. In conclusion, the 5 P's of PG offer a useful mnemonic for the diagnosis of PG, particularly in the initial clinical diagnosis prior to skin biopsy and treatment.

CONCLUSIONS

Despite the excellent performance of clinical diagnosis, there may be an important level of underdiagnosis. A broader clinical suspicion is therefore recommended to reduce missed BU diagnoses allowing improved patient management.

Taking into consideration diagnostic accuracy, time to results, cost-effectiveness, and clinical generalizability, the stepwise diagnostic approach reserving PCR to microscopy-negative patients performed best and would be suitable in the remote and resource-limited settings where BU is endemic.

Methods

Ethics statement and reporting standards

Ethics approval was obtained from the ethics committee at the Technical University of Dresden (BO-EK-53012021), the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg (69_21 Bc), the LMU Munich (21–0182), the University of Regensburg (20–2190–103), the Julius-Maximilians University Wuerzburg (293/20_z) and from the University Hospitals Mannheim (2020–656 N) and Essen (20–9784-BO). Patients provided informed written consent. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and followed the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD 2015) guidelines.

Patient cohorts, image acquisition, and slide acquisition

Study participants were prospectively enrolled in the Skin Classification Project (SCP2) across eight university hospitals in Germany (Berlin, Dresden, Erlangen, Essen, Mannheim, Munich, Regensburg, Wuerzburg) from April 2021 to February 2023. The inclusion criteria required patients to be at least 18 years old and present with pigmented melanoma-suspicious skin lesions, either as a clinical primary diagnosis or as a secondary/differential diagnosis with the intent of ruling out melanoma. The exclusion criteria prohibited the enrollment of pre-biopsied lesions or lesions located under the finger- or toenails. In addition, patients with person-identifying features (e.g. tattoos) in the immediate vicinity of the lesions were excluded due to data privacy concerns.

### Prospective validation of dermoscopy-based open-source artificial intelligence for melanoma diagnosis (PROVE-AI study) [^114aPkF4]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We prospectively assessed the diagnostic accuracy and potential utility of a melanoma AI algorithm in a specific intended use clinical setting: lesions selected by a dermatologist for biopsy to rule out melanoma. Furthermore, factors associated with diagnostic performance were characterized. The sensitivity of ADAE was found to be consistent after considering patient- and lesion-related factors. However, ADAE specificity was lower in patients 65+ years of age and those with skin-type I. Specificity was also lower in lesions on the head/neck, with a diameter > 6 mm, and with surrounding perilesional photodamage, and in actinic keratoses, solar lentigines, and non-melanocytic collision tumors. These findings may help identify clinical scenarios in which ADAE has the greatest potential utility or requires further training. Based on these results, we hypothesize that ADAE may be most helpful when challenged with a suspicious lesion on the trunk or extremities in a younger individual with a clinical differential diagnosis of nevus. It may be comparatively less helpful when assessing older individuals with photo-damage with a clinical differential diagnosis of solar lentigo. Randomized clinical trials are required to formally assess the potential benefits and harms of providing dermatologists with ADAE results after identifying a skin lesion suspicious for melanoma.

### Chronic cutaneous lesions of sarcoidosis [^1143F2YA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis involvement of the skin is common. The skin lesions of sarcoidosis may be nonspecific, showing a nondiagnostic inflammatory reaction pattern on histologic evaluation. Nonspecific skin lesions are often associated with an acute presentation of sarcoidosis and, in general, portend a good prognosis. Specific sarcoidosis skin lesions reveal typical sarcoid granulomas on histologic examination. These lesions tend to be chronic and require therapy for resolution. This article will review the epidemiology, diagnostic evaluation, and description of the various chronic skin lesions of sarcoidosis. Various images of these skin lesions will be demonstrated.

### Screening for skin cancer [^115ZiPrZ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Context

Malignant melanoma is often lethal, and its incidence in the United States has increased rapidly over the past 2 decades. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is seldom lethal, but, if advanced, can cause severe disfigurement and morbidity. Early detection and treatment of melanoma might reduce mortality, while early detection and treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer might prevent major disfigurement and to a lesser extent prevent mortality. Current recommendations from professional societies regarding screening for skin cancer vary.

Objective

To examine published data on the effectiveness of routine screening for skin cancer by a primary care provider, as part of an assessment for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

We searched the MEDLINE database for papers published between 1994 and June 1999, using search terms for screening, physical examination, morbidity, and skin neoplasms. For information on accuracy of screening tests, we used the search terms sensitivity and specificity. We identified the most important studies from before 1994 from the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, second edition, and from high-quality reviews. We used reference lists and expert recommendations to locate additional articles.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently reviewed a subset of 500 abstracts. Once consistency was established, the remainder were reviewed by one reviewer. We included studies if they contained data on yield of screening, screening tests, risk factors, risk assessment, effectiveness of early detection, or cost effectiveness.

Data Extraction

We abstracted the following descriptive information from full-text published studies of screening and recorded it in an electronic database: type of screening study, study design, setting, population, patient recruitment, screening test description, examiner, advertising targeted at high-risk groups or not targeted, reported risk factors of participants, and procedure for referrals. We also abstracted the yield of screening data including probabilities and numbers of referrals, types of suspected skin cancers, biopsies, confirmed skin cancers, and stages and thickness of skin cancers. For studies that reported test performance, we recorded the definition of a suspicious lesion, the "gold-standard" determination of disease, and the number of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative test results. When possible, positive predictive values, likelihood ratios, sensitivity, and specificity were recorded.

Data Synthesis

No randomized or case-control studies have been done that demonstrate that routine screening for melanoma by primary care providers reduces morbidity or mortality. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are very common, but detection and treatment in the absence of formal screening are almost always curative. No controlled studies have shown that formal screening programs will improve this already high cure rate. While the efficacy of screening has not been established, the screening procedures themselves are noninvasive, and the follow-up test, skin biopsy, has low morbidity. Five studies from mass screening programs reported the accuracy of skin examination as a screening test. One of these, a prospective study, tracked patients with negative results to determine the number of patients with false-negative results. In this study, the sensitivity of screening for skin cancer was 94% and specificity was 98%. Several recent case-control studies confirm earlier evidence that risk of melanoma rises with the presence of atypical moles and/or many common moles. One well-done prospective study demonstrated that risk assessment by limited physical exam identified a relatively small (< 10%) group of primary care patients for more thorough evaluation.

Conclusions

The quality of the evidence addressing the accuracy of routine screening by primary care providers for early detection of melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer ranged from poor to fair. We found no studies that assessed the effectiveness of periodic skin examination by a clinician in reducing melanoma mortality. Both self-assessment of risk factors or clinician examination can classify a small proportion of patients as at highest risk for melanoma. Skin cancer screening, perhaps using a risk-assessment technique to identify high-risk patients who are seeing a physician for other reasons, merits additional study as a strategy to address the excess burden of disease in older adults.

Biopsy — Indications and Recommendations

Lichen sclerosus guidelines recommend biopsy for diagnostic uncertainty and suspicion for neoplasia but provide few additional details. – Survey of 23 expert pathologists identified clinical features thought to support dVIN: visible lesion, history of LS/LP, previous SCC, older than 40 years, and steroid nonresponsiveness; none of these distinguish between leading differential diagnoses nor reliably exclude HSIL. Clinicians engaged in LS supervision require (1) familiarity with subtle manifestations of dVIN, (2) equipment and skill to biopsy in the outpatient setting, and (3) a mechanism for prompt operating room access for periclitoral or periurethral disease, multiple lesions, or refusal of office procedures. Adequate tissue sampling and labeling maximizes the chance of correct diagnosis. Accurate, pertinent information on pathology request forms is fundamental to clinicopathologic correlation.

Recommendations for tissue sampling of suspected precursor lesions,:

Optimal specimens require a minimum 4-mm width with 5-mm depth for hair bearing skin and 3-mm depth for hairless skin; this may be achieved with punch, suture-assisted snip, or excisional techniques,
Biopsy each morphologically distinct site at the most suspicious part of the lesion(s),
In the case of ulcer or fissure, biopsy where there is intact epithelium, and
In the case of presumed erosion, obtain a biopsy within the red-pink patch.

Recommendations for labeling and communication with pathologists include,:

Note laterality and location with anatomic terms, not an unoriented "clock-face" position,
Obtain and store clinical photographs with consent,
Write the underlying dermatosis and differential diagnosis on the request form,
Document concern for neoplasia and any previous HSIL, VAM, dVIN, and/or SCC, and
Flatten and pin excisional specimens with labels of surrounding structures.

Mapping biopsies may be required to outline margins and guide excisional procedures. Rates of margin positivity for dVIN range from 45% to 75%. To preserve capacity for sentinel nodes, generalists should avoid wide local excision unless SCC was recently excluded.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^1121RJTK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary cutaneous melanoma (CM) — clinical information provided to the pathologist — states that on the pathology requisition, it is essential that the clinician provide patient identification, age, sex, and the precise anatomic location of the biopsy site, including laterality; it is strongly recommended that the clinician include the clinical impression and differential diagnosis, size of the lesion, and intent of the biopsy with the type performed (elliptical/fusiform, deep shave/saucerization, broad shave, or punch). Macroscopic satellites around the clinical lesion should be noted because they upstage CM to stage III at the outset and can be associated with microscopic satellites in the primary tumor. It may be very useful for the pathologist to review clinical photographs, if possible, and optional but helpful items to be reported include the level of suspicion for CM, clinical description and history of the lesion beyond size (including whether there has been a change in the lesion or previous biopsy), and dermoscopic features (with or without an accompanying photograph), as these features may add specificity to the diagnosis of CM.

Case report

A 50-year-old woman with Fitzpatrick type 1–2 skin and a history of melanoma and atypical nevi presented for her recommended biannual dermatologic evaluation. Despite adherence to sun protection measures, prior dermatology examinations over 18 years had shown 15 biopsy-proven atypical nevi. Three were severely atypical, and 12 were moderately atypical. Just 4 months earlier, malignant melanoma, superficial spreading type (Breslow thickness of 0.7 mm and immunoreactive for melan A), was diagnosed from the anterior portion of her right forearm. Environmental risk factors included a limited, remote history of tanning bed use over 1 year and sunburns but no outdoor work or immunosuppression. She denied any history of lung or renal disease. On examination, tan-brown nevi of various sizes in a widely scattered distribution and a slightly darker suspicious site on the right back-lateral aspect of the lower leg were noted. Biopsy showed superficial spreading melanoma, Breslow thickness of 0.28 mm, and positive melan A reactivity (Fig 1). This unexpected history of 2 new melanomas over a short period prompted more careful review. Genetics consultation with detailed family history showed paternal renal cysts requiring surgical removal and a brother and son each having dysplastic nevi and singular malignant melanoma at an unknown age and age 21 years, respectively. On skin examination, numerous firm, whitish, dome-shaped papules were noted on her face, chest, and back. Three subtle lesions were biopsied, and 1 histologically confirmed fibrofolliculoma was noted, which meets the criterion for dermatologic diagnosis of this syndrome (Fig 2 and Table I). After pretest counseling with a genetics specialist, the patient was offered testing for an FLCN mutation. She declined because of cost and the potential for insurance discrimination.

Superficial soft-tissue lesions are frequently encountered by radiologists in everyday practice. Characterization of these soft-tissue lesions remains problematic, despite advances in imaging. By systematically using clinical history, anatomical location, and signal intensity characteristics on MRI images, one can determine the diagnosis for the subset of determinate lesions that have characteristic clinical and imaging features as well as narrow the differential diagnoses for lesions with non-specific or indeterminate characteristics. In this review, a spectrum of histologically proven benign and malignant superficial soft-tissue lesions from a single institution will be presented. In addition, a few tumour-like conditions will be included as they can be encountered during imaging of soft-tissue masses.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors… [^116e5Ety]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

9 Lipomas must be clinically differentiated from other tumors. The primary differential diagnosis in a subcutaneous mass is a sebaceous cyst or abscess. Lipomas are soft, flesh-colored nodules that are easily moveable under the overlying skin. Sebaceous cysts are generally identifiable by a central punctum, and abscesses can be identified by the presence of warmth, redness, and pain. Ultrasonography is increasingly used to aid in the diagnosis of lipomas. High-frequency ultrasonography can provide high-resolution images of subcutaneous tumors and surrounding structures. 10 The differential diagnosis of lipomas also includes liposarcomas; risk factors for malignancy are size greater than 10 cm, older age, rapid lesion growth, location on the thigh, and invasion into deeper tissue, such as nerve or bone, leading to a firm or fixed feeling on examination.

Lesions concerning for malignancy should be imaged with computed tomography or contrast magnetic resonance imaging.
11. 13 Keratoacanthomas share histopathologic characteristics that make them difficult to distinguish from squamous cell carcinoma. Shave biopsy may be inadequate to distinguish the conditions, whereas punch biopsy may be adequate because it obtains deeper tissue. Because no clinical or pathologic features can reliably differentiate keratoacanthoma from squamous cell carcinoma, early simple excision of lesions is recommended, with margins of 3 to 5 mm. Mohs micrographic surgery may be considered if tissue sparing is desired.
14. 17 Pyogenic granulomas are yellow to purplish, pulpy vascular lesions often surrounded by a scaly collarette. They are usually removed because of their rapid growth and tendency to bleed. The differential diagnosis includes Spitz nevi, amelanotic melanoma, and squamous or basal cell carcinoma.

Treatment options include shave excision with electrodesiccation of the base, and laser ablation 18. 22 Diagnosis of epidermal inclusion cysts is based on appearance and palpation of a discrete, freely movable cyst or nodule. Careful inspection often reveals a central punctum. Treatment is unnecessary unless desired by the patient, and can be accomplished via simple excision with removal of the cyst and cyst wall. Inflamed or ruptured cysts often resolve spontaneously without therapy, although they tend to recur. Intralesional steroid injections can hasten resolution of inflamed cysts and should be followed by interval excision. 23.

### Dermatoscopy and optical coherence tomography in vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and lichen sclerosus: a prospective observational trial [^115mKJbV]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This study describes a structured, prospective approach to identify sophisticated imaging methods for vHSIL and LS. Using dermatoscopy and D-OCT, we described potential characteristics to aid differentiation of diseased from healthy vulvar skin. Dermatoscopy is a promising tool that may facilitate clinical recognition and follow-up of vHSIL and LS after expansion of patient groups and clinical validation. Vulvar biopsies can be obtained on a limited basis, whereas noninvasive techniques can be used repeatedly, minimizing patient burden. The step to clinical integration of D-OCT is considered inappropriate at this stage due to the suboptimal algorithms and remaining questions on the applicability in clinical practice. Imaging techniques should always be preceded by visual examination to establish a clinical differential diagnosis. Our findings require confirmation in larger, more diverse cohorts including suspicious lesions of the vulva over time before implementation in the vulvar clinic.

### Algorithm based smartphone apps to assess risk of skin cancer in adults: systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies [^116GQ2zF]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To examine the validity and findings of studies that examine the accuracy of algorithm based smartphone applications ("apps") to assess risk of skin cancer in suspicious skin lesions.

Design

Systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CPCI, Zetoc, Science Citation Index, and online trial registers (from database inception to 10 April 2019).

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Studies of any design that evaluated algorithm based smartphone apps to assess images of skin lesions suspicious for skin cancer. Reference standards included histological diagnosis or follow-up, and expert recommendation for further investigation or intervention. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed validity using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool). Estimates of sensitivity and specificity were reported for each app.

Results

Nine studies that evaluated six different identifiable smartphone apps were included. Six verified results by using histology or follow-up (n = 725 lesions), and three verified results by using expert recommendations (n = 407 lesions). Studies were small and of poor methodological quality, with selective recruitment, high rates of unevaluable images, and differential verification. Lesion selection and image acquisition were performed by clinicians rather than smartphone users. Two CE (Conformit Europenne) marked apps are available for download. SkinScan was evaluated in a single study (n = 15, five melanomas) with 0% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the detection of melanoma. SkinVision was evaluated in two studies (n = 252, 61 malignant or premalignant lesions) and achieved a sensitivity of 80% (95% confidence interval 63% to 92%) and a specificity of 78% (67% to 87%) for the detection of malignant or premalignant lesions. Accuracy of the SkinVision app verified against expert recommendations was poor (three studies).

Conclusions

Current algorithm based smartphone apps cannot be relied on to detect all cases of melanoma or other skin cancers. Test performance is likely to be poorer than reported here when used in clinically relevant populations and by the intended users of the apps. The current regulatory process for awarding the CE marking for algorithm based apps does not provide adequate protection to the public.

### Teledermatology for diagnosing skin cancer in adults [^11731o2L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are high-risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Teledermatology provides a way for generalist clinicians to access the opinion of a specialist dermatologist for skin lesions that they consider to be suspicious without referring the patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology consultations can be 'store-and-forward' with electronic digital images of a lesion sent to a dermatologist for review at a later time, or can be live and interactive consultations using videoconferencing to connect the patient, referrer and dermatologist in real time.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for the detection of any skin cancer (melanoma, BCC or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)) in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of in-person diagnosis.

Search Methods

We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CPCI, Zetoc, Science Citation Index, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles.

Studies evaluating skin cancer diagnosis for teledermatology alone, or in comparison with face-to-face diagnosis by a specialist clinician, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow-up and expert opinion. We also included studies evaluating the referral accuracy of teledermatology compared with a reference standard of face-to-face diagnosis by a specialist clinician.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS-2). We contacted authors of included studies where there were information related to the target condition of any skin cancer missing. Data permitting, we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. Due to the scarcity of data, we undertook no covariate investigations for this review. For illustrative purposes, we plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity on coupled forest plots for diagnostic threshold and target condition under consideration.

Main Results

The review included 22 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy data for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases (16 studies) and referral accuracy data for reported data for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases as determined by the reference standard face-to-face decision (six studies). Methodological quality was variable with poor reporting hindering assessment. The overall risk of bias was high or unclear for participant selection, reference standard, and participant flow and timing in at least half of all studies; the majority were at low risk of bias for the index test. The applicability of study findings were of high or unclear concern for most studies in all domains assessed due to the recruitment of participants from secondary care settings or specialist clinics rather than from primary or community-based settings in which teledermatology is more likely to be used and due to the acquisition of lesion images by dermatologists or in specialist imaging units rather than by primary care clinicians. Seven studies provided data for the primary target condition of any skin cancer (1588 lesions and 638 malignancies). For the correct diagnosis of lesions as malignant using photographic images, summary sensitivity was 94.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 90.1% to 97.4%) and summary specificity was 84.3% (95% CI 48.5% to 96.8%) (from four studies). Individual study estimates using dermoscopic images or a combination of photographic and dermoscopic images generally suggested similarly high sensitivities with highly variable specificities. Limited comparative data suggested similar diagnostic accuracy between teledermatology assessment and in-person diagnosis by a dermatologist; however, data were too scarce to draw firm conclusions. For the detection of invasive melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants both sensitivities and specificities were more variable. Sensitivities ranged from 59% (95% CI 42% to 74%) to 100% (95% CI 48% to 100%) and specificities from 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%) to 100% (95% CI 93% to 100%), with reported diagnostic thresholds including the correct diagnosis of melanoma, classification of lesions as 'atypical' or 'typical, and the decision to refer or to excise a lesion. Referral accuracy data comparing teledermatology against a face-to-face reference standard suggested good agreement for lesions considered to require some positive action by face-to-face assessment (sensitivities of over 90%). For lesions considered of less concern when assessed face-to-face (e.g. for lesions not recommended for excision or referral), agreement was more variable with teledermatology specificities ranging from 57% (95% CI 39% to 73%) to 100% (95% CI 86% to 100%), suggesting that remote assessment is more likely recommend excision, referral or follow-up compared to in-person decisions.

Authors' Conclusions

Studies were generally small and heterogeneous and methodological quality was difficult to judge due to poor reporting. Bearing in mind concerns regarding the applicability of study participants and of lesion image acquisition in specialist settings, our results suggest that teledermatology can correctly identify the majority of malignant lesions. Using a more widely defined threshold to identify 'possibly' malignant cases or lesions that should be considered for excision is likely to appropriately triage those lesions requiring face-to-face assessment by a specialist. Despite the increasing use of teledermatology on an international level, the evidence base to support its ability to accurately diagnose lesions and to triage lesions from primary to secondary care is lacking and further prospective and pragmatic evaluation is needed.

### Effect of adding a diagnostic aid to best practice to manage suspicious pigmented lesions in primary care: randomised controlled trial [^112gaSPX]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

MoleMate (intervention) group

Lesions of participants allocated to the intervention group were clinically assessed as for the control group. Lead clinicians then used the MoleMate system to support their assessment and management of the lesion.

For all lesions, lead clinicians then decided whether to refer patients through the fast track skin cancer pathway or to manage them in primary care.

Reference standards

We recorded a reference standard final diagnosis for all lesions in the trial. For referred lesions we defined this as expert opinion by a histologist or dermatologist, and for non-referred lesions as review by two other dermatology experts of the recorded clinical history and examination, a digital photograph, and MoleMate image where available. For lesions where there was uncertainty based on this initial review (for example, poor quality digital photograph), the lead clinician collected these data on a second occasion 3–6 months later. All participants with non-referred lesions were also offered a follow-up consultation with the lead clinician 3–6 months later to collect these data, including a second photograph, for review by the dermatology experts to identify change over time and to confirm a benign diagnosis.

### Problematic lesions in the elderly [^111Pz8D3]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

As the population continues to age, clinicians and dermatologists are increasingly faced with geriatric patients presenting with a range of dermatologic manifestations, including benign and malignant skin tumors. Knowledge of epidemiologic and morphologic features, including dermoscopy of common and benign melanocytic and nonmelanocytic skin tumors, provides the basis for a better understanding and management of problematic skin tumors in this age group. This article provides an overview of common and problematic skin lesions in elderly patients and addresses epidemiologic, clinical, and dermoscopic clues that aid the differential diagnosis and management of challenging skin lesions.

### Differential diagnosis of round or discoid lesions [^111Z96DE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are called on to diagnose a variety of skin conditions in diverse age groups. Dermatologic diagnosis, based on identification of a primary lesion, uses morphologic clues to categorize the pathologic process causing the eruption. In addition, distribution and grouping of lesions helps support a specific diagnosis. Dermatologists consciously or unconsciously use pattern recognition to arrive at their differential diagnosis based on clinical experience and their having previously viewed similarly appearing skin lesions in lectures, texts, and journals. Round and discoid patches and plaques are extremely common in the clinical practice of dermatology. This contribution reviews the dermatologic conditions that present as round or discoid lesions and presents an approach to diagnosis.

### Benign cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions on FDG-PET / CT [^111m8hKF]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

18 F-FDG, the most commonly used PET radiopharmaceutical in clinical practice, can also accumulate in inflammatory and infectious conditions. This may account for false-positive PET findings when staging or restaging a patient with malignancy. As clinical use of FDG-PET-CT is increasing, nuclear medicine physicians are encountering a myriad of cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions, many of which are incidental and benign. The most common cause for the FDG avidity of these lesions is inflammation. Although a specific diagnosis may not always be possible, background clinical history and morphologic features of the lesion on CT may help narrow the differential diagnosis. This article aims to familiarize nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists with various benign cutaneous and subcutaneous conditions encountered in routine clinical practice.

### Visual inspection for diagnosing cutaneous melanoma in adults [^113Bz15F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Melanoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates of any cancer. It accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. History-taking and visual inspection of a suspicious lesion by a clinician is usually the first in a series of 'tests' to diagnose skin cancer. Establishing the accuracy of visual inspection alone is critical to understating the potential contribution of additional tests to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with limited prior testing and in those referred for further evaluation of a suspicious lesion. Studies were separated according to whether the diagnosis was recorded face-to-face (in-person) or based on remote (image-based) assessment.

Search Methods

We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: CENTRAL; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles.

Selection Criteria

Test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated visual inspection in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow-up. We excluded studies reporting data for 'clinical diagnosis' where dermoscopy may or may not have been used.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS-2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities per algorithm and threshold using the bivariate hierarchical model. We investigated the impact of: in-person test interpretation; use of a purposely developed algorithm to assist diagnosis; and observer expertise.

Main Results

We included 49 publications reporting on a total of 51 study cohorts with 34,351 lesions (including 2499 cases), providing 134 datasets for visual inspection. Across almost all study quality domains, the majority of study reports provided insufficient information to allow us to judge the risk of bias, while in three of four domains that we assessed we scored concerns regarding applicability of study findings as 'high'. Selective participant recruitment, lack of detail regarding the threshold for deciding on a positive test result, and lack of detail on observer expertise were particularly problematic. Attempts to analyse studies by degree of prior testing were hampered by a lack of relevant information and by the restricted inclusion of lesions selected for biopsy or excision. Accuracy was generally much higher for in-person diagnosis compared to image-based evaluations (relative diagnostic odds ratio of 8.54, 95% CI 2.89 to 25.3, P < 0.001). Meta-analysis of in-person evaluations that could be clearly placed on the clinical pathway showed a general trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, with the highest sensitivity (92.4%, 95% CI 26.2% to 99.8%) and lowest specificity (79.7%, 95% CI 73.7% to 84.7%) observed in participants with limited prior testing (n = 3 datasets). Summary sensitivities were lower for those referred for specialist assessment but with much higher specificities (e.g. sensitivity 76.7%, 95% CI 61.7% to 87.1%) and specificity 95.7%, 95% CI 89.7% to 98.3%) for lesions selected for excision, n = 8 datasets). These differences may be related to differences in the spectrum of included lesions, differences in the definition of a positive test result, or to variations in observer expertise. We did not find clear evidence that accuracy is improved by the use of any algorithm to assist diagnosis in all settings. Attempts to examine the effect of observer expertise in melanoma diagnosis were hindered due to poor reporting.

Authors' Conclusions

Visual inspection is a fundamental component of the assessment of a suspicious skin lesion; however, the evidence suggests that melanomas will be missed if visual inspection is used on its own. The evidence to support its accuracy in the range of settings in which it is used is flawed and very poorly reported. Although published algorithms do not appear to improve accuracy, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the 'no algorithm' approach should be preferred in all settings. Despite the volume of research evaluating visual inspection, further prospective evaluation of the potential added value of using established algorithms according to the prior testing or diagnostic difficulty of lesions may be warranted.

### Superficial soft-tissue masses: analysis, diagnosis, and differential considerations [^116nq8K2]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

A wide variety of superficial soft-tissue masses may be seen in clinical practice, but a systematic approach can help achieve a definitive diagnosis or limit a differential diagnosis. Superficial soft-tissue masses can generally be categorized as mesenchymal tumors, skin appendage lesions, metastatic tumors, other tumors and tumorlike lesions, or inflammatory lesions. With regard to their imaging features, these masses may be further divided into lesions that arise in association with the epidermis or dermis (cutaneous lesions), lesions that arise within the substance of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, or lesions that arise in intimate association with the fascia overlying the muscle. The differential diagnosis may be limited further by considering the age of the patient, anatomic location of the lesion, salient imaging features, and clinical manifestations.

### Effect of adding a diagnostic aid to best practice to manage suspicious pigmented lesions in primary care: randomised controlled trial [^115AU3cw]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We carried out a prospective, randomised open trial with pragmatic ascertainment of an endpoint, in 15 general practices in eastern England. The protocol for the MoleMate UK Trial has been published elsewhere.

Participants

All general practice team members identified potential participants. Adults were eligible for enrolment if they were aged 18 or over and had a suspicious pigmented lesion. For the purpose of the trial the definition of a suspicious pigmented lesion was any lesion presented by a patient, or opportunistically seen by a family doctor or practice nurse, that could not immediately be diagnosed as benign and about which the patient could not be reassured. We excluded patients who were unable to give informed consent or were considered inappropriate to include by their family doctor. Potentially eligible patients were internally referred within the general practice to attend a trial appointment within one week.

Procedures

Lead clinicians

In each practice we trained two lead clinicians (a total of 28 general practitioners and two nurse practitioners) in consent procedures for the trial, data collection, and best practice assessment. They also learned to use and interpret the MoleMate system by completing a two hour training CD-ROM to identify relevant SIAscopic features of various pigmented skin lesions; this has been shown to significantly improve the ability of general practitioners to interpret SIAscopic images. At the trial appointment the lead clinician confirmed eligibility of the patients and obtained consent. We did not recruit practices already using a MoleMate system, and we excluded general practitioners with known dermatological expertise from being lead clinicians — that is, current hospital practitioners, clinical assistants in dermatology, and general practitioners with a specialist interest in dermatology.

Randomisation

The lead clinician randomised participants to either the best practice (control) group or the MoleMate (intervention) group on the basis of a block randomisation method, using computer generated, randomly permuted blocks of size 2, 4, and 6, established by the trial statistician (ATP). Sets of numbered, sealed envelopes were prepared, with the order of the sequences verified at completion of the trial (ATP). Randomisation was stratified by lead clinician and patient's age (≤ 45 years, ≥ 46 years) to account for a potential differential effect on referral owing to the inclusion of age in the intervention system's primary care scoring algorithm.

Best practice (control) group

Lesions of participants allocated to the control group were clinically assessed according to the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust guidelines. This included taking a clinical history and naked eye examination.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115stpxn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation in febrile neutropenia with skin and soft tissue lesions — key diagnostic steps are specified. Signs and symptoms are often diminished or absent in neutropenia, and skin lesions, no matter how small or innocuous in appearance, should be carefully evaluated. Early involvement of an infectious diseases specialist, a surgeon, and a dermatologist may result in improved outcome. Initial clinical impressions should be supplemented with a systemic approach to enhance diagnosis and management. Blood cultures are critical, and at least 2 sets should be obtained. Radiographic imaging should be performed as clinically indicated and can help define extent of disease; chest/sinus imaging may identify silent pulmonary or sinus infection with dissemination. The most specific method is biopsy or aspiration of lesions for histological, cytological, and microbiological evaluation.

### Optimizing skin disease diagnosis: harnessing online community data with contrastive learning and clustering techniques [^116tTCov]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

AI-assisted diagnosis of skin diseases has immense potential for further advancement, especially with recent breakthroughs in multimodal language models like ChatGPT. These models possess the capability to process both image and text information, enabling quick access to accurate information about skin diseases for patients and healthcare providers, along with personalized responses to users' inquiries and descriptions. Furthermore, the integration of text-based patient symptoms with image-based skin lesions, gathered from internet forums and other user data sources, can further enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, it is important to note that dermatological conditions often encompass numerous atypical cases. Relying solely on images for a preliminary diagnosis and then mechanically asking questions to differentiate them from common diagnoses would be time-consuming and may not yield accurate results. Building upon our work, it may be possible to improve the efficiency of consultations by employing a common language model that can better target differential diagnoses sharing typical lesion features. This approach could optimize the efficiency of consultations. For skin lesions located far away from clusters of other diseases, the reliability of the diagnosis would increase, requiring only a few follow-up questions, thereby further optimizing efficiency. With the advent of Internet hospitals, these models can even identify similarities between patients with similar symptoms or conditions. Thus, incorporating internet data can lead to more effective and efficient development of skin disease diagnostic models. As AI technologies continue to advance, we can expect even more exciting possibilities for AI-assisted diagnosis of skin diseases in the future.
