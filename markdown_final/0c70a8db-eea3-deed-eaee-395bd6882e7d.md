## Question

Controller medication for asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about controller medication for asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining controller therapy and its dual goals. Then, I should verify the universal foundation of inhaled corticosteroids and the evidence base. Next, I will examine stepwise escalation, including LABA, LAMA, and LTRA, and clarify the role of SMART/MART. After that, I need to check age-specific nuances, including children 5 years and younger. I will then review step-down principles, adherence and inhaler technique, and finally synthesize a practical decision framework with key takeaways anchored to guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the definition and goals of controller therapy. Controllers are medications used on a regular basis to target both symptom control and future risk, with the overarching aims of achieving good long-term symptom control and minimizing exacerbations, lung function decline, and medication side effects, while aligning with patient goals through shared decision-making [^2d5a224e] [^7ec64e6c] [^ca809034].

> I need to verify the foundation: inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone across severities and ages. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence. Multiple high-credibility guidelines strongly recommend ICS as initial controller for persistent asthma, citing robust evidence that ICS improve symptoms, lung function, and reduce exacerbations and asthma-related mortality, with benefits even in mild disease when used appropriately [^f2da39c4] [^8acfff88] [^eb946f0d] [^2349739b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about add-on therapy. I should confirm the stepwise approach. For patients not controlled on ICS alone, adding a LABA is preferred over increasing ICS dose or adding LAMA or LTRA, given superior efficacy and a favorable benefit–risk profile; LAMA is a conditional alternative when LABA is not tolerated or unavailable, and LTRA is less effective but may be considered when ICS is not feasible or as an add-on in selected cases [^11e0b741] [^9d71287b] [^591c3403] [^e1a26ec1].

> Let me consider the SMART/MART strategy carefully. Single maintenance and reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol reduces exacerbations compared with higher-dose ICS or fixed-dose ICS-LABA plus SABA, with high-certainty evidence in adults and adolescents and moderate certainty in children 4–11 years; however, I should double-check regulatory status because in the U.S. this remains off-label for reliever use, which impacts access and payer coverage despite strong guideline endorsement [^ca7c0e6a] [^5217db2e] [^c3760644] [^cdb0f357].

> Next, I should review age-specific nuances. For adults and adolescents, ICS-containing therapy is recommended for all, with either daily low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed or as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol for mild asthma, and MART preferred for moderate–severe disease; for children 6–11 years, daily low-dose ICS is preferred, with ICS-LABA considered if control is inadequate; for children 5 years and younger, low-dose ICS is first-line, with reassessment of diagnosis and technique if control is poor after 3 months and careful stepwise adjustments based on response and risk [^043e58b2] [^741f8255] [^6e371ac6] [^121c9240].

> I will now examine step-down principles. Once good control is sustained for 2–3 months, I should confirm that guidelines recommend stepping down to the lowest effective ICS dose rather than abrupt withdrawal, with close monitoring for loss of control; this balances efficacy and safety and reduces the risk of overtreatment [^ff163c6f] [^dfe83fda] [^532f973d].

> But wait, what if poor control persists despite appropriate therapy? I need to ensure I check adherence, inhaler technique, and comorbidities before escalating, because these are common, modifiable drivers of uncontrolled asthma; indeed, technique errors are frequent and correcting them can materially improve outcomes, and structured education with written action plans improves adherence and reduces exacerbations [^69993b17] [^53a8196c] [^9811d218].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. Start with ICS for persistent asthma, tailor intensity to severity and patient factors, escalate preferentially to ICS-LABA if uncontrolled, consider SMART/MART when appropriate and available, reserve LAMA or LTRA for specific scenarios, and always reassess control, technique, and adherence at 1–3 month intervals; incorporate shared decision-making around device choice, cost, and patient goals to sustain long-term adherence and outcomes [^aa7bd711] [^6e161f04] [^a2ff5cae].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check that this aligns with the highest-quality sources: controller therapy centers on ICS-containing regimens to reduce both current symptom burden and future risk, with stepwise escalation that prioritizes ICS-LABA combinations and, when suitable, SMART/MART strategies, while individualizing by age, phenotype, access, and patient preferences and committing to regular review and step-down when stable [^2d5a224e] [^ca7c0e6a] [^f2da39c4].

Controller medications are the cornerstone of asthma management, with **inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as first-line therapy** for persistent asthma because they reduce airway inflammation, improve symptoms, and lower exacerbation risk [^f2da39c4] [^eb946f0d]. For patients not controlled on ICS alone, **add-on therapy with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)** is recommended; ICS-LABA combinations are preferred over increasing ICS dose alone [^11e0b741] [^9d71287b]. In moderate-to-severe asthma, single inhaler maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART/MART) with ICS-formoterol reduces exacerbations and simplifies regimens [^ca7c0e6a] [^5217db2e]. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are alternatives when ICS are not tolerated or as add-ons in specific cases [^741f8255] [^9c66ccce]. Treatment should be individualized, with regular reassessment and step-down once control is sustained [^ff163c6f] [^dfe83fda].

## Classes of controller medications

Controller medications include several classes, each with distinct mechanisms and roles:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical role** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) | - Fluticasone <br/> - Budesonide <br/> - Beclomethasone | Reduce airway inflammation | First-line for persistent asthma; improve symptoms, lung function, and reduce exacerbations [^f2da39c4] [^eb946f0d] |
| Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) | - Salmeterol <br/> - Formoterol | Bronchodilation | Add-on to ICS when control is inadequate; never use alone without ICS [^11e0b741] [^a26fd9fb] |
| Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) | - Montelukast <br/> - Zafirlukast | Block leukotriene receptors | Alternative or add-on therapy; useful when ICS are not tolerated or in allergic phenotypes [^741f8255] [^d0438c1b] |
| Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) | - Tiotropium <br/> - Umeclidinium | Anticholinergic bronchodilation | Add-on therapy for moderate-to-severe asthma, especially when LABA is not tolerated [^9c66ccce] [^67aa3e07] |
| Combination therapies | - ICS-LABA (e.g. fluticasone-salmeterol) <br/> - ICS-LAMA (e.g. fluticasone-umeclidinium) | Combined anti-inflammatory and bronchodilation | Preferred for moderate-to-severe asthma; SMART/MART with ICS-formoterol reduces exacerbations [^ca7c0e6a] [^5217db2e] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**, tailoring therapy to asthma severity and control:

- **Step 1 (intermittent asthma)**: Low-dose ICS as needed or daily in selected patients [^741f8255].
- **Step 2 (mild persistent)**: Daily low-dose ICS or as-needed ICS-formoterol [^741f8255].
- **Step 3 (moderate persistent)**: Low-dose ICS-LABA or ICS-formoterol SMART/MART [^ca7c0e6a].
- **Step 4 (severe persistent)**: Medium/high-dose ICS-LABA ± LAMA or LTRA; consider biologics for severe asthma [^936ff7d0].

Regular reassessment and **step-down** are recommended once control is sustained for 3 months [^ff163c6f] [^dfe83fda].

---

## Benefits and limitations of controller medications

Controller medications provide significant benefits, including improved symptom control, reduced exacerbations, enhanced quality of life, and preserved lung function [^eb946f0d] [^2349739b]. However, limitations include potential side effects (e.g. oral candidiasis with ICS, neuropsychiatric effects with LTRAs), adherence challenges, and cost/access barriers [^0a7438d3] [^3f1372f3].

---

## Factors influencing medication choice

Medication selection is individualized based on:

- **Age**: Children ≤ 5 years generally start with low-dose ICS; SMART/MART is not recommended in this age group [^6e371ac6].
- **Severity and control**: Higher steps for more severe or uncontrolled asthma [^aa7bd711].
- **Comorbidities**: Allergic rhinitis favors LTRAs; COPD overlap may benefit from LAMA [^notfound].
- **Patient preferences**: Inhaler technique, dosing frequency, and side-effect profiles [^6e161f04].
- **Cost and access**: Insurance coverage and availability influence adherence and outcomes [^3f1372f3].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies include **biologics** targeting type 2 inflammation (e.g. anti-IgE, anti-IL4/13, anti-IL5) for severe asthma, and novel inhaled combinations and devices to improve adherence and delivery [^6dd2ac93] [^d32df538]. Research continues to refine phenotype-specific strategies and minimize corticosteroid exposure [^859a1880] [^18673519].

---

Controller medications are essential for asthma management, with **ICS as the foundation** and stepwise add-on therapy tailored to control and patient factors. Regular reassessment and shared decision-making optimize outcomes and minimize adverse effects [^aa7bd711] [^ef025e83].

Guidelines-based management of the patient with asthma allows maximal levels of function with few adverse effects. A flexible approach to therapy that emphasizes an ongoing partnership between the patient and physician allows optimal communication, facilitating treatment adherence and maximal levels of control. Through assessment of the patient's initial severity of disease and an evaluation of the patient's ongoing level of control, appropriate medical therapy can be initiated and level of therapy can be modified based on the patient's response. Patient education, environmental control strategies, and proper use of medications are vital in achieving maximal benefit in asthma management. Excellent asthma control is possible and should be a goal of both physicians and patients.

Initiate ICS-containing therapy in patients not currently taking controller medication to reduce the risk of further exacerbations.

### Improving primary care management of asthma: do we know what really works? [^c2e90b8b]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma continues to be a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and there is need for a coordinated effort to improve care. A well-resourced primary care service is central to the provision of accessible and effective asthma care. An expert team identified the drivers that could enable improvements in both clinical management and patient outcomes, and a literature search showed that each of these individual drivers is supported by varying degrees of evidence. Objectively assessing the outcomes of such interventions is challenging because studies in this area are inherently complex, difficult to undertake and resource intensive, and so definitive research is seldom undertaken. In contrast single interventions studies are easier to conduct but frequently methodologically less robust and therefore tend to be inconclusive. Nevertheless, if substantial improvements in the management of asthma in primary care at a global level are to be achieved, combinations of interventions appear to be most effective. Well-supported holistic interventions involving the entire healthcare system and including the patient voice appear to provide the best outcomes.

Personalized control-based asthma management — Asthma control has two domains: symptom control and risk reduction, and in control-based asthma management treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle that involves assessment of symptom control and risk factors, treatment and review by appropriately trained personnel to achieve the goals of asthma treatment; asthma outcomes have been shown to improve after the introduction of control-based guidelines or practical tools; since 2014, GINA has emphasized personalized management of modifiable risk factors and patient preferences while non‑modifiable risk factors such as a history of past ICU admission should also be documented; for many patients in primary care, achieving good symptom control is a good guide to a reduced risk of exacerbations, and when ICSs were introduced into asthma management, large improvements were observed in symptom control and lung function with decreases in exacerbations and asthma-related mortality; however, patients with few or intermittent symptoms may be still at risk of severe exacerbations, some continue to exacerbate despite well-controlled symptoms, and side-effects may be an issue if ICS doses are stepped up, therefore both domains of asthma control (symptom control and future risk) should be considered when choosing treatment and reviewing response.

Introduction

Asthma is a serious global health issue that affects all age groups, with a reported 339 million sufferers worldwide, presenting a number of challenges for primary care physicians. Many patients with asthma remain symptomatic, despite treatment, for multiple different reasons –. It has been suggested that patients may overestimate and thus inaccurately report their level of disease control, because they accept and tolerate a certain level of symptoms, assuming them to be an inevitable consequence of asthma. Physicians may underestimate the prevalence and severity of symptoms and overestimate the degree to which the patient's asthma is controlled, meaning the patient may not receive adequate medication to achieve control of their disease. Reducing asthma symptoms and future risk through correct add-on therapy and management in patients who remain uncontrolled despite treatment is a major challenge for those working in both secondary and primary care. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) strategy recommends a stepwise approach to asthma management in order to achieve symptom control and prevent future risks, including exacerbations, loss of lung function, and side effects of medication (Fig. 1). Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are considered an effective long-term controller treatment in the management of asthma. However, if asthma remains uncontrolled despite medium-dose ICS, increasing the dose of ICS may not be appropriate due to an increased risk of local and systemic side effects and variation in individual ICS dose-responsiveness between patients. In addition, most of the clinical benefit of ICS use is seen at low doses. Add-on treatments may therefore be required. In addition, evidence suggests that the ICS dose–response curve is relatively flat, with 80–90% of the maximum achievable therapeutic effect in adult asthma obtained at 200–250 μg of fluticasone propionate or equivalent (Fig. 2); therefore, addition of an add-on therapy may be considered to be a more effective and safer treatment strategy –.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^aa7bd711]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma management cycle for personalized asthma care involves a continual cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment and review. Assess the patient's symptom control and their risk factors for exacerbations, for decline in lung function and for medication adverse effects, with particular attention to inhaler technique and adherence; assess comorbidities and the patient's goals and preferences, and confirm the diagnosis of asthma if not yet done. Adjust the patient's management based on these assessments, including treatment of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities, relevant non-pharmacologic strategies, education and skills training, and adjustment of medication as required; for adults and adolescents, the preferred controller and reliever treatment across all steps is with combination ICS-formoterol, as shown in GINA Track 1. Review the patient in line with the goals of treatment, reassess factors affecting symptoms, risk of adverse outcomes and patient satisfaction, arrange further investigations if needed, and readjust treatment if needed.

### Comparing LAMA with LABA and LTRA as add-on therapies in primary care asthma management [^e1a26ec1]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma recommends a stepwise approach to adjust asthma treatment to the needs of individual patients; inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) remain the core pharmacological treatment. However, many patients remain poorly controlled, and evidence-based algorithms to decide on the best order and rationale for add-on therapies are lacking. We explore the challenges of asthma management in primary care and review outcomes from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses comparing the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium with long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABAs) or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) as add-on to ICS in patients with asthma. In adults, LAMAs and LABAs provide a greater improvement in lung function than LTRAs as add-on to ICS. In children, results were positive and comparable between therapies, but data are scarce. This information could aid decision-making in primary care, supporting the use of add-on therapy to ICS to help improve lung function, control asthma symptoms and prevent exacerbations.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^bbfc72a3]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the GINA strategy emphasizes that asthma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anyone presenting with respiratory symptoms, particularly if recurrent and varying in severity. Where possible, the diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed with lung function testing before initiating controller treatment. Asthma control should be assessed in two domains: current symptom control and risk factors for future asthma flare-ups (exacerbations), which include having had a flare-up in the previous 12 months. Asthma treatment for all patients should include ICS: either regularly or (in mild asthma) as needed whenever symptom reliever is taken.

Optimization of asthma treatment includes education and skills training for inhaler technique and adherence, and provision of a written/pictorial asthma action plan. Failure to successfully optimize care in people with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma should prompt careful reassessment — if available, by a specialist with appropriate facilities for diagnosis and interdisciplinary treatment. Collaboration between primary care doctors and respiratory physicians is a key factor in effective asthma management.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^29257e37]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary care clinicians play a key role in asthma and asthma exacerbation management worldwide because most patients with asthma are treated in primary care settings. The high burden of asthma exacerbations persists and important practice gaps remain, despite continual advances in asthma care. Lack of primary care-specific guidance, uncontrolled asthma, incomplete assessment of exacerbation and asthma control history, and reliance on systemic corticosteroids or short-acting beta 2 -agonist-only therapy are challenges clinicians face today with asthma care. Evidence supports the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) + fast-acting bronchodilator treatments when used as needed in response to symptoms to improve asthma control and reduce rates of exacerbations, and the symptoms that occur leading up to an asthma exacerbation provide a window of opportunity to intervene with ICS. Incorporating patient perspectives and preferences when designing asthma regimens will help patients be more engaged in their therapy and may contribute to improved adherence and outcomes. This expert consensus contains 10 Best Practice Advice Points from a panel of primary care clinicians and a patient representative, formed in collaboration with the International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG), a clinically led charitable organization that works locally and globally in primary care to improve respiratory health. The panel met virtually and developed a series of best practice statements, which were drafted and subsequently voted on to obtain consensus. Primary care clinicians globally are encouraged to review and adapt these best practice advice points on preventing and managing asthma exacerbations to their local practice patterns to enhance asthma care within their practice.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^ca7c0e6a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 4.3

What is the comparative effectiveness of ICS with LABA used as both controller and quick-relief therapy compared to ICS with or without LABA used as controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

Recommendation 12: In individuals aged 4 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared to either a higher-dose ICS as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy or the same-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy.

Strong recommendation, high certainty of evidence for ages 12 years and above, moderate certainty of evidence for ages 4 to 11 years

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

In individuals aged 4 years and older, the preferred Step 3 (low-dose ICS) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS) therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol both daily and as needed. In the literature, inhaled ICS-formoterol is referred to as "single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART)." This form of therapy has only been used with formoterol as the LABA. Formoterol has a rapid onset and a maximum total daily dose that allows it to be used more than twice daily. The maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 8 puffs (36 μg) for ages4 to11 years and12puffs (54 μg) for ages12 years and above. SMART is administered with a single inhaler containing both formoterol and an ICS (primarily budesonide in the reviewed studies, but one study used beclomethasone). The regimens compared to address this key question required two inhalers: the controller (ICS or ICS-LABA) and the reliever (SABA). The recommended alternate therapy of maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy does not need to be changed if it is providing adequate control. However, patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on such therapy should receive the preferred SMART if possible before moving to a higher step of therapy.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^a2ff5cae]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma review frequency — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — states that each patient's asthma should be reviewed regularly to monitor control, risk factors and exacerbations and to document response to treatment changes; for most controller medications improvement begins within days but the full benefit may only be reached after 3–4 months; all healthcare providers should be encouraged to assess asthma control, adherence and inhaler technique at every visit; and ideally patients should be seen 1–3 months after starting treatment and every 3–12 months thereafter, with a review visit within 1 week scheduled after an exacerbation.

### Patients' perspective of barriers and facilitators to taking long-term controller medication for asthma: a novel taxonomy [^c19f177c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nearly 60% of patients with persistent asthma have suboptimal asthma control, a figure that has remained unchanged since 2000 in Canada and abroad. Suboptimal asthma control is associated with preventable asthma symptoms, overuse of bronchodilators (i.e. rescue medication), functional impairment (e.g. work absenteeism), increased health service use (e.g. emergency visits), and even death. The goal of asthma management is to control the disease so that patients may lead a normal active life and prevent long-term impairment. Through guided self-management plans, patients learn to manage their asthma under the recommendations of their physician. The cornerstone of asthma management in individuals with persistent asthma is the daily use of long-term controller medication for the disease, most notably, inhaled corticosteroids. Unfortunately, adherence to recommended medications remains very low and is recognized as the main cause of therapeutic failure and preventable asthma morbidity.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^2f52c918]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Asthma CPG — Controller/reliever therapy context — The 2025 VA/DoD Asthma CPG uses the terminology controller/reliever rather than maintenance and reliever and notes that particularly for mild asthma a symptom driven controller/reliever strategy does not require daily maintenance use. The majority of studies evaluated a single inhaler combination of inhaled corticosteroid and formoterol, and at the time of this guideline, formoterol is the only long-acting beta agonist (LABA) studied and effective in controller/reliever therapy, although it is not FDA approved as a reliever medication. A small number of studies evaluated a single inhaler combination of ICS/albuterol; albuterol is fast-acting with a shorter duration of action and is considered a short acting beta agonist (SABA). Access to combination inhalers may be limited due to cost or formulary considerations; with education, patients could duplicate the combined controller/reliever strategy by taking separate beta agonist and inhaled corticosteroid inhalers at the same time with close follow-up; combination products simplify treatment plans, support improved adherence by avoiding multiple devices, and patients will need education on purpose, frequency of use/overuse, and inhaler administration technique.

### Medication regimens for managing stable asthma [^d32df538]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma was developed as a means of standardizing asthma therapies and of improving outcomes. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines provide recommendations to care providers about the routine management of asthma. There has been rapid development of new therapies for asthma, specifically with the advent of new drug delivery devices and biologic therapies for severe asthma. We are increasingly recognizing that asthma is a heterogenous disease with a diverse underlying pathophysiology, and therefore, it is imperative for care providers to begin to understand asthma phenotypes and endotypes, and the implications of these classifications on management, especially of severe refractory asthma. This article serves as a review of guideline-based therapy for asthma and includes updates on alternative therapies, new approaches that use previously recognized therapies, and special populations with asthma.

### Medications for asthma… [^a26fd9fb]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Medications Used to Treat Asthma Medications are used to treat asthma to reduce the chance of symptoms worsening, which could lead to the need for additional medications or a visit to the hospital or emergency room. Two important categories of medications are used for daily management of asthma: rescue and controller therapies. Rescue therapies are used on an as-needed basis to provide symptom relief within minutes. Some people with asthma need only a rescue inhaler, such as people who have symptoms only when they are physically active or people with intermittent asthma symptoms. However, using a rescue therapy too often may be a sign of uncontrolled asthma and should be brought to the attention of a doctor. Short-acting bronchodilators are the standard rescue therapy for patients of all ages. Albuterol is the short-acting bronchodilator used for asthma and comes as an inhaler and nebulizer solution.

Controller therapies are used daily to treat the underlying inflammation and airway narrowing in an effort to obtain overall asthma control. Controller medications are not used to treat acute asthma attacks. Not all patients with asthma need a controller medicine. If your asthma symptoms happen more than 2 times per week, you wake up more than 2 nights per month, you need a rescue inhaler more than 2 days a week, or your asthma interferes with your daily activities, your asthma is likely severe enough to need controller therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are the standard controller therapy for asthma regardless of patient age. These drugs help decrease inflammation in the lungs and should be taken on a daily basis. It is important to rinse your mouth out after each use to prevent fungal infections in your mouth. Long-acting bronchodilators help relax the smooth muscles in the airway in older children and adults but are never used alone as a controller.

They are always added to an inhaled corticosteroid when the corticosteroid is not enough to control asthma symptoms. Many inhalers contain both a corticosteroid and a long-acting bronchodilator. Leukotriene receptor modifiers are oral medications that help reduce chemicals released inside the body when it is exposed to an allergen such as pollen, mold, dust, or animal dander that would otherwise cause inflammation and tightening of the airways. In some patients, these drugs may be added to inhaled corticosteroids to help obtain better asthma control.

### Asthma: addressing consistency in results from basic science, clinical trials, and observational experience [^4dd05e9f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

The basic science understanding of the pathophysiology of a disease often serves as the basis for clinical investigations. This knowledge is used to propose new directions in care and confirm initial concepts. The basic science of asthma demonstrates that the most comprehensive management of inflammation appears to be associated with the use of inhaled corticosteroids and proposes a mechanism for combination therapy with the addition of salmeterol. Randomized clinical trials are performed to confirm these initial observations and demonstrate both the safety and efficacy of therapeutic agents. These investigations are either placebo-controlled or direct comparisons of 2 medications. For the treatment of asthma, these studies have all consistently demonstrated that inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective primary controller therapy. Greater improvement in both lung function and patient-oriented symptom control is observed with the use of inhaled corticosteroids. For patients whose symptoms are not controlled with single-drug therapy, the addition of a long-acting bronchodilator appears to be the most effective add-on treatment with the greatest improvement in lung function and symptom control. Clinical trials have been used for the purposes of cost modeling. Therapies that produce the greatest effect size at the lowest incremental costs produce the greatest improvement in cost-effectiveness. Retrospective claims analysis, more recently, have been used to validate these observations from clinical trials. These studies measure both resource use and costs or charges. These analyses have confirmed that initial treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and combined treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators are the most effective stepwise approaches to the treatment of asthma.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^020c4eb0]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

Medications and Strategies for Symptom Control and Risk Reduction

Asthma medications are categorized as controllers, relievers, and add-on therapies:

- Controllers contain ICS, which reduce airway inflammation, control symptoms, and reduce the risks of exacerbations, even in mild asthma, and of asthma death. Treatment with ICS may reduce exacerbation-related declines in lung function. "Maintenance" therapies are controllers that are prescribed for daily use.
- Relievers (low-dose ICS–formoterol or SABA) contain rapid-onset bronchodilators. They are used "as needed" (i.e. for quick relief of symptoms, including during exacerbations). Using ICS–formoterol as a reliever (often called an "antiinflammatory reliever" or "AIR") also reduces the risk of severe exacerbations, compared with a SABA reliever, both with or without maintenance controller treatment. SABA or ICS–formoterol is also recommended before exercise if needed to prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
- Add-on therapies are mainly for patients with difficult-to-treat or severe asthma (see below).

When choosing medications, consider local guidelines, regulatory approvals, and payer criteria.

4. A practical algorithm for distinguishing between uncontrolled asthma and severe asthma in primary care

As above, asthma control relates both to symptom control and risk factors for future adverse outcomes such as exacerbations, and it can be quickly assessed at any time; whereas asthma severity (based on the level of treatment required to achieve good control) is a label that can only be applied retrospectively after the patient has been on treatment for at least several months. Of patients with poor symptom control and/or exacerbations despite treatment, few actually have severe refractory (i.e. treatment-resistant) asthma; the latter are estimated to comprise 5–10% of the asthma population. The GINA report provides a practical algorithm that, for primary care, prioritises the investigations for the most common remediable causes of uncontrolled asthma. It starts first with checking inhaler technique, as this is incorrect in up to 70–80% of patientsand can be corrected with appropriate skills training. Confirming the diagnosis of asthma is important, as up to 25–35% of people with asthma may have been misdiagnosed; however, if symptoms and lung function improve substantially when inhaler technique or adherence are corrected, this may effectively confirm the diagnosis of asthma, avoiding the need for additional investigations. Patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled despite appropriate management should be referred promptly for specialist investigation and advice.

5. Control-based management

In the past, this concept was sometimes interpreted as prompting an automatic step-up in controller treatment if symptoms were not well controlled. Key changes for primary care in the GINA report emphasise that control-based management should include three components:

'Assess': document the patient's symptom control and risk factors, and if these are uncontrolled, also check inhaler technique and adherence, and consider whether the symptoms are due to a co-morbid condition such as allergic rhinitis, obesity or reflux rather than asthma
'Adjust treatment' (up or down): not only drug therapy but also non-pharmacological strategies (e.g. physical activity) and treatment of modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking cessation, providing a written asthma action plan, weight reduction). Tables with evidence levels are provided in the report
'Review response': every treatment change should be followed by a scheduled asthma review, e.g. after 2–3 months, carried out by someone with appropriate expertise, to assess and optimise control and ensure that ineffective or poorly-tolerated treatments are reviewed.

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-," "medium-," and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

### Improving primary care management of asthma: do we know what really works? [^1588e7df]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma imposes a substantial burden on individuals and societies. Patients with asthma need high-quality primary care management; however, evidence suggests the quality of this care can be highly variable. Here we identify and report factors contributing to high-quality management. Twelve primary care global asthma experts, representing nine countries, identified key factors. A literature review (past 10 years) was performed to validate or refute the expert viewpoint. Key driving factors identified were: policy, clinical guidelines, rewards for performance, practice organisation and workforce. Further analysis established the relevant factor components. Review evidence supported the validity of each driver; however, impact on patient outcomes was uncertain. Single interventions (e.g. healthcare practitioner education) showed little effect; interventions driven by national policy (e.g. incentive schemes and teamworking) were more effective. The panel's opinion, supported by literature review, concluded that multiple primary care interventions offer greater benefit than any single intervention in asthma management.

SECTION V: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF LAMAs FOR ASTHMA

Background

LAMAs comprise a pharmacologic class of long-acting bronchodilators. The role of LAMAs in the management of asthma was not addressed in Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. Since that report's publication in 2007, several trials have investigated LAMAs as controller therapy for individuals with asthma.

The Expert Panel examined the harms and benefits of LAMAs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma and addressed three key questions. The Expert Panel did not examine the role of LAMA treatment in children aged 6 to 11 years because the key questions and systematic reviews did not address this age group. With the exception of one study that examined the LAMA umeclidinium, the RCTs reviewed by the Expert Panel used tiotropium bromide as the LAMA. At the time this report was written, tiotropium bromide (Respimat) was the only formulation of LAMA with US FDA approval for asthma treatment. The majority of LAMA studies used a comparative efficacy design, and not an effectiveness design, but the key questions were about effectiveness. Therefore, the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings is not well understood. Table V provides an overview of the key questions and recommendations on LAMAs.

Definitions of terms used in this section

In this section, "controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. The term "ICS-LABA" indicates therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually (and preferably) in a single inhaler.

Question 5.1

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA compared with other controller therapy as add-on therapy to ICSs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Question 5.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA as add-on therapy to ICS controller therapy compared with placebo or increased ICS dose in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Recommendation 14: In individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against adding LAMA to ICS compared to adding LABA to ICS.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

Recommendation 15: If LABA is not used, in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends adding LAMA to ICS controller therapy compared to continuing the same dose of ICS alone.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^0953331a]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to include regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment, as-needed reliever medication (low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-short-acting β-agonist, or short-acting β-agonist), and a short course of oral corticosteroids in the discharge medications. Do not prescribe short-acting β-agonist-only treatment. Review inhaler technique and adherence before discharge. Advise patients to use their reliever inhaler only as needed rather than routinely. Schedule a follow-up appointment for 2–7 days later, depending on the clinical and social context.

### Overview of changes to asthma guidelines: diagnosis and screening [^3038af3d]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel Report 3 of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program represents a major advance in the approach to asthma care by emphasizing the monitoring of clinically relevant aspects of care and the importance of planned primary care, and by providing patients practical tools for self-management. Treatment of asthma should be guided by a new system of classification that assesses severity at initial evaluation and control at all subsequent visits. Asthma severity is determined by current impairment (as evidenced by impact on day-to-day activities) and risk of future exacerbations (as evidenced by frequency of oral systemic corticosteroid use), and allows categorization of disease as intermittent, persistent-mild, persistent-moderate, and persistent-severe. Initial treatment is guided by the disease-severity category. The degree of control is also determined by the analysis of current impairment and future risk. Validated questionnaires can be used for following the impairment domain of control with patients whose asthma is categorized as "well controlled", "not well controlled", and "very poorly controlled". Decisions about medication adjustment and planned follow-up are based on the category of disease control. Whereas a stepwise approach for asthma management continues to be recommended, the number of possible steps has increased.

Ultimately, broad change in clinical practice depends on the uptake, adoption, and implementation of clinical practice recommendations by primary care providers with input from people who have asthma and their families, as well as support from health care systems. This update can serve as a basis to disseminate and facilitate adoption of the asthma recommendations at all levels and to ensure optimal care and equitable outcomes for all individuals with asthma. We ask for the assistance of every stakeholder in reaching our goal: improving asthma care and the quality of life of every person with asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^18673519]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Severe asthma with good response to Type 2 targeted therapy — re-evaluate the need for each asthma medication every 3–6 months, and emphasize to patients and their primary care physician that they should not completely stop ICS-containing therapy; base the order of reduction or cessation of add-on treatments on potential adverse effects, the observed benefit when the medication was started, patient risk factors, cost, and patient satisfaction. Minimizing the use of OCS is a very high priority, and after reducing/ceasing any medication, confirm asthma stability before making any further treatment changes. If asthma remains well controlled, consider ceasing other therapies, based on the above considerations.

### Is there a rationale and role for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma? [^b41419cb]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite current guidelines and the range of available treatments, over a half of patients with asthma continue to suffer from poor symptomatic control and remain at risk of future worsening. Although a number of non-pharmacological measures are crucial for good clinical management of asthma, new therapeutic controller medications will have a role in the future management of the disease. Several long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators are under investigation or are available for the treatment of respiratory diseases, including tiotropium bromide, aclidinium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide, glycopyrrolate and umeclidinium bromide, although none is yet licensed for the treatment of asthma. A recent Phase III investigation demonstrated that the once-daily long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator tiotropium bromide improves lung function and reduces the risk of exacerbation in patients with symptomatic asthma, despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs). This has prompted the question of what the rationale is for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma. Bronchial smooth muscle contraction is the primary cause of reversible airway narrowing in asthma, and the baseline level of contraction is predominantly set by the level of 'cholinergic tone'. Patients with asthma have increased bronchial smooth muscle tone and mucus hypersecretion, possibly as a result of elevated cholinergic activity, which anticholinergic compounds are known to reduce. Further, anticholinergic compounds may also have anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, evidence suggests that long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators might offer benefits for the maintenance of asthma control, such as in patients failing to gain control on ICS and a LABA, or those with frequent exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^6e161f04]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 3–4. Population-level versus patient-level decisions about asthma treatment — patient-level controller choice indicates that treatment choices for individual patients also take into account any patient characteristics or phenotype, or any environmental exposures, that may predict their risk of exacerbations or other adverse outcomes, together with assessment of multimorbidity, the patient's goals and preferences, and practical issues such as cost, ability to use the medication and adherence. Choosing between controller options for individual patients uses shared decision-making with the patient or parent/caregiver to discuss preferred treatment (as above) based on evidence for symptom control and risk reduction; patient characteristics or phenotype, including features that predict differences in future risk or treatment response (e.g., smoker; history of exacerbations, blood eosinophilia or high FeNO; environmental exposures); whether there are modifiable risk factors or multimorbidity that may affect treatment outcomes; patient views about goals, beliefs and concerns; and practical issues including which inhaler(s) are available to the patient, inhaler technique – can the patient use the inhaler correctly after training, adherence – how often is the patient likely to take the medication, cost to patient – can the patient afford the medication, and which of the available inhalers has the lowest environmental impact.

### SMART-is it practical in the United States? [^cdb0f357]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group advocate for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol combinations as single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) for patients with persistent asthma. We review the rationale, the evidence supporting SMART use in asthma, and barriers limiting its wide adoption in the United States.

Recent Findings

A growing body of evidence supports the use of SMART over the conventional use of controller medicaments with an as-needed short-acting β2 agonist for rescue therapy for the purpose of reducing the risk of asthma exacerbation and maintaining asthma control in adolescents and adults with persistent disease. Lack of US Food and Drug Administration approval, inconsistent insurance coverage, and limited options of ICS-formoterol combination available for use as SMART represent obstacles to wider integration of SMART in clinical practice.

Summary

SMART represents a paradigm shift in asthma management. By identifying and addressing the current and anticipated barriers to implementing SMART, its adoption by providers is likely to increase in the United States.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^0a2907d7]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapy — The 2019 VA/DoD Asthma CPG evidence review compared a combination inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist (ICS/LABA) as controller and quick relief therapy to maintenance ICS and to fixed dose maintenance ICS/LABA, noting that the LABA used in the combined ICS/LABA controller/reliever was formoterol. There are currently several LABAs approved for patients with asthma, with some having a more rapid onset of action (e.g., formoterol) while others have a slower onset (e.g., salmeterol). Despite evidence showing reduced exacerbations using formoterol combined with ICS as both controller and reliever, this strategy was not recommended by the 2019 VA/DO D Asthma CPG. The Food and Drug Administration had approved ICS/LABAs as maintenance controller medications for asthma but not as fast acting relievers, and although ICS/formoterol combinations still do not have FDA approval as quick relief medications, later asthma guidelines have supported their use as controller/relievers (GINA).

General Principles of Asthma Management

The goals of asthma management are to achieve good symptom control, relieve symptoms when they occur, and minimize the risk of exacerbations and asthma-related death, persistent airflow limitation, and side effects of treatment. The patient's own treatment goals should be identified because they may be different. Effective asthma management requires a partnership between the patient (or parent/caregiver) and healthcare providers, with shared decision-making and good communication.

Asthma management is not "one-size-fits-all" but instead should be personalized and adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment adjustment, and review (Figure 2).

Figure 2.
Personalized asthma management cycle of care. Reproduced by permission from Reference(Box 3–2).

Assessment

Assess not only symptom control and lung function but also the individual's modifiable risk factors and comorbidities (also called "treatable traits") and patient/parent goals and preferences. Check adherence and inhaler technique frequently. Poor symptom control is associated with a much higher risk of exacerbations, but patients with apparently mild asthma or with good symptom control can still have severe or life-threatening exacerbations.

Treatment Adjustment

Treatment adjustment includes not only changes in the asthma medication dose or type but also multidisciplinary management of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities (Section 3D in Reference) and nonpharmacological strategies such as smoking cessation and avoidance of indoor/outdoor air pollution (Box 3–9 in Reference).

For all patients, provide regular training in inhaler techniques and asthma self-management, including self-monitoring of symptoms and/or PEF, and a written asthma action plan (Section 3C in Reference). Encourage adherence with controller medication, even when symptoms are infrequent. Consider stepping down treatment when good control has been maintained for 2–3 months (Box 3–7 in Reference).

### Validation of a guideline-based composite outcome assessment tool for asthma control [^7014e46a]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of asthma management, as endorsed by the publication of recent guidelines, is to achieve and maintain effective control of the disease. The effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in asthma clinical trials is most commonly evaluated using individual endpoints, such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1). However, the assessment of these individual endpoints may lead to an over-estimation of the level of asthma control achieved and may not reflect the wider overall impact of the disease on the patient. In addition, therapeutic benefit is frequently expressed in terms of the degree of change in individual endpoints, rather than the achievement of a concrete predefined clinical goal, such as the absence of key symptoms. While the former is a primary aim of research-led studies largely designed to evaluate the efficacy of new treatments, the latter is the primary clinical objective in the day-to-day management of asthma.

Composite outcome measures that incorporate a range of endpoints in a single definition allow a range of important disease characteristics to be taken into account. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease this type of composite measure has been shown to have superior predictive properties, compared to the individual endpoints comprising the composite.

Assessment of asthma control

Our aim was to validate two guideline-based measures of asthma control. These tools had 'yes' or 'no' decision-making properties because their primary function was as an index of clinical status for use in asthma management. The control criteria were based on definitions of asthma control in recently published guidelines, including Global Initiative for Asthma. Totally controlled (TC) and well controlled (WC) asthma include seven endpoints, as detailed in Table 1. The evaluation of daytime symptoms and frequency of rescue β 2 -agonist medication are well-accepted measures for detecting deterioration of asthma, and impending exacerbations. The presence of night-time awakening or an emergency visit are important but different indicators of change in asthma status. Adverse events are included as a 'cost' of asthma control in the reference guidelines and were included in order to remain consistent with these (see Table 1). Morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) is considered to serve as an objective measure of asthma control supplementary to that of symptoms. Any one of these criteria alone is considered insufficient in the definition of asthma control because although not independent of one another, each endpoint contributes unique information to the overall assessment.

VA/DoD Asthma CPG — Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus long-acting beta agonist (LABA) controller/reliever therapy includes the directive: We recommend patients currently on ICS and LABA for asthma control utilize a combined ICS and a LABA for symptom relief as needed. Evidence reviewed from the 2019 VA/DoD Asthma CPG consistently showed ICS/LABA controller/reliever therapy reduced asthma exacerbations in patients 12 years and older compared to other strategies, and a 2022 review found a significant reduction in severe exacerbation rate versus remaining at the same dose of ICS/LABA maintenance plus short-acting beta agonist (SABA) reliever, with no statistically significant difference versus increased dose of ICS/LABA maintenance with addition of SABA as reliever; the SR reported mixed evidence regarding the benefit of SMART over other ICS/LABA regimens, no difference in the SAEs or increased level of harm, and study timeframe up to 12 months. The Work Group categorized this as Reviewed, New-added, noted that the confidence in the quality of evidence was low, judged that benefits outweighed potential harms as there were no SAEs noted, and decided on a Weak for recommendation.

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management recommendations… [^741f8255]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma.
- Controller therapy should be shifted to once-daily administration if symptoms are not controlled with as-needed therapy, minimizing the ICS dose when possible. From the AFP Editors Asthma is a serious global health problem. The latest update to the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines includes significant changes to treatment recommendations, especially a recommendation against using a short-acting beta 2 agonists such as albuterol as sole therapy. STEP 1 Step 1 options are for those with symptoms less than twice per month and no risk factors for exacerbations.

An inhaled low-dose ICS/formoterol combination used as needed is the preferred treatment in adults and adolescents. The guideline also strongly discourages the use of long-acting bronchodilators without an ICS because of increased risk of exacerbation. If the ICS/formoterol combination is not available or affordable, a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA is recommended. STEP 2 Preferred step 2 controller options in adults and adolescents include a daily low-dose ICS plus a SABA as needed or low-dose ICS/formoterol as needed. Leukotriene receptor antagonists are less effective but can be considered for patients who are unable or unwilling to use an ICS or who have concomitant allergic rhinitis. The preferred step 2 controller for children six to 11 years of age is a daily low-dose ICS plus a SABA as needed. Less effective options include a daily leukotriene receptor antagonist or using a low-dose ICS as needed with a SABA.

STEP 3 Options in adults and adolescents include low-dose ICS/long-acting beta 2-agonist as daily treatment with a SABA as needed, or low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily treatment and as needed. In children six to 11 years of age, either a medium-dose ICS or a low-dose ICS/LABA combination should be used as a controller, with a SABA as needed.

### Severe asthma in primary care: identification and management [^6dd2ac93]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Most patients with asthma are managed by primary care providers. Severe asthma is associated with substantial morbidity and health care resource use, and long-term sequelae of severe asthma include airway remodeling and a greater risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These consequences highlight the importance of early identification and improved management of patients with severe asthma. Although treatment guidelines can be confusing and it can be difficult to keep abreast of updates, routine assessments of lung function, frequency and severity of exacerbations, symptom control, and medication adherence in the primary care setting provide the necessary information for identifying severe asthma and determining appropriate management strategies. An increased understanding of asthma pathophysiology and its relationship to disease activity has identified therapeutic targets and associated biomarkers. Biologic therapies directed at these targets offer individualized targeted treatment of severe asthma. We review evidence-based guidelines for identification and management of severe asthma, clarify the relationship of asthma control and asthma severity, and provide an overview of new biologic therapies offering additional treatment options for patients with severe asthma.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and the US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to improve asthma awareness, prevention and management worldwide. GINA develops and publishes evidence-based, annually updated resources for clinicians. GINA guidance is adopted by national asthma guidelines in many countries, adapted to fit local healthcare systems, practices, and resource availability. GINA is independent of industry, funded by the sale and licensing of its materials. This review summarizes key practical guidance for primary care from the 2022 GINA strategy report. It provides guidance on confirming the diagnosis of asthma using spirometry or peak expiratory flow. GINA recommends that all adults, adolescents and most children with asthma should receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing therapy to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations, either taken regularly, or (for adults and adolescents with "mild" asthma) as combination ICS–formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief. For patients with moderate–severe asthma, the preferred regimen is maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with ICS–formoterol. Asthma treatment is not "one size fits all"; GINA recommends individualized assessment, adjustment, and review of treatment. As many patients with difficult-to-treat or severe asthma are not referred early for specialist review, we provide updated guidance for primary care on diagnosis, further investigation, optimization and treatment of severe asthma across secondary and tertiary care. While the GINA strategy has global relevance, we recognize that there are special considerations for its adoption in low- and middle-income countries, particularly the current poor access to inhaled medications.

Step 4 — Continue controller treatment and refer for expert assessment — when the Step 3 approach of doubling the initial dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) fails to achieve and maintain good asthma control, the guideline states to "carefully reassess inhaler technique and medication adherence," address environmental factors, and reconsider the diagnosis; as "the best treatment for this population has not been established," "options to consider, with specialist advice, are" to further increase the dose of ICS "for a few weeks," add leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) with counseling on neuropsychiatric adverse effects, add long-acting beta agonist (LABA) in combination with ICS based on data "in children ≥ 4 years of age," add "a low dose of oral corticosteroid (for a few weeks only)," or add "intermittent high-dose ICS at onset of respiratory illnesses" when exacerbations are the main problem, with monitoring for side-effects and re-evaluating the need for additional controller treatment at each visit.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma — pharmacologic adjustments: For patients with asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids alone, we suggest adding long-acting beta agonists as a step-up treatment over increasing inhaled corticosteroids alone or adding long-acting muscarinic antagonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists. In patients with controlled asthma on a stable medication regimen, we suggest either stepping down (not discontinuing) inhaled corticosteroids dose or discontinuing long-acting beta agonists. We suggest short-acting beta agonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists for prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting, SABAs, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that delivery of short-acting β-agonists via a pressurized-metered dose inhaler and spacer or a dry-powdered inhaler leads to a similar improvement in lung function as delivery via nebulizer,
although the most cost-effective route of delivery is pressurized-metered dose inhaler and spacer.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^7ec64e6c]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma management — long-term goals: The goal of asthma management is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient, encompassing long-term asthma symptom control that may include few/no asthma symptoms, no sleep disturbance due to asthma, and unimpaired physical activity, and long-term asthma risk minimization that may include no exacerbations, improved or stable personal best lung function, no requirement for maintenance systemic corticosteroids, and no medication side-effects. The patient's goals for their asthma may be different from these medical goals; ask the patient what they want from their asthma treatment, and when discussing the best possible asthma outcomes with a patient, consider their goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Assessing symptom control is NOT enough: the patient's risk factors, including history of exacerbations, should always also be assessed, and symptom control and risk may be discordant because patients with few or no symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, including from external triggers such as viral infections, allergen exposure (if sensitized) or pollution.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^ca0bc3bd]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

When asthma is poorly controlled despite medium or high dose ICS-LABA, the patient should be reassessed. This involves first ensuring that the diagnosis of asthma has been confirmed and relevant comorbidities and risk factors managed, that ICS have been prescribed, and that asthma treatment has been optimized; that is, that the patient is collecting and using the medication and that they are satisfied withand are able to use their inhaler correctly.

Figure 7 shows other factors and interventions that can also be considered in primary care. If asthma remains uncontrolled, there are several reasons why these people should be referred (if possible) for expert assessment, advice and/or provision of medication, and for guidance on ongoing primary care management. In addition to confirming the diagnosis, specialist asthma services have knowledge of, and access to, newer and specific treatment including the latest range of biologic treatments (monoclonal antibodies for severe asthma). They may also have access to specialist nursing, pharmacists, counseling and psychology expertise and the facilities to provide long-term follow-up and access to consistent support from liaison nurses.

An exacerbation requiring medical care indicates that the patient is at increased risk of future exacerbations.

### Comparing LAMA with LABA and LTRA as add-on therapies in primary care asthma management [^eb2c8b61]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

When stepping up asthma therapy and considering add-on therapy, it is important to review the options available, to involve patients in decisions about their treatment and to keep a dialogue between patients and HCPs. An up-to-date individualised asthma action plan can help to keep a record of any attempted treatment approaches and help the patient to self-manage. The action plans should be discussed and agreed with patients and reviewed at regular intervals to make sure that they remain up to date and are fit for purpose.

Poor asthma control leads to unfavourable outcomes, more frequent exacerbations, irreversible loss of lung function and even asthma-related deaths. Add-on therapy with LABA, LAMA or LTRA should be considered when asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled with at least medium–high ICS. Primary care practitioners can and should regularly assess symptom control following assessment of adherence, triggers, device technique and comorbidities. Therapy should be stepped up as recommended in GINA guidelines in order to attain optimal control, considering individual symptoms, lung function, comorbidities, inhaler technique, adherence and patient preference as important parameters for a personalised choice.

In conclusion, in adults, LAMAs and LABAs appear to provide a greater improvement in lung function than LTRAs as add-on to ICS, although there are no individual studies that directly compare LAMAs with LTRAs. LAMAs appear to be an effective alternative to LABAs for attaining asthma control, optimising lung function and preventing exacerbations, with a possible higher lung function benefit of LAMAs compared with LABAs. Data in patients aged < 18 years are currently limited due to inherent difficulties in the study of this population. Current available evidence from clinical trials suggests that LABAs, LTRAs and LAMAs have comparable safety profiles, with LABAs and LAMAs providing greater improvements in lung function than LTRAs, yet it should be noted the FDA have advised a boxed warning for the LTRA montelukast due to risk of mental health side effects. Asthma should be treated in accordance with current guidelines, with regular checks made to ensure symptoms are controlled, as well as ensuring optimal strategies are in place to prevent exacerbations and achieve best lung function. If control is not achieved, treatment should be stepped up, ensuring that factors that may influence control (such as adherence, administration technique, allergic triggers and comorbidities) are addressed for each individual patient.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

In individuals with asthma that is not controlled by ICS therapy alone, the Expert Panel recommends adding a LABA rather than a LAMA to an ICS. However, if the individual is not using or cannot use LABA therapy, adding a LAMA to an ICS is an acceptable alternative. Adding a LAMA to ICS controller therapy is more effective than using ICS controller therapy alone in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma. However, adding a LAMA to ICS controller therapy is not more efficacious than adding a LABA to ICS controller therapy, and adding a LAMA may increase the risk of harm, based on a single real-world study in Blacks. Therefore, the panel recommends preferentially adding LABA over LAMA to ICS. A LABA should not be used when the individual cannot tolerate it, the medication is contraindicated, the device that delivers the LABA is unsuitable for the individual, or the LABA is unavailable for insurance or supply reasons.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 13 can be found in EtD Table XIX in Appendix B.

Two blinded RCTs (N = 5481) compared SMART to higher-dose ICS-LABA, in individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older. SMART reduced the RR by 25% for exacerbations (high certainty of evidence). SMART also resulted in statistically significant reductions in corticosteroid use but had no significant effect on asthma quality of life or asthma control. As a result, the recommendation was conditional.

Asthma management — Implementation guidance (therapy choice when ICS alone is insufficient): In individuals with asthma that is not controlled by inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy alone, the Expert Panel recommends adding a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) rather than a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) to an ICS; if the individual is not using or cannot use LABA therapy, adding a LAMA to ICS is an acceptable alternative, and adding a LAMA to ICS controller therapy is more effective than using ICS controller therapy alone in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma. The panel notes that adding a LAMA to ICS controller therapy is not more efficacious than adding a LABA to ICS controller therapy and may increase the risk of harm, based on a single real-world study in Blacks, and therefore recommends preferentially adding LABA over LAMA to ICS; a LABA should not be used when it is not tolerated, is contraindicated, the device is unsuitable, or LABA is unavailable for insurance or supply reasons.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^c7159e56]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta agonist (LABA) prescribing and device considerations emphasize that these medications may be administered as two separate medications, however, are frequently administered together into one inhaler and are recommended for asthma control therapy, and that there are currently several LABAs, with some having a more rapid onset of action (e.g., formoterol) and others a slower onset (e.g., salmeterol); the LABA used in the combined ICS/LABA controller/reliever studies, and thus recommended by the Work Group, was formoterol which has a rapid onset of action. The patient focus group identified the value of access to combination medication for both control and reliever therapy, and the Work Group recognized the convenience of combination ICS/LABA devices, noting that combination products simplify treatment plans and support improved adherence by avoiding the need for multiple devices or delivery systems. When prescribing ICS/LABA as reliever medication, care should be taken that patients are prescribed rapid-onset/long-acting beta agonists (e.g., formoterol) versus a LABA with longer onset of action (e.g., salmeterol), and patients will need education regarding the purpose, frequency of use/overuse of medication as well as inhaler administration technique; other implications include that ICS/LABA is not FDA approved for children under 6 years old.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^5217db2e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management — Recommendation 13 for individuals aged 12 years and older conditionally recommends inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared with higher-dose ICS–long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) as daily controller therapy and short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) for quick relief, with high certainty of evidence; for Step 4, the preferred therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol used both daily and as needed, and the maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 12 puffs (54 μg) for those aged 12 years and older. This recommendation applies to all individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older. Individuals with asthma should use ICS-formoterol as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once or twice daily, with an additional 1 to 2 puffs as needed for symptoms up to a maximum of 12 puffs (54 μg formoterol) per day, and clinicians should advise individuals to contact their clinician if they need to use more than these amounts. The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, clinicians managing asthma should regularly assess individuals using this therapy, and this therapy is appropriate for Step 4. Individuals with asthma should not use ICS-formoterol as reliever therapy if they are taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy, and SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled with alternate treatments such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy. If maintenance ICS-LABA plus SABA provides adequate control, it does not need to be changed; however, if uncontrolled, individuals should receive the preferred SMART if possible before stepping up to a higher step of therapy.

### Medical therapy for asthma: updates from the NAEPP guidelines [^0fb7758a]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Proper care of patients with asthma involves the triad of systematic chronic care plans, self-management support, and appropriate medical therapy. Controller medications (inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists) are the foundation of care for persistent asthma and should be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred controller medication; studies have demonstrated that when inhaled corticosteroids are used consistently, they improve asthma control more effectively than any other single long-term control medication. Combining long-acting beta2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids is effective and safe when inhaled corticosteroids alone are insufficient, and such combinations are an alternative to increasing the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids. For patients with mild persistent asthma, leukotriene receptor antagonists are an alternative, second-line treatment option. They are easy to use, have high rates of compliance, and can provide good symptom control in many patients. Leukotriene receptor antagonists can also be used as an adjunctive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, but for persons 12 years and older the addition of long-acting beta2 agonists is preferred. Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists are the most effective therapy for rapid reversal of airflow obstruction and prompt relief of asthmatic symptoms. Increasing the use of short-acting beta2 agonists or using them more than two days per week or more than two nights per month generally indicates inadequate control of asthma and the need to initiate or intensify anti-inflammatory therapy. Oral systemic corticosteroids should be used to treat moderate to severe asthma exacerbations.

### Targeting asthma remission as the next therapeutic step toward improving disease control [^859a1880]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

The long-term goal of asthma management is to achieve disease control, comprising the assessment of 2 main domains: (1) symptom control and (2) future risk of adverse outcomes. Decades of progress in asthma management have correlated with increasingly ambitious disease control targets. Moreover, the introduction of precision medicines, such as biologics, has further expanded the limits of what can be achieved in terms of disease control. It is now believed that clinical remission, a term rarely associated with asthma, may be an achievable treatment goal. An expert framework published in 2020 took the first step toward developing a commonly accepted definition of clinical remission in asthma. However, there remains a widespread discussion about the clinical parameters and thresholds that should be included in a standardized definition of clinical remission. This review aims to discuss on-treatment clinical remission as an aspirational outcome in asthma management, drawing on experiences from other chronic diseases where remission has long been a goal. We also highlight the integral role of shared decision-making between patients and health care professionals and the need for a common understanding of the individual patient journey to remission as foundational elements in reducing disease burden and improving outcomes for patients with asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^6e371ac6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma pharmacotherapy for children of 5 years of age or younger — good control of asthma can be achieved in the overwhelming majority of young children with a pharmacological intervention strategy, and a stepwise treatment approach is recommended based on symptom patterns, risk of exacerbations and side-effects, and response to initial treatment; generally, treatment includes the daily, long-term use of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to keep asthma well controlled and reliever medications for as-needed symptom relief, and the choice of inhaler device is also an important consideration. When recommending treatment for a young child, both general and individual questions apply, including identifying the 'preferred' medication option at each treatment step to control asthma symptoms and minimize future risk, with decisions based on data for efficacy, effectiveness and safety from clinical trials and on observational data, considering that studies suggest factors such as allergic sensitization and/or peripheral blood count may help to better identify which children are more likely to have a short-term response to ICS, and accounting for response to previous treatment, patient characteristics that contribute to symptoms or risk of flare-ups, preferences of the parent/caregiver, and practical issues.

FOREWORD

It has been 13 years since the last revision of the asthma recommendations, and substantial progress has been made since that time in understanding the origins of asthma as well as its pathophysiology and treatment. As members of the pulmonary and allergy provider community and the primary care community that provide more than half of all asthma care in the United States, we now recognize that asthma is not one disease, but it is a syndrome composed of multiple phenotypes. Asthma is much more complex than indicated in the Expert Panel Report: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-1), released in 1991, which characterized asthma as an inflammatory disease that is responsive to corticosteroids.

This document updates selected topics that were identified as high priority by an NHLBI Advisory Council Asthma Expert Working Group based on input from previous guideline developers, NAEPP participant organizations, and the public. The list of these priority topics was published in 2015.

After 25 years of GINA, we need an overarching strategy. The resounding changes in GINA 2019 should be accompanied by another major change in general strategy of asthma management. The concept of control asthma and step strategy was established in 1997 by GINA; but still there is a great gap between GINA objectives and outcomes. O'Byrne and colleagues proposed a continuum of care approach; where patient-adjusted therapy would comprise both a controller and reliever (usually ICS/fast-acting LABA) in a single inhaler. We use a similar approach in our asthma centre.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^53a8196c]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Sidebar E: Asthma education and self-management support — Patients and caregivers should be informed of the diagnosis of asthma, their current understanding and treatment adherence should be assessed, they should be provided evidence-based education and materials/resources, and they should be given the opportunity to ask questions so they can fully understand their asthma; consistent follow-up should ensure confidence to self-manage and take a more active role with their healthcare team. Asthma education should include basic pathophysiology of asthma, typical asthma symptoms, how to identify well-controlled asthma, asthma patterns (exercise, nocturnal symptoms, and seasonal allergens) and risk factors, asthma exacerbations and precipitating triggers, goals of treatment and use of Asthma Action Plan, medication use (e.g., what it does, how to use it, potential side effects, and rationale for why each medication was selected) including assessment of device technique, how to recognize loss of asthma control and steps to take to regain control of symptoms, and when and how to seek emergency care for asthma exacerbations. The guideline further states to consider a personalized written asthma action plan and consider a team approach to asthma management, and to address lifestyle changes and psychosocial considerations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^550cfee5]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) introduction — Asthma is a serious global health problem affecting approximately 300 million people around the world and causing around 1,000 deaths per day. For individuals with asthma of all ages, the goal of asthma management is to achieve the patient's best possible long-term outcomes, encompassing long-term asthma symptom control (Few/no asthma symptoms, No sleep disturbance due to asthma, Unimpaired physical activity) and long-term asthma risk minimization (No exacerbations, Improved or stable personal best lung function, No requirement for maintenance OCS, No medication side-effects). The patient's goals may be different from these medical goals, and patients with few or no asthma symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, including from external triggers such as viral infections, allergen exposure (if sensitized) or pollution. Access gaps are highlighted, as many areas do not have access to inhaled corticosteroid-containing medications, which are the cornerstone of care for asthma patients of all severity, and access to and pricing of high-quality asthma medications continues to be an issue of urgent need.

Asthma pharmacotherapy — minimizing adverse effects of medication — Reduce the potential for local and/or systemic side-effects of inhaled medications by ensuring correct inhaler technique; reminding patients to rinse and spit out after using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and, after good asthma control has been maintained for 3 months; finding each patient's minimum effective dose of ICS-containing therapy (the lowest dose that will, in conjunction with an action plan, maintain good symptom control and minimize exacerbations); and checking for drug interactions particularly with cytochrome P450 inhibitors.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^c4d6851a]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Identify and Assess Asthma Exacerbations

Best Practice Advice 1: Consider incorporating available validated tools into primary care settings to evaluate asthma status including symptom burden, exacerbation history, and risk

Assessing asthma control is fundamental for asthma management to optimize medication therapy, prevent exacerbations, improve quality of life and achieve patient and clinical treatment goals. Clinicians' and patients' assessment of asthma control tends to overestimate control and often differ from each other. Validated tools can help improve the accuracy of assessment of asthma control. However, most validated tools assess only symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, chest tightness or pain) with little or no attention to past exacerbations and therefore the risk of exacerbations (also called "asthma attacks") which is also a key factor in a patient's overall asthma control.

An ideal tool for assessing asthma control should include questions that reveal both symptoms and exacerbation risk, such as the Asthma Impairment and Risk Questionnaire (AIRQ). Prior exacerbations are the best predictor of future exacerbations, which is one reason the AIRQ contains questions focusing on exacerbation history.

Asthma quick-relief medications — individuals ages 0–4 years: Use inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) as needed for symptoms, with intensity based on symptom severity allowing up to 3 treatments at 20-minute intervals as needed. Caution: Increasing use of SABA or use > 2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment. Consider short course of oral systemic corticosteroid if exacerbation is severe or individual has history of previous severe exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^dfe83fda]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Stepping down treatment when asthma is well controlled — once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2–3 months and lung function has reached a plateau, treatment can often be successfully reduced without loss of asthma control; aims are to find the patient's minimum effective treatment to maintain good control of symptoms and exacerbations and to minimize costs and potential for side-effects, and to encourage continued ICS-containing treatment, noting that patients on maintenance controller treatment often experiment with intermittent treatment and that for patients prescribed GINA Track 1 MART the ICS-formoterol reliever provides a safety net during planned step-down or if adherence with maintenance doses is poor.

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^9dc37e6c]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

Best Practice Advice 3: Recognize and support education and management plans addressing exacerbation risk for people with all severities of asthma

Asthma exacerbations can occur in all severities of asthma despite guideline-directed treatment. A history of ED visits or hospitalization for an exacerbation increase the risk of future exacerbations, irrespective of severity, patient demographics, or clinical characteristics. Patients with intermittent, mild, and moderate asthma are all at risk for exacerbations, which is often related to unrecognized lack of asthma control.

Recently in the US, approximately 60% of adults and 44% of children were reported to have uncontrolled asthma, with more than 80% of whom had mild or moderate asthma. In an international cohort of 1115 patients classified as GINA Step 1 or Step 2, 25% had uncontrolled asthma and about 33% reported rescue inhaler use in the previous 4 weeks. Based on United Kingdom data from the National Review of Asthma Deaths, up to 45% of patients across asthma severities dies without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided, indicating a need for improved education and management plans.

Appropriate and optimal therapy to minimize symptoms, exacerbations risk, and routine exacerbation assessment and history is important for all patients with asthma, regardless of severity.

### Combination therapy: appropriate for everyone? [^48bfbe00]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

The severity of asthma often varies throughout the course of the disease. At times the symptoms and underlying inflammation that are characteristic of asthma can worsen. Thus during an episode of viral-induced asthma or during a seasonal increase in asthma severity, a patient may be directed to increase his or her dosage of asthma controllers (i.e., inhaled corticosteroid) or add a long-acting bronchodilator (or other controller medications such as antileukotrienes) to manage symptoms, as recommended in guidelines published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Similarly, when symptoms are stable, decreasing dosages or discontinuing certain medications may be appropriate. The recent introduction of a combination product, of a long-acting bronchodilator formulated in the same dry powder device with an inhaled corticosteroid raises new challenges for the step care approach to asthma management recommended by the NIH in 1997. Although unquestionably more convenient for the patient, a combination formulation has the potential to decrease the flexibility required to successfully manage asthma over long periods. In addition, controversy exists regarding long-acting beta-agonists alone because their regular use may mask inflammation in the lung and decrease responsiveness to the bronchodilating effects of rescue medications (i.e., short-acting beta-agonists). The purpose of this article is to help physicians make informed therapeutic decisions for their patients with asthma. It focuses on the advantages and potential disadvantages of using combination products, which contain both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist in the context of the NIH step care approach. Recent publications outlining the use of other add-on controller medications are also discussed.

### Stepping down asthma treatment: how and when [^ad25eec1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Guidelines suggest that asthma medication should be reduced once asthma control is sustained. Moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can typically be reduced, but questions remain about the lowest effective ICS dose and the role of non-ICS controllers in treatment reduction. Long-acting beta agonist (LABA) safety concerns have created controversy about how to step down patients on ICS/LABA therapy. This review will focus on the current status of these issues.

Recent Findings

Intermittent ICS treatment, often in fixed combination with short-acting beta agonist, is an emerging strategy for control of mild asthma. Addition of leukotriene modifiers, LABAs, and omalizumab to ICS can allow for reduced ICS dosing. Doses of ICS that control symptoms may be inadequate to control exacerbations. Reducing ICS dose before discontinuing LABAs may be the more effective approach for patients on combination therapy.

Summary

Use of non-ICS controllers allows for ICS dose reduction with superior outcomes. Tapering of ICS prior to LABA discontinuation may be the favored approach for patients on ICS/LABA therapy, but an understanding of long-term outcomes and further safety data are required. The lowest ICS dose that adequately controls both asthma impairment and risk remains to be determined.

### Controller medication use and exacerbations for children with asthma in high-deductible plans… [^3f1372f3]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Exposure Employer-mandated HDHP transition. Main Outcomes and Measures Thirty-day fill rates and adherence were measured for asthma controller medications. Asthma exacerbations were measured by rates of oral corticosteroid bursts and asthma-related emergency department visits among controller medication users. Asthma is a major cause of preventable disease burden for children and adults, with substantial socioeconomic disparities. 1–4 Despite guidelines recommending use of controller medications such as inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors, or combination ICS and long-acting β2-agonists and demonstrated efficacy, 5–13 adherence is suboptimal, placing patients at risk for asthma exacerbations.

11–14 High out-of-pocket costs have been associated with decreased controller medication use and adverse asthma outcomes over 12-month periods for children and adults. 15–19. We used a difference-in-differences design to assess changes in outcomes from baseline to follow-up for HDHP enrollees relative to controls. The main study outcomes were controller medication fills, adherence, and asthma exacerbations. We identified all filled prescriptions for ICS, LTIs, and ICS-LABAs during the baseline and follow-up periods. We measured asthma exacerbations among enrollees who used any controller medication in the baseline period. Asthma exacerbations were measured as rates of oral corticosteroid bursts and asthma-related ED visits. We defined OCS bursts as a dispensing of a 3- to 21-day supply after a "clean period" of at least 30 days without an OCS dispensing.

46 We defined asthma-related ED visits as all ED visits with a principal diagnosis of asthma, or with any diagnosis of asthma in combination with a diagnosis of a related condition. 45, 46. In difference-in-differences analyses among children, the HDHP group had absolute reductions in 30-day fills for ICS-LABA compared with controls. Changes in fill rates for other controllers among children were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. There were no significant changes in the PDC for any controller class or in rates of OCS bursts or asthma-related ED visits for HDHP children relative to controls.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1dc016d6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — initial pharmacotherapy selection: Commence treatment as described in Chapter 4; pharmacotherapy is based on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death and to improve symptom control, with add-on treatment such as long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) as required; as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol may be used as the reliever; inhaled therapy should be optimized to minimize the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS).
