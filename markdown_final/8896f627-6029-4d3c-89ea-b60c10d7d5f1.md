## Question

Aortic stenosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about aortic stenosis management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining disease severity and confirming the diagnosis. Then, I should verify symptom status and how to elicit subtle symptoms. Next, I will review indications for intervention in symptomatic patients, followed by the more controversial asymptomatic scenarios. After that, I need to check the choice between surgical and transcatheter approaches, including special populations and coronary disease. Finally, I will consider surveillance, imaging nuances, and the role of shared decision-making and heart teams, and close with a concise synthesis of the decision framework.

> Let me first confirm the hemodynamic definition of severe aortic stenosis, because everything downstream depends on this. Severe AS is generally defined by a peak aortic jet velocity of at least 4.0 m/s, a mean transvalvular gradient of at least 40 mmHg, and an aortic valve area of 1.0 cm² or less, with indexed AVA of 0.6 cm²/m² or less when body size is considered, and I should double-check that these thresholds align with contemporary guidelines, which they do in ESC/EACTS and ACC/AHA documents [^1126Vz7k].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic pathway before labeling severity. Transthoracic echocardiography is the first-line modality to assess valve morphology and hemodynamics, but I need to ensure accurate measurements and consider discordant parameters, which are not rare and can misclassify severity; in such cases, multimodality imaging such as CT calcium scoring, dobutamine echocardiography, or CMR can help adjudicate true severe AS and myocardial status, so I should not jump to conclusions based on a single discordant study [^113SyRaH] [^112yrftW] [^11477r55].

> Next, I should review symptom status carefully, because symptoms are the strongest trigger for intervention. Classic symptoms include exertional dyspnea, chest pain or pressure, syncope or presyncope, and fatigue, and I need to remember that older, sedentary patients may minimize symptoms, so exercise testing can unmask exertional hypotension, limited exercise tolerance, or symptoms attributable to AS. Guideline-directed exercise testing with attention to blood pressure response is particularly informative in apparently asymptomatic patients [^1156zo6f] [^112CtsAF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about asymptomatic patients; I should confirm objective markers of decompensation. A sustained fall in systolic blood pressure of more than 20 mmHg during exercise, a reduction in LVEF below 50% on serial imaging, or very severe hemodynamics such as peak velocity of 5.0 m/s or higher are red flags that shift the balance toward earlier intervention even in the absence of overt symptoms, and I should double-check that these are indeed Class I or IIa triggers in current guidance, which they are in ACC/AHA and ESC/EACTS documents [^1156zo6f] [^114L63PB] [^112oqzym].

> For symptomatic severe AS, I need to ensure I am clear that valve replacement is indicated essentially regardless of gradient subtype, because untreated symptomatic severe AS carries a median survival of roughly 2 to 3 years and high event rates. Both SAVR and TAVR improve survival and symptoms, and the choice should be individualized by a heart team using shared decision-making rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^115Epmo6] [^114w1dGw] [^114rnc3g].

> Now, regarding asymptomatic severe AS, I should confirm the traditional stance and then weigh emerging evidence. Historically, watchful waiting with close surveillance has been standard, but randomized trials such as AVATAR and RECOVERY suggest that early intervention reduces all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations compared with conservative management, although individual trials vary in endpoints and generalizability; thus, a tailored approach is prudent, favoring early AVR in reliable patients with high-risk features and conservative management when surveillance is assured and risk is low [^111uAopi] [^114LGnNi] [^111zi8fv].

> But wait, what if the patient has low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with reduced LVEF? I should verify how to distinguish true severe AS from pseudosevere stenosis. Dobutamine stress echocardiography to assess for contractile or flow reserve is essential, and if true severe AS is confirmed, AVR is indicated. CT aortic valve calcium scoring can further support severity in this phenotype, and I need to ensure I do not mislabel secondary LV dysfunction as primary cardiomyopathy before committing to intervention [^11477r55] [^112oqzym].

> Let me consider the choice between SAVR and TAVR, and I should confirm age and risk stratification guidance. In general, SAVR is favored in younger patients, those with long life expectancy, or when concomitant surgical procedures are needed, whereas TAVR is preferred in older adults, high or prohibitive surgical risk, or when anatomy favors transfemoral access; importantly, contemporary trials support TAVR as noninferior or comparable to surgery even in low-risk cohorts, though durability beyond 10 to 15 years remains a key consideration in younger patients [^113qMx9U] [^111yrMg6] [^112S1h8g].

> I should double-check special populations and scenarios. In women, smaller annular size and higher rates of pacemaker with self-expanding valves may influence device selection and access planning, so sex-specific anatomic and outcome data should inform the heart team discussion. In patients with concomitant coronary artery disease, combined SAVR plus CABG may be advantageous when CAD is complex, whereas a staged TAVR followed by PCI strategy is reasonable in high surgical risk. And in patients undergoing other cardiac surgery, treating moderate AS at the time of operation is reasonable to avoid redo sternotomy [^115PsZ3d] [^115mzAND].

> Next, I should review surveillance intervals and triggers for re-evaluation, and I need to ensure I am not overextending intervals in severe disease. For asymptomatic patients managed conservatively, echocardiography every 6 to 12 months for severe AS, every 1 to 2 years for moderate AS, and every 3 to 5 years for mild AS is appropriate, with earlier reassessment if symptoms emerge or if there is rapid progression. Education on symptom recognition and prompt reporting is essential to avoid late presentation [^111QetAu] [^115T4Tnt].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of the heart team and shared decision-making, because contemporary guidelines emphasize process as much as thresholds. A multidisciplinary heart valve team including interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, imaging, anesthesia, and heart failure specialists should review all cases where intervention is contemplated, integrate patient values and life expectancy, and document a shared decision-making conversation that weighs procedural risks, valve durability, and the possibility of reintervention over time [^113vsYN7] [^115rSLBR] [^114rnc3g].

> Let me synthesize the decision framework to ensure internal consistency. If the patient has symptomatic severe AS, proceed to AVR via SAVR or TAVR based on age, anatomy, and risk, with shared decision-making. If the patient is asymptomatic with severe AS, assess for high-risk features such as very severe hemodynamics, LVEF less than 50%, or abnormal exercise test, and consider early AVR in those with reliable follow-up and low procedural risk, otherwise continue surveillance with close echocardiographic monitoring. Throughout, confirm severity with high-quality imaging and address discordant data using multimodality approaches before committing to intervention [^114rnc3g] [^113vsYN7] [^112yrftW].

Aortic stenosis is a progressive narrowing of the aortic valve orifice, most often due to **calcific degeneration** in older adults [^116amJNW], with a prevalence of ~2% in those > 65 and ~13% in those > 75 [^116amJNW] [^112CAHBJ]. It causes increased afterload, left ventricular hypertrophy, and, when severe, heart failure, angina, and syncope; once symptoms appear, **untreated survival averages 2–3 years** [^111QetAu]. Diagnosis relies on echocardiography [^113SyRaH] to define severity by jet velocity, mean gradient, and valve area, with CT or catheterization when echo is inconclusive [^113SyRaH]. The only definitive therapy is **aortic valve replacement (SAVR or TAVR)** [^1141ARES], guided by symptoms, severity, and heart team assessment; TAVR is favored in older or higher-risk patients, while SAVR is preferred in younger, low-risk patients or when durability is paramount [^111YNwDe]. Medical therapy is limited to symptom control and risk factor management; prognosis is excellent with timely intervention but poor when treatment is delayed or not offered [^1125jvRx] [^115Epmo6].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Aortic stenosis has **three principal etiologies**:

- **Degenerative calcific aortic stenosis**: The most common in developed countries, associated with aging and risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking [^115Epmo6].

- **Congenital bicuspid aortic valve**: Present in 1–2% of the population, predisposing to early calcification and stenosis [^116amJNW].

- **Rheumatic heart disease**: Less common in developed countries but remains prevalent in developing regions [^116amJNW].

Pathophysiologically, valve narrowing increases left ventricular afterload, causing concentric hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction; with progression, systolic dysfunction, heart failure, and adverse remodeling occur [^1128k7Gw].

---

## Clinical presentation

Aortic stenosis has a long asymptomatic phase; **symptoms typically appear late** and reflect advanced disease:

- **Exertional dyspnea**: Early symptom due to diastolic dysfunction and elevated left atrial pressures.

- **Angina**: Results from increased myocardial oxygen demand and reduced coronary perfusion.

- **Syncope or presyncope**: Occurs due to reduced cardiac output during exertion or arrhythmias.

- **Heart failure**: Late manifestation with pulmonary congestion and reduced exercise tolerance [^116amJNW].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Echocardiography is the **cornerstone of diagnosis and severity grading**, using Doppler-derived jet velocity, mean gradient, and valve area [^112eooXk]:

| **Severity** | **Jet velocity (m/s)** | **Mean gradient (mmhg)** | **Valve area (cm²)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | < 3.0 | < 20 | > 1.5 |
| Moderate | 3.0–4.0 | 20–40 | 1.0–1.5 |
| Severe | ≥ 4.0 | ≥ 40 | ≤ 1.0 |

---

Additional tests — such as **cardiac CT (for calcium scoring)** [^11477r55], **cardiac MRI (for myocardial fibrosis)** [^1141ARES], and **exercise testing (to unmask symptoms)** [^112CtsAF] — may be used when echocardiography is inconclusive or to refine risk stratification [^112yrftW].

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

Medical therapy does not alter disease progression; it focuses on **symptom control** and risk-factor modification. Use diuretics cautiously for heart failure symptoms, treat hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, and **avoid overuse of vasodilators** in severe AS. Statins **do not slow calcific progression** once stenosis is established [^notfound].

---

### Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR)

SAVR has long been the **gold standard** for severe symptomatic AS, with excellent long-term durability, particularly with mechanical valves. It is preferred for patients younger than 65 years or with a life expectancy exceeding 20 years, those with concomitant surgical indications (e.g. coronary artery bypass grafting), or when TAVR is anatomically unsuitable [^113qMx9U].

---

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)

TAVR is a **minimally invasive** alternative to SAVR and has expanded to include low-risk patients based on robust trial data [^1141ARES]. It is favored for patients aged ≥ 75 years, those at **high or prohibitive surgical risk**, or when a less invasive approach is preferred. Durability **beyond 10–15 years** remains under study, particularly in younger patients [^notfound].

---

## Indications for intervention

Current guidelines recommend intervention based on **symptoms, severity, and ventricular function**:

- **Symptomatic severe AS**: Class I indication for SAVR or TAVR [^1141ARES].

- **Asymptomatic severe AS**: Consider intervention if LVEF < 50%, very severe stenosis (jet velocity ≥ 5.0 m/s), or abnormal exercise testing (hypotension or symptoms) [^114L63PB].

- **Low-flow, low-gradient AS**: Intervention indicated if AS is confirmed and symptoms are present or LV dysfunction is due to afterload mismatch [^112oqzym].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with severity and treatment: asymptomatic patients have near-normal survival, whereas symptomatic severe AS without intervention carries a median survival of 2–3 years [^111ni6kv]. Timely AVR **improves survival and quality of life**; delayed intervention increases mortality and complications [^111HhjZi].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Earlier intervention**: Trials explore the benefit of intervening before symptom onset in selected asymptomatic patients [^114LGnNi].

- **Improved risk stratification**: Advanced imaging and biomarkers aim to identify patients at risk of rapid progression or adverse events [^117CAKsv].

- **Valve durability**: Ongoing studies address long-term durability of TAVR valves, especially in younger patients [^1165LE4E].

---

Aortic stenosis is a progressive valve disease with a **poor prognosis once symptoms develop**; timely AVR is the only definitive therapy. TAVR has broadened treatment access, but durability and patient selection remain key considerations.

Practical recommendations and processes of care

Care of the asymptomatic patient with AS can be complex and challenging. While additional evidence is awaited, we advise detailed clinical and echocardiographic assessment with exercise testing and advanced imaging (eg, stress echocardiography, TOE, CT and CMR) performed as indicated to clarify symptoms, severity of AS and myocardial health. This should be performed by heart valve specialists working as part of a heart team. Patient involvement in decision making is key where indications for intervention are borderline. Given delays between referral and procedure that are common in most healthcare systems, this could also be discussed with the patient and may inform decision making for earlier intervention. The recent ESC/EACTS guideline update also recommends the establishment of heart valve centres with access to advanced imaging modalities and contemporary interventional techniques supported by robust internal audit processes. Finally, patients managed conservatively should be educated as to the typical symptoms of AS (table 2) and the importance of prompt symptom reporting. Regular clinic surveillance is essential, and current guidelines recommend clinical assessment with echocardiography at least every 6 months.

### ESC / EACTS vs. ACC / AHA guidelines for the management of severe aortic stenosis [^114sUF8v]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a serious and complex condition, for which optimal management continues to evolve rapidly. An understanding of current clinical practice guidelines is critical to effective patient care and shared decision-making. This state of the art review of the 2021 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Guidelines and 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines compares their recommendations for AS based on the evidence to date. The European and American guidelines were generally congruent with the exception of three key distinctions. First, the European guidelines recommend intervening at a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, compared with 60% over serial imaging by the American guidelines for asymptomatic patients. Second, the European guidelines recommend a threshold of ≥ 65 years for surgical bioprosthesis, whereas the American guidelines employ multiple age categories, providing latitude for patient factors and preferences. Third, the guidelines endorse different age cut-offs for transcatheter vs. surgical aortic valve replacement, despite limited evidence. This review also discusses trends indicating a decreasing proportion of mechanical valve replacements. Finally, the review identifies gaps in the literature for areas including transcatheter aortic valve implantation in asymptomatic patients, the appropriateness of Ross procedures, concomitant coronary revascularization with aortic valve replacement, and bicuspid AS. To summarize, this state of the art review compares the latest European and American guidelines on the management of AS to highlight three areas of divergence: timing of intervention, valve selection, and surgical vs. transcatheter aortic valve replacement criteria.

### Prevalence, mechanisms, and prognostic impact of effort intolerance in patients with asymptomatic / minimally symptomatic aortic stenosis [^111fTw74]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Valvular disease is increasing with the aging population. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a serious condition that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the standard AS treatment; however, less invasive transcatheter AVR has become more widespread, reducing procedural risks and increasing treatment options for older adult patients. AVR has traditionally been considered only in hemodynamically severe diseases with clinical symptoms. Specifically, it is included in current guidelines as a Class I recommendation for patients with symptomatic severe AS and asymptomatic severe AS with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% or other indications for open heart surgery. However, asymptomatic severe and even moderate AS in symptomatic patients has growing evidence of adverse clinical consequences. Moreover, the timing and indications for surgical intervention in asymptomatic patients remain debatable. Although guidelines prioritize symptom presence or absence when considering AVR indications, we often encounter patients with poor symptoms in practice. Exercise testing is recommended for assessing symptoms and hemodynamics in patients with AS in class I and class IIa in the European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for valvular disease. However, implementation rates are low. Moreover, effort intolerance was associated with long‐term mortality in patients with asymptomatic severe AS and preserved LVEF. It is, therefore, important to assess accurate effort intolerance. Recently, the concept of cardiac damage, where AS cardiac load adversely affects the left ventricle, left atrium, pulmonary circulation, and right ventricle in a retrograde manner, has been proposed, raising concerns about its effect on irreversible extra‐aortic cardiac injury. In addition to AS, there are reports on the need for exercise tolerance and its mechanisms in, for example, poorly symptomatic organic mitral regurgitation.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and prognostic impact of effort intolerance in patients with minimally symptomatic moderate or asymptomatic severe AS, using exercise‐stress echocardiography with cardiopulmonary exercise test (ESE‐CPET) and to study the factors associated with effort intolerance in patients with AS.

### Navigating the gray zone: AI decision support to identify aortic stenosis severity [^115Ro9cX]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic pathways within cardiology carry immense potential to benefit from artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technologies. AI can track beat-to-beat ejection fraction, identify cardiac amyloidosis, and automate error-prone tedious measurements from images. As AI research for cardiovascular diagnosis gathers unprecedented momentum, a key question prevails: what cardiovascular conditions, or "use cases", are ideal for the application of AI-based decision support? We postulate that conditions that are life- or quality of life-threatening and have proven therapies but suffer from diagnostic uncertainty, risk underestimation, and consequent significant practice variation may be well-suited to develop and study AI-enabled decision support to optimize diagnosis, risk assessment, and potential therapy allocation. Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is one such potential condition.

Symptomatic, severe AS is a high-risk valvular disease that requires aortic valve replacement (AVR) to improve symptoms and outcomes, including mortality. Transcatheter AVR options may be available even if surgical AVR is high risk. Therefore, identifying severe AS for timely and appropriate AVR referral has increasing importance in modern cardiology practice. Echocardiographic (echo) diagnosis — the standard modality — relies on a combination of directly measured variables including aortic valve velocities, transaortic gradients, and left ventricular outflow tract dimensions; and subsequent parameters calculated from the measured variables, including aortic valve area and the dimensionless valve index. Discordant parameters are not uncommon, which may lead to consternation regarding the presence of "true" severe AS — and the appropriate timing of referral for AVR. Suboptimal echo data due to technical limitations or variation in user-dependent measurements (such as left ventricular outflow tract dimension) may further add subjectivity to the evaluation of AS despite clear thresholds in guidelines. Diagnostic uncertainty may be exacerbated in patients with subtle or limited symptoms or concomitant disease that can be alternative etiologies for symptoms, such as cardiomyopathy, obstructive airway disease, or morbid obesity.

Regarding surgical interventions for aortic stenosis, more specifically with respect to aortic valve replacement, indications, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend to perform aortic valve replacement in symptomatic patients with combined AS and aortic regurgitation and a peak transvalvular jet velocity of at least 4.0 m/s or a mean transvalvular gradient of at least 40 mmHg.

### Rationale and design of the aortic valve replAcemenT versus conservative treatment in asymptomatic seveRe aortic stenosis (AVATAR trial): a randomized multicenter controlled event-driven trial [^115jan4k]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic valve replacement (AVR) therapy is an obvious choice for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients as it improves symptoms, left ventricular function, and survival. The treatment decisions and indication for AVR in asymptomatic patients with severe AS and normal left ventricular ejection fraction are less well established and the subject of ongoing debate. Many efforts have been made to define the best treatment option in asymptomatic AS patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Retrospective and observational data imply that elective AVR for asymptomatic severe AS may lead to improvement in outcomes in comparison to surgery performed after onset of symptoms. The AVATAR trial will aim to assess outcomes among asymptomatic AS patients randomized to either elective early AVR or medical management with vigilant follow-up. In the latter group, AVR would be delayed until either the onset of symptoms or changes in predefined echocardiographic parameters. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it will be the first large prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of elective AVR in this specific group of patients.

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^111YNwDe]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk and decision-making pathways — guided actions for aortic valve replacement (AVR) selection are organized as: No current indication for AVR lists periodic monitoring of aortic stenosis (AS) severity and symptoms and re-evaluation when AS is severe or symptoms occur. When AVR is indicated but surgical AVR (SAVR) is preferred over TAVR, the document states 'SAVR recommended in lower-risk patients', notes valve durability considerations in younger patients, and that a concurrent surgical procedure may be needed. For a TAVR candidate with expected benefit > risk, actions include discussion with patient and family and proceeding with TAVR imaging evaluation and procedure. For severe symptomatic AS but benefit < risk (futility), thresholds include life expectancy < 1 year and chance of survival with benefit at 2 years < 25%, with actions including discussion with patient and family, palliative care inputs, and palliative balloon aortic valvuloplasty in selected patients.

Current guideline-recommended treatment strategies and their limitations

Broadly speaking, contemporary clinical guidelines recommend aortic valve intervention when stenosis severity is deemed severe and there is evidence of left ventricular decompensation, using either direct objective or surrogate symptomatic measures (figure 1 and table 1). Haemodynamic severity is best assessed using echocardiography but can be challenging when measures of severity are discordant or low-flow states exist. New recommendations for confirming AS severity are given in the 2017 ESC/EACTS guideline update. Detailed discussion of low-flow states is beyond the scope of this article but can be found elsewhere.

### Narrowed aortic valve… [^116qg2bx]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve, the outflow valve of the heart between the left ventricle and the aorta. The aortic valve normally functions as a 1-way valve that prevents blood from leaking back into the heart. When the aortic valve narrows, the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the aorta. Aortic stenosis is caused by stiffening of the 3 valve leaflets, restricting its ability to open normally. Aortic stenosis typically develops in individuals older than 65 years but can also develop in younger individuals who are born with an abnormal valve or develop rheumatic heart disease. What Are the Symptoms. Symptoms of aortic stenosis include chest pressure, lightheadedness or fainting, breathlessness, and/or fatigue.

They indicate that the extra work required to open the valve has overcome the heart's ability to work normally. Aortic stenosis is a slowly progressive disease. Many patients never develop symptoms and thus never need to have the valve replaced. However, when symptoms develop or the obstruction becomes very severe, expeditious diagnosis and treatment are critical. How Is It Diagnosed. Aortic stenosis is often first diagnosed when a physician hears a heart murmur, caused by blood flowing rapidly through the valve. More reliable diagnosis is made using echocardiography to image the heart's structure and function and to measure the speed of blood traveling through the valve. Other tests include cardiac catheterization, a procedure in which small tubes are inserted into blood vessels and passed directly across the valve to determine its tightness, and imaging tests such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

How Is It Treated. Medications are usually not effective in treating aortic stenosis as this is a mechanical problem, and valve replacement is the only proven therapy to improve symptoms and prolong life. Open heart surgery to replace the aortic valve has been an effective and durable treatment for aortic stenosis for decades. In this operation, a heart surgeon removes the narrowed valve and replaces it with either a tissue valve or a mechanical valve.

### Stress testing in asymptomatic aortic stenosis [^112CtsAF]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is 1 of the most common heart valve diseases among adults. When symptoms develop, prognosis is poor, and current guidelines recommend prompt aortic valve replacement. Depending of the severity of the aortic stenosis and the presence of concomitant heart disease and medical comorbidities, stress testing represents a reasonable strategy to help better risk stratify asymptomatic patients. The present report provides a comprehensive review of the current available data on stress testing in aortic stenosis and subsequently summarizes its potential for guiding the optimal timing of aortic valve replacement.

Table 1 results and discussion — Scope and stress testing considerations: The table is intended for "patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, which conforms to stages C1 and C2 in the ACC/AHA guidelines (1,2)". It specifies that "the decision to be made is between aortic valve replacement (AVR) and no intervention, as the choices do not differentiate between TAVR versus SAVR since the type of AVR is influenced by variables not considered in this table", and that "Balloon valvuloplasty was not offered as an option as it would rarely, if ever, be considered an option in the asymptomatic patient". It further notes, "Amplifying the role for stress testing addressed by the guidelines, the scenarios in this table underscore the importance of stress test performance in decision making (12–17)", while acknowledging that "stress testing in elderly patients may be challenging and stress test results may not be available for all patients". In such cases, "the decision to intervene or manage the patient medically will be influenced predominantly by surgical risk and the presence of factors associated with possible symptom onset and/or rapid disease progression", and "The definitions of surgical risk are covered in the General Assumptions (#12)".

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^113vsYN7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Shared decision-making and Heart Valve Team — the management of patients with severe AS considered for TAVR is 'best achieved by a multidisciplinary, collaborative Heart Valve Team' including cardiologists with expertise in valvular heart disease, structural interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, cardiovascular surgeons, cardiovascular anesthesiologists, and cardiovascular nursing professionals. Patient management 'relies on a shared decision-making approach' integrating patient preferences and values; specific tasks are to review the patient's condition and valve severity, determine which interventions are indicated, technically feasible, and reasonable, and discuss benefits and risks with the patient and family. The Heart Valve Team 'should emphasize that the purpose of valvular intervention is to improve symptoms and/or prolong survival, while minimizing adverse outcomes associated with the intervention'. Initial assessment includes evaluation of AS symptoms, disease severity and comorbidities, and 'Echocardiographic measures of AS severity should be reviewed, disease severity confirmed, and additional imaging performed as indicated'.

### Severe aortic stenosis: more than an imaging diagnosis [^114Rknv8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The definition of severe aortic stenosis has undergone significant change casting a wider net to avoid missing patients who could benefit from valve replacement. The presence or absence of symptoms remains the key decision-making element; however, individuals presently undergoing evaluation are older, more likely asymptomatic, and have lower gradients. Due to numerous potential measurement errors, attention to detail when performing diagnostic testing and understanding their limitations are necessary to render appropriate treatment. Exercise testing adds useful information for individuals with severe aortic stenosis felt to be asymptomatic. Dobutamine echocardiography, in low flow-low gradient aortic stenosis, distinguishes between a myopathic and valvular cause of left ventricular dysfunction. Evaluation of patients when normotensive minimizes measurement errors. The amount of aortic valve calcification adds useful information when the degree of aortic stenosis is uncertain. A good history and physical integrated with high-quality imaging data allows for appropriate clinical treatment decisions for patients with aortic stenosis. The goal is simultaneously to provide aortic valve replacement for patients in need while avoiding overdiagnosis and performance of unnecessary procedures.

### Asymptomatic aortic stenosis: from risk stratification to treatment [^111zi8fv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our understanding of the natural history of aortic stenosis has significantly increased over the last decade. There have been considerable advances in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with aortic stenosis and in surgical and anesthetic techniques. In addition, transcatheter aortic valve replacement has established itself as a viable alternative to surgical management. Inevitably, these developments have raised questions regarding the merits of waiting for symptom onset in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis before offering treatment. Recent observational and randomized trial data suggest that early intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and normal left ventricular function may confer a prognostic advantage to a watchful waiting strategy. In this review, we highlight advances in the management and risk stratification of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis with particular consideration of recent findings supporting early valvular intervention.

### Imaging and impact of myocardial fibrosis in aortic stenosis [^1141ARES]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis is one of the most common valvular diseases in the Western world, with an estimated prevalence as high as 12.4% in the elderly. Aortic stenosis is characterized not only by progressive valve obstruction, but also by the left ventricular remodeling response. Narrowing of the valve causes pressure overload of the left ventricle and triggers a hypertrophic response that maintains myocardial performance for many years, if not decades. However, with time, this process decompensates as patients transition from hypertrophy to heart failure, a change that is heralded clinically by the development of symptoms and adverse events, leading to consideration of aortic valve replacement (AVR).

Aortic stenosis progresses inexorably. Although the early stages are asymptomatic and associated with a good prognosis, advanced disease is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite much research, to date there are no proven medical therapies that slow disease progression. The only definitive treatment for severe aortic stenosis remains AVR, either by surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) approaches. The uptake of TAVR has grown exponentially, as interventions that were initially offered only to elderly, inoperable patients are now being performed in younger, lower-risk patients with excellent results. Decisions about if, when, and how to intervene have therefore become increasingly complex, requiring careful assessment of individual patients within a multidisciplinary heart team.

Current guidelines recommend intervention in patients with severe aortic stenosis and evidence of left ventricular decompensation. Most commonly this is in the form of development of typical symptoms, but other markers include a reduction in ejection fraction < 50%, an abnormal exercise tolerance test, or a rise in brain natriuretic peptide levels. Unfortunately, symptoms are often difficult to identify in the elderly comorbid patients encountered in clinical practice, and many of the other changes appear only late in the course of the disease after irreversible myocardial damage has become established. European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide a Class 1 recommendation, Level of Evidence: B, for intervention in the most common scenario — symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis. However, intervention in asymptomatic patients with a reduction in ejection fraction < 50% or an abnormal exercise test is only Level of Evidence: C (i.e. expert opinion). The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines are largely in alignment. This highlights the need for more robust data to better risk-stratify patients and optimize management strategies before the onset of symptoms and heart failure.

### Clinical outcomes according to aortic stenosis management: insights from real-world practice [^115qybBU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent valvular heart disease in Western countries, affecting ≈5% of individuals aged > 65 year old. Untreated, symptomatic severe AS is associated with poor short‐term prognosis, significant rates of health care resource usage including frequent hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), and impaired quality of life. To date, aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the only effective therapy that has been proven to improve survival. Therefore, current guidelines strongly recommend to refer symptomatic patients with severe AS for AVR, whether surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR), depending on surgical risk and/or patient age.

Despite these recommendations, previous studies consistently reported an underuse of AVR in a significant proportion of symptomatic patients with severe AS. Additionally, the question of more timely interventions in severe but also moderate AS emerges to reduce its burden, particularly at a time of low AVR‐related death even for those who were previously deemed to be inoperable. Importantly, most of the studies exploring the current management of patients with AS and its association with outcomes are restricted to severe AS, tertiary centers, report only limited follow‐up or may be biased by the cost or the availability of the selected therapy. Finally, the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines suggest different age thresholds (65 and 80) for choosing between SAVR or TAVR and highlight for the first time the importance of shared decision making with the patient. In this context, there are few data on patients who did not have an AVR (because they refused or in whom AVR was considered futile) despite a strong indication.

Given the growing interest in intervention in AS patients, a deeper understanding of the population risk profile and clinical course of the disease through contemporary and unbiased management may serve as a benchmark for future clinical studies. Based on a population of outpatients across the overall spectrum of AS (mild, moderate and severe AS), this study aimed to explore the mode of intervention, in the overall cohort and according to the age of the patients proposed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, as well as the association between the initial therapeutic decision and long‐term outcomes, including patients in whom AVR was considered futile or patients who refused AVR.

### Aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease: what do we know? What don't we know? A comprehensive review of the literature with proposed treatment algorithms [^114v8TyH]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Aortic valve stenosis is the most common form of valvular heart disease in the elderly population and occurs frequently in conjunction with coronary artery disease. The standard treatment option for patients with these two conditions has been surgical aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. The arrival of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has considerably shifted the treatment paradigms. Nevertheless, a lot of questions remain unanswered regarding the management of coronary artery disease in the setting of the transcatheter options for severe aortic stenosis. This article includes a comprehensive review of the literature and seeks to describe the actual knowledge on the topic of aortic stenosis and concomitant coronary artery disease.

### Management strategies and future challenges for aortic valve disease [^115qBjv9]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The management of aortic valve disease has been improved by accurate diagnosis and assessment of severity by echocardiography and advanced imaging techniques, efforts to elicit symptoms or objective markers of disease severity and progression, and consideration of optimum timing of aortic valve replacement, even in elderly patients. Prevalence of calcific aortic stenosis is growing in ageing populations. Conventional surgery remains the most appropriate option for most patients who require aortic valve replacement, but the transcatheter approach is established for high-risk patients or poor candidates for surgery. The rapid growth of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been fuelled by improved technology, evidence-based clinical research, and setting up of multidisciplinary heart teams. Aortic regurgitation can be difficult to diagnose and quantify. Left ventricular dysfunction often precedes symptoms, needing active surveillance by echocardiography to determine the optimum time for aortic valve replacement. Development of transcatheter approaches for aortic regurgitation is challenging, owing to the absence of valvular calcification and distortion of aortic root anatomy in many patients.

### Was it worth it? Benefits of transcatheter aortic valve implantation from a patient's perspective [^117WN37E]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an important treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis. To improve patient selection, shared decision-making is recommended to elicit patients' treatment expectations and goals. We assessed patients' expectations and goals before TAVI treatment and whether these were met after treatment. Additionally, we evaluated how meeting these goals aligned with quality of life and functional recovery.

Design

A mixed method study.

Setting

An academic medical center.

Participants

Seventy-four patients undergoing TAVI between 2015 and 2017.

Measurements

Patients' expectations and goals were assessed qualitatively before treatment. Six to twelve months post procedure, quality of life was measured with the EuroQuol-5D and any change in the number of dependencies in (instrumental) activities of daily living was assessed.

Results

Mean age of patients was 81.5years, and 37.8% were male. Regaining the ability to engage in a specific hobby or activity was the most important treatment goal (33 patients, 54.1%), followed by reducing symptoms (19 patients 31.1%). 66.2% of patients stated that their treatment goal was met. Quality of life was higher in this group, as compared with patients who had not met their treatment goal. Twenty-three patients (31.1%) showed functional improvement.

Conclusion

TAVI patients were quite capable of eliciting treatment goals and a majority stated, after treatment, that these had been met patients' experience of treatment benefits regarding these goals had poor alignment with functional outcomes. This raises questions regarding relevant outcome measurements in this population, and could aid in improving shared decision-making and patient selection for TAVI.

### Calcification in aortic stenosis: the skeleton key [^111dvfkB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is a common, potentially fatal condition that is set to become an increasing public health burden. Once symptoms develop, there is an inexorable deterioration with a poor prognosis. Despite this, there are no medical therapies capable of modifying disease progression, and the only available treatment is aortic valve replacement, to which not all patients are suited. Conventional teaching suggests that aortic stenosis is a degenerative condition whereby "wear and tear" leads to calcium deposition within the valve. Although mechanical stress and injury are important factors, it is becoming increasingly appreciated that aortic stenosis is instead governed by a highly complex, regulated pathological process with similarities to skeletal bone formation. This review discusses the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis with an emphasis on the emerging importance of calcification, how this can be visualized and monitored using noninvasive imaging, and how our improved knowledge may ultimately translate into novel disease-modifying treatments.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117G5oCS]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

The "2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the diagnosis, genetic evaluation and family screening, medical therapy, endovascular and surgical treatment, and long-term surveillance of patients with aortic disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets (ie, asymptomatic, stable symptomatic, and acute aortic syndromes).

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee, where appropriate. Structure: Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. The is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease.

### Aortic stenosis: diagnosis and treatment [^111QetAu]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis affects 3% of persons older than 65 years. Although survival in asymptomatic patients is comparable to that in age- and sex-matched control patients, it decreases rapidly after symptoms appear. During the asymptomatic latent period, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial augmentation of preload compensate for the increase in afterload caused by aortic stenosis. As the disease worsens, these compensatory mechanisms become inadequate, leading to symptoms of heart failure, angina, or syncope. Aortic valve replacement is recommended for most symptomatic patients with evidence of significant aortic stenosis on echocardiography. Watchful waiting is recommended for most asymptomatic patients. However, select patients may also benefit from aortic valve replacement before the onset of symptoms. Surgical valve replacement is the standard of care for patients at low to moderate surgical risk. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement may be considered in patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk. Patients should be educated about the importance of promptly reporting symptoms to their physicians. In asymptomatic patients, serial Doppler echocardiography is recommended every six to 12 months for severe aortic stenosis, every one to two years for moderate disease, and every three to five years for mild disease. Cardiology referral is recommended for all patients with symptomatic moderate and severe aortic stenosis, those with severe aortic stenosis without apparent symptoms, and those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Medical management of concurrent hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease will lead to optimal outcomes.

### Comprehensive update on the new indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the latest 2017 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^112oqzym]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

The management of patients with low-gradient aortic stenosis is more challenging. In patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis and reduced ejection fraction in whom the depressed ejection fraction is predominantly caused by excessive afterload, LV function usually improves after aortic valve replacement. Intervention is indicated in symptomatic patients with severe low-flow, low-gradient (< 40 mm Hg) aortic stenosis with reduced ejection fraction, and evidence of flow (contractile) reserve excluding pseudosevere aortic stenosis (class I, LoE C). Decision making about intervention should take into account the degree of valve calcification, the extent of coronary artery disease and the feasibility of concomitant or staged revascularisation, as well as the patient's comorbidities. The ability to identify patients with severe aortic stenosis in this subgroup by CT calcium scoring and the availability of TAVR have lowered the threshold to intervene. The new 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines now also state that intervention 'should' — and not only 'may' (2012) — be considered in symptomatic patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis and reduced ejection fraction without flow (contractile) reserve, particularly in those patients in whom CT calcium scoring confirms severe aortic stenosis (class IIa, LoE C).

Patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis and preserved ejection fraction are the most difficult subgroup to decide on intervention or not. Data on their natural history and outcome after surgical or catheter intervention are scarce and remain controversial. In such cases, intervention should only be performed when symptoms are present and if comprehensive evaluation suggests significant valve obstruction. The strongest indication for intervention remains symptoms (either spontaneous or on exercise testing).

Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis remains controversial. The currently available studies do not provide convincing data to support the general recommendation of early SAVR — the decision to operate on asymptomatic patients requires careful weighing of the risks and benefits. In physically active patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis, exercise testing is recommended for unmasking symptoms and for risk stratification.

As mentioned in the ESC/EACTS guidelines, SAVR is indicated in asymptomatic patients with an impaired LV function < 50% not due to other causes and/or an abnormal exercise test showing symptoms on exercise related to aortic stenosis (class I, LoE C). Moreover, SAVR is indicated in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or surgery on the ascending aorta or another valve (class I, LoE C).

### Pathophysiology, emerging techniques for the assessment and novel treatment of aortic stenosis [^116amJNW]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent acquired valvular heart disease. The condition's incidence increases with age, affecting 2% of adults over 65 years old and rising to 10% in the eighth decade of life. Disease burden is set to increase due to an ageing population. AS has a subclinical period which is asymptomatic and does not increase mortality. However, the prognosis when symptoms arise is poor and untreated patients have an average survival rate of 2–3 years.

The aetiology of AS can be classified into three groups: congenitally bicuspid aortic valve, inflammatory rheumatic heart disease and degenerative calcification. Chronic rheumatic fever can cause immunologically mediated scarring of the valve, however, its incidence has decreased in developed countries due to better treatment against group A streptococcus. Congenital bicuspid aortic valves have two cusps, impeding blood flow which can increase the risk of early-onset AS and calcification. It is calcific AS (CAS) which poses the greatest disease burden on developed countries due to its greater prevalence. Symptoms occur in CAS due to the calcification and thickening of the aortic valve reducing the flow of blood into the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract (figure 1). The symptoms of severe AS include angina, syncope and, ultimately, heart failure.

Figure 1
Diagram showing the anatomy of the heart and stenosis of the aortic valve during the cardiac cycle. During systole, as the valve opens, the flow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta is reduced due to the progressive narrowing of the aortic valve. Furthermore, thickening of the valve can reduce its mobility to close fully during diastole, leading to mixed aortic valve disease in some patients. Image from Zakkar et a.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Task Force have recently published guidance on the workup and treatment of AS. Challenges remain in the timing of surgical intervention, procedural risk, lack of medical treatment options and the unpredictable nature of AS deterioration. As a result of this, evolving data on the pathophysiology seeks to elucidate novel biomarkers and therapeutics to better patient outcomes. Furthermore, clinical trials such as the Early Valve Replacement guided by Biomarkers of Left Ventricular Decompensation in Asymptomatic Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis (EVOLVED) and The Early Valve Replacement in Severe Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis Study aim to influence patient management through emerging imaging modalities, better patient stratification and early intervention.

### Introduction to aortic stenosis [^113c5Q3C]. Circulation Research (2013). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is perhaps the most common of all valvular heart diseases in the developed nations of the world. Once primarily caused by rheumatic fever, the most common pathogenesis today is an active inflammatory process with some features that are similar to atherosclerosis. Because of this shift, the age at onset of severe obstruction has changed from the sixth decade 50 years ago to the eighth decade in most individuals today. The onset of symptoms remains a key determinant of outcome, although the later age at onset may make it difficult to discern if aortic stenosis or other age-related comorbidities is the cause of the symptoms. Once symptoms of aortic stenosis develop, life expectancy is shortened to ≈3 years unless the mechanical obstruction to left ventricular outflow is relieved by aortic valve replacement. Traditionally performed during cardiac surgery, aortic valve replacement now may be performed safely and effectively using transcatheter techniques, potentially revolutionizing the approach to this potentially fatal disease.

Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) describe treatment options including surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The writing group identified 95 clinical scenarios with up to 6 potential treatment options, and an independent rating panel scored each indication from 1 to 9 with categories defined as 1–3 Rarely Appropriate, 4–6 May Be Appropriate, and 7–9 Appropriate. After considering symptom status, left ventricular function, surgical risk, and concomitant disease, the panel determined that either SAVR or TAVR is Appropriate in most patients with symptomatic AS at intermediate or high surgical risk, while also noting circumstances in which indications are less clear or neither intervention is suitable. The document's purpose is to provide guidance by identifying reasonable treatment and intervention options across scenarios and to serve as an educational and quality improvement tool to identify patterns of care and reduce rarely appropriate interventions.

### Aortic stenosis: diagnosis and treatment [^111ni6kv]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most important cardiac valve disease in developed countries, affecting 3 percent of persons older than 65 years. Although the survival rate in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis is comparable to that in age- and sex-matched control patients, the average overall survival rate in symptomatic persons without aortic valve replacement is two to three years. During the asymptomatic latent period, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial augmentation of preload compensate for the increase in afterload caused by aortic stenosis. As the disease worsens, these compensatory mechanisms become inadequate, leading to symptoms of heart failure, angina, or syncope. Aortic valve replacement should be recommended in most patients with any of these symptoms accompanied by evidence of significant aortic stenosis on echocardiography. Watchful waiting is recommended for most asymptomatic patients, including those with hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis. Patients should be educated about symptoms and the importance of promptly reporting them to their physicians. Serial Doppler echocardiography is recommended annually for severe aortic stenosis, every one or two years for moderate disease, and every three to five years for mild disease. Cardiology referral is recommended for all patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, those with severe aortic stenosis without apparent symptoms, and those with left ventricular dysfunction. Many patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis have concurrent cardiac conditions, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease, which should also be carefully managed.

### Aortic stenosis [^115Epmo6]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

In developed countries, aortic stenosis is the most prevalent of all valvular heart diseases. A manifestation of ageing, the disorder is becoming more frequent as the average age of the population increases. Symptomatic severe disease is universally fatal if left untreated yet is consistent with a typical lifespan when mechanical relief of the stenosis is provided in a timely fashion. Management of mild disease, severe asymptomatic disease, and far advanced disease, and the effect of new percutaneous treatments, provide both controversy and exciting promise to care of patients with aortic stenosis. We discuss these issues in this Review.

### Aortic stenosis: is it simply a degenerative process or an active atherosclerotic process? [^113E2Af3]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis remains the most common cause of cardiac valve replacement in developed countries. The prevalence of this condition increases with age, and many of the risk factors for coronary artery disease also appear related to the development and progression of aortic stenosis. Recent studies also suggest a relationship between calcium and lipid accumulation in both coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis. Most important, there is growing evidence that aggressive treatment of coronary artery disease risk factors, particularly hyperlipidemia, may influence the progression of aortic stenosis. In this article the current literature is reviewed as it relates to vascular biology, pathogenesis of aortic valve disease, and current and newly emerging management approaches in the care of the patient with aortic stenosis.

Aortic stenosis — when to intervene?

When assessing a patient with aortic valve stenosis, some essential questions have to be asked and answered. How severe is the aortic stenosis? Does the patient have symptoms? Are the symptoms related to valvular disease? What are the patient's life expectancy and expected quality of life? Do the expected benefits of intervention outweigh its risks? Are local resources optimal for the planned intervention? What is the patient's preference?

Echocardiography is the key diagnostic tool. It confirms the presence of aortic valve stenosis; assesses the degree of valve calcification, left ventricular (LV)function and wall thickness and detects the presence of other associated valve disease or aortic pathology. Doppler echocardiography is the preferred technique for assessing the severity of the aortic valve stenosis.

In accordance with the 2012 ESC/EACTS guidelines, early therapy is strongly recommended in all symptomatic patients with severe high-gradient aortic stenosis (mean gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg or peak velocity ≥ 4 m/s; class I, level of evidence (LoE) B). For this patient group, there is virtually no lower ejection fraction limit for intervention. The only exceptions are patients with severe comorbidities indicating a survival of < 1 year and patients in whom severe comorbidities or their general condition at an advanced age make it unlikely that the intervention will improve quality of life or survival (class III, LoE C).

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in women [^116K5Zr6]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

This review examines the treatment options for women with severe aortic stenosis. It is known that female sex is associated with poorer outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement. With the introduction and adoption of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement, there are emerging data about the potential impact of female sex-specific characteristics on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. These data provide an insight into female-specific aspects of the treatment of aortic stenosis. The data can help guide patient selection, choice of intervention method, and evaluation of risk to help improve long-term follow-up of patients with aortic stenosis.

### Multimodality imaging strategies for the assessment of aortic stenosis: viewpoint of the heart valve clinic international database (HAVEC) group [^112yrftW]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most frequent valvular heart disease. In aortic stenosis, therapeutic decision essentially depends on symptomatic status, stenosis severity, and status of left ventricular systolic function. Surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation is the sole effective therapy in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, whereas the management of asymptomatic patients remains controversial and is mainly based on individual risk stratification. Imaging is fundamental for the initial diagnostic work-up, follow-up, and selection of the optimal timing and type of intervention. The present review provides specific recommendations for utilization of multimodality imaging to optimize risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making processes in aortic stenosis.

### European heart health survey 2019 [^116q7tNd]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In recent years, treatment of HVD (in particular, the treatment of aortic valve stenosis) has been revolutionized. Randomized trials and big registries have shown positive outcome results of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to medical and surgical treatment‐ independent of the individual surgical risk. 11, 12, 13, 19, 20 Additionally, TAVI offers advantages to the patient including shorter recovery time allowing patients to leave the hospital earlier and get back to normal life, which can lead to cost savings to healthcare systems. 21 Discussions about long‐term durability of keyhole devices are still ongoing, but show promising results with no inferiority to surgical devices until now. 22, 23, 24 As available data suggests TAVI as the gold standard for most of the patients with aortic valve stenosis, the numbers of TAVI procedures already exceeded the number of surgical aortic valve repair in many European countries. In Germany TAVI is performed already twice as often as isolated surgical aortic valve repair. 11, 12 In case of other HVD than aortic valve stenosis, the results of keyhole procedures are promising and new techniques and devices may offer valuable treatment options. 25, 26, 27, 28 This survey proves that people would definitely prefer keyhole procedures over surgery for the treatment of HVD, but also over medical daily or even weekly treatment. Despite this preference, the HVD survey 2017 showed that only a minority (19%) of respondents are aware of the possibility of receiving a keyhole procedure to treat HVD, whereas the majority are more likely to know about open heart valve replacement. 15 People should be encouraged to seek for an appointment with their GP in case of HVD symptoms. People might be willing to undergo a curative therapy earlier and would seek a medical appointment earlier if it was better known that there a less invasive keyhole therapy was more widely available. Awareness campaigns, patient organizations and education on the different treatment options could help with this.

4.1 Limitation of the survey

The 2019 European Heart Health Survey was only fielded in countries in Western Europe. Respondents were pre‐selected based on their agreement and ability to participate in an online survey. Among other factors this might have influenced the age distribution with fewest participants in the age group > 80 years. Nonetheless, the large number of respondents may overcome the latter limitations.

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^1154amLC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) benefit from aortic valve replacement (AVR). Management of severe AS in the absence of symptoms is, however, controversial and often challenging. Unselected premature AVR carries the risks of cardiac surgery; delayed AVR due to unrecognized symptoms can result in a dismal outcome. Echocardiography is the standard tool to evaluate and follow patients with AS. Nevertheless, most of the current echocardiographic parameters have limitations in predicting symptom onset and clinical outcome. The same applies to clinical parameters, exercise stress testing, and other imaging modalities used in AS evaluation and serial follow-up. Predictors of outcome could, however, help to identify asymptomatic patients who would benefit from expedited AVR with the goal to reduce mortality. This review will discuss the most relevant clinical studies and guidelines on management of asymptomatic severe AS, with an emphasis on providing concise information for identifying patients at high risk.

### Aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease: decision-making between surgical and transcatheter management [^115PsZ3d]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) frequently coexist and share pathophysiological mechanisms. The proportion of patients with AS and CAD requiring revascularization varies widely because of uncertainty about best clinical practices. Although combined surgical aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting has been the standard of care, management options in patients with AS and CAD requiring revascularization have expanded with the advent of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Potential alternative treatment pathways include revascularization before TAVR, concomitant TAVR and percutaneous coronary intervention, percutaneous coronary intervention after TAVR and deferred percutaneous coronary intervention or hybrid procedures. Selection depends on underlying disease severity, antithrombotic treatment strategies, clinical presentation, and symptom evolution after TAVR. In patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement, the addition of coronary artery bypass grafting has been associated with improved long-term mortality, especially if CAD is complex. although it is associated with higher periprocedural risk. The therapeutic impact of percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with TAVR is less well-established. The multitude of clinical permutations and remaining uncertainties do not support a uniform treatment strategy for patients with AS and CAD. Therefore, to provide the best possible care for each individual patient, heart teams need to be familiar with the available data on AS and CAD. Herein, we provide an in-depth review of the evidence supporting the decision-making process between transcatheter and surgical approaches and the key elements of treatment selection in patients with AS and CAD.

### Symptoms, disease severity and treatment of adults with a new diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis [^114pGHu5]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Contemporary data on patients with previously undiagnosed severe aortic stenosis (AS) are scarce. We aimed to address this gap by gathering data from consecutive patients diagnosed with severe AS on echocardiography.

Methods

This was a prospective, multicentre, multinational, registry in 23 tertiary care hospitals across 9 European countries. Patients with a diagnosis of severe AS were included using echocardiography (aortic valve area (AVA) < 1 cm², indexed AVA < 0.6 cm²/m², maximum jet-velocity (V_max) > 4 m/s and/or mean transvalvular gradient > 40 mmHg).

Results

The 2171 participants had a mean age of 77.9 years and 48.0% were female. The mean AVA was 0.73cm 2, V max 4.3 m/s and mean gradient 47.1mm Hg; 62.1% had left ventricular hypertrophy and 27.3% an ejection fraction (EF) < 50%. 1743 patients (80.3%) were symptomatic (shortness-of-breath 91.0%; dizziness 30.2%, chest pain 28.9%). Patients had a EuroSCORE II of 4.0; 25.3% had a creatinine clearance < 50mL/min, and 3.2% had an EF < 30%. Symptomatic patients were older and had more comorbidities than asymptomatic patients. Despite European Society of Cardiology 2017 valvular heart disease guideline class I recommendation, in only 76.2% a decision was made for an intervention (transcatheter 50.4%, surgical aortic valve replacement 25.8%). In asymptomatic patients, 57.7% with a class I/IIa indication were scheduled for a procedure, while 36.3% patients without an indication had their valve replaced.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with severe AS presented at an advanced disease stage. Management of severe AS remained suboptimal in a significant proportion of contemporary patients with severe AS.

### Early surgery versus conservative management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a meta-analysis [^115np7Vg]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although current guidelines generally recommend watchful waiting strategy for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis until symptoms develop, early surgery for asymptomatic aortic stenosis remains controversial. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of early surgery versus conservative strategy for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis.

Methods

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through February 2020 to identify clinical trials that investigated early surgery and conservative strategy for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. From each study, we extracted the hazard ratio of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted by dividing into severe aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s, mean aortic pressure gradient ≥ 40 mmHg, or aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 cm²) and very severe aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity ≥ 4.5 m/s, mean pressure gradient ≥ 50 mmHg, or aortic valve area ≤ 0.75 cm²) groups.

Results

One randomized controlled trial and 7 observational studies were identified. Pooled analyses demonstrated that all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality for early surgery were significantly lower compared with conservative strategy (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.36–0.68; P < .0001, hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.82; p = 0.01, respectively). Subgroup analyses showed significant reduction for early surgery in all-cause mortality (severe aortic stenosis: hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.35–0.78; p = 0.001, very severe aortic stenosis: hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–0.85; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

We demonstrated that early surgery was associated with significant reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Further randomized trials are warranted to confirm our findings.

### Timing of intervention in aortic stenosis: a review of current and future strategies [^112tp3nw]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease requiring surgical intervention in high-income countries. It is characterised by progressive thickening, fibrosis and calcification of the leaflets leading to restriction and valve obstruction. The consequent increase in left ventricular afterload leads to a hypertrophic response of the left ventricle, normalising wall tension and maintaining cardiac output. However, with progressive valvular stenosis, this hypertrophic response eventually decompensates resulting in symptom development, heart failure and death.

With no medications proven to attenuate or reverse stenosis progression, the only available treatment is valve replacement. This should ideally be performed when the risks of the disease process (ie, sudden cardiac death, irreversible functional impairment and heart failure) outweigh those of intervention (ie, procedural risk, long-term complications and potential need for reoperation). However, we frequently lack robust evidence to make accurate assessments of such risk. Deciding on the timing of valvular intervention is therefore difficult in many patients, and contemporary clinical guidelines are often underpinned by historical observational data rather than high-quality randomised controlled trials. This article will review our current understanding of the pathophysiology of AS, describe and examine the evidence behind current guideline recommendations and explore potential future strategies to optimise the timing of valve intervention.

Regarding surgical interventions for aortic stenosis, more specifically with respect to aortic valve replacement, indications, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider performing aortic valve replacement in apparently asymptomatic patients with severe AS (stage C1) and low surgical risk when an exercise test demonstrates decreased exercise tolerance (normalized for age and sex) or a fall in SBP of ≥ 10 mmHg from baseline to peak exercise.

### Misconceptions and facts about aortic stenosis [^112muQtx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease leading to intervention, and it is typically a disease of the elderly. Recent clinical advances have expanded the role of transcatheter aortic valve intervention in patients with severe aortic stenosis, making aortic valve intervention feasible and effective even in patients at intermediate, high, and prohibitive surgical risk. With the rapid advances in treatment, proper diagnosis becomes crucial for a wide range of patients with aortic stenosis: from "concordant" high-gradient aortic stenosis to "discordant" low-gradient aortic stenosis. The latter group commonly presents a clinical challenge requiring thoughtful and comprehensive evaluation to determine eligibility for aortic valve intervention. Providers at all levels should be familiar with basic diagnostic caveats and misconceptions when evaluating patients with possible aortic stenosis.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2018). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology collaborated with the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, American Heart Association, American Society of Echocardiography, European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Heart Valve Society, Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons to develop and evaluate Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). This is the first AUC to address the topic of AS and its treatment options, including surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). A number of common patient scenarios experienced in daily practice were developed along with assumptions and definitions for those scenarios, which were all created using guidelines, clinical trial data, and expert opinion in the field of AS. The 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines(1) and its 2017 focused update paper (2) were used as the primary guiding references in developing these indications. The writing group identified 95 clinical scenarios based on patient symptoms and clinical presentation, and up to 6 potential treatment options for those patients. A separate, independent rating panel was asked to score each indication from 1 to 9, with 1–3 categorized as "Rarely Appropriate", 4–6 as "May Be Appropriate", and 7–9 as "Appropriate". After considering factors such as symptom status, left ventricular (LV) function, surgical risk, and the presence of concomitant coronary or other valve disease, the rating panel determined that either SAVR or TAVR is Appropriate in most patients with symptomatic AS at intermediate or high surgical risk; however, situations commonly arise in clinical practice in which the indications for SAVR or TAVR are less clear, including situations in which 1 form of valve replacement would appear reasonable when the other is less so, as do other circumstances in which neither intervention is the suitable treatment option. The purpose of this AUC is to provide guidance to clinicians in the care of patients with severe AS by identifying the reasonable treatment and intervention options available based on the myriad clinical scenarios with which patients present. This AUC document also serves as an educational and quality improvement tool to identify patterns of care and reduce the number of rarely appropriate interventions in clinical practice.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk of TAVR and shared decision-making — the final treatment decision should be individualized using clinical and imaging evaluation, risk category, patient goals and expectations, and futility considerations. If the evaluation indicates that AS is not severe or symptoms are not due to AS, it may be prudent to continue periodic monitoring of AS severity and symptoms, deferring intervention until guideline-based criteria are met. Alternatively, the Heart Valve Team evaluation may conclude that the SAVR is the best option if surgical risk is low, the durability of a mechanical or other tissue valve is preferable in a younger patient, or concurrent procedures such as aortic root replacement or coronary bypass grafting are needed. Even when severe symptomatic AS is present, TAVR is considered futile when the expected benefit from TAVR is less than the expected risk; in these patients, palliative care may be the best option in terms of both quality and length of life. In patients who meet guideline-based criteria for TAVR and whose evaluation indicates the benefit is greater than risk, discussion with the patient and family should again review the likelihood of symptom relief or improved survival, possible complications and the expected recovery process, and alignment of patient goals and expectations with possible procedural outcomes.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116HVpnR]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2020 — Mixed aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR): Overall, patients with severe AS and severe primary MR are best treated with SAVR and mitral valve surgery unless the surgical risk is high or prohibitive, and if there is a high or prohibitive surgical risk, a staged procedure, with TAVI followed by mitral TEER, can be effective. If there is severe AS and severe secondary MR, either SAVR and mitral valve surgery or a staged approach with TAVI followed by mitral TEER are options. In patients with both AS and MR who are at a low or intermediate surgical risk, it is reasonable to address both valves with surgery. Patients with severe AS who are at high to prohibitive surgical risk are best served by TAVI, and if symptoms persist after TAVI and if there is suitable anatomy, percutaneous mitral repair can be performed, which can reduce MR and improve symptoms. For patients with AS who have secondary MR, the fate of MR after SAVR or TAVI is uncertain, and secondary MR does not improve or may even worsen after AVR in many cases. Because there are limited data to support CORs, a table provides a perspective on possible interventions in these complex patients.

### Aortic stenosis: timing is everything [^1165LE4E]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The publication of this study is timely in the context of other recent data on the burden and treatment of AS. Généreux et alrecently demonstrated in the largest AS cohort to date that a disproportionately large number of patients with severe AS did not undergo AVR, suggesting underutilization of AVR. It is reasonable to believe that a significant number of these patients with severe AS had either unrecognized symptoms or early markers of poor prognosis and would have benefited from AVR. Patients with moderate AS, for whom the current standard of care is close observation, also appear to be at increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. While this may reflect under recognition of severe AS, prospective trials are underway to examine the role of early intervention in this population.

Most of the data supporting early intervention that informs current practice are derived from patients who underwent surgical AVR. In the study by Azavedo et al, only about 10% of patients underwent TAVR, which is contrary to TAVR uptake in contemporary clinical practice. In the United States, TAVR volume has surpassed surgical AVR volume in 2019, and TAVR is now the predominant method of intervention. The short-term outcomes of TAVR in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AS are promising, and we eagerly await long-term data in this population. TAVR has permitted the treatment of AS in the elderly with multiple comorbidities, and in these patients, the long-term performance of TAVR on a 10-year scale may have limited relevance compared to that in younger patients. As TAVR is being performed in lower-risk patients, particularly younger patients, it is important to consider the implications of prosthetic valve degeneration, need for repeat intervention, and the ensuing impact on long-term outcomes even beyond 10 years. Continual re-evaluation of the timing of aortic valve intervention is paramount in view of our improving ability to accurately discern prognostically important AS and the greater number of intervention options available.

Decision-making in medicine is often biased toward improving present-day symptoms, and it can be difficult for patients to consider the future over a span of decades. Aortic stenosis, a progressive and indolent disease, needs to be considered in this timescale. Patients may be keen to defer AVR when they are asymptomatic, as they may be hesitant to undergo a procedure with an upfront morbidity cost. Practitioners may want to delay AVR until it is necessary to maximize the longevity of the prosthesis. A shared decision-making process is vital considering the age, lifestyle, and comorbidities of the patient.

### Aortic stenosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^113t7TKR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of aortic stenosis increases with age, affecting up to 10% of the population by the eighth decade. Once symptoms develop, aortic stenosis is rapidly fatal. Proper management requires an understanding of the physiology and criteria used to define disease severity. There is no effective pharmacologic treatment. Surgical aortic valve replacement has been the gold standard treatment for decades. However, over the last 10 years transcatheter aortic valve replacement has emerged as an attractive, less-invasive option for appropriately selected patients. Refinements in valve design and delivery systems have led to widespread use of this breakthrough technology in selected patients. We review the pathophysiology, criteria for valve replacement, and the results of the trials comparing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with surgical aortic valve replacement.

### Pathophysiology, emerging techniques for the assessment and novel treatment of aortic stenosis [^115jYoFw]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our perspectives are shifting from passive monitoring to active management for the assessment and treatment of those with AS. Insight into the two stages of CAS, initiation and propagation, have proven to be invaluable, providing novel management options. Of particular interest is Lp(a), which can play a multifaceted role in genetic screening, biomarker measurement and targeted treatment. Further studies into cellular pathology are warranted to contextualise current research and identify additional biomarkers, increasing the specificity of a multimarker screening approach. In addition to this, asymptomatic management has the potential to be revolutionised through the use of therapeutics to slow disease progression and CMR to guide early valve replacement. Validation of advanced patient stratification and diagnostic workup could propagate the widespread adoption of personalised AS therapy. Although many pharmacotherapies have exhibited potential, an increase in the number of prospective RCTs, with the larger cohort sizes of retrospective studies, is necessary to validate their clinical efficacy in reducing CAS burden.

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uAopi]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The management of severe aortic stenosis mandates consideration of aortic valve intervention for symptomatic patients. However, for asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, recent randomised trials supported earlier intervention. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate all the available data comparing the two management strategies.

Methods

PubMed, Cochrane and Web of Science databases were systematically searched from inception until 10 January 2022. The search key terms were 'asymptomatic', 'severe aortic stenosis' and 'intervention'.

Results

Meta-analysis of two published randomised trials, AVATAR and RECOVERY, included 302 patients and showed that early intervention resulted in 55% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.86; I² = 0%) and 79% reduction in risk of hospitalisation for heart failure (HR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.96; I² = 15%). There was no difference in risk of cardiovascular death between the two groups (HR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.78; I 2 78%). Additionally, meta-analysis of eight observational studies showed improved mortality in patients treated with early intervention (HR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.56; I 2 77%).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis provides evidence that, in patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis, early intervention reduces all-cause mortality and improves outcomes compared with conservative management. While this is very encouraging, further randomised controlled studies are needed to draw firm conclusions and identify the optimal timing of intervention.

### Timing of intervention in asymptomatic patients with valvular heart disease [^114fT1dt]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Current management of valvular heart disease (VHD) seeks to optimize long-term outcome by timely intervention. Recommendations for treatment of patients with symptoms due to severe valvular disease are based on a foundation of solid evidence. However, when to intervene in asymptomatic patients remains controversial and decision requires careful individual weighing of the potential benefits against the risk of intervention and its long-term consequences. The primary rationale for earlier intervention is prevention of irreversible left ventricular (LV) myocardial changes that might result in later clinical symptoms and adverse cardiac events. A number of outcome predictors have been identified that facilitate decision-making. This review summarizes current recommendations and discusses recently published data that challenge them suggesting even earlier intervention. In adults with asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), emerging risk markers include very severe valve obstruction, elevated serum natriuretic peptide levels, and imaging evidence of myocardial fibrosis or increased extracellular myocardial volume. Currently, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is not recommended for treatment of asymptomatic severe AS although this may change in the future. In patients with aortic regurgitation (AR), the potential benefit of early intervention in preventing LV dilation and dysfunction must be balanced against the long-term risk of a prosthetic valve, a particular concern because severe AR often occurs in younger patients with a congenital bicuspid valve. In patients with mitral stenosis, the option of transcatheter mitral balloon valvotomy tilts the balance towards earlier intervention to prevent atrial fibrillation, embolic events, and pulmonary hypertension. When chronic severe mitral regurgitation is due to mitral valve prolapse, anatomic features consistent with a high likelihood of a successful and durable valve repair favour early intervention. The optimal timing of intervention in adults with VHD is a constantly changing threshold that depends not only on the severity of valve disease but also on the safety, efficacy, and long-term durability of our treatment options.

### Patient-and process-related contributors to the underuse of aortic valve replacement and subsequent mortality in ambulatory patients with severe aortic stenosis [^116DJhMH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common cause of valvular heart disease in the Western world and is the most frequent indication for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Current clinical practice guidelines recommend deferring AVR until symptom onset or overt left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Left untreated, 50% of patients with severe AS die within 1 to 2 years of symptom onset. Although potentially lifesaving, past studies have estimated that up to a third of patients with an indication for AVR do not undergo treatment; ultimately, these patients have a higher rate of hospitalization, are intensive users of health care resources, and cost the US Medicare program an estimated ≈$1.3 billion per year, all despite their limited long‐term survival.

Until recently, data on AVR use in patients with severe AS were primarily driven by surgical AVR (SAVR), because this was the sole treatment option for AS. With the advent of transcatheter AVR (TAVR), patients normally ineligible for SAVR because of high mortality risk, advanced age, or comorbid conditions can be eligible for a less‐invasive treatment option for AS with lower procedural morbidity and mortality. Because of this, TAVR was anticipated to improve adherence to guideline‐based use of AVR in patients with symptomatic severe AS. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that a substantial number of patients with symptomatic severe AS still do not undergo AVR.

The evaluation and management of patients with severe AS has become increasingly complex and heavily relies on provider referral upon detection of AS. The presence of discordant imaging measures of AS severity has been previously documented and is estimated to occur in up to 40% of patients with AS. Moreover, the rapid evolution of TAVR devices and procedural techniques mandates an intimate knowledge of the field to inform the difficult risk–benefit analysis that surrounds treatment decisions. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology practice guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease recommend that providers refer patients with severe valvular heart disease to a multidisciplinary heart valve team for further evaluation when intervention is being considered. However, recent data suggest that medically managed patients with an indication for AVR are not consistently referred to a multidisciplinary heart valve team or valve specialist for evaluation. Thus, factors beyond a patient's biology and more inherent to the patient referral process may affect AVR usage rates and, in turn, postprocedural outcomes in patients with severe AS.

Timing of the procedure is also an important step in decision making: Does the patient meet criteria for treatment of the valve? Our current indications for treatment with transcatheter therapies reflect practice patterns when surgery is the only option. With less invasive treatments and increasing options for repeat procedures, the optimal timing of intervention should be questioned. With the introduction of TAVR and the opportunity for valve‐in‐valve TAVR in the treatment of AS, strategy trials are important to better understand whether TAVR may be beneficial earlier in the disease, ie, before symptoms (eg, EARLY TAVR [Evaluation of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Compared to Surveillance for Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis] NCT 03042104], or in symptomatic moderate disease (eg, TAVR UNLOAD [Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Unload the Left Ventricle in Patients With Advanced Heart Failure: A Randomized Trial] NCT 02661451). Similar questions about timing exist for the treatment of mitral and tricuspid valve disease. The technology, however, is at an earlier stage in defining the efficacy of approaches and devices.

### Severe aortic stenosis patient risk during the COVID-19 pandemic [^111b31e6]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive aortic valve disease that can lead to heart failure, syncope and sudden death if not treated. Severe AS currently affects more than 2 million people over 65 years of age in the USA. The only treatment option for AS is valve replacement by either surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) or the less invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), also called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). AVR requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission, whereas TAVR can be performed in a non-ICU setting. Both procedures are commonly associated with complications, such as stroke. Bleeding and thrombosis are also potential complications of these procedures. Given the considerable morbidity and mortality, patients with these postoperative complications are admitted to the ICU for management.

SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has become a pandemic and has caused high mortality rates among the elderly. Currently, there is no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and there is no effective treatment to treat patients with severe COVID-19. More than 730 000 people worldwide and over 160 000 in the USA have died from COVID-19 as of 10 August 2020 according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center; these figures are expected to continue to rise until there are effective vaccines and therapies. Treating patients with COVID-19 during this pandemic requires many medical resources. Importantly, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failures, believed to be due to systemic and pulmonary thrombosis, are common symptoms of severe COVID-19 that require treatment in the ICU. Therefore, government officials have recommended ceasing almost all elective surgeries until the COVID-19 pandemic is under control. Although many patients with symptomatic AS can delay procedures intended to alleviate their symptoms, some may require life-saving procedures. In cases where life-saving procedures (AVR or TAVR) are required, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be an additional and very dangerous comorbidity. Therefore, I suggest that the following points should be considered:

### The 'wait for symptoms' strategy in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^112f4sun]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis is a prevalent and worrisome healthcare problem. The therapeutic approach in asymptomatic aortic stenosis is not well established. We argue that the natural history of this disease is based on old incomplete studies with many limitations. Likewise, studies suggesting that replacement, either surgical or percutaneous, improves prognosis in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis have important drawbacks and do not support this strategy as the treatment of choice. Despite the lack of evidence, some groups recommend early valve replacement in patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis. There are five ongoing randomised trials which will shed light on this topic. Our conclusion is that unless a randomised study changes the evidence, valve replacement cannot be recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis.

Despite numerous promising therapeutic targets, there are no proven medical treatments for calcific aortic stenosis (AS). Multiple stakeholders need to come together and several scientific, operational, and trial design challenges must be addressed to capitalize on the recent and emerging mechanistic insights into this prevalent heart valve disease. This review briefly discusses the pathobiology and most promising pharmacologic targets, screening, diagnosis and progression of AS, identification of subgroups that should be targeted in clinical trials, and the need to elicit the patient voice earlier rather than later in clinical trial design and implementation. Potential trial end points and tools for assessment and approaches to implementation and design of clinical trials are reviewed. The efficiencies and advantages offered by a clinical trial network and platform trial approach are highlighted. The objective is to provide practical guidance that will facilitate a series of trials to identify effective medical therapies for AS resulting in expansion of therapeutic options to complement mechanical solutions for late-stage disease.

### Impact of selected comorbidities on the presentation and management of aortic stenosis [^115171AM]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent native valve disease worldwide, affecting approximately 3.4% of elderly individuals in Europe and the USA. Patients with severe AS who do not undergo timely aortic valve replacement (AVR) face an extremely poor prognosis; this is particularly true following symptom onset, at which point average survival is just 2–3 years. Consequently, rapid, effective management is paramount.

Current European guidelines recommend that AVR be performed in patients with AS that are symptomatic, experience symptoms/hypotension during exercise testing, and/or that have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%. However, despite the ever-growing availability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as a minimally invasive alternative to surgical AVR (SAVR), studies suggest that up to 40% of patients with severe AS still do not receive either of these life-saving interventions. The reason for this appears to be multifactorial, though a high comorbidity burden has been suggested as a key driver. Furthermore, certain comorbidities may have clinical presentations resembling those of AS. To the best of our knowledge, no formal investigations into such effects have been carried out to date.

The aim of this analysis therefore was to assess the impact of comorbidities on disease presentation and management decisions in patients with severe AS.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2018). Medium credibility.

Severe aortic stenosis (AS) appropriate use criteria introduction — transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) use and selection are outlined, including scenarios where no intervention may be reasonable. TAVR is described as ushering in a new era for symptomatic severe AS and providing options for patients with advanced disease and extreme surgical risk when no effective definitive therapy had been available, and it has been shown to be a safe alternative to SAVR in patients for whom surgery is feasible but who are intermediate or high risk. The document emphasizes that selecting patients for TAVR or SAVR and identifying cases where aortic valve replacement (AVR) is futile remains a work in progress, and decision points include when to select TAVR versus SAVR, when surgery is preferable, when balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) is a reasonable diagnostic or treatment option, and when no intervention is reasonable at the extremes of illness. The project was initiated to ensure effective referral for SAVR, TAVR, or conservative management with no intervention and notes the need for timely updates as technology and outcomes evolve.

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^115kAFwT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) — scope and methods — states that TAVR is "currently approved for use in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who are at intermediate to high surgical risk or are inoperable". Since "the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2011, over 50,000 patients have undergone TAVR in the United States alone". The pathway "starts at the point where a patient with severe AS has an indication for AVR and is being considered for TAVR" and "only addresses TAVR for native aortic stenosis; valve-in-valve procedures are not addressed". Echocardiography is assumed completed beforehand — "Echocardiographic assessment of AS severity has been performed before making the decision that AVR is needed. Thus, echocardiography is not discussed in detail in this document". Practical guidance is organized into "4 sections: 1) preprocedure evaluation of the patient being considered for TAVR; 2) imaging modalities and measurements; 3) key issues in performing the TAVR procedure; and 4) recommendations for patient follow-up after TAVR", and it highlights "The central role of the Heart Valve Team in decision-making at each step along the way".

### A call to consider an aortic stenosis screening program [^112CAHBJ]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common age-related valvular condition with a prevalence of 13.1% in patients older than 75 years of age. Based on the severity of AS and symptoms, current guidelines recommend interval monitoring with transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). However, no guidelines exist regarding screening asymptomatic persons for AS. Prevalence of AS is comparable to conditions such as colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and abdominal aortic aneurysm where dedicated screening programs are offered resulting in reduction of overall morbidity and mortality. We review recent advancements in treatment options, and we propose an AS screening program for high-risk individuals without known history of AS including all persons over age 75 and persons aged 70 years and older with dialysis dependent end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

### Pathophysiology, emerging techniques for the assessment and novel treatment of aortic stenosis [^112eooXk]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Current management

AS is detected following a physical examination. The clinical signs include a slow rising pulse, palpable precordial thrill, narrow pulse pressure, ejection-systolic murmur radiating to the carotids, soft second heart second due to valve restriction and a fourth heart sound. Currently, transthoracic echocardiography remains the initial imaging modality to assess valve morphology and haemodynamics. Following diagnosis, patients are stratified based on symptom status, valvular anatomy and haemodynamics. Severe AS is defined by an aortic valve area (AVA) ≤ 1 cm² (or indexed AVA ≤ 0.6 cm²/m²), peak transvalvular velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s, mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mmHg and velocity time integral < 0.25. Severity guides intervention timing, valve replacement being the gold standard in symptomatic patients. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is preferred in high-risk patients over surgery and its indications are expanding.

However, limitations around the timing of intervention arise; the balance between early intervention risk and irreversible cardiac damage is difficult to evaluate within current diagnostic parameters. Compounding this is the lack of robust evidence in treating severe asymptomatic AS. As a result, standard recommendations are passive and suggest watchful waiting. Interpretation of symptom severity is challenging in an elderly, comorbid, sedentary population and the rapid deterioration of symptomatic AS necessitates the need for advanced assessment techniquesCurrent research is ongoing assessing evaluating earlier valve intervention in the asymptomatic patient.

AHA and ESC guidelines currently do not recommend intervention in patients with moderate AS but it can be considered if the patient is undergoing CABG or surgical intervention on the ascending aorta or another valve. Large cohort studies do, however, show that moderate AS is not a benign condition and that these patients have poor survival rates and that AVR in this population group is associated with better outcomes. Further randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are required to guide future recommendations. The PROGRESSand Evolut EXPAND TAVR II Pivotaltrials are aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAVR in moderate AS and the TIAMARand TAVR UNLOADstudies are also investigating intervention in patients with concomitant moderate mitral regurgitation and heart failure, respectively.

### The role of imaging in measuring disease progression and assessing novel therapies in aortic stenosis [^113nJAXL]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis represents a growing health care burden in high-income countries. Currently, the only definitive treatment is surgical or transcatheter valve intervention at the end stages of disease. As the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology evolves, many promising therapies are being investigated. These seek to both slow disease progression in the valve and delay the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure in the myocardium, with the ultimate aim of avoiding the need for valve replacement in the elderly patients afflicted by this condition. Noninvasive imaging has played a pivotal role in enhancing our understanding of the complex pathophysiology underlying aortic stenosis, as well as disease progression in both the valve and myocardium. In this review, the authors discuss the means by which contemporary imaging may be used to assess disease progression and how these approaches may be utilized, both in clinical practice and research trials exploring the clinical efficacy of novel therapies.

### Which patients with aortic stenosis should be referred to surgery rather than transcatheter aortic valve implantation? [^1119kKWy]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has matured into a standard treatment option for patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis (AS) across the whole spectrum of risk. The advances in the interventional treatment of AS raise the question of which patients with severe AS should be referred to surgery. The myriad of clinical permutations does not allow providing a single, uniform treatment strategy. Rather, the advent of TAVI along with established surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) fundamentally enforces the role of the multidisciplinary heart team for decision-making recommending the best individual choice of the two options based on a thorough review of clinical and anatomical factors as well as lifetime management considerations. Involvement of the informed patient expressing treatment preferences is a key for a shared decision-making process. Herein, we provide an in-depth review of evidence informing the decision-making process between TAVI and SAVR and key elements for treatment selection. Special attention is given to the populations that have been excluded from randomized clinical trials, and also lifetime management strategies of patients with severe AS are proposed.

For most patients with severe but asymptomatic aortic stenosis, current guidelines favor a conservative approach, with close surveillance for development of symptoms, an unexplained decline in left ventricular systolic function, or rapid hemodynamic progression. However, recent randomized data have reignited debate, 1, 2 including calls for these guidelines to be revised and for aortic valve replacement to be recommended for all patients with severe aortic stenosis, irrespective of symptoms. 1 Before implementing any change, it is important to carefully review the evidence, particularly that provided by 4 recent randomized clinical trials.

Valvular heart disease — top take-home messages (items 6–10) highlight that "indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation are expanding", and for severe aortic stenosis "the choice of type of intervention… should be a shared decision-making process that considers the lifetime risks and benefits" including valve type and approach. For valvular regurgitation, "indications for intervention… are relief of symptoms and prevention of the irreversible long-term consequences of left ventricular volume overload", and "thresholds for intervention now are lower than they previously were because of more durable treatment options and lower procedural risks". "A mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is of benefit to patients with severely symptomatic primary mitral regurgitation who are at high or prohibitive risk for surgery", and to a select subset with secondary mitral regurgitation despite guideline-directed therapy. Patients with severe symptomatic isolated tricuspid regurgitation "may benefit from surgical intervention" if performed before severe right ventricular dysfunction or end-organ damage. For prosthetic valves, "bioprosthetic valve dysfunction may occur" from leaflet degeneration or thrombosis, and "catheter-based treatment… is reasonable in selected patients" with leaflet degeneration or paravalvular leak without active infection.

### Differences in the presentation and management of patients with severe aortic stenosis in different European centres [^111HhjZi]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) are still diagnosed late and show advanced symptoms at the time of referral. Timely intervention is crucial to improve quality of life and survival. Once symptoms develop, the average survival of patients without appropriate intervention is 2–3 years. The only effective treatment for severe AS is aortic valve replacement (AVR), using either surgical AVR (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines recommend SAVR for patients with symptomatic AS at low surgical risk, and TAVI for those who are at increased operative risk. However, data from the IMPULSE registry, which covers nine European countries, indicate that almost a quarter of patients with symptomatic AS meeting guideline recommendations for AVR do not undergo such treatment.

Despite accepted European guidelines, the practice of cardiovascular medicine differs between European countries. In the case of aortic valve disease, differences in the clinical features of patients undergoing intervention, time to intervention, implanted aortic valve sizes, type of anaesthesia and utilisation of TAVI have been reported. The rate of adoption of TAVI varies between countries, with Germany, as one of the earliest adopters, having the highest rate of usage; by 2015, TAVI accounted for 59% of all aortic valve interventions in Germany compared with 36% in France. The percentage of TAVI-eligible patients who actually receive TAVI also varies, ranging from 36.2% in Germany to 6.4% in Portugal in 2011. Between-country differences in the rates of short-term complications after TAVI, including 30-day mortality, stroke, pacemaker implantation and paravalvular leak, have also been reported.

Further evaluation of differences in the management of patients with severe AS between countries could provide impact for the various healthcare systems and help identify aspects of management that could be improved. To this end, an investigation into the potential differences between Germany, France and the UK with respect to the presentation and management of patients with severe AS was made based on two prospective, multicentre European registries, IMPULSE and IMPULSE enhanced with a virtually identical design.

### Timing of surgery in aortic stenosis [^112qbPmD]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

In adults with valvular stenosis, the importance of prompt aortic valve replacement once symptoms occur is well known. The operative mortality for aortic valve replacement has improved dramatically over the past 4 decades and remains the only effective therapy for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Aortic valve replacement in patients with left ventricular dysfunction has a high operative mortality, although those patients who do not undergo surgery at all have an even worse outcome. While issues to consider include the presence or absence of coronary artery disease and expected hemodynamics of the prosthetic valve compared with the native valve, when in doubt, one should err on the side of surgical intervention. Elderly age is not a contraindication to aortic valve replacement for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, although there is a higher prevalence of comorbid disease and higher operative mortality. Life expectancy is significantly prolonged and quality of life is significantly improved in the elderly who survive surgery. Indications for surgery in asymptomatic patients are controversial. We do not recommend valve replacement in asymptomatic patients at this time due to the known risks of surgery and a prosthetic valve and the lack of evidence for benefit of early surgery. Patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery should be considered for concomitant aortic valve surgery for moderate aortic stenosis that is expected to progress to severe stenosis in less than 5 years.

Contemporary management

The 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease and the 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease both recommend consideration for valvular replacement for moderate AS in patients who are already undergoing open heart surgery (class IIa, level of evidence C for both guidelines). The major rationale for this recommendation is the elevated perioperative risk and potential for damage to bypass grafts (if present) during repeat sternotomy should the moderate AS progress and require operative intervention in the future. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend screening patients with moderate AS with echocardiography every 1–2 years to assess for progression versus the ESC/EACTS guidelines which recommend yearly screening. Currently, guidelines do not recommend stratification of individuals at risk of rapid progression.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) futility — assessment focuses on avoiding procedures without symptomatic or survival benefit. It is appropriate to avoid intervention in patients who will not benefit, and SAVR/TAVR is considered futile with a life expectancy < 1 year despite a successful procedure or a chance of "survival with benefit" < 25% at 2 years; "survival with benefit" means survival with improvement by at least 1 New York Heart Association class or at least 1 Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class, improvement in quality of life, or improvement in life expectancy. If a procedure is considered futile and not recommended, it is important that care plans are put into place to prevent a feeling of abandonment, and input from palliative care specialists is particularly helpful.

### Aortic stenosis in women [^112PRurv]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common valve disorder in an ageing population in western countries, and women, with longer life expectancy, comprise a substantial percentage of elderly patients with AS. Compared with men, women exhibit distinctive characteristics at the level of stenotic valve leaflets and subsequent compensatory responses of the left ventricle to chronic pressure overload, and in clinical presentation, consequences and response to intervention. Randomised controlled trials of transcatheter aortic valve implantation have yielded new evidence of sex differences in both short-term and long-term outcomes after intervention. A comprehensive knowledge of the existing evidence may inform our understanding of gender differences during assessment and treatment of patients with AS. In this paper, we review the available evidence regarding sex differences in AS in terms of symptoms, clinical presentation, anatomical differences and pathophysiological progression, management and outcomes after aortic valve replacement. Implications for further research are suggested.

### Valvular aortic stenosis: disease severity and timing of intervention [^115D2fKw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Standard echocardiographic evaluation of aortic stenosis (AS) severity includes measurement of aortic velocity, mean transaortic pressure gradient, and continuity equation valve area. Although these measures are adequate for decision making in most patients, there is no single value that defines severe stenosis. Aortic stenosis affects not just the valve, but the entire vascular system, including the left ventricle (LV) and systemic vasculature. More sophisticated measures of disease severity might explain the apparent overlap in hemodynamic severity between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and might better predict the optimal timing of valve replacement. There have been several approaches to evaluation of stenosis severity based on valve hemodynamics, the ventricular response to increased afterload, ventricular-vascular coupling, or the systemic functional consequences of valve obstruction, such as exercise testing and serum brain natriuretic peptide levels. Aortic valve replacement is indicated when symptoms due to severe AS are present. In most asymptomatic patients, the risk of surgery is greater than the risk of watchful waiting so that management includes patient education, periodic echocardiography, and cardiac risk factor modification. Many adults with AS have comorbid conditions that affect both the diagnosis and management of the valve disease, including aortic regurgitation, aortic root dilation, hypertension, coronary artery disease, LV dysfunction, and atrial fibrillation. Comorbid conditions should be evaluated and treated based on established guidelines, although awareness of the potential effects of therapy in the presence of valve obstruction is needed.

### Calcific aortic stenosis: a disease of the valve and the myocardium [^1128k7Gw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Although aortic stenosis is a common condition associated with major morbidity, mortality, and health economic costs, there are currently no medical interventions capable of delaying or halting its progression. Re-evaluation of the underlying pathophysiology is therefore required so that novel therapeutic strategies can be developed. Aortic stenosis is characterized by progressive aortic valve narrowing and secondary left ventricular hypertrophy. Both processes are important because in combination they drive the development of symptoms and adverse events that characterize the latter stages of the disease. In this review, the authors examine the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis with respect to both the valve and the myocardium. In particular, the authors focus on the role of inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification in progressive valve narrowing and then examine the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, its subsequent decompensation, and the transition to heart failure. Finally the authors discuss potential therapeutic strategies on the basis of similarities aortic stenosis shares with other pathological conditions.

### Early intervention vs conservative management in severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis: a critical review of randomized evidence [^114LGnNi]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive disease that may remain asymptomatic despite underlying myocardial damage. Management of asymptomatic severe AS remains controversial, especially in the current era of safer surgical and transcatheter valve replacement. This critical review examines 4 randomized controlled trials-AVATAR (Aortic Valve Replacement Vs Conservative Treatment in Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis), RECOVERY (Randomized Comparison of Early Surgery vs Conventional Treatment in Very Severe Aortic Stenosis), EARLY TAVR (Evaluation of TAVR Compared to Surveillance for Patients with Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis), and EVOLVED (Early Valve Replacement Guided by Biomarkers of Left Ventricular Decompensation in Asymptomatic Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis)-comparing early aortic valve replacement with conservative management. While early intervention reduces composite endpoints involving heart failure hospitalization, individual trials have not demonstrated consistent mortality or stroke benefits. Importantly, sudden cardiac death was rare across all trials, and close surveillance appeared to be a key determinant of outcomes in the conservative arms. Differences in surveillance intensity, trial populations, and valve types limit pooled interpretations. Current evidence supports a tailored approach: conservative management is reasonable when reliable follow-up can be ensured, while early aortic valve replacement may benefit selected patients. Ongoing trials will help clarify long-term outcomes, optimal timing, and risk stratification strategies in asymptomatic AS.
