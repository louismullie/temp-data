## Question

what labs should be ordered in patient with suspect urticarial vasculitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what laboratory tests should be ordered in a patient with suspected urticarial vasculitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical suspicion and when to biopsy. Then, I should verify the core laboratory workup that distinguishes normocomplementemic from hypocomplementemic disease. Next, I will consider targeted tests for autoimmune associations, infections, and hematologic mimics. After that, I need to check organ-specific assessments for systemic involvement. Finally, I will integrate results into a practical algorithm and highlight pitfalls and special populations, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical suspicion before ordering labs. Urticarial vasculitis presents with wheals that persist beyond 24 hours, are often burning or painful, and may leave bruising or hyperpigmentation; importantly, lesions can occasionally be evanescent, so I should not exclude UV solely because individual wheals last less than 24 hours, and I should maintain a low threshold to biopsy when the story fits or when antihistamine-refractory urticaria persists [^b6324fb5] [^ad249b52] [^e0a36cab].

> Wait, let me verify the histopathologic confirmation step because management hinges on it. A lesional skin biopsy demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis and neutrophil-rich infiltrate is the diagnostic gold standard; if the first biopsy is nondiagnostic, I should consider repeating it on a fresh lesion within 24 hours, as older lesions may lose vasculitic features and show nonspecific lymphocytic or eosinophilic infiltrates instead [^f39263d2] [^cbb9b6ea] [^6c8d3677].

> Next, I should review the core laboratory panel that stratifies disease subtype. I need to check C3, C4, and C1q to distinguish normocomplementemic UV from hypocomplementemic UV or HUVS; low C3/C4 and especially low C1q with or without anti-C1q antibodies point to HUV, which carries higher risks of systemic involvement and guides escalation of therapy and surveillance [^9072ea56] [^3f8e85cd] [^d318e450].

> Hold on, I should verify the inflammatory markers and basic hematologic profile. ESR and/or CRP are typically elevated in UV and help track disease activity; a CBC with differential can reveal leukocytosis or anemia, which are not diagnostic but support an inflammatory process and inform baseline risk before immunosuppression [^8a8b2a5a] [^0c9da264].

> I will now examine autoimmune serologies because HUV overlaps with connective tissue disease. ANA with a reflex ENA panel (SSA/SSB, RNP, Sm, Scl-70, Jo-1) should be ordered to screen for SLE and Sjögren syndrome; anti-dsDNA and anti-ENA are less common in isolated UV but can be present in SLE-associated cases, so I need to interpret results in clinical context and avoid overcalling lupus without meeting classification criteria [^a69f18f5] [^d318e450] [^6c8d3677].

> But wait, what if the complement profile is low and I suspect HUVS? I should double-check for anti-C1q antibodies when available, as they are present in roughly half of HUV cases and correlate with disease severity; if unavailable, persistently low C1q with low C3/C4 and compatible clinical features still supports the diagnosis and warrants closer systemic screening [^d318e450] [^3f8e85cd].

> Next, I should review infectious and hematologic mimics that can drive immune complex vasculitis. Hepatitis B and C serologies are indicated because chronic viral hepatitis can precipitate UV; cryoglobulins should be considered if there is a suggestive history or positive hepatitis C, and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation helps exclude monoclonal gammopathies such as MGUS or Schnitzler syndrome, which can mimic UV clinically but have different histology and treatment implications [^b5606181] [^e2782afd] [^a686ac68].

> I need to ensure I assess for systemic organ involvement, especially in hypocomplementemic disease. Urinalysis with microscopy is essential to screen for hematuria and proteinuria suggesting glomerulonephritis; if abnormal, I should quantify proteinuria and consider early nephrology referral, as renal disease in HUV can be severe and relapsing, and early recognition changes outcomes [^4603140a] [^32e17fa9].

> Let me consider pulmonary and ocular systems next. A chest radiograph is reasonable if there are respiratory symptoms or suspected HUV, given the risk of obstructive lung disease; ocular symptoms should prompt slit-lamp examination for episcleritis or uveitis, which are more frequent in HUV and can be sight-threatening if missed [^d318e450] [^9072ea56].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-ordering low-yield tests. Routine thyroid autoantibodies, stool ova and parasites, or broad autoantibody panels are not recommended in the absence of suggestive features; targeted testing based on history and exam avoids unnecessary costs and rarely changes management in typical urticaria presentations, reinforcing the principle of selective, not extensive, testing in UV as well [^a69f18f5] [^5237ae33] [^ca944dea].

> Let me integrate this into a practical algorithm. If clinical suspicion for UV is moderate to high, I should obtain C3, C4, C1q, ESR/CRP, CBC with differential, ANA with reflex ENA, urinalysis, and hepatitis B/C serologies; if complement is low or systemic symptoms are present, I should add anti-C1q, cryoglobulins, and consider chest imaging and organ-specific assessments, while proceeding to biopsy to confirm vasculitis and guide therapy escalation [^8a8b2a5a] [^f39263d2] [^d318e450].

> I should double-check special populations and mimics. In children, the same principles apply, but I must also consider IgA vasculitis and autoinflammatory syndromes; in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors, drug-induced UV is increasingly recognized, so medication reconciliation and temporal correlation are critical, and management may require multidisciplinary input and consideration of biologics such as rituximab or IL-1 blockade in refractory cases [^6a5939f7] [^4c3b85f8] [^39e9d9e4].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and reassessment are built into the plan. Repeat complement levels and inflammatory markers can track response, and periodic urinalysis is prudent in HUV to detect silent renal flares; if the clinical course deviates from expectations or new organ symptoms arise, I should broaden the workup accordingly and reconsider the differential, including autoinflammatory diseases and other vasculitides [^4603140a] [^3f8e85cd].

For suspected urticarial vasculitis, order **CBC, ESR/CRP, liver enzymes, and urinalysis** as the initial screen [^ebed08bf] [^8a8b2a5a]. Add **C3, C4, C1q, and ANA with anti-dsDNA** to assess complement and autoimmune associations, and include **hepatitis B/C serologies and HIV testing** when risk factors are present [^b5606181] [^39e9d9e4]. If systemic involvement is suspected, obtain **creatinine/eGFR, chest radiograph, and pulmonary function tests** [^42f2a8ce]. Reserve **skin biopsy** for lesions persisting > 24 hours or with atypical features to confirm leukocytoclastic vasculitis [^f39263d2] [^e0a36cab]. Tailor additional tests (e.g. cryoglobulins, ANCA, SPEP) to clinical suspicion and abnormal results [^ebed08bf].

---

## Initial laboratory screening

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Evaluate for anemia, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and thrombocytopenia, which may indicate systemic involvement or an underlying autoimmune process [^ebed08bf].

- **Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Assess systemic inflammation; elevated levels are common in urticarial vasculitis [^1392abf2].

- **Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP)**: Screen for hepatic involvement or drug-induced liver injury [^ebed08bf].

- **Urinalysis**: Detect proteinuria, hematuria, or casts, indicating renal involvement, particularly in hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUVS) [^4603140a].

---

## Complement studies

Complement studies are essential to distinguish **normocomplementemic from hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis** and to guide management [^3f8e85cd]. Order **C3, C4, and C1q** to identify hypocomplementemia, which is associated with systemic involvement and worse prognosis [^d318e450]. Consider **CH50** to assess the overall complement activity, particularly when HUVS is suspected [^8a8b2a5a].

---

## Autoimmune serology

Autoimmune serology helps identify **underlying autoimmune diseases** associated with urticarial vasculitis:

- **Antinuclear antibody (ANA)**: Screen for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other connective tissue diseases [^a69f18f5].

- **Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA)**: Specific for SLE, often positive in HUVS [^notfound].

- **Extractable nuclear antigens (ENA)**: Evaluate for Sjögren's syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, and other autoimmune conditions [^notfound].

- **Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP)**: Assess for rheumatoid arthritis, which can coexist with urticarial vasculitis [^ebed08bf].

---

## Infectious disease screening

Infectious diseases can trigger or mimic urticarial vasculitis; screen based on **risk factors and clinical suspicion**:

- **Hepatitis B and C serologies**: Chronic hepatitis B or C infections are associated with urticarial vasculitis [^b5606181].

- **HIV testing**: Consider in patients with risk factors or systemic symptoms [^notfound].

- **Cryoglobulins**: Test if hepatitis C is suspected or if there is a history of cold exposure with purpura [^ebed08bf].

---

## Additional laboratory tests based on clinical suspicion

Additional tests should be guided by **clinical context and abnormal findings**:

| **Clinical suspicion** | **Recommended tests** |
|-|-|
| Systemic involvement (e.g. renal, pulmonary) | - Creatinine <br/> - eGFR <br/> - Chest radiograph <br/> - Pulmonary function tests [^42f2a8ce] [^4603140a] |
| Monoclonal gammopathy or hematologic malignancy | - Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) <br/> - Immunofixation <br/> - Free light chains [^a686ac68] |
| ANCA-associated vasculitis | - ANCA (MPO and PR3) [^notfound] |
| Autoinflammatory syndromes | - Genetic testing for cryopyrinopathies (e.g. NLRP3) [^901d2dfc] |

---

## Role of skin biopsy

Skin biopsy is the **gold standard** for confirming urticarial vasculitis. Indications include lesions persisting > 24 hours, burning or painful wheals, or atypical features. Histopathology typically shows **leukocytoclastic vasculitis** with fibrinoid necrosis and neutrophil-rich infiltrates; direct immunofluorescence may reveal immunoglobulin and complement deposition [^f39263d2] [^3f8e85cd].

---

## Summary of recommended laboratory tests

| **Test category** | **Recommended tests** |
|-|-|
| Initial screening | - CBC with differential <br/> - ESR/CRP <br/> - Liver enzymes <br/> - Urinalysis [^ebed08bf] |
| Complement studies | - C3 <br/> - C4 <br/> - C1q <br/> - CH50 (if indicated) [^9072ea56] |
| Autoimmune serology | - ANA <br/> - Anti-dsDNA <br/> - ENA <br/> - RF <br/> - Anti-CCP [^ebed08bf] |
| Infectious screening | - Hepatitis B/C serologies <br/> - HIV testing <br/> - Cryoglobulins (if indicated) [^b5606181] |
| Additional tests | - Creatinine/eGFR <br/> - Chest radiograph <br/> - Pulmonary function tests <br/> - SPEP <br/> - Immunofixation <br/> - ANCA <br/> - Genetic testing (if indicated) [^8a8b2a5a] [^a686ac68] |
| Confirmatory test | Skin biopsy (lesional) [^f39263d2] |

---

Laboratory evaluation for suspected urticarial vasculitis should be **comprehensive yet targeted**, focusing on confirming the diagnosis, assessing disease severity, and identifying underlying causes. Initial screening with CBC, ESR/CRP, liver enzymes, and urinalysis is essential, followed by complement studies, autoimmune serology, and infectious screening as indicated. Skin biopsy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.

Chronic urticaria (CU) diagnosis and management algorithm — patients with a history suggestive of chronic urticaria and/or angioedema are first assessed for angioedema; if present, "Consider medications, C1INH syndromes, or conditions that mimic angioedema". If not and the "history, review of systems, and physical examination" are not consistent, "Consider alternative diagnoses (see Differential Diagnosis Section)". When the history suggests a physical component, "Does the history suggest physical urticaria? Is there a physical component to the urticaria and/or" and the action is to "Consider appropriate challenge testing for physical urticaria". If vasculitis is suggested, "If skin biopsy diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis. If biopsy negative go to box 10". If "history, physical examination, and/or basic laboratory tests" indicate an underlying cause, "Evaluate and manage specific conditions", otherwise proceed with "Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema" and ensure "Periodic reassessment for underlying etiology and response to therapy".

Is it necessary to perform extensive diagnostic studies by complementary testing in all patients with CSU?

The indiscriminate search for underlying causes that may include an extensive battery of tests is discouraged – due to low cost-effectiveness. A careful and detailed medical history and physical examination are essential. Patient-oriented questions are helpful to establish the type of chronic urticaria and to define baseline laboratory studies and/or other complementary tests tailored to the individual patient (Table 2). In most cases, there is no need to order an extensive work-up unless data from the clinical history suggest an underlying disease. Table 3 lists the essential tests that should be performed.

Recommended data to obtain from the patient's medical history

Key point: Unless suggested by the clinical history, there is no need to perform extensive tests when examining a CSU patient.

What is the differential diagnosis to be established for a patient with CSU?

Apart from urticaria vasculitis for which diagnosis is made through biopsy, It can be difficult to differentiate hives from other dermatoses (Table 4). However, the natural course differs in these pathologies. Erythema multiform clears on its own within a maximum of 3 weeks; it is included in the differential diagnosis because of its severity and should always be ruled out at the onset of symptoms, when it can resemble chronic urticaria. Autoinflammatory syndromes have symptoms that may be confused with chronic urticaria, but they are rare, and although skin rashes are always associated with systemic symptoms, itching is not as striking a feature as it is in the case of chronic urticaria. Certain systemic diseases are associated with urticaria-like lesions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Schnitzler syndrome (IgM monoclonal gammopathy, urticaria, fever, lymphadenopathy and weight loss), mastocytosis and hypereosinophilic syndromes.

Table 4
Differential diagnosis of chronic urticaria

Key point: Chronic urticaria differs from other dermatosis on its duration, the evanescence of lesions and intense itching.

Conclusions and Outlook

Urticarial vasculitis treatment continues to be a challenge with no licensed medications available. The proposed algorithm is an attempt to assist treating physicians in selecting an appropriate therapy for patients with UV. The development of a guideline for the management of UV based on an international expert consensus, supported by the international network of Urticaria Centers of Reference and Excellence (UCARE), represents the next step towards establishing a standardized therapy algorithm. In this context, there is a need for standardized patient-reported outcomes, including the validation of the UVAS. Furthermore, the pathomechanisms of the disease, including disease endotypes and corresponding biomarkers, as well as possible coexistence with CSU, must be further investigated. This will provide indications for new therapeutic options to be developed, including disease-modifying therapies. Prospective studies with current and novel drugs are needed and could provide further insights into UV pathogenesis and treatment.

### Managing urticarial vasculitis: a clinical decision-making algorithm based on expert consensus [^b0bbc9d4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This review has several limitations. First, this is not a systematic review, and some studies were not included. Second, the proposed algorithm is based on the expert opinion of the coauthors of this review and available literature, primarily case reports and case series. Furthermore, few publications specified the treatment of children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and other vulnerable patients. The treatment algorithm should be adjusted to meet the needs of these populations. Last, drug combinations were used in many studies, making the identification of individual drug efficacy difficult.

### The diagnostic workup in chronic spontaneous urticaria-what to test and why [^212061d7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), the guidelines recommend very limited diagnostic procedures during the routine workup, although additional investigations might be indicated in some patients with CSU. For physicians treating patients with CSU, it is often difficult to decide which diagnostic tests are useful.

Objective

To provide recommendations on what diagnostic tests should be performed on which patients with CSU.

Methods

We performed an extensive literature search on the respective topics and identified relevant questions that should prompt diagnostic procedures based on the published evidence and expert consensus among all authors.

Results

We provide questions, diagnostic testing, where appropriate, and recommendation that should be included when assessing the history of a patient with CSU, to explore and rule out differential diagnoses, to assess patients for underlying causes and modifying conditions, to explore patients for comorbid diseases and consequences of having CSU, and to assess patients for CSU components that can help to predict their disease course and response to treatment.

Conclusions

Here, we provide physicians treating patients with CSU with information about which clues should lead to which tests and why.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^15894632]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) and angioedema — diagnostic algorithm (Fig 3) — defines CU when episodes persist for greater than 6 weeks, and individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours. In 40% to 50% of patients with urticaria, angioedema will also be a part of the spectrum, and when angioedema occurs alone it can last for greater than 24 hours and be nonpruritic. If urticaria/angioedema is exclusively or primarily triggered by an external physical trigger, the work-up should proceed to Box 6; if only partially triggered by physical factors or not at all, the work-up should progress to Box 10. For suspected physical urticaria or angioedema, physical challenge procedures can be used to confirm the diagnosis, and if confirmed by challenge testing the condition should be managed with a combination of avoidance measures. If urticarial vasculitis is suspected — lesions often persist for greater than 24 to 48 hours — a biopsy is important for confirming the diagnosis; if the skin biopsy is diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis, and if negative, proceed to Box 10. In evaluating angioedema, for a patient taking an ACE inhibitor, drug discontinuation and replacement with an equally efficacious alternative agent should be considered.

Chronic urticaria (CU) and isolated angioedema — evaluation and testing guidance: Patients with recurrent angioedema without urticaria "should be evaluated for hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor–associated angioedema before a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema is made". For CU, "Skin biopsy can be performed in patients with refractory CU and should be performed when vasculitis is suspected or when other nonurticarial immunologic skin diseases are a consideration", whereas "Routine skin biopsies are not required in most cases of CU". Allergy testing is limited: "Immediate hypersensitivity skin or serologic testing for food or other allergens is rarely useful and not recommended on a routine basis".

Chronic urticarial vasculitis — clinical features and diagnosis: Summary Statement 17 (B) notes chronic urticarial vasculitis with low or normal complement levels can be primary or secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and urticarial vasculitis lesions usually last longer than 24 hours and leave residual marks; diagnosis should be confirmed by a biopsy demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^a69f18f5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — associated conditions and selective testing note that numerous autoimmune disorders, including SLE, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, Sjogren syndrome, and Still disease, have been associated with CU; however, serology to diagnose these underlying autoimmune diseases is not warranted in the initial evaluation of CU in the absence of additional features suggestive of a concomitant autoimmune disease. Thyroid autoantibodies are frequently identified in patients with CU, but because the clinical relevance of these autoantibodies has not been established, routine testing for thyroid autoantibodies is not recommended. Chronic urticarial vasculitis associated with low or normal complement levels might present as a primary autoimmune disorder or develop secondary to an autoimmune disorder, such as SLE; urticarial vasculitic lesions might sometimes be evanescent, lasting less than 24 hours, so cutaneous vasculitis cannot be completely excluded based on the history of lesions spanning less than 24 hours, and the diagnosis should be confirmed by a biopsy demonstrating the presence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The co-occurrence of CU with H pylori infection and celiac disease has been reported; however, evidence does not support testing for these conditions in a patient with CU with an otherwise unremarkable history and physical examination, and there are no convincing data demonstrating that treatment based on abnormal test results leads to improvement or change in the course of CU.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^cbb9b6ea]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis and hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUVS) — patients with HUVS must present with urticaria, angioedema, or both for at least 6 months and hypocomplementemia, and urticaria is characterized by burning, pruritus, and longer duration (each hive can last 3 days) with possible hyperpigmentation on resolution. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis is seen on biopsy, and immunofluorescence can reveal deposits of immunoglobulins, complement, and/or fibrin mostly in the dermal–epidermal junction; if clinical suspicion is consistent with cutaneous vasculitis and the biopsy result is negative, a repeat biopsy would merit consideration, and biopsy for direct immunofluorescence is preferably performed in lesions within 24 hours because loss of staining has been seen starting in less than 48 hours. Laboratory evaluation should include C1q, C4, and C3 measurement. Antihistamines can be used to manage pruritus but have no substantial effect on the vasculitic process; the dose of prednisone is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/d for at least 1 week and then tapered slowly, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, and dapsone have been used in case reports for management of UV, pentoxifylline (1200 mg/d) can be beneficial to enhance the effect of dapsone, patients with hepatitis A, B, or C and HIV might benefit from the use of IFN-α used with or without ribavirin, and for refractory disease azathioprine with prednisone (with antecedent testing for thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency) can be used; other therapies, such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and methotrexate, have been used for severe cases.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^c5caa605]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — biopsy and evaluation — Although skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases, it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders, and biopsy is rarely indicated when lesions are typical of urticaria with duration < 24 hours without bruising or purpura; biopsy might be indicated when mastocytosis or urticarial vasculitis is suspected. Most often acute urticaria is self-limiting and resolves in less than 6 weeks, and extensive evaluation for causes not suggested by history or examination is not cost-effective and has not been associated with improved outcomes.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^86be5f93]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Annotation 10 — History, physical examination, and basic laboratory tests in chronic urticaria: For patients with chronic urticaria (CU), history taking and physical examination should be performed, and consensus recommendations favor performance of limited laboratory testing to confirm or rule out an underlying condition, although no testing might also be appropriate based on patient circumstances; an extensive laboratory work-up, including skin testing to inhalants and foods, is of limited use and not recommended. If a physical urticaria/angioedema condition is suspected, this can be evaluated further with specific challenge tests, and the evaluation of physical urticarias might include some laboratory evaluation such as measurement for cryoglobulins in patients with cold urticaria. There is no correlation between the number of screening laboratory tests done and detection of an underlying diagnosis in patients whose presentation is consistent with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), and autoantibody-associated urticaria should be considered a subset of CIU.

Management of patients with UV is often challenging for treating physicians. Its etiology varies widely between patients, with up to 30% of patients with UV having an underlying disease including SLE, cancer, and chronic infection. The pathogenesis of UV is not yet fully understood and remains a subject of academic discussion. If identified, triggers such as drugs should be avoided, and known comorbidities should be treated to improve UV symptoms. Because of unpredictable symptom occurrence and extracutaneous involvement, topical therapy is rarely effective. Oral antihistamines seldom suffice to manage symptoms effectively, especially in patients with systemic manifestations of UV. Such patients often respond well to systemic glucocorticosteroids (SGC) but frequently relapse when doses are tapered or treatment is discontinued. Many patients require three or more different drugs in combination or subsequently to manage their illness. So far, guidelines and treatment algorithms to help with the management of UV do not exist. In this review, we describe the evidence on different systemic treatments used for UV with the focus on clinical aspects, and we propose a clinical decision-making algorithm for its management.

### Laboratory tests and identified diagnoses in patients with physical and chronic urticaria and angioedema: a systematic review [^07d9ef50]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The value of laboratory tests in chronic urticaria is still controversial.

Objective

Our aim was to assess this value in clinical studies, and to identify factors explaining the variation in the number of identified causes.

Methods

A total of 4 electronic databases were searched, and a manual literature search was performed. Only unselected patient series with more than 50 adult patients were included. From each included study predefined items were recorded to assess their quality (consecutive patients, use of standardized diagnostic criteria) and validity (follow-up, assessment of treatment effects, level of evidence).

Results

A total of 29 studies were included, involving 6462 patients. The verification of the validity of the results and the level of evidence of the included studies were limited.

Conclusion

No relationship between the number of identified diagnoses and the number of performed laboratory tests, the different settings, the study design, or the publication period was found. On the basis of this systematic review and the relevant literature, a clinical guideline in the form of a flowchart is presented.

Introduction

Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis presenting with recurrent long-lasting wheals. UV is rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.5 cases per 100,000 person-years. UV is classified into two variants: normocomplementemic (NUV) and hypocomplementemic (HUV). HUV is severe, difficult to treat, often linked to an underlying disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and with systemic symptoms such as fever and arthralgia, whereas NUV is more common and usually limited to the skin. Most UV cases are chronic (> 6 weeks), with a median disease duration of 1.5–4.0 years. Most patients with UV report a considerable decrease in quality of life, which is associated with a long disease duration, high symptom burden, and high need for therapy. Disease-specific patient-reported outcome measurements to assess disease control and impact are not yet available. Urticarial vasculitis activity can be measured with the Urticarial Vasculitis Activity Score (UVAS, Table 1), which assesses five key symptoms of UV: wheals, burning or pruritus, residual skin pigmentation, joint pain, and general symptoms such as fatigue or fever.

Table 1
Urticarial Vasculitis Activity Score (UVAS). Please rate the severity of the following symptoms on a scale from 0 to 10 over the last 24 h

The UVAS was formerly developed as a modification of an instrument previously validated for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome; however, it has not been validated yet to assess UV severity. To calculate daily UVAS, the severity of the five key symptoms is assessed based on their occurrence over the past 24 hours on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 meaning a symptom did not occur and 10 being the strongest possible presentation of a symptom). The individual scores are added and divided by 5 to yield a UVAS score between 0 and 10. To calculate UVAS7, the sum of daily UVAS scores of 7 consecutive days should be taken with the total score range between 0 and 70

### Urticarial vasculitis [^0c9da264]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis is a clinico-pathologic entity typified by recurrent episodes of urticaria that have the histopathologic features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The cutaneous features may include painful, burning or pruritic skin lesions, the persistence of individual lesions greater than 24 hours, palpable purpura, pronounced central clearing of lesions, and residual hyperpigmentation following resolution. However, because clinical characteristics of urticarial vasculitis may overlap with those of allergic urticaria, confirmation of the diagnosis requires a lesional skin biopsy. This condition is idiopathic in many patients but can also occur in the context of autoimmune disorders, infections, drug reactions, or as a paraneoplastic syndrome. In idiopathic urticarial vasculitis common laboratory findings are an elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and reduction of serum complement. An association between urticarial vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus has been hypothesized as some clinical manifestations of disease overlap and C1q autoantibodies may be present in both diseases. Normo-complementemic patients usually have minimal or no systemic involvement and often have a better prognosis. On-the-other-hand, hypocomplementemic patients have the propensity to have more severe multi-organ involvement. Response to treatment is variable and a wide variety of therapeutic agents may be efficacious. Initial recommendations for treatment of urticarial vasculitis manifest only as non-necrotizing skin lesions include antihistamines, dapsone, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine or indomethacin, but corticosteroids are often required. With necrotizing skin lesions or visceral involvement, corticosteroids are regularly indicated. Cases of severe corticosteroid resistant urticarial vasculitis or where corticosteroid morbidity is evident [table: see text] may require treatment with other immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine.

### Urticarial lesions: if not urticaria, what else? The differential diagnosis of urticaria: part II. systemic diseases [^0fedcbb5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

There are a number of systemic disorders that can manifest with urticarial skin lesions, including urticarial vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, hematologic diseases, and autoinflammatory syndromes. All of these conditions may enter into the differential diagnosis of ordinary urticaria. In contrast to urticaria, urticarial syndromes may manifest with skin lesions other than wheals, such as papules, necrosis, vesicles, and hemorrhages. Lesions may have a bilateral and symmetrical distribution; individual lesions have a long duration, and their resolution frequently leaves marks, such as hyperpigmentation or bruising. Moreover, systemic symptoms, such as fever, asthenia, and arthralgia, may be present. The most important differential diagnosis in this group is urticarial vasculitis, which is a small-vessel vasculitis with predominant cutaneous involvement. Systemic involvement in urticarial vasculitis affects multiple organs (mainly joints, the lungs, and the kidneys) and is more frequent and more severe in patients with hypocomplementemia. Clinicopathologic correlation is essential to establishing a correct diagnosis.

Learning Objectives

After completing the learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish urticarial lesions suggesting diagnoses other than common urticaria; assess patients with urticarial lesions, and suspect systemic diseases presenting with urticarial skin lesions.

Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIg)

Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) exhibit immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties and have been effectively utilized in several cutaneous autoimmune diseases including SLE, dermatomyositis, pemphigus, and chronic urticaria. However, the strength of evidence supporting the use of IVIgs in treating UV is limited. IVIgs were effective at doses of 1–2 g/kg administered every 4 weeks in four case reports involving patients with UV aged between 4 and 76 years. This cohort included two patients with HUV and one patient with HUVS, all of whom achieved full clinical remission (Table 15 of the ESM).

In summary, SGC should be considered in moderate-to-severe cases of UV with pronounced systemic manifestations. However, long-term use should be avoided, particularly in vulnerable patient populations, such as older patients with comorbidities. The dosage should be tapered as soon as possible to mitigate long-term adverse effects, though this may not always be possible, especially in refractory UV cases. Other immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies may serve as SGC-sparing agents and can be beneficial for patients with UV with multi-organ involvement and underlying rheumatic diseases, such as SLE. Nonetheless, similarly to SGCs, these therapies can have potentially severe side effects, necessitating a careful evaluation of the risk–benefit ratio and close monitoring of both clinical and laboratory parameters.

### Managing urticarial vasculitis: a clinical decision-making algorithm based on expert consensus [^cbc210a9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a rare and difficult-to-treat, small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis presenting with recurrent long-lasting wheals. So far, no guidelines and treatment algorithms exist that could help clinicians with the management of UV. In this review, we describe evidence on systemic treatments used for UV and propose a clinical decision-making algorithm for UV management based on the Urticarial Vasculitis Activity Score assessed for 7 days (UVAS7). Patients with occasional UV-like urticarial lesions and patients with UV with skin-limited manifestations and/or mild arthralgia/malaise (total UVAS7 ≤ 7 of 70) can be initially treated using the step-wise algorithm for chronic urticaria including second-generation H1-antihistamines, omalizumab, and cyclosporine A. Patients with UV with more severe symptoms (UVAS7 > 7), especially those with hypocomplementemic UV, may require a multidisciplinary approach, particularly if underlying diseases, for example, systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer, or infection, are present. Immunomodulatory therapy is based on clinical signs and symptoms, and the drug availability and safety profile, and includes systemic corticosteroids, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine, anti-interleukin-1 agents, and other therapies. The level of evidence for all UV treatments is low. Prospective studies with current and novel drugs are needed and could provide further insights into UV pathogenesis and treatment.

Discussion

Urticarial vasculitis is believed to be a type III hypersensitivity reaction mediated by immune complex deposition of C3 and immunoglobulins in the postcapillary venules. Antibody-triggered release of C3a and C5a leads causes chemotaxis of neutrophils and eosinophils. Concurrent activation of mast cells further contributes to the generation of angioedema and urticarial lesions characteristic of urticarial vasculitis. The underlying pathogenesis is reflected in histopathologic findings, which often include damaged dermal blood vessels, neutrophil karyorrhexis, extravasation of erythrocytes into the dermis, and an inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes.

The severity of urticarial vasculitis can vary, ranging from mild skin symptoms to systemic involvement requiring immunosuppressive therapy. The degree of complement consumption dictates the disease severity. In skin-limited cases, complement levels typically remain within the normal range. Contrarily, hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis is associated with a poorer prognosis and may present with various systemic symptoms, such as renal, lung, and gastrointestinal involvement. Pulmonary involvement in systemic cases is the leading cause of death for urticarial vasculitis; thus pulmonary function testing is indicated for symptomatic patients. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cooccur with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, and there is a high degree of symptom overlap between the 2 conditions. Therefore, when evaluating a patient for urticarial vasculitis, the initial workup should include complement levels and antinuclear antibodies, in addition to a complete blood count and basic chemistries.

### Mimickers of urticaria: urticarial vasculitis and autoinflammatory diseases [^a686ac68]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

A wide differential diagnosis must be considered in a patient presenting with urticarial plaques. Although acute and chronic urticaria are the commonest diagnoses, other differential diagnoses include polymorphous eruption of pregnancy, mast cell disorders, hypereosinophilic syndrome, urticarial vasculitis, pemphigoid, systemic lupus erythematosus, and autoinflammatory disease. This review will specifically address urticarial vasculitis and autoinflammatory syndromes. These entities represent contrasting examples of urticarial-like lesions resulting from either an adaptive immune complex-mediated mechanism (urticarial vasculitis) or an innate immune-mediated mechanism (autoinflammatory disorders), with differing therapeutic implications. In patients presenting with painful, persistent plaques that last more than 24 hours and resolve with bruising of the skin, consideration should be given to a diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis. A biopsy should be obtained to ascertain this diagnosis. In patients presenting with a persistent history of recurrent urticarial plaques associated with signs of systemic inflammation including fevers and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP]/serum amyloid A, leukocytosis, and negative connective tissue serologies), consideration should be given to autoinflammatory disorders: the 3 cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, Schnitzler syndrome, and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 2. Serum protein electrophoresis should be checked to rule out an underlying monoclonal gammopathy.

### Practical algorithm for diagnosing patients with recurrent wheals or angioedema [^6453ffed]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic urticaria is a common disorder characterized by recurrent wheals, angioedema, or both. Several differential diagnoses need to be considered in patients presenting with wheals and/or angioedema. These include rare diseases such as autoinflammatory syndromes and urticarial vasculitis in patients with recurrent wheals and bradykinin-mediated angioedema in patients with recurrent swellings. AIM AND RESULT: In order to not miss these conditions, we have developed a symptom-based diagnostic algorithm for the management of patients with wheals and/or angioedema.

Discussion and Conclusion

By asking the right questions and performing a limited diagnostic workup as suggested here, this algorithm may help to establish the right diagnosis and treat patients early and more effectively.

Chronic urticaria (CU) laboratory testing — After a thorough history and physical examination, no further diagnostic testing might be appropriate; however, limited routine laboratory testing can be performed to exclude underlying causes, with targeted testing based on clinical suspicion. Extensive routine testing for exogenous and rare causes of CU or immediate hypersensitivity skin testing for inhalants or foods is not warranted, and routine laboratory testing in patients with CU whose history and physical examination lack atypical features rarely yields clinically significant findings (C). Extensive testing uncovered an otherwise undiscovered specific underlying disease process in 1.6% of cases of CU, and a more recent study found that although 17% of laboratory tests performed in 356 patients with CU were abnormal and 8.4% of patients underwent additional testing, only 1 patient had a management change leading to improvement; in 2 other reports a definite cause was found in only 5% or less. Limited testing might be justified for its 'reassurance value'; however, extensive routine testing is not favorable from a cost-benefit standpoint and does not lead to improved patient care outcomes.

Urticarial vasculitis is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent edematous papules and plaques on the skin that last longer than 24 hours, often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as joint pain and fever. Unlike common urticaria, this condition involves inflammation of small blood vessels, leading to more severe and long-lasting skin lesions with a tendency to leave a bruiselike appearance. Diagnosis is challenging and may require a skin biopsy. Associated with underlying autoimmune diseases, treatment involves managing symptoms with medications such as antihistamines and corticosteroids, addressing the immune system's dysfunction, and treating any concurrent autoimmune conditions.

Omalizumab (Anti-IgE)

Between 2009 and 2023, omalizumab was administered to 108 patients with UV, primarily those with NUV (n = 52/108), across 25 studies, most of which were case reports (Table 4 of the ESM). Cutaneous symptoms improved in 76% of patients (n = 82/108), many of whom achieved full clinical remission. Extracutaneous symptoms, such as arthralgia or abdominal pain, improved in 40% of patients (n = 10/25). Non-serious AEs, including fever and laboratory abnormalities, were reported in 12 patients during or after the treatment.

Omalizumab is approved for the treatment of sgAH-refractory CSU as the second-line therapy, administered at a dose of 300 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks in adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older. Dosing in CSU is independent of the serum IgE level or body weight, although low and high levels of total IgE have been described as a marker of slow/non-response and fast/good response to omalizumab, respectively. In studies of urticaria and asthma, omalizumab was well tolerated, even with long-term use. It is also considered safe in pregnancy, in younger children, and in elderly individuals, although it is not licensed for these subpopulations of patients with CSU.

Canakinumab and Anakinra (Anti-IL-1)

Krause et al. used a single dose of canakinumab (300 mg subcutaneously) in an open-label study in ten patients with UV (9 NUV and 1 HUV). Cutaneous and systemic symptoms, as well as laboratory markers of inflammation, improved within 15 days in 70% of patients (n = 7/10), followed by relapse in one patient after 4 weeks. In a French multicenter study, six patients with UV (two NUV and four HUV) with associated skin, gastrointestinal, and articular symptoms were treated with anakinra (with one case later switching to canakinumab). Five patients experienced a complete remission and one showed a partial improvement of cutaneous and systemic symptoms, but at least four relapsed upon drug discontinuation. In a case report of NUV, presenting for more than 3 years with wheals, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein, the patient responded to anakinra, further supporting the potential of IL-1 inhibition in UV (Table 5 of the ESM).

Pemetrexed — an antifolate agent approved for use in patients with lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma — has an unknown exact incidence of hypersensitivity; in phase III trials, 17% to 22% of patients developed a rash, and reported reactions include pneumonitis, urticarial vasculitis, angioedema, AGEP, and anaphylaxis. For evaluation, clinical symptoms should be closely assessed and if IgE is suspected, skin testing and desensitization can be considered; if a more serious reaction is not felt to be IgE-mediated, alternative treatment options should be considered. Intradermal testing dilutions that have been reported include 1:10,000, 1:1,000, 1:100, 1:10, although more data are needed to determine optimal nonirritating skin test concentrations. For patients with suspected IgE-mediated reactions with no reasonable alternatives, desensitization has been successfully reported.

### An approach to the hospitalized patient with urticaria and fever [^4c20bc46]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a common skin disorder with a long differential diagnosis. Most cases are readily treated symptomatically and have no systemic implications. However, a number of diseases and syndromes, including vasculitides, immunologic disorders, infectious diseases, hematologic diseases, and autoinflammatory syndromes, can present with urticaria and systemic symptoms, which may lead to hospitalization of the patient. These urticarial syndromes are important to recognize as they often have significant health implications. A comprehensive history and physical exam is important in distinguishing cases of simple urticaria from these syndromes. The presence of atypical wheals, systemic symptoms such as fever or arthralgia, and a lack of response to antihistamine therapy are important diagnostic clues that should prompt further workup.

### Managing urticarial vasculitis: a clinical decision-making algorithm based on expert consensus [^c57eabee]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A typical patient with UV is a middle-aged woman (82%) with recurrent wheals that appear without any specific or definite external stimuli. Therefore, the main differential diagnosis of UV is chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU, Table 2). In most cases, a clear distinction can be made between UV and CSU based on wheal duration, presence of systemic symptoms, and residual skin signs. In CSU, wheals are transient, lasting from minutes to a few hours. In contrast to the itchy wheals of CSU, which disappear without residual bruising or hyperpigmentation, the wheals associated with UV are commonly associated with burning and pain of the skin and heal with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. UV is associated with systemic symptoms, particularly in the context of HUV, which typically do not occur in CSU. However, an overlap and a continuum between both diseases, UV and CSU, has been observed in individual patients. The occurrence of chronic recurrent wheals and systemic symptoms is also typical for Schnitzler syndrome and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, i.e. rare urticarial autoinflammatory syndromes, which are further differential diagnoses of UV. Last, wheals can also appear in patients with other types of vasculitis, including Henoch–Schönlein purpura, acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Table 1 of the Electronic Supplementary Material [ESM]).

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^e0a36cab]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Is skin biopsy a mandatory diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of CSU?

Skin biopsy is not mandatory to diagnose chronic spontaneous urticaria, but it is strongly advisable when hives last more than 24 h, to exclude urticarial vasculitis. Certain patients with urticarial vasculitis may exhibit symptoms similar to those of patients with chronic urticaria, with wheals lasting < 24 h and with no residual skin lesions. In cases with an unusual presentation of chronic urticaria – that is, mild itching, painful skin lesions or unresponsiveness to antihistamines – or when the diagnosis is not clear, we recommend performing a skin biopsy to rule out urticarial vasculitis.

Key point: Skin biopsy is only recommended when skin lesions last longer than 24 h.

Is it necessary to assess patients for infections or active infestations in the diagnosis of CSU?

Despite being included in several guidelines, no large randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated a causative role for infections in CSU. With the exception of certain geographical regions in which specific parasites are endemic –, there is no need to perform a search or treatment for underlying infections.

Key point: The evidence for the role of infection in CSU is very weak. There is no need for a systematic assessment of infection in CSU.

Is food allergy associated with CSU?

Chronic urticaria is not a manifestation of IgE-mediated food allergy. However, in isolated cases, certain true food allergies can mimic chronic urticaria. This has been recorded in allergies to foods containing omega-5 gliadin, lipid transfer protein (LPT) or galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose. On the other hand, it should be noted that in some cases food allergy might occur independently from CSU.

Key point: CSU is not related to IgE-mediated food allergy.

### Urticarial vasculitis: clinical and laboratory findings with a particular emphasis on differential diagnosis [^3f8e85cd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a rare cutaneous vasculitis of small vessels characterized by recurrent episodes of wheal-like lesions that tend to last more than 24 hours, healing with a residual ecchymotic postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. The histopathologic pattern of UV is that of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, consisting of fibrinoid necrosis of dermal vessels' walls and neutrophil-rich perivascular inflammatory infiltrates. Although its etiopahogenesis remains still undefined, UV is now regarded as an immune complex-driven disease with activation of the complement cascade, leading to exaggerated production of anaphylatoxins that are responsible for neutrophil recruitment and activation. This condition can be categorized into 2 main entities according to serum complement levels: normocomplementemic UV and hypocomplementemic UV, the latter being associated with circulating anti-C1q autoantibodies and possible extracutaneous manifestations. Systemic multiorgan involvement may be seen particularly in syndromic hypocomplementemic UV, also known as McDuffie syndrome. This review summarizes the clinicopathological and laboratory features as well as the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of UV. A focus on its main differential diagnoses is provided, that is, chronic spontaneous urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, IgA (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) and IgM/IgG immune complex vasculitis, lupus erythematous tumidus, Wells syndrome, erythema multiforme, cutaneous mastocytosis, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, and coronavirus disease 2019-associated and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-vaccine-associated urticarial eruptions.

History and physical examination items include Onset (eg, timing of symptoms with any change in medication or other exposures), Frequency, duration, severity, and localization of wheals and itching, Known precipitating factors of urticaria (eg, physical stimuli, exertion, stress, food, or medications), Associated angioedema or systemic manifestations (eg, headache, joint pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms), Known allergies, intolerances, infections, systemic illnesses, or other possible causes, Family history of urticaria and atopy, Degree of impairment of quality of life, Response to prior treatment, and Physical examination. For laboratory evaluation, Testing should be selective. A majority of members of the Practice Parameters Task Force expressed a consensus for the following routine tests in managing a patient with CU without atypical features: CBC with differential; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or both; Liver enzymes; TSH. The utility of performing the above tests routinely for patients with CU has not been established. Additional evaluation might be warranted based on patients' circumstances and might include but not be limited to the diagnostic tests listed below. A thorough history and meticulous physical examination are essential for determining whether these additional tests are appropriate: Skin biopsy; Physical challenge tests; Complement system (eg, C3, C4, and CH50); Stool analysis for ova and parasites; Urinalysis; Hepatitis B and C serologies; Chest radiography, other imaging studies, or both; Anti-nuclear antibody; Rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein; Cryoglobulin levels; Serologic and/or skin testing for immediate hypersensitivity; Thyroid autoantibodies; Serum protein electrophoresis. More detailed laboratory tests, skin biopsies, or both merit consideration if urticaria is not responding to therapy as anticipated, and Additional laboratory testing might be required before initiation of certain medications, such as G6PD screening before prescribing dapsone.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^b6324fb5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical features distinguishing chronic urticaria from urticarial vasculitis and angioedema — CU lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals of variable size and shape with surrounding erythema and are generally pruritic, and individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours. A painful or burning dysesthesia is not characteristic of CU and suggests the presence of cutaneous vasculitis, in which lesions are palpable and usually nonblanching, spanning several days or more and often followed by residual hyperpigmented changes; diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis should be confirmed by a biopsy demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Because urticarial vasculitic lesions might sometimes be evanescent, lasting less than 24 hours, this condition cannot be completely excluded based on a history of lesions spanning less than 24 hours. Angioedema typically appears as nonpitting, brawny, nonpitting edema, typically without well-defined margins and without erythema.

Methotrexate for chronic urticaria — experience is limited to small case reports and case series, and because of the limited evidence and potential for more serious adverse effects, use in CU should be considered only in patients refractory to other anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, or other safer alternative agents. In the largest case series, 12 of 16 responded, 2 with complete response, among methotrexate-treated patients (8 with CIU, 3 with urticarial vasculitis, and 1 with idiopathic angioedema), with an effective dose of 10 to 15 mg/wk. Methotrexate has potentially serious adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity and pulmonary fibrosis, requires extensive laboratory monitoring, and folic acid supplementation has been shown to improve continuation rates by reducing the incidence of liver function test abnormalities and gastrointestinal intolerance; recommendations for routine liver biopsies vary and methotrexate-specific liver lesions are rarely observed in long-term arthritis therapy with increased liver enzyme levels.

Chronic urticaria (CU) diagnostic testing — For patients with otherwise unremarkable history and examination, skin or in vitro testing for IgE to inhalants or foods and/or extensive laboratory testing are not recommended. Targeted laboratory testing based on clinical suspicion is appropriate, and limited routine laboratory testing can be performed to exclude underlying causes. Limited laboratory testing includes a CBC with differential, sedimentation rate, and/or C-reactive protein, liver enzyme, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement, and in such patients limited laboratory testing might be appropriate to identify infrequent or rare causes or provide "reassurance value". Serology to diagnose underlying autoimmune diseases is not warranted in the initial evaluation without additional suggestive features, and routine testing for thyroid autoantibodies is not recommended. Evidence does not support testing for Helicobacter pylori infection or celiac disease in otherwise unremarkable patients, and there are no convincing data that treatment based on such abnormal test results leads to improvement or change in the course of CU. Routine laboratory testing in typical CU rarely yields clinically significant findings, screening for thyroid disease is of low yield without symptoms or history, and increased anti-thyroglobulin or antithyroid antibodies in euthyroid subjects are commonly detected although the clinical implications are unclear.

### Urticaria mimickers in children [^6a5939f7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Acute urticaria is a self-limited cutaneous condition marked by transient, erythematous, and pruritic wheals. It is a hypersensitivity response that is often secondary to infection, medications, or food allergies in children. In contrast, the urticarial "mimickers" described in this review article are often seen in the context of fever and extracutaneous manifestations in pediatric patients. The differential diagnosis ranges from benign and self-limited hypersensitivity responses to multisystem inflammatory diseases. Establishing the correct diagnosis of an urticarial rash in a pediatric patient is necessary to both prevent an unnecessary work up for self-limited conditions and to appropriately recognize and evaluate multisystem inflammatory disorders. Herein, we describe two cases to illustrate the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, histopathology and differential diagnoses for several mimickers of acute urticaria including: urticaria multiforme, serum sickness like reaction, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy, systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes, and urticarial vasculitis.

### Utility of routine laboratory testing in management of chronic urticaria / angioedema [^25c18af6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Laboratory tests are routinely ordered to identify or rule out a cause in patients with chronic urticaria/angioedema (CUA). The results of these tests are usually within normal limits or unremarkable.

Objective

To investigate the proportion of abnormal test results in patients with CUA leading to a change in management and in outcomes of care.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of a random sample of adult patients with CUA from 2001–2009.

Results

Cases totaled 356: 166 with urticaria and angioedema (AE), 187 with urticaria, and 3 with only AE. Patients were predominately women (69.1%) and white (75.6%), with a mean age of 48 ± 15 years. Abnormalities were commonly seen in complete blood counts (34%) and in complete metabolic panels (9.4%). Among the 1,872 tests that were ordered, results of 319 (17%) were abnormal. Of 356 patients, 30 underwent further testing because of abnormalities in laboratory work. This represented 30 of 1,872 tests (1.60%). Only 1 patient benefited from a subsequent change in management.

Conclusions

Laboratory testing in CUA patients referred for an Allergy and Immunology evaluation rarely lead to changes in management resulting in improved outcomes of care.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)

In several publications (Table 14 of the ESM), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reportedly helped approximately 57% of patients with UV (n = 74/130). Daily dosages ranged from 100 to 400 mg, with 400 mg/day being the preferred dosage. In two larger case series as well as a web-based questionnaire of patients with UV, response rates of 75% (n = 18/24), 54% (n = 14/26), and 76% (n = 36/47), respectively, were reported. HCQ was frequently administered alongside SGCs. Combining HCQ with prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) achieved complete remission in 88% (n = 15/17) of HUV cases, with the authors typically initiating treatment with both drugs and then continuing with HCQ alone to mitigate the long-term adverse effects of SGCs. One study indicated that HCQ was as effective as SGCs while exhibiting a favorable AE profile. The efficacy of HCQ typically became apparent within 3 months of treatment initiation. It was predominantly used for treating HUV/hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome (HUVS), leading to complete remission of skin symptoms and improvements in extracutaneous symptoms affecting the joints, lungs, and eyes. Additionally, HCQ contributed to improved immunological markers among patients with UV, including increased complement components.

### A reassessment of diagnostic criteria and treatment of idiopathic urticarial vasculitis: a retrospective study of 47 patients [^19062cff]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is an uncommon type of chronic urticaria (CU), which exhibits leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Painful and long-lasting (> 24 h) weals associated with purpura or bruising are considered indicative of UV. It is often responsive to oral corticosteroids and poorly to oral antihistamines. Hypocomplementaemia and systemic involvement are also commonly reported.

Aims

To diagnose patients with UV histologically and then compare their clinical features and response to various treatment regimens.

Methods

Biopsies were taken from 312 subjects with CU unresponsive to oral antihistamines; of these, 47 were histologically diagnosed as having UV. Biopsies were taken irrespective of the clinical features of weal eruption. Other diseases known to be associated with small-vessel vasculitis had previously been excluded. Results. Individual weals lasted < 24 h in 57.4% of patients, and pain or tenderness was reported only by 8.6%. Extracutaneous features were present in 81%, hypocomplementaemia in 11% and abnormalities of other laboratory parameters (i.e. raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, microscopic haematuria) in 76.6%. Hydroxyzine was effective in only one patient. Both oral corticosteroids and cinnarizine were effective in a high percentage of the patients.

Conclusion

This diagnostic approach allowed us to identify a large group (47 patients) with UV. Most did not present the clinical (prolonged duration of weals and bruising) and laboratory features that have previously been described as characteristic of UV. Cinnarizine was found to be a valuable treatment option.

### The role of patch testing in evaluating delayed hypersensitivity reactions to medications [^2dfc067a]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

In the setting of a negative patch test, skin prick or intradermal testing can be pursued, although false positives are more common with intradermal testing than with patch testing. Details of skin prick and intradermal testing are beyond the scope of this review as they are generally more helpful for urticarial reactions. However, these modalities have demonstrated some efficacy in identifying the culprit drug in the setting of morbilliform eruptions and fixed drug eruption. For example, in one study, five of twelve patients (42%) with morbilliform eruptions who had negative patch test results subsequently exhibited positive skin prick or intradermal tests to the suspected drugs. In contrast, a much higher proportion, 11 of 13 (85%) of patients with drug-induced urticaria who were negative on patch testing were positive on skin prick and/or intradermal testing. Given the high risk of rash recrudescence, these tests are contraindicated in the setting of SCARs, as well as erythema multiforme and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Importantly, given the risk of anaphylaxis, intradermal tests should only be performed in settings where a crash cart is available.

In the future, various limitations need to be addressed in order to enable more widespread adoption of confirmatory testing. Currently, the variability in study design and lack of standardized patch testing methodology in the literature precludes direct comparison between studies. In addition, only a limited number of haptens are commercially available for testing. In many cases, pharmacies in academic medical centers or specialized compounding pharmacies in the community can be helpful in the preparation of haptens. However, both the availability of centers and cost of case-by-case compounding are limitations to more widespread use.

More work is also needed in order to define optimal practices in testing, such as the optimal concentration and vehicle for testing particular drugs. Additional studies are also needed to elucidate the role of metabolites versus the native drug in precipitating eruptions. Testing key metabolites may enable confirmation of testing in previously low yield scenarios. For example, Lee et al. (2003) uncovered 3 additional relevant reactions in a cohort of 13 patients with suspected cutaneous adverse reactions to carbamazepine by additionally testing to carbamazepine's main metabolite, carbamazepine-epoxide. Overall, given how rare these reactions are, collaborative, multi-centered studies will be required to achieve these goals.

Second-Generation H1-Antihistamines

Overall, 141 patients with UV (77 of whom had NUV) from 23 publications received different second-generation anti-histamines (sgAHs) at a standard dose or up-titrated up to four times the standard dose (n = 5). Two patients received concomitant ranitidine (an H2-antihistamine), whereas eight patients received an additional first-generation H1-antihistamine (hydroxyzine, up to 50 mg/day). The duration of treatment varied from 10 days to 8 years. Resolution of skin lesions with the isolated use of sgAHs occurred in 3.5% of patients (n = 5/141), and skin lesions improved in 6.4% (n = 9/141) of patients with concomitant use of oral prednisolone or colchicine. SgAHs, used at standard or higher than the standard dose, failed to effectively improve skin lesions in the remaining 90.1% patients (n = 128/141). These patients commonly switched to the use of SGC, immunomodulators, or omalizumab for their UV. SgAHs have not been reported to have any effect on extracutaneous symptoms, and no treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported (Table 3 of the ESM).

In line with our recent systematic review, we found that sgAHs are of limited efficacy in UV. However, given their safety profile, sgAHs can be tried in patients with UV with mild symptoms and pruritus, those who have signs of a CSU/UV overlap, and possibly also in patients with more severe disease as an adjunct therapy, along with systemic immunomodulators or biologics. SgAHs are generally safe, even as a long-term treatment; however, some AEs are possible, such as tiredness and somnolence, especially at high doses. Elderly patients, especially those with renal, hepatic and/or cardiac disorders may be at risk while taking high doses of some sgAHs. Cetirizine and loratadine are considered to be safe in pregnant and breastfeeding women.

Monoclonal Antibodies

Among biologic therapies, the most substantial evidence for treating UV is available for omalizumab, a humanized recombinant anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody, and rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the B-lymphocyte antigen CD20. Additionally, there is evidence for the use of canakinumab, an interleukin (IL)-1β antagonist, and anakinra, an IL-1-receptor antagonist.

### Urticarial lesions: if not urticaria, what else? The differential diagnosis of urticaria: part I. cutaneous diseases [^3f993418]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Acute urticaria is self-limiting, and a cause can be identified in many patients. Chronic urticaria is a long lasting disease, and patients are commonly examined for an autoimmune origin and for associated diseases. Although the diagnosis of urticaria is straightforward in most patients, it may pose some difficulties at times and it may require a careful differential diagnosis with a number of conditions. Urticarial syndromes comprise both cutaneous and systemic disorders. Part I of this two-part series focuses on the clinical and histologic features that characterize common urticaria and on the cutaneous diseases that may manifest with urticarial lesions and must be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Learning Objectives

After completing the learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish between the typical wheals of urticaria and urticarial lesions suggesting other diagnoses and to assess patients with urticarial lesions in order to exclude or confirm other cutaneous diseases.

### Biopsy-proven kidney involvement in hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis [^4603140a]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with HUV can display heterogeneous kidney lesions with glomerular, vascular and tubulo-interstitial involvement, with or without immune complex deposits. Kidney involvement of HUV can be severe and relapsing, and lead to ESKD. Corticosteroids, and Rituximab in severe forms, could be the preferential therapeutic options. Screening for proteinuria, and monitoring of blood pressure and serum creatinine could be proposed in all patients with HUV followed-up in Rheumatology or Dermatology, at the time of the diagnosis and during subsequent flares, to diagnose and treat kidney lesions early to avoid chronic kidney damage.

### Annular urticarial lesions [^0ff4074c]. Clinics in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Annular urticarial configurations are often associated with acute and chronic urticaria. Such lesions may be short-lived, migratory, transient, pruritic, and resolving with no residual evidence, making the diagnosis of urticaria an obvious one. Annular urticarial lesions can be the presenting signs of various cutaneous and systemic diseases. The differentiation of urticarial lesions may be made by considering the duration of an individual lesion longer than 24 hours, with burning and pain sensation in the lesions or lack of pruritus; skin marks such as postinflammatory pigmentation or purpura after resolution of the lesions; associated scaling or vehiculation in the lesions; systemic symptoms such as arthralgia, fever or fatigue; and several abnormal laboratory findings. The main differential diagnoses of annular urticarial lesions include urticarial vasculitis, autoinflammatory syndromes, hypersensitivity reactions, and connective tissue diseases.

A. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
B. Adult-onset Still disease
C. Schnitzler syndrome (SS)
D. Urticarial vasculitis
E. Cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes

Answers:
A. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance – Incorrect. This very common plasma cell dyscrasia is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal Ig in the serum or urine. It is typically asymptomatic and is seen in older individuals. This patient presented with fever, urticaria, and constitutional symptoms.
B. Adult-onset Still disease – Incorrect. It presents with a spiking fever, evanescent rash with high serum ferritin levels and elevated hepatic transaminases. This patient, on the other hand, had episodes of recurrent urticaria, lasting about 24 hours, and a nonspiking fever associated with biclonal gammopathy involving both IgG and IgA.
C. Schnitzler syndrome (SS) – Correct. The Strasbourg criteriafor diagnosis requires 2 major criteria - recurrent, nonpruritic urticaria, and monoclonal gammopathy, and 3 minor criteria, which include recurrent fever, objective findings of abnormal bone remodeling with or without bone pain, neutrophilic dermal infiltrate on skin biopsy, and elevated CRP and/or leukocytosis. This patient fulfilled Strasbourg criteria: 2 major criteria, recurrent urticaria and gammopathy, and 3 minor criteria, fever, raised ESR and CRP levels, and neutrophilic urticarial histopathology.
D. Urticarial vasculitis – Incorrect. Presentation is similar to SS but the histopathology should reveal features of true vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis of small vessel walls, and also may show complement consumption. Both these features were absent in the present case.
E. Cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes – Incorrect. Cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes including neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease, Muckle-Wells syndrome, and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome generally present at an earlier age and are not associated with a serum monoclonal protein.

### The clinical spectrum and therapeutic management of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis: data from a French nationwide study of fifty-seven patients [^d318e450]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV) is an uncommon vasculitis of unknown etiology that is rarely described in the literature. We undertook this study to analyze the clinical spectrum and the therapeutic management of patients with HUV.

Methods

We conducted a French nationwide retrospective study that included 57 patients with chronic urticaria, histologic leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and hypocomplementemia. We assessed clinical and laboratory data and evaluated the patients' cutaneous and immunologic responses to therapy. We evaluated treatment efficacy by measuring the time to treatment failure.

Results

Urticarial lesions were typically more pruritic than painful and were associated with angioedema in 51% of patients, purpura in 35%, and livedo reticularis in 14%. Extracutaneous manifestations included constitutional symptoms (in 56% of patients) as well as musculoskeletal involvement (in 82%), ocular involvement (in 56%), pulmonary involvement (in 19%), gastrointestinal involvement (in 18%), and kidney involvement (in 14%). Patients with HUV typically presented with low C1q levels and normal C1 inhibitor levels, in association with anti-C1q antibodies in 55% of patients. Hydroxychloroquine or colchicine seemed to be as effective as corticosteroids as first-line therapy. In patients with relapsing and/or refractory disease, rates of cutaneous and immunologic response to therapy seemed to be higher with conventional immunosuppressive agents, in particular, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclophosphamide, while a rituximab-based regimen tended to have higher efficacy. Finally, a cutaneous response to therapy was strongly associated with an immunologic response to therapy.

Conclusion

HUV represents an uncommon systemic and relapsing vasculitis with various manifestations, mainly, musculoskeletal and ocular involvement associated with anti-C1q antibodies, which were found in approximately half of the patients. The best strategy for treating HUV has yet to be defined.

Correspondence: I. Nikishina

Pediatric Rheumatology, 23(2): PU21

Introduction: Chronic urticarial rash is the most common clinical manifestation of chronic spontaneous urticaria. However, it may indicate a rare disease, especially when systemic symptoms such as fever (F), joint damage, and elevated inflammatory markers are present.

Objectives: We aimed to describe our experience in diagnosing and treating a patient with urticarial rash (UR).

Methods: The patient's clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, and treatment course were described.

Results: The patient's first symptoms appeared at age 41 (pain in the small joints of the hands and morning stiffness lasting more than an hour). Three years later, the patient's condition worsened, with generalized UR (lasting more than 24 hours and unresponsive to antihistamines), recurrent F (up to 38.5°C), periodic swelling of the lips, paraorbital and occipital regions, hoarseness, and a sensation of breathing difficulty. A year later, recurrent panuveitis (U) developed. The patient was monitored by ophthalmologists and received steroid therapy with temporary and incomplete benefit. A skin biopsy showed sparse perivascular and periadnexal infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes with some small lymphoid cells and plasma cells. There was no evidence of vasculitis. Signs of neutrophilic dermatitis. Laboratory data revealed a CRP level of 35 mg/L; RF, ANA, ENA, ANCA, ferritin, leukocytes, and eosinophils were normal. ESR 40 mm/h, C3 0.57 g/L, C4 0.05 g/L, anti-C1q > 200, and IgM 2N. Monoclonal secretion of IgMκ 5.6 g/L. The p.L625P mutation in the MYD88 gene was not detected. Therefore, the patient with persistent UR had highly specific laboratory markers suggestive of both hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV) and Schnitzler syndrome. Histological examination of the skin biopsy favored Schnitzler syndrome, while angioedema and U were more suggestive of urticarial vasculitis. Considering this, and previous reports of successful use of IL-1 inhibitors in urticarial vasculitis, and more so in Schnitzler syndrome, the patient was prescribed anakinra. However, it was ineffective. Cyclosporine and azathioprine were also prescribed sequentially, but were poorly tolerated and had only temporary effects. Steroids provided the best relief but led to steroid dependence. Thus, the diagnosis was formulated as HUV with recurrent bilateral U, F, polyarthritis, angioedema, increased ESR and CRP, decreased C3, C4, positive anti-C1q antibodies, and MGUS IgMκ. Therapy with azathioprine and rituximab allowed for a reduction in the metilprednisone dose from 12 mg to 4 mg, relieving pain, rash, and edema, and reducing the frequency of U relapses.

The clinical evaluation of angioedema is reliant on obtaining a thorough patient and family history with an assessment of risk factors and presenting symptoms unique to each subtype. It is important to distinguish between angioedema with and without urticaria as a primary step in the evaluation; thereafter, laboratory parameters and investigations allow for subsequent stratification. There is a significant disease burden associated with angioedema and thus it is essential for health care practitioners to establish a prompt and accurate diagnosis, and a comprehensive care plan that addresses the patient's physical and mental well-being alike.

Introduction: Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a rare cutaneous vasculitis of small vessels (SVV) characterized by wheal-like lesions that tend to last more than 24 hours, healing with a residual ecchymotic postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. The histopathologic pattern is definide as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. UV can be limited to the skin or may be associated with constitutional symptoms, including fever and arthralgias, and involvement of other organs such as kidneys, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and eyes. The Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) 2012 included the hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV) (anti-C1q vasculitis) in the group of 'immune complex SVV'. HUV was defined as 'a form of vasculitis accompanied by urticarial and hypocomplementemia affecting small vessels and associated anti-C1q antibodies'. HUV is a rare disease in children.

Objectives: To describe a case of pediatric HUV.

Methods: A 2 years old male infant was admitted to our hospital with urticarial erythematous rash lasting 9 days, bilateral non-secreting conjunctivitis, erythema and cracking of lips. His recent medical history was remarkable for fever 5 days before (lasting 6 days). Blood tests showed elevation of inflammatory indexes and hypocomplementemia (reduced C3 and undosable C4). The clinic and blood tests were suggestive of hypocomplementemic ANCA-negative urticarial vasculitis. Urine tests, abdominal ultrasound, cardiac examination and ocular fundus excluded complications of vasculitis. Secondary forms were excluded with negative ANA, anti dsDNA, anti-cardiolipin, antiphospholipid antibodies, normal expression of immune system, absence of signs of acute Sars-COV-2 infection. Unfortunately, it was not possible to detect anti-C1q antibodies.

### Hypocomplementaemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome: a mimicker of systemic lupus erythematosus [^ac84d521]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A middle aged female patient presented with generalised palpable purpura associated with intense pruritus along with subconjunctival haemorrhage and orbital inflammation. There was extensive dermographism. Other systemic examinations were within normal limits. Haematological profile was normal except raised D-dimer. Skin biopsy revealed the presence of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Antinuclear antibody was positive in a titre of 1: 160, but antidouble-stranded DNA was negative. Urine examination revealed haematuria and proteinuria. Complement C3, C4 and C1q levels were decreased with the presence of anti-C1q antibody. There was a diagnostic dilemma between systemic lupus erythematosus and hypocomplementaemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome. However, as the patient did not fulfil the American College of Rheumatology criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus, but fulfilled all the criteria for hypocomplementaemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome, the case was finally diagnosed as hypocomplementaemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome and treated accordingly with favourable outcome.

### Cost-utility of routine testing in chronic urticaria / angioedema: a cohort study [^ca944dea]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic urticaria/angioedema (CUA) guidelines recommend limiting tests to diagnose and assess prognosis, activity, and severity. Routine testing in CUA might substantially increase cost of disease without benefiting outcome.

Objective

To evaluate the utility of tests in CUA and how they influence the cost of disease.

Methods

We reviewed 725 electronic medical records of patients who were evaluated for CUA between 2010 and 2018 at a tertiary care center. The sample was gathered through the search of International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth Revision codes pertaining to CUA. Analyses were made to evaluate changes in outcome for patients on whom at least 1 test was performed to evaluate CUA, the costs generated by these tests, and the tendencies to order specific tests from 2010 through 2018.

Results

Of 725 patients (age median, 47 years; women, 73.1%), 543 (74.8%) had at least 1 test performed. Tests had an elevated percentage of normal results (> 90%). Five patients (0.9%) had a change in outcome and 8 patients were given a different diagnosis (0.1% each). Evaluation, management, and tests accounted for most of the costs. Costs remain similar between 2010–2014 (mean, $569) and 2015–2018 (mean, $569).

Conclusions

In CUA, tests rarely uncover underlying conditions or lead to changes in management and outcome, but they substantially increase the costs generated by the disease. Adherence to current recommendations to limit testing might help in reducing the financial burden of CUA and improve delivery of care.

### Burning urticarial plaques in a middle-aged woman [^d40fc582]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Normocomplementemic UV – Correct. UV is a rare subtype of leukocytoclastic vasculitis that predominantly affects the skin. Individual hive-like lesions of UV characteristically persist longer than 24 hours, a trait distinguishing it from ordinary urticaria. A burning sensation often accompanies edematous plaques, which leave bruise-like patches upon resolution. Based on complement consumption, UV is categorized as normocomplementemic (80% of cases), hypocomplementemic, and rare hypocomplementemic UV syndrome. The serum levels of C3 and C4 should be checked to differentiate normocomplementemic UV from these.
B. NUD – Incorrect. There can be diagnostic and histologic overlap between NUD and UV, and workup for underlying systemic, autoimmune conditions is necessary in unclear cases. Most patients with NUD have fever, polyarthritis, leukocytosis, and associated systemic disease (Still disease, lupus, or Schnitzler syndrome). This patient's lack of systemic symptoms argues against NUD.
C. Adult-onset Still disease – Incorrect. Our patient's lack of fever and arthritis argues against adult-onset Still disease, which classically presents as evanescent salmon-colored papules.
D. Schnitzler syndrome – Incorrect. Although skin biopsy for Schnitzler syndrome most commonly exhibits neutrophilic urticaria (with leukocytoclastic vasculitis seen in 25% of patients), these patients also present with fever, arthralgias, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, which were absent in this patient.
E. Hypocomplementemic UV syndrome – Incorrect. This is a severe syndrome defined by specific diagnostic criteria – urticaria for 6 months as well as hypocomplementemia and 2 of the following criteria: (1) vasculitis on biopsy, (2) arthralgia or arthritis, (3) uveitis or episcleritis, (4) glomerulonephritis, (5) recurrent abdominal pain, or (6) positive C1q precipitin test result with a low C1q level.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic urticaria, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, BAD 2022 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a basophil histamine release assay, if feasible, in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria with an inadequate response to first-line treatment, recognizing that a positive basophil histamine release assay may indicate a higher probability of disease responsiveness to cyclosporin and slower or delayed response to omalizumab, whereas a negative basophil histamine release assay may indicate a higher probability of disease responsiveness to omalizumab.

Angioedema usually occurs within the setting of allergic diseases or urticaria, but situations occur in which angioedema itself represents a disease, such as in hereditary angioedema. Evaluation of patients for recurrent angioedema without wheals must take into account both specific clinical signs and symptoms and specialized laboratory testing.

Results: Patient underwent prednisone 1 mg/kg/die orally for one week, discontinuated in three weeks. The rash disappeared and C3 and C4 levels were progressively normalized in one month.

Conclusion: Urticaria-like lesions, palpable purpura, petechiae and angioedema are characteristic features of HUV. Systemic involvement includes arthralgias and myalgias, arthritis, kidney involvement (proteinuria or hematuria), ocular involvement (episcleritis, uveitis, and conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Laboratory marker of HUV is hypocomplementemia, with a profile indicative of classical pathway activation (reduced C1, C2, C4, C3). CHCC addendum distinguished HUV from the normocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, a skin-limited vasculitis, not accompanied by systemic involvement. This form of vasculitis is associated with normocomplementemia and absence of anti-C1q antibodies. Even if our patient did not perform the skin biopsy and dosage of anti-C1q antibodies, the cutaneous picture, the systemic involment and the hypocomplementemia were suggestive of HUV.

Unlabelled

Vasculitis can range in severity from a self-limited single-organ disorder to a life-threatening disease with the prospect of multiple-organ failure. This condition presents many challenges to the physician, including classification and diagnosis, appropriate laboratory workup, treatment, and the need for careful follow-up. The physician must not only be able to recognize vasculitis but also be able to provide a specific diagnosis (if possible) as well as recognize and treat any underlying etiologic condition. Most diagnostic criteria are based on the size of vessel involvement, which often correlates with specific dermatologic findings. This may allow the dermatologist to provide an initial diagnosis and direct the medical evaluation. This article reviews the classification and diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitic syndromes and current treatment options; it also presents a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and treating the patient with suspected cutaneous vasculitis. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2003;48:311–40.)

Learning Objective

At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the classification and clinical features of the various forms of cutaneous vasculitis. They should also have a rational approach to diagnosing and treating a patient with vasculitis.

Table 2
Schwarz criteria for the diagnosis of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis

One interesting feature of HUVS is the heterogeneity regarding renal involvement. In a recent review of the literature, Boyer et al. identified 82 cases of HUVS with renal involvement, 88% of them being glomerulonephritis. Isolated microscopic hematuria and subnephrotic-range proteinuria are common manifestations, whereas nephrotic syndrome and acute kidney injury are less common. Various histologic patterns have been described as well. The commonest histologic patterns are membranoproliferative and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, followed by membranous nephropathy. Cases of minimal change disease, tubulointerstitial nephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis have also been described. No plausible explanation has been suggested to justify this heterogeneity and the factors affecting it. Urticarial vasculitis is mediated by antigen-antibody complexes that are deposited on vascular lumina, resulting in complement activation through the classical pathway. The complement cascade, when triggered, releases chemotactic factors, which in turn attract inflammatory cells, resulting in the damage of the endothelium and surrounding tissues. The stimulus for these events seems to be activation of the C1q component. This explains why low C1q levels are found in the majority of patients (90–100%) with urticarial vasculitis. A suggested mechanism for the activation is binding of anti-C1q antibodies to the collagen-like region of the C1q molecule. Anti-C1q circulating antibodies are found in more than half of the patients and are, along with low C1q levels, considered to be the marker of the disease. Apart from these, other factors that could possibly activate C1q are drugs, like the anti-TNF factor etanercept, viruses, like Epstein-Barr and Hepatits B, C and other, non-identified autoantibodies. Unfortunately, we could not test for anti-C1q antibodies, as the assay is not available not only in out hospital, but in any public laboratory in Greece. C1q and C4 levels were at the lowest end of the normal range. Therefore, we considered them low, particularly when combined with low C3 and her clinical presentation.

### Urticarial vasculitis… [^dfd3f9fe]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A woman with cutaneous vasculitis had a severe bullous eruption that was suggestive of erythema multiforme. The patient also had a history of recurrent urticaria that continued intermittently for over a year of follow-up examination. Skin biopsy specimens of both urticarial and erythema and multiforme lesions showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. An illness resembling systemic lupus erythematosus is suggested by transient, lowtiter, positive antinuclear antibody tests, persistent deposits of immunoglobulin and complement in normal skin, arthralgias, circulating immune complexes, and chronic hypocomplementemia. This case is similar to cases previously reported as "hypocomplementemic vasculitis, " an "unusual SLE-related syndrome, " and "urticaria with vasculitis". Gammon WR, Wheeler CE.

Introduction: We wanted to share a difficult case of urticarial rash (UR).

Objectives: We aimed to share our experience diagnosing and treating a patient with UR.

Methods: The patient's clinical features, laboratory findings, and treatment course were reviewed.

Results: The patient, a 35-year-old, was admitted for observation at the V. A. Nasonova Rheumatology Research Institute. According to the medical history, urticarial rashes began within the first weeks of life. These rashes recurred, lasted for more than 24 hours, and did not respond to antihistamines. At age 28, the condition worsened, with episodes of widespread urticarial rashes and fever up to 38.5°C. During this period, the patient also developed dry eyes and mouth, and needed to drink fluids to eat. At age 32, the patient first visited a rheumatologist. Lab tests showed rheumatoid factor (RF) > 200 ME/ml and CRP 73 mg/l, with positive ANA, ENA screen, SSA, and SSB markers. A skin biopsy indicated small vessel vasculitis. The patient was diagnosed with urticarial vasculitis as part of Sjogren's disease, though no standard imaging of the glands was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Low-dose steroid therapy and hydroxychloroquine were followed by methotrexate, but these were ineffective. Rituximab therapy was then started, the patient received 2000 mg and showed some improvement. However, within three months, the patient suffered a relapse with widespread rash, fever, and a CRP of 56 mg/l, despite marked depletion of B cells. At this time, the patient came under our care. Lab studies showed RF 82 ME/ml, ANF Hep2 1/1280 sp, anti-Ro > 200, anti-La 2 N, IgG 19.6 g/l, CRP 69 mg/l, ESR 80 mm/h, with B cells (CD19+, CD3-) at 0.3%. C3, C4, and anti-C1q levels were normal. Tear film breakup time was 3 seconds. Schirmer tear test result was 13 mm, with no staining defects of the conjunctiva or cornea. Sialography showed uneven filling of the ducts with a cloud-like appearance, but without definite cavity formation. A minor salivary gland biopsy revealed mild sialadenitis, focus score 1.1. Saliva flow rate was 2.9 ml/min. Salivary gland ultrasound showed diffuse heterogeneity, with single, round, smooth, hypoechoic avascular formations up to 1.4 mm in size. Because of the weak glandular changes and the early onset of skin symptoms, an autoinflammatory disease was suspected. Genetic testing identified a heterozygous p. Thr350Met mutation in exon 4 of the NLRP3 gene, confirming a diagnosis of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). The patient was diagnosed with both Sjogren's disease and CAPS. The main clinical features were urticarial rashes and inflammatory activity. Given the risk of hearing loss and amyloidosis, interleukin-1 inhibitor therapy (anakinra) was started, resulting in rapid and complete improvement.

### A case report of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis presenting with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis [^6c8d3677]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The uncertainty about the disease's pathogenesis does not facilitate the differential diagnosis from other conditions, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus and cryoglobulinemia. It is not difficult to distinguish urticarial vasculitis from common urticaria, because the skin lesions last more than 24 h, usually 2–3 days, are sometimes painful or "burning" and may leave a residual bruising or hyperpigmentation of the skin. Skin biopsy typically reveals a small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis that involves post-capillary venules. However, it seems that non-specific findings, such as lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltrates are relatively common, when an 'older' lesion is biopsied. Often, multiple biopsies of are needed to establish diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, preferably of a wheal less than 12 h after eruption. This is, in our opinion, the reason why our patient's skin biopsies were negative for vasculitis and, considering that she already fulfilled Schwarz criteria, we chose not to put her through a third biopsy.

Differential diagnosis from lupus erythematosus is still a controversial issue. By many HUVS is thought to be a precursor or atypical presentation of lupus, taking into consideration the fact that there are patients presenting with urticarial vasculitis in whom the diagnosis of lupus is following after months or years. On the other hand, there are clinical and immunological differences showing that we are dealing with two distinct conditions. Lupus was on our differential diagnosis, considering the fact that our center has great experience with lupus patients and atypical manifestations of the disease. However, on immunofluoroescence, the classically described for the diagnosis of lupus nephritis "full-house" pattern was practically absent. Furthermore, in means of systemic manifestations, our patient did not fulfill the American Society of Reumatology (ASR). The typical butterfly rash does not occur in HUVS patients, while wheals and angioedema are rare in lupus. Ocular involvement in not so frequent in lupus, while pulmonary disease is particularly rare, in comparison to HUVS patients, in whom chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common finding. Renal involvement tends to be more common in lupus, kidney biopsy sometimes fails to distinguish between the two entities. Likewise, about half of vasculitis patients are positive for antinuclear antibodies, even though anti-dsDNA and ENA antibodies rarely are positive. Anti-C1q antibodies, are also found positive in 30% of lupus patients, as well as in other autoimmune diseases like Sjogren syndrome.

Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 typically present simultaneously with or after other COVID-19 symptoms; however, in 12% of cases, they can occur prior. Diagnosing underlying COVID-19 is paramount, given the associated public health risks, since accurate and timely diagnosis can prevent further spread of the virus through appropriate quarantining measures and possibly provide patients with COVID-19 treatment options earlier in their disease course.

### Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis: report of a 12-year-old girl with systemic lupus erythematosus [^fbaf9e88]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis, a form of leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving the postcapillary venules, is classified as a type III hypersensitivity reaction and has been associated with connective tissue disease. The lesions resemble urticaria and typically persist for more than 24 hours. Urticarial vasculitis usually affects young women, and the diagnosis is confirmed at histologic examination. Patients with urticarial vasculitis can be divided into 2 types — those with normal complement levels and those with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV). Patients with normocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis have a milder course than do patients with HUV, a condition that has a strong association with systemic lupus erythematosus. Angioedema, ocular inflammation, obstructive lung disease, and glomerulonephritis are commonly associated with HUV. We describe the case of a girl with systemic lupus erythematosus and HUV who also had pancreatitis, hypothyroidism, and elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies.

### A case of urticarial vasculitis associated with atezolizumab [^4c3b85f8]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

The presented case suggests an association between the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab and the development of urticarial vasculitis in a patient with metastatic small cell lung cancer. The temporal relationship between the initiation of atezolizumab therapy and the onset of cutaneous symptoms strongly suggests a drug-induced etiology. Moreover, cirAE development is associated with favorable ICI response, as seen in this case. Although urticarial vasculitis secondary to ICI therapy is, to our knowledge, not a previously reported phenomenon, reports have characterized the development of other types of vasculitis in response to ICI treatment. Notably, the PD-L1 pathway has been implicated in the development of vasculitis, particularly giant cell arteritis. In a transcriptomic analysis of giant cell arteritis, arterial biopsies demonstrated low PD-L1 expression, suggesting that inhibition of programmed death-1 and PD-L1 leads to cytokine release and loss of immune privilege in the vessel wall. In the presented case, it is feasible that inhibition of PD-L1 by atezolizumab contributed to the activation of the aforementioned inflammatory mediators, leading to the development of an ICI-induced urticarial vasculitis.

There are no treatment guidelines for urticarial vasculitis, and randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of available therapies are lacking. However, several therapies have been utilized with varying levels of success, including: doxycycline, dapsone, colchicine, corticosteroids, omalizumab, rituximab, and anakinra. As urticarial vasculitis can be associated with medications, cancers, or infections, withdrawal of the offending agent, cancer remission, or treatment of the underlying infection can effectively improve urticarial vasculitis symptoms. Early diagnosis and management of cirAEs is crucial to limit interruptions or discontinuation of life-saving cancer therapy.

In reporting this case, we hope to contribute to the literature regarding the spectrum of cirAEs. Dermatologists should be aware of the various cirAE presentations in order to guide workup and management. Further research should elucidate the underlying mechanisms and optimize treatment strategies for this cutaneous manifestation.

Methods

Medical and ophthalmic history, results of physical and ophthalmic examinations, laboratory data, and histologic and immunopathologic examination were reviewed and results recorded.

Results

A 67-year-old man who presented with eye redness and pain, rash, arthralgia, and malaise was found to have hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis. Treatment with high-dose oral corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in the resolution of the rash and scleritis.

Conclusions

Ocular involvement may be a helpful clue in the diagnosis of this uncommon syndrome.

Vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of disorders that share the common feature of inflammation of the blood vessel wall. Vasculitis can be a systemic or localized process and depending on the disorder can affect large, medium, or small vessels. Vascular physicians including interventional radiologists often may be involved early in these cases before the establishment of a diagnosis as these patients may present with manifestations attributable to occlusive vascular syndromes. In this article, we discuss the presenting signs and symptoms of patients with vasculitis as well as laboratory and imaging studies required to further evaluate these disorders and treatment options, which include interventional as well as noninterventional options.

### In urticarial vasculitis, long disease duration, high symptom burden, and high need for therapy are linked to low patient-reported quality of life [^736c53af]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a rare and difficult-to-treat chronic skin disease defined by long-lasting urticarial lesions and the histopathologic finding of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. As of yet, little is known about UV patients' perspective on the disease.

Objective

To assess UV patients' perspective on the clinical course, treatment response, greatest challenges, and quality-of-life (QOL) impairment.

Methods

A web-based questionnaire was disseminated in a Facebook group of patients with UV. Patients with UV confirmed by skin biopsy were included.

Results

Patients with UV had a mean age of 47.3 ± 12.3 years and were mostly female (94.3%; n = 82 of 87). The median delay in diagnosis was 8.1 months (interquartile range, 2.0–46.3). Normocomplementemia and hypocomplementemia were present in 54.0% (n = 27) and 46.0% (n = 23) of 50 patients, respectively. Most patients with UV (51.8%; n = 43 of 83) reported severely decreased QOL due to their disease. Low QOL was also the most frequently reported greatest challenge for patients with UV (40.7%), followed by the long-standing course of UV with frequent relapses (14.8%). Low QOL correlated with long disease duration (r = 0.298; P = 0.02) and high numbers of clinical symptoms (r = 0.294; P = 0.007). Patients with UV with allergies, lung diseases, and chronic infections reported lower QOL. Patients with UV with low QOL were treated with analgesics, dapsone, montelukast, omalizumab, and colchicine more often than patients with UV with higher QOL (P < .05 for all).

Conclusions

Our results show a considerable impairment in QOL in patients with UV associated with long disease duration, high symptom burden, and a high need for therapy. Improvement of the management of UV by further research is necessary.

Background

Biopsy specimens of lesions with clinical features of urticarial vasculitis often show a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils and red blood cell extravasation. Only occasionally is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis encountered, confirming a diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical presentation and histologic features of patients who meet the clinical criteria for urticarial vasculitis.

Methods

Patients were recruited who had persistent urticarial lesions individually lasting longer than 24 hours, associated with at least 2 of 3 of the following: pain or tenderness; purpura or dusky changes; and resolution with hyperpigmentation. Patients were interviewed based on a standard questionnaire with regard to their symptoms. Blood tests and chest radiographs were performed to exclude systemic involvement and hypocomplementemia. Skin biopsy specimens were sent for histology and direct immunofluorescence.

Results

Of 22 patients recruited, 19 (86.4%) showed a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate on histology. Three cases (13.6%) had a neutrophil-predominant infiltrate associated with a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Twenty (90.9%) had a superficial perivascular infiltrate, and two (9.1%) had a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate. In all, 21 biopsy specimens (95.5%) showed inflammatory cells within dermal blood vessel walls, obscuring the vessel outline in some. Endothelial cell swelling was seen in 20 biopsy specimens (90.9%), erythrocyte extravasation in 17 (77.3%), nuclear dust in 5 (22.7%), and fibrin extravasation in 2 (9.1%). Multivariate analysis revealed the following features to be independently associated with neutrophil predominance: fulfillment of all 3 minor criteria for urticarial vasculitis-like lesions (P = 0.007); presence of fibrin on histology (P < .001); presence of nuclear dust on histology (P = 0.001); hypocomplementemia (P = 0.001); and anemia (P = 0.015). There was a trend toward lesions not clearing as readily in the neutrophil-predominant group (P = 0.071), even with two-modality treatment (P = 0.089).

Limitations

Serum immunoelectrophoresis was not done to exclude Schnitzler's syndrome. Electronmicroscopy and cytokine profiling were not performed.

Conclusion

Biopsy specimens of lesions with clinical features of urticarial vasculitis reveal that only a minority of patients has leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The majority has a lymphocyte-predominant histology, associated with varying numbers of eosinophils. We favor a lymphocytic vasculitis as a causative explanation in the lymphocyte-predominant group.
