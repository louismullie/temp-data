## Question

can dehydration cause aki

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dehydration can cause acute kidney injury and how to understand the mechanism, evidence, and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking dehydration to renal hypoperfusion and tubular injury. Then, I should verify the epidemiologic and clinical evidence across settings. Next, I will examine special populations and risk modifiers. After that, I need to distinguish prerenal azotemia from intrinsic AKI and consider biomarker nuances. Finally, I will translate this into practical prevention and management steps, including fluid strategy and medication adjustments, and close with a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic plausibility. Dehydration reduces effective circulating volume, lowering mean arterial pressure and renal perfusion pressure, which triggers renal vasoconstriction and afferent arteriolar constriction, decreasing glomerular filtration rate. If sustained, this can progress from functional prerenal azotemia to ischemic acute tubular injury, especially in nephron segments with high oxygen demand and limited anaerobic reserve, such as the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb, making them vulnerable to hypoxia and energy failure [^112vGJEU] [^117WwW58].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence across populations. Large multinational data show dehydration is a leading cause of AKI globally, particularly in lower-income settings where dehydration accounted for 46% of community-acquired AKI cases, compared with 32% in upper-middle-income and 39% in high-income countries, underscoring its real-world importance as an etiologic driver of AKI [^114LbVJp]. I should also note that in high-income settings, dehydration remains a recognized precipitant, especially among older adults with reduced renal reserve and comorbidities, reinforcing the need for vigilance in susceptible groups [^111pc4Gq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without considering special populations. Athletes undergoing rapid weight loss and intense training demonstrate elevated AKI biomarkers during dehydration phases, indicating that even healthy individuals can develop AKI when dehydration is combined with high workload, and repeated episodes may carry long-term renal consequences, though causality for CKD remains under study [^113wjG3f] [^115MWPXU]. I need to check occupational data too: field studies in agricultural and construction workers show high rates of dehydration and concurrent AKI on workdays, supporting a dose-response relationship between heat stress, dehydration, and kidney injury risk [^117D4KrH] [^115c3K1s].

> Let me consider iatrogenic and medication-related contributors. GLP-1 receptor agonists and fixed-dose combinations containing liraglutide carry FDA warnings for AKI due to volume depletion from gastrointestinal losses, and tirzepatide labeling similarly notes AKI associated with dehydration from GI adverse effects, highlighting how medication-induced fluid losses can precipitate prerenal AKI in ambulatory patients [^116dGw4W] [^115zoZFb] [^117Wkvs1]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline-based prevention advice to assess and correct hypovolemia and avoid nephrotoxins in at-risk patients, which it does [^115WnXbc].

> Next, I should review the prerenal-to-intrinsic spectrum. Initially, dehydration causes a functional decline in GFR without structural injury. With persistent hypoperfusion, tubular epithelial cells become ischemic and necrotic, producing acute tubular injury that may not fully recover and can transition to chronic kidney disease, particularly with repeated insults or additional nephrotoxic exposures [^117WwW58] [^113LsPJo]. But wait, what if biomarkers blur this dichotomy? Emerging data suggest that so-called prerenal AKI often shows low-level injury biomarker elevation, implying a continuum rather than a binary divide, which cautions me to avoid overcalling "pure prerenal" when injury signals are present [^115H1KWk].

> I will now examine the role of repeated or cyclical dehydration. Mechanistic and observational work links recurrent dehydration to tubulointerstitial injury, with fructose-metabolism pathways and vasopressin-mediated effects proposed as contributors. Case series describe individuals progressing from repeated dehydration-associated AKI to CKD, mirroring patterns seen in Mesoamerican nephropathy, though confounding exposures complicate attribution and warrant cautious interpretation [^111ohWn1] [^116H4Ca8] [^111RRd1Q]. Let me reconsider the strength of evidence: while biologically plausible and epidemiologically coherent, much of this remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, so I should frame it as a credible risk signal rather than proven causality in every context [^113LsPJo].

> Next, I should review prevention and early management principles. Early correction of intravascular volume depletion with isotonic crystalloids is foundational, but fluids should be individualized and stopped once euvolemia is achieved to avoid fluid overload, which itself worsens kidney outcomes. Balanced crystalloids are reasonable in many settings, and starches should be avoided due to harm [^115Y3xdJ] [^115se755] [^1161eqHR]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with a staged approach: yes, expert guidance supports early resuscitation followed by conservative fluid management and timely de-resuscitation once hemodynamically stable, integrating frequent reassessment of volume status and urine output trends [^115WnXbc] [^1147Cvx6].

> I need to ensure medication-related risk is addressed. Temporarily withholding RAAS inhibitors, NSAIDs, and diuretics during intercurrent illnesses causing vomiting, diarrhea, or fever reduces the risk of prerenal AKI in susceptible patients; this is repeatedly emphasized in primary care and nephrology literature and should be operationalized in care pathways for dehydration-risk episodes [^112soBCV] [^1166h7ys]. Let me double-check that this aligns with broader AKI prevention guidance to avoid nephrotoxins and optimize volume status, which it does [^115WnXbc].

> But wait, what about contrast and procedural contexts where dehydration intersects with other insults? Dehydration is a recognized risk factor for contrast-associated AKI, and pre-procedural oral hydration alone is generally insufficient in high-risk patients; isotonic intravenous saline before and after contrast is recommended in those at increased risk, with attention to minimizing contrast dose and avoiding preparatory dehydration [^114Anr3s] [^114Uy9ta]. I should confirm that this applies particularly when eGFR is reduced or comorbid risk is high, which is consistent with cardiology and radiology guidance [^114iUNpY] [^117MWDyy].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Yes, dehydration can cause acute kidney injury, primarily via renal hypoperfusion leading to prerenal azotemia that may evolve to ischemic acute tubular injury if uncorrected. The evidence spans mechanistic physiology, multinational epidemiology, and clinical observations across athletes, workers, and patients with medication-induced fluid losses, with repeated episodes posited to contribute to CKD in some settings, though causality is complex and multifactorial [^112vGJEU] [^114LbVJp] [^113wjG3f] [^111ohWn1]. I should emphasize that prompt recognition, early isotonic fluid resuscitation to restore intravascular volume, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and judicious medication management during dehydration-risk events are key to preventing and mitigating dehydration-associated AKI [^115WnXbc] [^115Y3xdJ] [^112soBCV].

---

Yes, dehydration can cause **acute kidney injury (AKI)** through renal hypoperfusion and ischemia, especially in vulnerable patients or when combined with nephrotoxins or comorbidities [^112vGJEU] [^116QRuer]. AKI risk rises with the severity and duration of dehydration, and repeated episodes can lead to **chronic kidney disease** [^111ohWn1] [^113wjG3f]. Early recognition and prompt isotonic fluid resuscitation are essential to prevent or reverse AKI; avoid over-resuscitation to prevent fluid overload, which can worsen outcomes [^115Y3xdJ] [^114sfsAy].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking dehydration to AKI

Dehydration reduces intravascular volume, lowering renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), causing **prerenal azotemia** — a functional decline that is reversible with timely correction [^116Htf3U]. Persistent hypoperfusion leads to ischemic **acute tubular necrosis (ATN)**, a structural injury with higher morbidity and mortality [^116Htf3U]. Dehydration also activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system, worsening renal vasoconstriction and ischemia [^116PLjPo].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies and guidelines confirm dehydration as a **recognized cause of AKI**:

- **Global burden**: Dehydration is a leading cause of AKI, especially in low-resource settings, and was the most frequent cause in lower-income countries in the ISN 0by25 study [^114LbVJp].
- **Occupational risk**: Agricultural and construction workers exposed to heat and dehydration have high rates of AKI, with dehydration identified as a key driver [^117D4KrH] [^115c3K1s].
- **Athletes**: Rapid weight loss and dehydration in combat sports increase AKI risk, with repeated episodes linked to CKD [^113wjG3f] [^115MWPXU].
- **Clinical guidelines**: KDIGO and ERBP highlight dehydration as a major AKI risk and recommend early detection and correction of volume depletion [^116QRuer] [^115se755].

---

## Risk factors and patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients are at **higher risk of dehydration-induced AKI**:

| **Risk factor** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| Elderly | Reduced renal reserve, impaired thirst, and comorbidities increase susceptibility [^111pc4Gq] |
| Chronic kidney disease (CKD) | Diminished renal reserve heightens vulnerability to hypoperfusion [^116QRuer] |
| Diabetes mellitus | Osmotic diuresis and autonomic neuropathy increase dehydration risk [^notfound] |
| Heart failure | Compromised cardiac output limits renal perfusion during dehydration [^112soBCV] |
| Liver disease | Impaired fluid handling and RAAS activation increase risk [^notfound] |
| Medications | Diuretics, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors exacerbate dehydration and renal hypoperfusion [^112soBCV] [^116zE6cT] |

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Dehydration-related AKI typically presents with:

- **Oliguria**: Reduced urine output (< 0.5 mL/kg/h) [^116CgFts].
- **Elevated creatinine**: Rise in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or ≥ 1.5-fold from baseline [^116CgFts].
- **Signs of dehydration**: Dry mucosa, tachycardia, hypotension, and orthostatic changes [^112zK2mp].
- **Laboratory findings**: Elevated BUN, concentrated urine, and low fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) in prerenal states [^notfound].

---

## Prevention and management strategies

Effective prevention and management focus on **early recognition and targeted interventions**:

- **Early detection**: Monitor at-risk patients for dehydration and AKI using creatinine and urine output [^116QRuer].
- **Fluid resuscitation**: Use isotonic crystalloids (e.g. normal saline or balanced solutions) to restore intravascular volume and renal perfusion [^115se755] [^115Y3xdJ].
- **Avoid fluid overload**: Use conservative fluid strategies after initial resuscitation to prevent edema and delayed recovery [^114sfsAy] [^1147Cvx6].
- **Medication review**: Temporarily stop nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, diuretics) during dehydration episodes [^112soBCV] [^1166h7ys].
- **Education**: Teach patients to recognize dehydration and maintain adequate hydration, especially during illness or heat exposure [^111pc4Gq] [^116kZkZ3].

---

## Potential complications and long-term consequences

Untreated dehydration-related AKI can cause **significant morbidity**:

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Repeated AKI episodes can cause permanent nephron loss and CKD [^111ohWn1] [^113LsPJo].
- **Increased mortality**: AKI is associated with higher short- and long-term mortality [^1174XRkG] [^116CgFts].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload are common [^115bjeSL].
- **Need for renal replacement therapy**: Severe cases may require dialysis [^1164os86].

---

Dehydration is a **preventable cause of AKI** via renal hypoperfusion and ischemia; prompt recognition and isotonic fluid resuscitation are critical to prevent progression and reduce morbidity.

### Are diuretics harmful in the management of acute kidney injury? [^113tQ7DQ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To assess the role of diuretics in acute kidney injury (AKI) and their effectiveness in preventing AKI, achieving fluid balance, and decreasing progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent Findings

Diuretics are associated with increased risk for AKI. The theoretical advantage of diuretic-induced preservation of renal medullary oxygenation to prevent AKI has not been proven. A higher cumulative diuretic dose during the dialysis period can cause hypotension and increase mortality in a dose-dependent manner. Data on the use of forced euvolemic diuresis to prevent AKI remains controversial. Positive fluid balance has emerged as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes. Post-AKI furosemide dose had a favorable effect on mortality due in part to the reduction of positive fluid balance. There are exciting experimental data suggesting that spironolactone may prevent AKI once an ischemic insult has occurred and thus prevent the progression to CKD.

Summary

Diuretics are ineffective and even detrimental in the prevention and treatment of AKI, and neither shorten the duration of AKI, nor reduce the need for renal replacement therapy. Diuretics have an important role in volume management in AKI, but they are not recommended for the prevention of AKI. There is increased emphasis on the prevention of progression of AKI to CKD.

### Dehydration-associated chronic kidney disease: a novel case of kidney failure in China [^116H4Ca8]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Mesoamerican nephropathy (MeN) is a pattern of chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalent among Central American men who work in agriculture, and its underlying cause has not been elucidated. Currently, experts hypothesize that MeN is related to repeated episodes of occupational heat stress leading to water loss and hence it is also called dehydration-associated CKD.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 40-year-old man, whose first admission to Peking Union Medical College Hospital was due to acute kidney injury (AKI). The clinical and pathological processes were consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). However, after full recovery, CKD developed 1 year later. The second renal biopsy showed characteristics of ischemic renal disease but there was no evidence of vascular disease. It is worth noting that the patient had been taking part in long-distance running without drinking adequate water for years, which would have markedly decrease his renal blood flow. Thus, this patient may have developed chronic dehydration-associated kidney disease sharing the similar etiology of MeN.

Conclusions

We report here a case of dehydration-associated CKD in a Chinese patient which shared similar etiology to MeN. Even in non-agricultural areas, this etiology of CKD should be noted to obtain a relevant history and prompt diagnosis.

### Fluid balance and acute kidney injury [^114sfsAy]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluids are widely administered to patients who have, or are at risk of, acute kidney injury (AKI). However, deleterious consequences of overzealous fluid therapy are increasingly being recognized. Salt and water overload can predispose to organ dysfunction, impaired wound healing and nosocomial infection, particularly in patients with AKI, in whom fluid challenges are frequent and excretion is impaired. In this Review article, we discuss how interstitial edema can further delay renal recovery and why conservative fluid strategies are now being advocated. Applying these strategies in critical illness is challenging. Although volume resuscitation is needed to restore cardiac output, it often leads to tissue edema, thereby contributing to ongoing organ dysfunction. Conservative strategies of fluid management mandate a switch towards neutral balance and then negative balance once hemodynamic stabilization is achieved. In patients with AKI, this strategy might require renal replacement therapy to be given earlier than when more-liberal fluid management is used. However, hypovolemia and renal hypoperfusion can occur in patients with AKI if excessive fluid removal is pursued with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy. Thus, accurate assessment of fluid status and careful definition of targets are needed at all stages to improve clinical outcomes. A conservative strategy of fluid management was recently tested and found to be effective in a large, randomized, controlled trial in patients with acute lung injury. Similar randomized, controlled studies in patients with AKI now seem justified.

### Some biomarkers of acute kidney injury are increased in pre-renal acute injury [^115H1KWk]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Although patients were vigorously hydrated in accordance with ICU practice, our study was limited by a lack of fluid balance data to rule out volume depletion or objectify the response to deliberate fluid loading. Similarly, we lack data on diuretic use. By normalizing the biomarkers to urinary creatinine, we account, at least in part, for any potential differences in fluid loading. Although the largest study of its kind, the study remains limited by size; nearly 8% of patients were excluded because of insufficient follow-up plasma creatinine measurements or death before 48 h after admission. NGAL results were unavailable in another 4% of patients. Consequently, the modest number of patients in each group after stratification for duration and FENa means that the conclusions require validation in larger studies.

In summary, in critically ill patients, urinary biomarkers of injury increase in concentration with duration of AKI regardless of whether there is preservation of tubular function, as typified by a low FENa. This suggests that pre-renal AKI is simply a mild form of structural AKI rather than a unique functional form of AKI. Early return of renal function, as demonstrated by a decrease in creatinine, probably represents recovery, not reversibility, of a unique 'physiological' increase in serum creatinine. Although it remains theoretically possible that GFR may decrease in the absence of renal tubular injury, until there are studies demonstrating that urinary biomarkers of renal injury are absent in such cases, we suggest that the term 'pre-renal mechanisms' be used for classifying etiology but not type of AKI. Perhaps in the future AKI may be categorized according to extent of injury (biomarker concentration), extent and duration of glomerular functional change, and preservation or otherwise of sodium reabsorption or other tubular functions.

### Rehydration with fructose worsens dehydration-induced renal damage [^115eiAPP]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, rehydration with fructose in a model of heat stress and dehydration was associated with significant increased renal inflammation and a tendency for worse renal outcomes compared to equivalent rehydration with water. We recommend additional studies to investigate what concentrations of fructose and glucose may provide benefit for maintaining glucose stores while at the same time minimizing the risk for renal injury in the dehydrated patient.

### Acute kidney injury [^114DQC2P]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by a sudden decrease in glomerular filtration rate, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or oliguria, and classified by stage and cause. This type of injury occurs in approximately 20% of hospitalized patients, with major complications including volume overload, electrolyte disorders, uremic complications, and drug toxicity. Management includes specific treatments according to the underlying cause and supportive treatment to prevent and manage complications. Kidney replacement therapy is used when complications cannot be managed with medical therapy alone. Despite advances in care, the mortality rate in patients requiring kidney replacement therapy remains approximately 50%.

### Evaluating renal microcirculation in patients with acute kidney injury by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography: a protocol for an observational cohort study [^111rJF71]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function within a few hours to a few days. The prognosis of AKI is poor, and it has been reported that the mortality rate of AKI in critically ill patients can even reach 80 percent in some studies. Kidney damage varies according to the primary insult, including kidney ischemia, nephrotoxins exposure, dehydration or sepsis. Changes in intra-renal microcirculation and tissue oxygenation are currently considered essential pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the development and progression of AKI. Early morphological alterations are driven by a delicate balance between energy demand and oxygen supply. Functional changes in renal microcirculation are common initial factors, that timely fluid and vasoactive agents therapies could make AKI reversible potentially. Therefore, it is fundamental to identify the decrease of intra-renal micro-perfusion early.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^113jxCKX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hypotension and dehydration, which are common complications of acute infection, are among the leading causes of AKI, and infection-associated AKI has been associated with higher severity of illness, longer hospital stays, and increased mortality among hospitalized patients. – Like other viral respiratory infections such as influenza, many patients with COVID-19 develop AKI, and a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of AKI in COVID-19 found the incidence of AKI in this setting to be 12.3%. Acute kidney injury in the setting of COVID-19 frequently develops during the second week of infection.

The causes of COVID-19–associated AKI are likely multifactorial, and are thought to include direct viral injury to kidney cells, dehydration, sepsis-mediated hypotension or immunologic injury, and microvascular disease. Care of patients with COVID-19 should include screening for AKI, prevention of AKI development or worsening, and treatment of AKI, including treatment of renal failure. Each of these important clinical components can be challenging, as clinicians seek to balance the risks and benefits of treatments such as fluid resuscitation, antiviral medications, antibiotics for bacterial superinfection, and anti-inflammatory medications. These challenges are further impacted by limited human and physical resources. Here, we review the current literature on prevention, detection, and treatment of AKI among patients with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

### Management of severe paediatric malaria in resource-limited settings [^114nRBhy]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The aetiology of renal injury in the paediatric kidney is unknown and may reflect multiple insults including hypovolaemia or dehydration (pre-renal failure) and direct tubular or glomerular injury. Pathological studies in adults with severe malaria have shown sequestration of parasitised red cells in glomerular and tubulo-interstitial vessels and acute tubular damage due to accumulation of monocytes in glomerular capillaries. The level of sequestration in the kidney was greater in those who developed renal failure than in fatal cases without renal failure. No equivalent autopsy data are available for African children. WHO malaria treatment guidelines consider acute kidney injury as a serum creatinine level > 250 mmol/L in adults but does not indicate any criteria for children. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of renal involvement are needed, as is rational integrated fluid management and other supportive treatment in paediatric malaria, which do not currently exist.

### Acute kidney injury [^1142XM1n]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a syndrome characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney's excretory function and is typically diagnosed by the accumulation of end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea and creatinine) or decreased urine output, or both. It is the clinical manifestation of several disorders that affect the kidney acutely. Acute kidney injury is common in hospital patients and very common in critically ill patients. In these patients, it is most often secondary to extrarenal events. How such events cause acute kidney injury is controversial. No specific therapies have emerged that can attenuate acute kidney injury or expedite recovery; thus, treatment is supportive. New diagnostic techniques (eg, renal biomarkers) might help with early diagnosis. Patients are given renal replacement therapy if acute kidney injury is severe and biochemical or volume-related, or if uraemic-toxaemia-related complications are of concern. If patients survive their illness and do not have premorbid chronic kidney disease, they typically recover to dialysis independence. However, evidence suggests that patients who have had acute kidney injury are at increased risk of subsequent chronic kidney disease.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^111R9Kdg]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — renal toxicities with immune checkpoint inhibitors: Immune-related renal toxicities include nephritis or acute kidney injury (AKI), with the median time to onset of renal toxicities 14 weeks (range 6.5 to 21 weeks), and presenting symptoms that may include urinary frequency, dark cloudy urine; fluid retention (edema) of face, abdomen and extremities; sudden weight gain; abdominal or pelvic pain; nausea or vomiting; high blood pressure; and/or change in mental status, such as drowsiness. Checkpoint inhibitor therapy appears to be safe in patients with baseline renal impairment from a nonimmune basis, whereas patients with a renal allograft are at high risk of rejecting the transplanted kidney and requiring dialysis; limited data suggest that the risk of renal allograft rejection with anti–CTLA-4 antibodies may be less than the near-universal rejection seen with PD1 pathway blockers, and PD-1 pathway blockers should only be considered with multidisciplinary input from renal transplant nephrology team. Patients should have serum creatinine checked before every dose of checkpoint inhibitor therapy; for those with new elevations in creatinine, one should consider holding therapy while other potential causes are evaluated (eg, recent intravenous [IV] radiographic contrast administration, dehydration, other nephrotoxic medicines including concomitant CTX, and urinary tract infection). Patients without other obvious causes or who do not respond to alternative treatment measures should be presumed to have immune-related renal toxicity and treated empirically, and renal biopsy is typically not necessary or recommended unless the AKI is refractory to steroids and other immunosuppressant agents.

### Fluid overload and acute kidney injury: cause or consequence? [^114bsQoe]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Fluid overload, AKI and poor outcomes are clearly associated. However, whether AKI has caused fluid overload or vice versa can be difficult to determine. Better tools are necessary to measure intravascular volume status. Until then, fluid therapy needs to be personalised with physiological end-points, guided by dynamic tests like PLR manoeuvre, and monitored by using cumulative fluid balance coupled, where possible, with daily weights to avoid the adverse outcomes associated with fluid overload.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1164os86]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline suggested initiating RRT emergently in the presence of life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance. Since 2012, data from several RCTs and observational studies have become available. However, the optimal timing for acute RRT remains unknown. It has been proposed that initiation of RRT should be considered when metabolic and fluid demands exceed the kidney's capacity to meet them. – This concept acknowledges the dynamic nature of acute illness and stresses the importance of regular evaluation of the demand and renal capacity relationship. However, the exact methods for determining demand and capacity are unknown. Existing evidence does not support using biomarkers when deciding whether to initiate RRT. Use of a standardized FST can be considered in AKI, to further quantify the likelihood of AKI progression, and integrated into the spectrum of clinical information available when planning for and deciding to initiate RRT. In determining whether or not to start RRT, risk of complications, global prognosis, potential for recovery, and patient preferences should be considered (Figure 3). Although some regions of the globe have challenges and constraints in providing universal access to RRT, we recommend a similar approach be undertaken for considering for whom and when to start RRT in all regions. – Additionally, a similar approach should be undertaken in both intensive care unit and non–intensive care unit settings.

### Impact of early postbariatric surgery acute kidney injury on long-term renal function [^116XX7TY]. Obesity Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bariatric surgery can improve renal dysfunction associated with obesity and diabetes. However, acute kidney injury (AKI) can complicate the early postoperative course after bariatric surgery. The long-term consequences of early postoperative AKI on renal function are unknown.

Methods

Patient undergoing bariatric surgery from 2008 to 2015 who developed AKI within 60 days after surgery were studied. Patients on dialysis before surgery were excluded.

Results

Out of 4722 patients, 42 patients (0.9%) developed early postoperative AKI after bariatric surgery of whom five had chronic kidney disease (CKD) preoperatively including CKD stage 3 (n = 2), stage 4 (n = 2), and stage 5 (n = 1). Etiologies of AKI included prerenal in 37 and renal in 5 patients. Nine patients (21%) underwent hemodialysis in early postoperative period for AKI. The median duration of follow-up was 28 months (interquartile range, 4–59). Of the 40 patients eligible for follow-up, 36 patients (90%) returned to their baseline renal function. However, four patients (10%) had worsening of renal function at follow-up.

Conclusions

The incidence of early postoperative AKI after bariatric surgery is about 1%. The most common causes of AKI after bariatric surgery are dehydration and infectious complications. In our series, 10% of patients who developed AKI in early postoperative period had worsening of renal function in long-term follow-up. In the absence of severe sepsis and severe underlying kidney dysfunction (CKD stages 4 and 5), full recovery is expected after postoperative AKI.

### Comparison of clinical and biochemical markers of dehydration with the clinical dehydration scale in children: a case comparison trial [^116mrCZm]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In total, six biochemical and two clinical parameters distinguished dehydrated patients from the comparison group. As expected, these included: diastolic blood pressure z-score, heart rate z-score, urine Na/K ratio, urine Na, FeNA, blood urea and serum bicarbonate and creatinine. It should be noted that the urea differences, albeit significant, were not clinically relevant. Unforeseen, however, were the categories that did not identify children with dehydration. These included percent dehydration and urine osmolality. Numerous studies have used percent dehydration as a gold standard to quantify the degree of dehydration in a child, Unfortunately, despite the assistance of trained and dedicated research nurses to perform and ensure adequate and consistent weight measurement prior to and following treatment, the difference in percent dehydration did not reach statistical significance. This further supports the subjectivity of this parameter despite employing specific training. Furthermore, other factors that contribute to weight gain or loss during an acute illness episode may have influenced these findings, including the amount of rehydration, decreased intake, ongoing oral/rectal and urinary losses, increased insensible losses and an increased catabolic rate. Additionally, intravascular volume may be the most important factor in complications associated with dehydration such as hypo-volemic shock or acute kidney injury. Severe dehydration requires prompt restoration of intravascular volume through intravenous administration of fluids followed by oral rehydration therapy. Body water movement from compartment to compartment during any time period can be attributed to forces active within and upon each space. These forces lead to water transfer between intravascular and extravascular compartments and shifts between extracellular and intracellular spaces, and may be independent of body weight.

### Preventing acute kidney injury and its longer-term impact in the critically ill [^111mg36D]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden (within 7 days) loss of kidney function that is determined on the basis of reduced urinary output and/or increased serum creatinine levels. Acute kidney disease (AKD) includes a variety of acute and subacute kidney conditions, including AKI, lasting for up to 90 days. AKD can persist after incomplete resolution of an AKI episode or AKD can develop without ever meeting AKI criteria, for example, when kidney dysfunction evolves slowly. Kidney dysfunction lasting for > 3 months is referred to as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

As the diagnostic markers of AKI, serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output (UO), have poor sensitivity and specificity, it is possible that a healthy individual with transient volume depletion could fulfill the diagnostic criteria of AKI without having kidney injury or long-term health implications. Therefore, clinical judgement is required to diagnose AKI and consider the clinical context. AKI persisting despite volume repletion likely reflects structural damage to the kidney. Similarly, drugs that affect glomerular filtration may cause small changes in SCr levels that are not necessarily indicative of kidney injury.

AKI is a syndrome affecting 10–15% of hospitalized patients and more than 50% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. AKI can be caused by different etiologies and the large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Recent evidence demonstrates that the AKI burden extends beyond the acute phase with progression to CKD, recurrent episodes of AKI, increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and reduced long-term survival. Finding specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by the late diagnosis and the fact that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation. Existing animal models fail to recapitulate the complexity of human AKI, which is often multifactorial. In addition, many clinical trials do not enroll patients with the precise mechanisms and timing modeled in animal experiments thereby limiting translation. Therefore, the main focus lies on preventing AKI development and progression. Recently, several trials have identified measures to prevent the development of AKI in different settings.

In this narrative review, we discuss methods for early diagnosis of AKI, AKI-CKD transition, preventive strategies, as well as the choice of endpoints for AKI prevention trials. A discussion of other AKI etiologies (e.g. glomerulonephritis, vasculitis), AKI management and renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management [^111NmB7g]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. Severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine level. Etiologies of acute kidney injury are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present (e.g., older male with prostatic hypertrophy). General management principles for acute kidney injury include determination of volume status, fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treatment of volume overload with diuretics, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and adjustment of prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control. Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and reduced risk of progression. Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause, stage 3 or higher acute kidney injury, preexisting stage 4 or higher chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, and other situations requiring subspecialist expertise.

### Prevention of acute kidney injury and protection of renal function in the intensive care unit: update 2017: expert opinion of the working group on prevention, AKI section, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^1153BN4b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Although it seems prudent to correct hypovolaemia before contrast administration, prophylactic volume expansion in critically ll patients who are euvolaemic cannot be recommended on the basis of current data. No study demonstrates protection of pre-emptive volume expansion against CA-AKI in the critically ill. An RCT comparing hydration with isotonic bicarbonate versus normal saline failed to show superiority of either regimen but reported an excessively high rate of CA-AKI of 33% in both groups, which may be attributed to severity of illness in this critically ill cohort. Importantly, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), hydration volumes above 11 ml/kg body weight (BW) were associated with continuously increased rates of AKI, requirement for RRT and mortality. The adjusted OR for developing AKI with hydration volumes greater than 25 ml/kg BW was 2.11 (CI 1.24–3.59). We recommend that the clinical decision to perform a contrast study in ICU patients must weigh the potential benefits with the low but probably not zero risk of CA-AKI.

### Kidney physiology and susceptibility to acute kidney injury: implications for renoprotection [^112vGJEU]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Kidney damage varies according to the primary insult. Different aetiologies of acute kidney injury (AKI), including kidney ischaemia, exposure to nephrotoxins, dehydration or sepsis, are associated with characteristic patterns of damage and changes in gene expression, which can provide insight into the mechanisms that lead to persistent structural and functional damage. Early morphological alterations are driven by a delicate balance between energy demand and oxygen supply, which varies considerably in different regions of the kidney. The functional heterogeneity of the various nephron segments is reflected in their use of different metabolic pathways. AKI is often linked to defects in kidney oxygen supply, and some nephron segments might not be able to shift to anaerobic metabolism under low oxygen conditions or might have remarkably low basal oxygen levels, which enhances their vulnerability to damage. Here, we discuss why specific kidney regions are at particular risk of injury and how this information might help to delineate novel routes for mitigating injury and avoiding permanent damage. We suggest that the physiological heterogeneity of the kidney should be taken into account when exploring novel renoprotective strategies, such as improvement of kidney tissue oxygenation, stimulation of hypoxia signalling pathways and modulation of cellular energy metabolism.

### Cyclical dehydration-induced renal injury and mesoamerican nephropathy: as sweet by any other name? [^114jFGxw]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Severe cyclical dehydration induces chronic renal injury in rodents. This effect is attenuated by global fructokinase deficiency, suggesting possible roles for fructokinase and fructose metabolism in mediating or promoting dehydration-induced injury. Clinical and pathological similarities between this injury model and endemic Mesoamerican nephropathy (MeN) have fueled speculation that dehydration-induced injury and MeN may share common mechanistic underpinnings involving fructokinase that can be targeted to mitigate disease development, progression, and/or severity.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^113Bvx9Y]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypertonic sodium solution administration — acute kidney injury (AKI) risk mitigation recommendations are as follows: We suggest that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia during treatment with hypertonic sodium solutions should be avoided due to the association with acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). An upper serum sodium range of 155–160 mEq/L and a serum chloride range of 110–115 mEq/L may be reasonable to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should routinely monitor both sodium and chloride serum concentrations to assess risk of AKI related to elevated concentrations (good practice statement), and renal function should be monitored closely in patients receiving hypertonic sodium solutions due to the risk of AKI with hyperosmolar therapy (good practice statement). For monitoring frequency, clinicians should use patient-specific factors with ranging from twice daily to every 2 h based on rapidity of change to interventions.

### The kidney under heat stress: a vulnerable state [^111sJDVF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the effects of occupational heat stress on kidney health. It focuses on the role of hyperthermia in the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) and its potential progression to chronic kidney disease of nontraditional etiology (CKDnt). We highlight the physiological mechanisms by which hyperthermia affects kidney function and discuss emerging preventive strategies.

Recent Findings

Hyperthermia places the kidneys in a vulnerable state. As body temperature increases, blood flow is directed toward the skin to aid in cooling, diverting it away from internal organs like the kidneys to support blood pressure regulation. At the same time, hyperthermia and dehydration increases energetic demand to promote fluid and electrolyte conservation. Collectively, this can create a localized supply-demand mismatch, resulting in tissue hypoxia that can damage kidney tissues. These findings highlight that heat hyperthermia can lead to subclinical kidney damage, with potential long-term implications for kidney health.

Summary

Heat-induced AKI is a growing public health concern. Individuals engaged in manual labor with prolonged exposure are at risk of CKDnt. Interventions aimed to prevent hyperthermia show promise in mitigating the risk of AKI. Further research is necessary to refine these strategies and establish evidence-based guidelines for reducing heat-related kidney injuries.

### Diuretics for preventing and treating acute kidney injury [^113s4tXG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-known complication of critical illnesses, significantly affecting morbidity and the risk of death. Diuretics are widely used to ameliorate excess fluid accumulation and oliguria associated with AKI. Their popularity stems from their ability to reduce the energy demands of renal tubular cells by inhibiting transporters and flushing out intratubular casts. Numerous studies have assessed the effects of diuretics in the context of AKI prevention and treatment. However, a comprehensive systematic review addressing this topic has yet to be conducted.

Objectives

This review aimed to explore the benefits and harms of diuretics for both the prevention and treatment of AKI.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched up to May 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which diuretics were used to prevent or treat AKI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data using standardised data extraction forms. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was used. The primary review outcomes for AKI prevention studies were the incidence of AKI and any use of kidney replacement therapy (KRT). For treatment studies, the primary outcome was any use of KRT. The certainty of evidence was assessed per outcome using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We included 64 studies (83 reports, 9871 participants): 53 prevention studies (8078 participants) and 11 treatment studies (1793 participants). Studies were conducted in the following World Health Organization regions: the Americas (15), Eastern Mediterranean (9), Europe (25), South-East Asia (2), and the Western Pacific (13). Thirty-six studies were single-centre studies, 19 were multicentre, and the setting was unclear in nine studies. Diuretics were compared to placebo, no treatment or conventional therapy, saline solutions (isotonic or hypotonic), 5% dextrose, 5% glucose, Hartmann's solution, and Ringer's acetate. Overall, the risk of bias was low in one study, high in 19 studies, and of some concern in 41 studies. Three studies could not be assessed because they did not report any outcomes of interest. For AKI prevention, compared to control, diuretics may reduce the risk of AKI (38 studies, 5540 participants: RR 0.75, 95%, CI 0.61 to 0.92; I² = 77%; low-certainty evidence) and probably reduce any use of KRT (32 studies, 4658 participants: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.91; I² = 0%, moderate-certainty evidence) and death (33 studies, 6447 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). The use of diuretics may result in little or no difference in the need for permanent dialysis (2 studies, 956 participants: RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.47; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence), hypotension (7 studies, 775 participants: RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.86; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence) and hypokalaemia (6 studies, 1383 participants: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.73; I² = 43%; low-certainty evidence), and had uncertain effects on arrhythmias (13 studies, 3375 participants: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.04; I² = 53%; very-low certainty evidence). Diuretics may make little or no difference to changes in SCr within 30 days (8 studies, 646 participants: SMD 0.41, 95% CI -0.01, to 0.83; I² = 82%; low-certainty evidence) but it was uncertain whether diuretics increased urinary output (8 studies, 1155 participants: SMD 1.87, 95% CI -0.20 to 3.95; I² = 99%; very low-certainty evidence). For AKI treatment, diuretics may make little or no difference to any use of KRT (8 studies, 1275 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.04; I² = 2%; low-certainty evidence) or death (14 studies, 2052 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.22; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Diuretics may increase hypotension (2 studies, 720 participants: RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.41; I² = 90%; low-certainty evidence) and probably increase arrhythmias (6 studies, 1011 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.33; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). Diuretics may result in little or no difference in hypokalaemia (3 studies, 478 participants: RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.31; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). It was uncertain whether diuretics increased urinary output (3 studies, 329 participants: SMD 4.40, 95% CI -0.94 to 9.74; I² = 99%; very low-certainty evidence). The need for permanent dialysis and changes in serum creatinine were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

When used for the prevention of AKI, diuretics may reduce the risk of AKI. However, our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. Diuretics probably reduce the incidence of KRT use, and we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. When used for the treatment of AKI, diuretics may make little or no difference to any use of KRT, and our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. More RCTs are needed to explore the role of diuretics for treating established AKI.

### Acute kidney injury: an increasing global concern [^112XELTZ]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Despite an increasing incidence of acute kidney injury in both high-income and low-income countries and growing insight into the causes and mechanisms of disease, few preventive and therapeutic options exist. Even small acute changes in kidney function can result in short-term and long-term complications, including chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and death. Presence of more than one comorbidity results in high severity of illness scores in all medical settings. Development or progression of chronic kidney disease after one or more episode of acute kidney injury could have striking socioeconomic and public health outcomes for all countries. Concerted international action encompassing many medical disciplines is needed to aid early recognition and management of acute kidney injury.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^115bjeSL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

1.2: Risk assessment

1.2.1 We recommend that patients be stratified for risk of AKI according to their susceptibilities, especially pre-existing proteinuria and CKD, and exposures to nephrotoxic medication or interventions. (1C)

1.2.2 We recommend monitoring patients at increased risk for AKI with measurements of serum creatinine and urine output to detect AKI at an early stage. (Ungraded statement). Frequency and duration of monitoring should be planned based on patient risk and clinical course. (Ungraded statement).

1.2.3 We recommend developing and implementing pathways of care at the broader hospital level, in close collaboration with the other individual specialities, to achieve the above-mentioned targets. (Ungraded statement).

Rationale

Risk for AKI is increased by exposure to factors that cause AKI (e.g. nephrotoxic medication) or the presence of factors that increase susceptibility to AKI [e.g. dehydration, co-morbidities, and also pre-existing proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD)]. The interaction between susceptibility and the type and extent of exposure to insults determines the risk of AKI occurrence. Particularly in the hospital setting, the patient's susceptibility should be assessed on a regular basis and some factors modified or even avoided (e.g. administration of potentially nephrotoxic agents). ERBP wants to point out that in patients on dialysis, but with preserved diuresis, it can be of importance to follow-up this parameter after procedures with a risk of deterioration of residual renal function, as unnoticed loss of residual renal function is an important risk factor in this patient group.

As prevention is still the best 'treatment' of AKI, and as many cases of avoidable AKI do not occur in patients in the ICU or on the nephrology ward, but in general wards, ERBP stresses the importance of developing and implementing pathways of care to detect and monitor patients at risk of AKI outside nephrology units and ICUs. These pathways should be developed in collaboration with the different involved specialities, to address the specific needs and risks per particular patient group. Even if patients are only seen after having been exposed to a risk factor, they still should be assessed in order to identify those who are more likely to develop AKI, as well as those who will require closer monitoring and general supportive measures in order to avoid further injury.

### Fluid management for the prevention and attenuation of acute kidney injury [^1147Cvx6]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

In patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), optimization of systemic haemodynamics is central to the clinical management. However, considerable debate exists regarding the efficacy, nature, extent and duration of fluid resuscitation, particularly when the patient has undergone major surgery or is in septic shock. Crucially, volume resuscitation might be required to maintain or restore cardiac output. However, resultant fluid accumulation and tissue oedema can substantially contribute to ongoing organ dysfunction and, particularly in patients developing AKI, serious clinical consequences. In this Review, we discuss the conflict between the desire to achieve adequate resuscitation of shock and the need to mitigate the harmful effects of fluid overload. In patients with AKI, limiting and resolving fluid overload might prompt earlier use of renal replacement therapy. However, rapid or early excessive fluid removal with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy might lead to hypovolaemia and recurrent renal injury. Optimal management might involve a period of guided fluid resuscitation, followed by management of an even fluid balance and, finally, an appropriate rate of fluid removal. To obtain best clinical outcomes, serial fluid status assessment and careful definition of cardiovascular and renal targets will be required during fluid resuscitation and removal.

### Characteristics and outcome of pregnancy-related acute kidney injury in a teaching hospital in a low-resource setting: a five-year retrospective review [^114pmRZF]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy-related kidney injury contributes to a high burden of acute kidney injury in low-resource settings and causes maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Few studies have examined the impact of acute kidney injury in resource-limited countries, with very limited research on pregnancy-specific disorders in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of pregnancy-related acute kidney injury, outcomes and associated factors.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the clinical profile and maternal-fetal outcome of pregnancy-related acute kidney injury at Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in Tigray, Ethiopia, from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. Maternal and fetal outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between the dependent and independent variables.

Results

Of 27,350 mothers who delivered at Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2021, a total of 187 women developed pregnancy-related acute kidney injury, a prevalence rate of 68 per 100,000 births. Preeclampsia, sepsis and pre-renal causes due to dehydration and hemorrhage were the most common causes of pregnancy-related acute kidney injury in this study. Hemodialysis was needed in 8.6% (n = 16) of patients. Of the 187 pregnancy-related acute kidney injuries, 143 (76.5%) recovered completely and 30 (16%) partially. The mortality rate was 7.5%. Preexisting chronic kidney disease (AOR = 30.13; 95% CI: 2.92, 310.84), use of vasoactive agents (AOR = 5.77; 95% CI: 1.47, 22.67), increase in creatinine per unit (AOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.45) and complications related to acute kidney injury (AOR = 5.26; 95% CI: 1.73, 16.00) were determinants of the composite endpoints (partial renal recovery and death).

Conclusions

This study emphasizes acute kidney injury in resource-limited settings is a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The vast majority of patients with pregnancy-related acute kidney injury recovered completely from kidney injury. The main causes of pregnancy-related acute kidney injury were preeclampsia, sepsis and pre-renal associated with hemorrhage and dehydration. Preexisting renal disease, use of vasopressors, increase in creatinine per unit and complications associated with acute kidney injury were determining factors for concomitant fetomaternal mortality. Appropriate preventive strategies during prenatal care and prompt treatment are needed for pregnancy-related acute kidney injury.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114Uy9ta]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous volume expansion versus oral hydration for prevention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI): IV volume expansion reduces the risk of AKI but oral fluid administration does not, and a single meta-analysis included 513 patients in six trials comparing IV saline (five trials utilizing isotonic [0.9%] saline and one trial utilizing 0.45% saline) to various oral regimens. In the only study directly comparing IV isotonic saline to unrestricted oral fluids, only one patient (3.7%) in the saline group developed CA-AKI (defined as an increase in serum creatinine [sCr] by 0.5 mg/dl within 48 hours) versus nine patients (34.6%) with oral hydration (p = 0.005), and the study was terminated early after only 53 patients were enrolled; however, the strength of evidence was Very low and showed no change in incidence when comparing IV isotonic saline to oral mineral water, IV sodium bicarbonate, oral sodium bicarbonate, and water. In one non-inferiority trial there was no significant difference in AKI incidence 2–5 days after receiving contrast (Oral: 4.8% vs. IV: 3.1%; 95% CI: -4.2 to 7), and based on this data, neither oral hydration nor oral sodium loading should be considered adequate as the primary means of prophylaxis in individuals at high-risk for CA-AKI.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^112zK2mp]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydration is a fundamental but confusing area of practice for clinicians working with older people. There is little doubt that addressing dehydration can prevent and treat common disorders such as urinary tract infections, acute kidney injury, orthostatic hypotension, constipation and delirium. However, the assessment of dehydration can be rather subjective, non-evidence based and affected by multiple factors. Once identified, reversing dehydration can be challenging as it often involves behavioural change and overcoming barriers such engrained habits and fear of incontinence.

5. It was recognized that AKI is often superimposed on pre-existing CKD. Further validation will be required to determine whether the criterion of a creatinine elevation of 0.3 mg/dl (25 μmol/l) is applicable to these patients (that is, whether a creatinine increase of more than 0.3 mg/dl from an elevated baseline represents AKI and has the same risks as a creatinine increase from a normal baseline).

6. The need for including urine output as a diagnostic criterion is based on the knowledge of critically ill patients in whom this parameter often heralds renal dysfunction before serum creatinine increases.

A minority of group members, both intensivists and nephrologists, felt that a urine output reduction of less than 0.5 ml/kg per hour over the span of six hours was not specific enough to lead confidently to the designation of AKI. It was recognized that the hydration state, use of diuretics, and presence of obstruction could influence the urine volume, hence the need to consider the clinical context. Additionally, accurate measurements of urine output may not be easily available in all cases, particularly in patients in non-intensive care unit settings. Despite these limitations, it was felt that the use of changes in urine offers a sensitive and easily discernible means of identifying patients, but its value as an independent criterion for diagnosis of AKI will need to be validated.

The proposed diagnostic criteria for AKI are designed to facilitate acquisition of new knowledge and validate the emerging concept that small alterations in kidney function may contribute to adverse outcomes. The goal of adopting these explicit diagnostic criteria is to increase the clinical awareness and diagnosis of AKI. It is recognized that there may be an increase in false-positives, so that some patients labeled with AKI will not have the condition. There was consensus that adopting the more inclusive criteria is preferable to the current situation, in which the condition is under-recognized and many people are identified late in the course of their illness and potentially miss the opportunity for prevention or application of strategies to minimize further kidney damage.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^117MWDyy]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) contrast nephropathy risk assessment for computed tomography (CT) imaging states that the overall risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) following IV contrast utilization is very low, ranging from 0 to 11 percent, and that improved sensitivity of the study will outweigh AKI risk in the majority of patients. Patients with a significantly compromised glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to multiple comorbidities, marked dehydration, or known chronic kidney injury are particularly susceptible; point-of-care creatinine assessment (iSTAT), when available, will rapidly estimate GFR in 2 minutes. Patients with a GFR of less than 30 mL/min are deemed at risk for AKI; options in these patients include performing the study initially without contrast or performing the study with the minimum acceptable volume contrast infusion necessary to obtain a diagnostic study. When initial non-contrast torso imaging is used, real-time interpretation concurrent with acquisition is a best practice, and the presence of mediastinal, intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal fluid consistent with hemorrhage, in other words, Hounsfield units of 30 or more, and/or concern for visceral injury usually warrants utilization of IV contrast despite its risk.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^113nhEFc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

Wide variation in healthcare infrastructure, staffing, and funding within and across LMICs results in a broad range of treatment capabilities. A 2015 cross-sectional study of the identification and management of AKI in various healthcare facilities showed that crystalloid fluid was used as initial management in 92% of all patients in LMICs. In addition, 73.9% of these patients were administered antibiotics. Diuretics were used in 36.1% of patients. A 2016 survey of 160 physicians treating kidney disease in low-resource settings found that nearly all regional hospitals had access to oral and intravenous hydration solutions, and antibiotics, whereas only 60% and 52% of rural healthcare providers had access to intravenous fluids and antibiotics for AKI management, respectively.

Feasibility and affordability of AKI treatment has been an ongoing challenge in LMICs, especially in remote and community healthcare settings. Intravenous fluids are the most commonly available resource for the management of AKI in both urban and community settings in LMICs and could be used to the benefit of AKI patients early in their disease courses. However, emerging evidence indicating increased adverse outcomes among AKI, ARDS, and critically ill patients receiving excessive fluid resuscitation poses safety concerns if this treatment is improperly implemented by providers with little working knowledge of fluid management. One observational study of 1,808 patients with sepsis across ICUs in 84 countries found an increased risk of death in those with higher fluid balance. Multiple reviews regarding fluid management in the setting of COVID-19 therefore recommend maintaining a negative fluid balance to improve outcomes, especially in critically ill patients dependent on mechanical ventilation.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1 We recommend the judicious use of intravenous fluid resuscitation using crystalloids for early management of AKI in all COVID-19 patients (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
2 We recommend more conservative fluid management for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Negative fluid balance should be maintained, if possible (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
3 We suggest the use of lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategies, where applicable, to prevent renal injury from associated cytokine release (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

Question 4: In patients with COVID-19–related AKI in LMICs, what strategies can be used to optimize efficiency and availability of dialysis?

Background

Although acute diarrhoea is a self-limiting disease, dehydration may occur in some children. Dehydration is the consequence of an increased loss of water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate) in liquid stools. When these losses are high and not replaced adequately, severe dehydration appears. Severe dehydration is corrected with intravenous solutions. The most frequently used solution for this purpose is 0.9% saline. Balanced solutions (e.g. Ringer's lactate) are alternatives to 0.9% saline and have been associated with fewer days of hospitalization and better biochemical outcomes. Available guidelines provide conflicting recommendations. It is unclear whether 0.9% saline or balanced intravenous fluids are most effective for rehydrating children with severe dehydration due to diarrhoea.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of balanced solutions for the rapid rehydration of children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea, in terms of time in hospital and mortality compared to 0.9% saline.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials in children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea comparing balanced solutions, such as Ringer's lactate or Plasma-Lyte with 0.9% saline solution, for rapid rehydration.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. time in hospital and 2.

Mortality

Our secondary outcomes were 3. need for additional fluids, 4. total amount of fluids received, 5. time to resolution of metabolic acidosis, 6. change in and the final values of biochemical measures (pH, bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine), 7. incidence of acute kidney injury, and 8.

Adverse Events

We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Characteristics of the included studies We included five studies with 465 children. Data for meta-analysis were available from 441 children. Four studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries and one study in two high-income countries. Four studies evaluated Ringer's lactate, and one study evaluated Plasma-Lyte. Two studies reported the time in hospital, and only one study reported mortality as an outcome. Four studies reported final pH and five studies reported bicarbonate levels. Adverse events reported were hyponatremia and hypokalaemia in two studies each. Risk of bias All studies had at least one domain at high or unclear risk of bias. The risk of bias assessment informed the GRADE assessments. Primary outcomes Compared to 0.9% saline, the balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in hospital (mean difference (MD) -0.35 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.60 to -0.10; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). However, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of the balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.39; 1 study, 22 children; very low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes Balanced solutions probably produce a higher increase in blood pH (MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.09; 4 studies, 366 children; low-certainty evidence) and bicarbonate levels (MD 2.44 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.97; 443 children, four studies; low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, balanced solutions likely reduces the risk of hypokalaemia after the intravenous correction (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.96; 2 studies, 147 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions may result in no difference in the need for additional intravenous fluids after the initial correction; in the amount of fluids administered; or in the mean change of sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children. However, balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in the hospital compared to 0.9% saline. Also, balanced solutions likely reduce the risk of hypokalaemia after intravenous correction. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions compared to 0.9% saline probably produce no changes in the need for additional intravenous fluids or in other biochemical measures such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels. Last, there may be no difference between balanced solutions and 0.9% saline in the incidence of hyponatraemia.

### Fructokinase activity mediates dehydration-induced renal injury [^111RRd1Q]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

An epidemic of chronic kidney disease is occurring in the hot coastal communities of Central America, especially among men working in sugarcane fields. The cause of the disease, which has been called 'Mesoamerican nephropathy', has remained a mystery, as it is not associated with the usual causes of chronic kidney disease such as diabetes or hypertension. Studies to date have not identified heavy metals, agrochemicals, or other toxins as likely candidates for causing the epidemic. However, a common predisposing feature appears to be exposure to heat and the development of recurrent dehydration.

Dehydration is commonly associated with 'prerenal' dysfunction with retention of urea, but classically this is thought to reflect hemodynamic changes and not to be associated with true renal injury. If dehydration is severe, subjects can develop acute kidney injury from heat stroke, rhabdomyolysis, and hypotension, but such individuals would likely have substantial symptoms and not present with the insidious onset of chronic kidney disease as typically occurs. However, a favorite hypothesis is that recurrent dehydration may lead to low-grade renal injury that over time results in chronic kidney disease. Dehydration from sweat and heat is known to activate the release of vasopressin. In turn, vasopressin has recently been recognized to have a potential role as a mediator of chronic kidney disease. However, although a role for vasopressin in increasing the rate of progression in chronic kidney disease has been shown in animals, its role in acute renal injury associated with dehydration remains largely unexplored.

Dehydration can also result in an increase in serum osmolarity and in the activation of aldose reductase. Activation of aldose reductase is important in the renal medulla, as here it generates sorbitol that can help protect tubular cells from the high osmolarity in the extracellular environment at this site, thus facilitating urinary concentration. However, activation of aldose reductase in the proximal tubule may not be beneficial, as the conversion of glucose to sorbitol may result in its further degradation by sorbitol dehydrogenase to fructose. Although fructose itself may not be toxic, when it is metabolized by fructokinase, it results in transient adenosine triphosphate depletion with the generation of uric acid, oxidants, and inflammatory mediators. The proximal tubule is one of the major sites where fructokinase is expressed. This raises the hypothesis that recurrent dehydration may result in repeated stimulation of aldose reductase with the generation of fructose in the proximal tubule, leading to tubular injury and inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we designed the following study.

### Peri-operative renal dysfunction: prevention and management [^114mE3Pd]. Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Postoperative increases in serum creatinine concentration, by amounts historically viewed as trivial, are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney injury is common, affecting one in five patients admitted with acute medical disease and up to four in five patients admitted to intensive care, of whom one in two have had operations. This review is focused principally on the identification of patients at risk of acute kidney injury and the prevention of injury. In the main, there are no interventions that directly treat the damaged kidney. The management of acute kidney injury is based on correction of dehydration, hypotension, and urinary tract obstruction, stopping nephrotoxic drugs, giving antibiotics for bacterial infection, and commencing renal replacement therapy if necessary.

### Science and fiction in critical care: established concepts with or without evidence? [^111tzhKu]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Dogma #1: Give fluids, diuretics, and vasopressors if urinary output decreases

Most oliguric intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive fluids, diuretics, and/or vasopressors with the goal to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI). This treatment, however, is based on the belief that AKI in critically ill patients results from renal ischaemia. Whereas fluids and vasopressors are usually administered to increase renal blood flow and in proportion oxygen delivery, diuretics are given to reduce the osmolarity in the renal medulla. This is expected to increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and ultimately improve renal function.

Oliguria, however, is a clinical symptom rather than a disease. The underlying mechanisms include, but are not restricted to, hypovolaemia, physiologic stress response, tubular damage, post-renal obstruction or a combination of these factors. If hypovolaemia is not the cause of oliguria, it does not make sense to administer fluids for its treatment. Giving fluids to patients who are not hypovolaemic may in fact harm the kidneys by increasing intracapsular pressure, thereby further reducing urinary output. Hence, administering fluids to these patients may lead into a vicious cycle of infusing more and more fluids to treat oliguria, which is eventually a result of over-hydration. Furthermore, if functional renal damage is present, e.g. due to ischaemia or nephrotoxins, treating oliguria with fluids or diuretics is unlikely to improve renal function. In this context, it is also noteworthy that the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for AKI recommend neither fluid therapy beyond the correction of hypovolaemia nor diuretics for the treatment of AKI. This is supported by the fact that clinical evidence for a sustained increase in urine output or improvement in renal blood flow secondary to fluids and/or diuretics is lacking. Conversely, indiscriminately giving fluids to oliguric patients increases the risk of fluid overload with negative consequences on morbidity. Although fluid overload has been identified as independent risk factor for AKI in critically ill patients, "fill and spill" ("fill" the circulation and urine will "spill") is still a dogma in many ICUs. Likewise, the concept of "squeeze and diurese" is commonly applied. It aims to increase mean arterial blood pressure with vasopressors ("squeeze") and at the same time administer loop diuretics to paralyse the medulla and avoid ischaemia ("diurese"). Interestingly, no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) support the latter treatment strategies.

### Fluid overload is an independent risk factor for acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: results of a cohort study [^115CxE87]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, large infusions of fluids may predict a higher risk of AKI in critically ill patients. Our findings support the hypothesis that 'routine' intravenous fluids may not be routine and in themselves be associated with organ dysfunction. Our results can be used to build hypotheses for further controlled trials.

### Acute kidney injury in Turkey: epidemiological characteristics, etiology, clinical course, and prognosis [^1167a75r]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to evaluate the etiologies, comorbidities, and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in Turkey and determine any potential differences among different geographical parts of the country.

Methods

This prospective observational study was conducted by the Acute Kidney Injury Working Group of the Turkish Society of Nephrology. Demographical and clinical data of patients with AKI at the time of diagnosis and at the 1 st week and 1 st, 3 rd, and 6 th months of diagnosis were evaluated to determine patient and renal survival and factors associated with patient prognosis.

Results

A total of 776 patients were included (54.7% male, median age: 67 years). Prerenal etiologies, including dehydration, heart failure, and sepsis, were more frequent than other etiologies. 58.9% of the patients had at least one renal etiology, with nephrotoxic agent exposure as the most common etiology. The etiologic factors were mostly similar throughout the country. 33.6% of the patients needed kidney replacement therapy. At the 6 th month of diagnosis, 29.5% of the patients had complete recovery; 34.1% had partial recovery; 9.5% developed end-stage kidney disease; and 24.1% died. The mortality rate was higher in the patients from the Eastern Anatolian region; those admitted to the intensive care unit; those with prerenal, renal, and postrenal etiologies together, stage 3 AKI, sepsis, cirrhosis, heart failure, and malignancy; those who need kidney replacement therapy; and those without chronic kidney disease than in the other patients.

Conclusion

Physicians managing patients with AKI should be alert against dehydration, heart failure, sepsis, and nephrotoxic agent exposure. Understanding the characteristics and outcomes of patients with AKI in their countries would help prevent AKI and improve treatment strategies.

### Comparison of clinical and biochemical markers of dehydration with the clinical dehydration scale in children: a case comparison trial [^115zoEEm]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dehydration associated with gastroenteritis represents one of the leading causes of admission and morbidity in the pediatric emergency department (ED). It is also the most common cause of electrolyte abnormalities in children presenting at the ED. In Canada, acute gastroenteritis accounts for 240,000 annual pediatric visits to the ED, while globally, diarrheal disease is responsible for approximately 10% of deaths in children under 5 years of age. Considering its extensive global impact, it is not surprising that there are several serious complications associated with severe dehydration including hypo-volemic shock, pre-renal acute kidney injury, and acute tubular necrosis. Clinicians must determine whether patients only need to be rehydrated or whether they face more substantial morbidity, which can be challenging. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in developing a simple, non-invasive tool for measuring the severity of dehydration in children. Although previous studies have attempted to validate markers of dehydration by assessing the severity of dehydration using serial measurements of patient body weight, serial weights in sick and dehydrated children may be unreliable due to a number of factors that are not related to the severity of their illness. The clinical dehydration scale (CDS, Table 1) has been developed to meet this important objective. The CDS combines scores of general appearance, eyes, mucous membranes, and tears. Use of the CDS has increased and it has been validated in 3 prospective studies, including one in the original ED, in a different Canadian pediatric ED, and in a multicenter trial at 3 Canadian EDs.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116kZkZ3]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Appendix O. Heat-related illness and CKD — military personnel are subject to prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures with intense physical exertion; heat-related illness can increase risk of hyperthermia, dehydration, and damage to the kidneys, and increases in core body temperature, more so in the presence of dehydration, magnifies processes that may result in kidney related pathology such as acute kidney injury. There is some data to suggest a decline in heat stroke incidence over the past 3 years, while incidence of heat exhaustion has increased within that same time span, and heat-related illness should be considered as a potential contributor to historical or acute kidney injury, which may hasten development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We suggest that providers take a detailed military occupational history from each patient newly diagnosed with CKD and perform an occupational and environmental exposure assessment.

### Acute kidney injury in Turkey: epidemiological characteristics, etiology, clinical course, and prognosis [^111oz38T]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

A sufficiently large number of cases with AKI (n = 776) were included in our study to evaluate the etiologic factors, geographical differences, and outcomes. Unfortunately, we could not conclude on the incidence of AKI, since we did not have data on the number of patients admitted to the related centers during the study period. Further, not all hospitals and nephrologists provided data to the study. Therefore, we could not evaluate the proportion of patients with AKI within the outpatient and inpatient populations. Nevertheless, we were able to evaluate the clinical courses, treatment options, and differences between the geographical regions.

Many disease conditions are known to contribute to the development of AKI. The incidence of AKI may differ according to the features of the studied population and approach of the physician. The nephrological approach in patients at high risks can be lifesaving in this field. Training physicians on how to recognize and evaluate patients at high risks to protect them from developing AKI is important. To clarify the different features among countries, the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) designed the Snapshot Study, which was a multinational study including 3664 patients from different countries with varying degrees of income. Hypotension or shock was the most common etiological factor in high-income countries; meanwhile, dehydration was the most common factor in lower-income countries, wherein sepsis and AKI related to pregnancy were more frequent. In a study conducted in Malawi, community-acquired AKI was detected in 12.7% of admissions within a pre-specified period of 3 months. A significant number of patients (43.8%) were seropositive for HIV. The most frequent causes of AKI were reported to be HIV-related sepsis and hypovolemia mostly due to gastroenteritis. Toxins, urinary obstruction, and primary renal parenchymal diseases were less prevalent. Investigators from Karachi studied hospital-acquired AKI and found that the most common causes of AKI were sepsis, gastroenteritis, and surgical and obstetric complications. Another study conducted in Singapore analyzed 422 cases of AKI. The most common etiological factors were prerenal etiologies, followed by sepsis and ischemic acute tubular necrosis. Lombardy et al. studied the causes of AKI in 2864 patients. They reported that AKI was more prevalent during winter (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05–1.29; p = 0.003), and a higher AKI risk was found to be associated with lower air temperature and higher humidity. In our study, the most frequent etiology of prerenal AKI was dehydration, heart failure, and sepsis. This prompts the necessity of early evaluation and supportive care of patients with symptoms that may cause dehydration. With advances in the treatment options for ischemic heart disease, survival is prolonged, and an increasing number of cardiorenal syndrome cases are observed. There is a need for education among both primary care physicians and patients regarding the use of diuretics, especially their correct indication and dose, to prevent both hypervolemia and dehydration.

### Dehydration-associated chronic kidney disease: a novel case of kidney failure in China [^111ohWn1]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In recent years, a cluster of chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unknown origin has emerged among agricultural workers, as well as in other manual laborers in various regions of the world, which is known as Mesoamerican nephropathy (MeN). This disease can not be attributed to the classic causes of kidney disease (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypertension and glomerular diseases). Clinically, patients may present with normal or mildly elevated systemic blood pressure, reduced glomerular filtration rate, low-grade non-nephrotic proteinuria and electrolyte abnormalities. Kidney biopsies have demonstrated evidence of both acute injury (acute tubular cell injury, interstitial edema, early fibrosis) and chronic injury (tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis). The exact etiology is unknown. The most likely cause is repeated episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) related to dehydration and hence some researchers have named the disease dehydration-associated CKD. We present a 40-year-old man who progressed from AKI to CKD sharing a similar pathogenesis to dehydration-associated CKD.

### Tirzepatide (Zepbound) [^117Wkvs1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Acute Kidney Injury

Use of ZEPBOUND has been associated with acute kidney injury, which can result from dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions to ZEPBOUND, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, there have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Some of these events have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to ZEPBOUND that could lead to volume depletion.

5.4 Acute Gallbladder Disease

Treatment with ZEPBOUND and GLP-1 receptor agonists is associated with an increased occurrence of acute gallbladder disease.

In a pool of two ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction (Studies 1 and 2), cholelithiasis was reported in 1.1% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients, cholecystitis was reported in 0.7% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, and cholecystectomy was reported in 0.2% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and no placebo-treated patients. Acute gallbladder events were associated with weight reduction. Similar rates of cholelithiasis were reported in ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction and in ZEPBOUND trials for OSA. If cholecystitis is suspected, gallbladder diagnostic studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.

### Fluid overload and acute kidney injury: cause or consequence? [^114CnEfu]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that fluid overload and acute kidney injury (AKI) are associated but the exact cause-effect relationship remains unclear. Wang and colleagues analysed patients admitted to 30 intensive care units in China and found that fluid accumulation was independently associated with an increased risk of AKI and mortality. This commentary focuses on the close pathophysiological link between AKI and fluid overload and discusses the implications for clinical practice. It outlines some of the challenges, including the difficulty in diagnosing fluid overload reliably with current methods, and stresses the importance of personalised fluid therapy with physiological end-points to avoid the deleterious effects of fluid overload.

### Prerenal acute kidney injury-still a relevant term in modern clinical practice? [^117BvjEb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The traditional taxonomy of acute kidney injury (AKI) has remained pervasive in clinical nephrology. While the terms 'prerenal', 'intrarenal' and 'postrenal' highlight the diverse pathophysiology underlying AKI, they also imply discrete disease pathways and de-emphasize the nature of AKI as an evolving clinical syndrome with multiple, often simultaneous and overlapping, causes. In a similar vein, prerenal AKI comprises a diverse spectrum of kidney disorders, albeit one that is often managed by using a standardized clinical algorithm. We contend that the term 'prerenal' is too vague to adequately convey our current understanding of hypoperfusion-related AKI and that it should thus be avoided in the clinical setting. Practice patterns among nephrologists indicate that AKI-related terminology plays a significant role in the approaches that clinicians take to patients that have this complex disease. Thus, it appears that precise terminology does impact the treatment that patients receive. We will outline differences in the diagnosis and management of clinical conditions lying on the so-called prerenal disease spectrum to advocate caution when administering intravenous fluids to these clinically decompensated patients. An understanding of the underlying pathophysiology may, thus, avert clinical missteps such as fluid and vasopressor mismanagement in tenuous or critically ill patients.

### Acute kidney injury among Florida construction workers: a pilot study [^115c3K1s]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

While construction workers have the second highest rate of heat-related mortality, less is known about the prevelance of heat-related illness (HRI) symptoms, dehydration and kidney dysfunction. The aim of this study was to conduct a biomedical field-based study with construction workers to characterize HRI symptoms, dehydration, and kidney dysfunction, and analyze relationships between post-work urine specific gravity (USG) percentiles and predictors such as work hours, water consumption, and sugary beverage consumption.

Methods

In collaboration with the Farmworker Association of Florida, 58 construction workers in Central Florida were monitored pre- and post-work shift on one workday. Research staff used a recreational vehicle to meet workers at their worksites, collect blood and urine pre- and post-work shift, and administer a survey on HRI symptoms. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was measured using serum creatinine and dehydration with USG. Predictors were examined in single covariate linear quantile mixed models against USG percentiles.

Results

The mean heat index was 88.4°F. Forty-two percent reported at least one symptom of HRI. Dehydration rates were 75% pre-work shift and 78% post-work shift. Severe dehydration increased from 16% to 33%. AKI was observed in 38% of the participants.

Conclusion

This is, to our knowledge, the first US field-based biomedical study to document AKI, dehydration, and HRI symptoms in construction workers. This study adds to the literature that supports occupational heat exposure as a risk factor for AKI and dehydration.

### Hydration status, kidney function, and kidney injury in Florida agricultural workers [^117D4KrH]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Recent findings suggest that laboring in hot occupational environments is related to kidney damage in agricultural workers. We examined hydration status and kidney function in 192 Florida agricultural workers.

Methods

Blood and urine samples were collected over 555 workdays during the summers of 2015 and 2016. Urine-specific gravity (USG), serum creatinine, and other kidney function markers were examined pre- and post-shift on each workday. Multivariable mixed modeling was used to examine the association of risk factors with hydration status and acute kidney injury (AKI).

Results

Approximately 53% of workers were dehydrated (USG ≥ 1.020) pre-shift and 81% post-shift; 33% of participants had AKI on at least one workday. The odds of AKI increased 47% for each 5-degree (°F) increase in heat index.

Conclusion

A strikingly high prevalence of dehydration and AKI exists in Florida agricultural workers.

### Fluid management in acute kidney injury [^115Y3xdJ]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Correction of intravascular hypovolemia is a key component of the prevention and management of acute kidney injury (AKI), but excessive fluid administration is associated with poor outcomes, including the development and progression of AKI. There is growing evidence that fluid administration should be individualized and take into account patient characteristics, nature of the acute illness and trajectories, and risks and benefits of fluids. Existing data support the preferential use of buffered solutions for fluid resuscitation of patients at risk of AKI who do not have hypochloremia. There is a limited role for albumin, and starches should be avoided. Fluids should only be administered until intravascular hypovolemia has been corrected and euvolemia has been achieved using the minimum amount of fluid required to achieve and maintain euvolemia. Oliguria alone should not be viewed as a trigger for fluid administration. If fluid overload occurs, fluid therapy needs to be discontinued, and fluid removal using diuretic agents or extracorporeal therapies should be considered.

### Acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients with exertional… [^115Hyomc]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome and Measures Development of AKI, CKD, and compartment syndrome and number of deaths. Results. This analysis suggests that eliminating preadmission NSAID use and dehydration could reduce the risk of potential AKI in patients with ERM by 92. 6% in this population. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study of hospitalized patients with ERM suggest that serum CK elevation alone is insufficient as an indicator of AKI in patients with ERM. Concurrent risk factors, such as NSAID use or dehydration, may be associated with AKI development in patients with ERM. We next examined the association between a history of preadmission dehydration and the risk of AKI development in the cohort. Our findings revealed a significant association between a history of preadmission dehydration and the risk of AKI development.

Our study suggests that eliminating key risk factors, such as NSAID use and dehydration, may potentially reduce the incidence of AKI in patients with ERM. Animal studies offer a parallel perspective that elevated CK levels alone may be insufficient to cause AKI in ERM, emphasizing the crucial role of NSAIDs and dehydration. 15, 16 The association of prior dehydration with the development of AKI from rhabdomyolysis was also supported in these models. 15 Interestingly, a previous study examined the effects of acetaminophen and ibuprofen on kidney function during exercise and dehydration. This finding may be due to unreported NSAIDs, other nephrotoxic agents, dehydration, or unknown risk factors. Our findings suggest that straightforward interventions, such as avoiding NSAIDs and prioritizing hydration, may potentially lower AKI risk in those with intense exercise-induced muscle pain.

A previous study suggests that more than 50% of healthy volunteers exhibited CK levels in the rhabdomyolysis range after strenuous exercise, 9 underscoring the significant clinical relevance of our findings. This large, community-based study significantly advances our understanding of AKI in patients with ERM. It demonstrates a lower AKI risk compared with other causes of rhabdomyolysis and challenges existing assumptions by finding no direct association between elevated CK levels and AKI risk. Additionally, it highlights potential risks associated with NSAID use and dehydration in AKI development and questions the necessity for lengthy hospitalization and associated costs in ERM.

### Paradigms of acute kidney injury in the intensive care setting [^117WwW58]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that has multiple aetiologies, variable pathogenesis and diverse outcomes. However, these heterogeneities are not reflected in current approaches to the diagnosis and, to some degree, treatment of AKI. For example, congestive heart failure and dehydration can produce identical changes in serum creatinine level and urine output (parameters that are used to define AKI); however, they differ vastly in their physiological contexts and demand completely opposite treatments. AKI is often still considered to be a homogeneous clinical entity, which implies a uniform pathogenesis and a well-defined prognosis. As a consequence, efforts to find effective AKI treatments have been hampered by a lack of clear clinical classifications for various types of AKI. In addition, subclassification of AKI into subclinical phenotypes - for example, on the basis of protein biomarkers and other in vitro diagnostics that take into account disease aetiology and underlying pathogenesis - might be necessary to develop therapeutic approaches that effectively target the widely differing pathomechanisms of AKI. In this Review, we discuss the major subtypes of AKI that are associated with sepsis, major surgery, renal hypoperfusion and nephrotoxin exposure -situations that are typically seen in the intensive care setting. We consider differences and similarities in their phenotype, pathogenesis and outcomes and how this information might be used to guide treatment.

### Acute kidney injury is a common and significant complication following ileostomy formation [^1112aiCb]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

The aim was to characterize the incidence and short-term prognostic value of an acute kidney injury (AKI) during the admission where an ileostomy is formed.

Methods

Adults with a baseline serum creatinine measurement discharged alive after ileostomy formation from 2014 to 2016 were included. All patients had daily basic metabolic panels and the Kidney Diseases Improving Global Outcomes criteria were used to determine the presence and severity of any AKI. Dehydration was defined by a single urine abnormality or clinical criteria combined with an objective abnormality in vitals or basic metabolic panels.

Results

Of 262 patients, 19.4% sustained an AKI (74.5% Stage I, 15.7% Stage II, 9.8% Stage III) during the index admission. Predictors of incident AKI were increasing age, male sex, higher baseline creatinine and open surgery. Patients with AKI had significantly longer length of stay and 45% had creatinine < 1.0 mg/dl at discharge. Of the total cohort, 11% were readmitted with dehydration and the independent predictors were AKI during the index admission, high ileostomy output, age > 65 years, male sex and prior ileostomy. Of those readmitted with dehydration, 79% had AKI at readmission.

Conclusions

Nearly 20% of patients with ileostomies develop an AKI during the index admission with almost half resolving by discharge. Patients with AKIs are at high risk for 30-day dehydration-related readmission and AKI is present in nearly 80% of those readmitted with dehydration. Since AKI is objective, based on routine laboratory measures, and has known prognostic value it is probably a more robust outcome than dehydration for researchers, surgeons and patients.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^1161eqHR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Prevention and treatment of AKI — KDOQI aligns with key KDIGO recommendations and fluid choices: the section includes 7 level 1 recommendations and 22 level 2 recommendations, and our KDOQI Work Group agreed with the 7 level 1 recommendations; the Work Group agreed with using isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids for volume expansion in patients at risk of AKI or with AKI and noted harm with starch-containing colloids, therefore these solutions should be avoided; albumin resuscitation has been associated with harm in traumatic brain injury and should be avoided in that setting; in liver disease, intravenous albumin appears to be beneficial for prevention of renal failure and death in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and for prevention of renal failure in large-volume paracentesis; diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome include lack of improvement after volume expansion with albumin (1 g/kg/d up to 100 g/d) for at least 2 days and withdrawal of diuretic therapy; avoidance of nephrotoxins is not always possible given pathogen resistance examples.

### Risk factors for chronic kidney disease in patients with Crohn's disease [^1146nneS]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease patients are also known to develop electrolyte imbalances and acute kidney injuries because of vomiting, diarrhea, or severe dehydration, especially in times of active flares. While Montreal classification and 1 bowel resection did not significantly predict subsequent CKD in our study, we found that CD patients who had undergone 3 or more surgeries had over 7 times higher odds of developing CKD than those who had not undergone surgery. This aligns with previous findings that the risks of acute kidney injury or kidney failure are elevated in IBD patients who undergo colectomy. Similar to the link between bowel resection and risk of urolithiasis, we suspect that the underlying pathophysiological factor leading from refractory CD to CKD is severe dehydration, poor ileal absorption, electrolyte imbalances, and frequent acute renal injury. Our metabolomic data support this possibility, as CD + CKD patients exhibited higher serum levels of metabolites associated with kidney injury and oxidative cell damage than CD patients without CKD.

The medications used to treat IBD and reduce inflammation represent potential mitigators of risk for CKD development in IBD patients. Of the commonly used IBD medications, we observed a 0.28-fold lower risk of CKD in patients with previous 5-aminosalicylic acid use, and no significant change in CKD risk in patients with biologic, immunomodulator, or steroid use. 5-aminosalicylic acid medications have the possibility — though rare — of inducing interstitial nephritis. We found a slight protective effect of these medications; however, most patients with CD should not be on 5-aminosalicylates given their lack of efficacy. This leads us to speculate that mesalamine use was likely associated with patients who had milder disease. While we did not find significant associations between biologic use and CKD risk, we believe that studies with larger sample sizes may find that patients on 2 or more biologics may be at higher risk of CKD since such medication use may indicate that these patients have refractory disease.

Volume expansion

Recommendations

We recommend controlled fluid resuscitation in volume depletion, while, however, avoiding volume overload (Grade 1C).
We recommend against the use of starches (Grade 1A) as harm has been shown and suggest not using gelatine or dextrans for fluid resuscitation (Grade 2C).
We recommend correction of hypovolaemia/dehydration using isotonic crystalloids in patients receiving intravascular contrast media (Grade 1B).
We recommend regular monitoring of chloride levels and acid–base status in situations where chloride-rich solutions are used (BPS).
We suggest the use of balanced crystalloids for large volume resuscitation (Grade 2C).
We suggest using human serum albumin if a colloid is deemed necessary for the treatment of patients with septic shock (Grade 2C).
We suggest prophylactic volume expansion with crystalloids to prevent AKI by certain drugs (specified below) (BPS).
We suggest not delaying urgent contrast-enhanced investigations or interventions for potential preventative measures (BPS).

### Preventing acute kidney injury in high-risk patients by temporarily discontinuing medication-an observational study in general practice [^1166h7ys]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Dutch GPs do not frequently advise high-risk patients to discontinue high-risk medication during 'dehydration-risk' episodes. Unfortunately, complications such as acute kidney injury do occur. Timely discontinuation of high-risk medication needs more attention in general practice in order to prevent drug-related complications.

### Fructokinase activity mediates dehydration-induced renal injury [^116PLjPo]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

These findings could be relevant to the etiology of the epidemic of kidney disease in Central America, which also appears clinically and histologically to be a type of primary tubulointerstitial injury, although with some global glomerulosclerosis. To date, the only common risk factor seems to be exposure to heat and recurrent dehydration. Many of the workers also hydrate themselves with fructose-rich juices or beverages that might compound the problem. Thus, we would like to suggest that repeated renal injury may be occurring from the effects of endogenously generated fructose and that this might be potentiated by fructose provided in the drinks.

We recognize that other mechanisms are also likely important and could be acting synergistically with the consequences of activation of the aldose reductase pathway. Dehydration and volume depletion, for example, are known to activate a variety of mediators that are capable of inducing renal injury, including the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system, and vasopressin. Dehydration may lead to increased reabsorption of toxins into the kidney, such as heavy metals and agrochemicals.

Nevertheless, the importance of this study is that it identifies a new potential mediator of chronic kidney disease that is activated by heat and dehydration. This could be important as global warming leads to the emergence of new diseases. Besides Central America, there is concern that kidney diseases are increasing in other hot agricultural communities, such as in Sri Lanka, India, Mexico, Ecuador, and Egypt. Clearly, more studies are needed. However, we would like to suggest that the activation of fructokinase could represent one new player in driving acute and chronic kidney disease.

### Evaluation and initial management of acute kidney injury [^116zoaEu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation and initial management of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) should include: (1) an assessment of the contributing causes of the kidney injury, (2) an assessment of the clinical course including comorbidities, (3) a careful assessment of volume status, and (4) the institution of appropriate therapeutic measures designed to reverse or prevent worsening of functional or structural kidney abnormalities. The initial assessment of patients with AKI classically includes the differentiation between prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes. The differentiation between so-called "prerenal" and "renal" causes is more difficult, especially because renal hypoperfusion may coexist with any stage of AKI. Using a modified Delphi approach, the multidisciplinary international working group, generated a set of testable research questions. Key questions included the following: Is there a difference in prognosis between volume-responsive and volume-unresponsive AKI? Are there biomarkers whose patterns (dynamic changes) predict the severity and recovery of AKI (maximal stage of AKI, need for RRT, renal recovery, mortality) and guide therapy? What is the best biomarker to assess prospectively whether AKI is volume responsive? What is the best biomarker to assess the optimal volume status in AKI patients? In evaluating the current literature and ongoing studies, it was thought that the answers to the questions posed herein would improve the understanding of AKI, and ultimately patient outcomes.

### Iodixanol [^116Zh2Qx]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risks Associated with Inadvertent Intrathecal Administration

Iodixanol is for intravascular use only and is contraindicated for intrathecal use [see Contraindications (4) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Inadvertent Intrathecal administration can cause death, convulsions/seizures, cerebral hemorrhage, coma, paralysis, arachnoiditis, acute renal failure, cardiac arrest, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, and brain edema.

5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Iodixanol can cause life-threatening or fatal hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. Manifestations include respiratory arrest, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, angioedema, and shock. Most severe reactions develop shortly after the start of the injection (within 3 minutes), but reactions can occur up to hours later. There is an increased risk in patients with a history of a previous reaction to contrast agent, and known allergies (i.e., bronchial asthma, drug, or food allergies) or other hypersensitivities. Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids does not prevent serious life-threatening reactions, but may reduce both their incidence and severity.

Obtain a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast agents and always have emergency resuscitation equipment and trained personnel available prior to iodixanol administration. Monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions.

5.3 Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury

Acute kidney injury, including renal failure, may occur after iodixanol administration. Risk factors include: pre-existing renal impairment, dehydration, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, advanced vascular disease, elderly age, concomitant use of nephrotoxic or diuretic medications, multiple myeloma/paraproteinaceous diseases, repetitive and/or large doses of an iodinated contrast agent.

Use the lowest necessary dose of iodixanol in patients with renal impairment. Adequately hydrate patients prior to and following iodixanol administration. Do not use laxatives, diuretics, or preparatory dehydration prior to iodixanol administration.

### Year in review 2013: critical care-nephrology [^117VWcbq]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Risk factors and hemodynamics of acute kidney injury

Kellum and Lameire proposed the concept of risk factors and susceptibility. The main external stressors that may cause AKI include sepsis, shock, burns, trauma, cardiopulmonary bypass, nephrotoxic drugs, radiocontrast agents, and poisonous plants and animals. However, the chances of developing AKI after exposure to the same insult depend on a number of 'susceptibility factors' that vary widely from individual to individual. For susceptibility factors we may consider advanced age, dehydration or volume depletion, female gender, black race, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and anemia. Therefore, it is important to screen patients who have undergone an exposure and to continue monitoring them until the risk has subsided. To better interpret the pathophysiology of AKI and its interplay with several hemodynamic variables, a retrospective study including 137 septic ICU patients was performed: AKI was defined as occurrence of a novel AKI case or an increase in the stage of previously diagnosed AKI during the first 5 days following ICU admission based on the AKIN criteria. Central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output, mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2) or mixed venous oxygen saturation were analyzed. One-half of patients in the study had new or persistent AKI. MAP, ScvO 2 and cardiac output were not significantly different between AKI and non-AKI patients. The development or progression of AKI, regardless of the level of fluid balance and positive end-expiratory pressure, was strongly associated with the CVP level. This suggests participation of venous congestion in the physiopathology of AKI in severe sepsis and septic shock. Patients with AKI had lower DAP and higher CVP (P = 0.0003). Although the role of renal hypoperfusion (low cardiac output or hypovolemia) is believed to contribute to the development of sepsis-induced renal dysfunction, AKI appears to be only partially reversible after the optimization of systemic hemodynamics. Fluid resuscitation and pressure optimization is a landmark treatment for septic patients in order to improve renal perfusion pressure. For some patients, the induced CVP elevation may overcome the DAP increase, reducing renal perfusion with harmful effects on renal function. This aspect is supported by the recently reported association between fluid overload and mortality in critically ill patients, especially in patients with AKI or septic shock. The creation of a vicious circle with oliguria and fluid-loading may then aggravate AKI. Therefore, targeting a pre-defined CVP as a therapeutic target might not be suitable in septic patients. Legrand and colleagues suggested instead that hemodynamic targets are best achieved at low CVPs (that is, a CVP less than 8 to 12 mmHg). The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines mention that 'in mechanically ventilated patients or those with known preexisting decreased ventricular compliance, a higher target CVP of 12–15 mmHg should be achieved to account for the impediment in filling'. The results of this study suggest, instead, that such targets might be too high from a 'renal' perspective. Therefore, a strategy of fluid restriction in these patients is an important option to be considered.

### Recognition and management of acute kidney injury in the international society of nephrology 0by25 global snapshot: a multinational cross-sectional study [^114LbVJp]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Epidemiological data for acute kidney injury are scarce, especially in low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to assess regional differences in acute kidney injury recognition, management, and outcomes.

Methods

In this multinational cross-sectional study, 322 physicians from 289 centres in 72 countries collected prospective data for paediatric and adult patients with confirmed acute kidney injury in hospital and non-hospital settings who met criteria for acute kidney injury. Signs and symptoms at presentation, comorbidities, risk factors for acute kidney injury, and process-of-care data were obtained at the start of acute kidney injury, and need for dialysis, renal recovery, and mortality recorded at 7 days, and at hospital discharge or death, whichever came earlier. We classified countries into high-income countries (HICs), upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), and combined LICs and LMICs (LLMICs) according to their 2014 gross national income per person.

Findings

Between Sept 29 and Dec 7, 2014, data were collected from 4018 patients. 2337 (58%) patients developed community-acquired acute kidney injury, with 889 (80%) of 1118 patients in LLMICs, 815 (51%) of 1594 in UMICs, and 663 (51%) of 1241 in HICs (for HICs vs UMICs p = 0.33; p < 0.0001 for all other comparisons). Hypotension (1615 [40%] patients) and dehydration (1536 [38%] patients) were the most common causes of acute kidney injury. Dehydration was the most frequent cause of acute kidney injury in LLMICs (526 [46%] of 1153 vs 518 [32%] of 1605 in UMICs vs 492 [39%] of 1260 in HICs) and hypotension in HICs (564 [45%] of 1260 vs 611 [38%%] of 1605 in UMICs vs 440 [38%] of 1153 LLMICs). Mortality at 7 days was 423 (11%) of 3855, and was higher in LLMICs (129 [12%] of 1076) than in HICs (125 [10%] of 1230) and UMICs (169 [11%] of 1549).

Interpretation

We identified common aetiological factors across all countries, which might be amenable to a standardised approach for early recognition and treatment of acute kidney injury. Study limitations include a small number of patients from outpatient settings and LICs, potentially under-representing the true burden of acute kidney injury in these areas. Additional strategies are needed to raise awareness of acute kidney injury in community health-care settings, especially in LICs.

### Rapid weight loss can increase the risk of acute kidney injury in wrestlers [^115MWPXU]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, HISST with RWL among wrestlers was associated with an increased risk of AKI. This study demonstrated changes in the analysed markers of AKI in both phases of the research. However, during P1, some values of AKI markers exceeded the reference range (BUN: 2.5–7.5 mmol/L; URCA: 155–428 mmol/L; CRE: 49–115 mmol/L). Kidney injury begins by inducing biological and molecular changes, which biomarkers can detect early. The incidence of AKI is likely due to a combination of different factors. Of these factors, hypohydration may be particularly interesting, as it is commonly seen during RWL in combat athletes. According to the literature, dehydration appeared to be the primary RWL strategy practised by a number of combat sports athletes. Dehydration has multiple effects on the kidney. Moreover, the current literature recognises that even mild dehydration may be a risk factor in the progression of all types of chronic kidney diseases. According to Lakicevic et al, RWL caused dehydration and subsequent acute kidney damage despite various degrees of weight loss. Based on obtained results, high-intensity specific training combined with RWL significantly affects the increase of kidney function markers compared with identical acute training without RWL. This study showed that RWL affects CRE, BUN and URCA but not CysC. Conversely, the mean serum CysC remained remarkably stable during the RWL phase. Also, serum CysC did not differ significantly between the phases. A study conducted on a sample of judokas reached similar results. After a rapid reduction in body mass (6%) within 7 days, a significant increase in creatinine concentration was recorded (p ≤ 0.05). A significant increase in creatinine level was also recorded in wrestlers after reducing a greater percentage of body mass (~8%) over a longer period (2–3 weeks). One study reported high CRE levels during the final phase of the weight cutting, consistent with AKI. Also, previous studies demonstrated that CRE concentrations might increase due to exercise-induced muscle breakdown. Similar to creatinine, kidney injury biomarkers such as BUN and URCA were significantly increased. There is a greater trend of rise in the mentioned marker's concentration during RWL compared with acute training without RWL. Elevated BUN and creatinine concentrations often serve as biomarkers of AKI.URCA concentration also increased significantly during P1 compared with the initial measurement. In addition, URCA concentration exceeded the reference range after RWL. Significantly higher values were also noted after the acute training session (HISST) measurement (P2) compared with the initial measurement but remained within the normal reference range. Similar results were obtained in a study where an increase in the concentration of URCA was recorded in judokas after 7 days of a restrictive diet and a 5% reduction in body mass. The kidney is the main excretory organ for URCA. The high URCA concentration after P1 and P2 can be due to increased purine nucleotide degradation and damage to fast-twitch fibres under conditions of high energy demand. Also, the elevated concentration of this marker may be due to insufficient hydration as a consequence of RWL. It is critical to point out that the biomarkers (BUN, URCA and CRE) that changed significantly throughout the experimental phases surpassed the reference range only in the phase when RWL was applied together with HISST.

### Intravenous fluid therapy in critically ill adults [^116DR42o]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluid therapy is one of the most common interventions in acutely ill patients. Each day, over 20% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) receive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and more than 30% receive fluid resuscitation during their first day in the ICU. Virtually all hospitalized patients receive intravenous fluid to maintain hydration and as diluents for drug administration. Until recently, the amount and type of fluids administered were based on a theory described over 100 years ago, much of which is inconsistent with current physiological data and emerging knowledge. Despite their widespread use, various fluids for intravenous administration have entered clinical practice without a robust evaluation of their safety and efficacy. High-quality, investigator-initiated studies have revealed that some of these fluids have unacceptable toxicity; as a result, several have been withdrawn from the market (while others, controversially, are still in use). The belief that dehydration and hypovolaemia can cause or worsen kidney and other vital organ injury has resulted in liberal approaches to fluid therapy and the view that fluid overload and tissue oedema are 'normal' during critical illness; this is quite possibly harming patients. Increasing evidence indicates that restrictive fluid strategies might improve outcomes.

SGLT2 inhibitors — adverse events, amputation risk, and kidney considerations: Patients with signs or symptoms of ketoacidosis "should be instructed to discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors and seek immediate medical attention", and "SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued in the context of acute kidney injury". Canagliflozin was associated with higher amputation risk in CANVAS "(6.3 versus 3.4 amputations per 1,000 patient-years of observation after a median follow-up of 126 weeks; p < 0.001)", whereas in CREDENCE the amputation rate was similar to placebo "(12.3 versus 11.2 events/1,000 patient-years, respectively, HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.56)". Ertugliflozin showed a numerical excess in phase III trials "(0.1% [n = 1] with placebo versus 0.5% [n = 8] with the 15 mg dose)", and "caution is suggested in those with a history of peripheral artery disease, severe peripheral neuropathy, lower extremity diabetic ulcers, or soft tissue infections", with the advice that "All patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors should be instructed to be getting regular foot exams". Given diuretic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors "may increase the risk of volume depletion and hypotension", and while concerns about acute kidney injury have lessened, "the risk of acute kidney injury was significantly lower when compared with placebo", and "it is prudent to educate patients about signs and symptoms of dehydration".

### Management of patients at risk of acute kidney injury [^115WnXbc]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a multifaceted syndrome that occurs in different settings. The course of AKI can be variable, from single hit and complete recovery, to multiple hits resulting in end-stage renal disease. No interventions to improve outcomes of established AKI have yet been developed, so prevention and early diagnosis are key. Awareness campaigns and education for health-care professionals on diagnosis and management of AKI-with attention to avoidance of volume depletion, hypotension, and nephrotoxic interventions-coupled with electronic early warning systems where available can improve outcomes. Biomarker-based strategies have not shown improvements in outcome. Fluid management should aim for early, rapid restoration of circulatory volume, but should be more limited after the first 24–48 h to avoid volume overload. Use of balanced crystalloid solutions versus normal saline remains controversial. Renal replacement therapy should only be started on the basis of hard criteria, but should not be delayed when criteria are met. On the basis of recent evidence, the risk of contrast-induced AKI might be overestimated for many conditions.

### Rapid weight loss can increase the risk of acute kidney injury in wrestlers [^113wjG3f]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The kidney is an organ that can tolerate exposure to various factors, whereby a predisposing factor such as dehydration may represent an additional risk for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). Although dehydration was thought not to be associated with long-term adverse effects on kidney function, this opinion has been disproved. The possible factor causing acute kidney failure is dehydration, and even mild dehydration can be a risk factor in the progression of kidney disease. Since athletes in combat sports reduce their body mass up to 10 times yearly, frequent dehydration can affect kidney function. There is no evidence that sport practising can lead to chronic kidney problems. However, early detection of AKI in athletes who regularly use RWL methods is of utmost importance for preventing more severe kidney disease. Dehydration and soft drink intake during and following exercise may lead to acute kidney dysfunction. Also, repeated episodes of acute kidney failure may lead to chronic kidney disease. Several classification systems have been developed to streamline research and clinical practice concerning AKI. Changes in serum creatinine (CRE) levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid (URCA) and Cystatin-C (CysC) levels are indicators of kidney function. However, CRE and BUN are influenced by many renal and nonrenal factors independent of kidney function. Unlike CRE and BUN, CysC levels are much less influenced by factors such as gender, age and muscle mass. CysC is a suitable marker for assessing kidney functions during and after exercise. Elevating URCA levels are also associated with strenuous exercise.

Athletes are usually healthy by definition, but the combination of RWL and high training workload may modify their homeostasis, inducing pathological biochemical kidney marker values. This study examined the impact of high-intensity specific training combined with RWL and without RWL on body composition and biochemical markers of kidney function.

### Myeloma kidney: advances in molecular mechanisms of acute kidney injury open novel therapeutic opportunities [^114umj6F]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Renal impairment is a common complication of multiple myeloma (MM) and is supported in virtually all patients by a tubulointerstitial pathology that results from high serum concentrations of monoclonal free light chains (FLCs). The proteins involved in the kidney injury and the analysis of their binding interactions have been thoroughly investigated and the main pathogenic mechanisms are being elucidated. Early sustained reduction of circulating FLC leads to improved renal recovery rates that translate into improved quality of life and survival. The mainstay of therapy is presently the removal of aggravating factors (dehydration, hypercalcaemia, nephrotoxic drugs) and the prompt institution of rapidly acting novel chemotherapy combinations. This approach allows the rescue of kidney function in more than two-thirds of patients. High cut-off haemodialysis dialysers may potentially add clinical benefits and the outcomes of controlled trials are eagerly awaited. Basic research findings have led to the design of targeted drugs that prevented the functional manifestations of acute kidney injury in animal models. There is now hope to prevent the renal damage in patients with MM.

### Three feasible strategies to minimize kidney injury in' incipient AKI' [^116dHeWB]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and increasing in hospitalized patients. The earlier recognition of renal injury, at a stage described as 'incipient AKI', may allow renoprotective strategies to be initiated at a time when more kidney tissue is salvageable. 'Incipient AKI' represents renal injury as manifested by new-onset proteinuria, cellular activity on urine microscopy, or elevated novel biomarkers of kidney injury in the absence of clinical data that meet current diagnostic criteria for AKI. We propose three strategies to preserve kidney function and minimize further kidney injury in patients with 'incipient AKI'. These include — when appropriate for the prevailing cause of 'incipient AKI' — use of low-chloride-containing intravenous solutions, continued use of renin-angiotensin system antagonists, and use of diuretics to achieve adequate control of intravascular volume. The combined approach of the early diagnosis of AKI and early employment of feasible therapeutic strategies may slow the growth of clinical AKI, AKI requiring renal replacement therapy and chronic kidney disease, and might reduce AKI-associated mortality.

### Fluid management in acute kidney injury [^1119zuuW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluids are closely linked through oliguria, which is a marker of the former and a trigger for administration of the latter. Recent progress in this field has challenged the physiological and clinical rational of using oliguria as a trigger for the administration of fluid and brought attention to the delicate balance between benefits and harms of different aspects of fluid management in critically ill patients, in particular those with AKI. This narrative review addresses various aspects of fluid management in AKI outlining physiological aspects, the effects of crystalloids and colloids on kidney function and the effect of various resuscitation and de-resuscitation strategies on the course and outcome of AKI.

### Impact of providing patient information leaflets prior to hospital discharge to patients with acute kidney injury: a quality improvement project [^115GBZ4M]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Background

AKI has become a well-recognised medical condition since the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death, and the introduction of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance in 2013 (subsequently updated in 2019) which highlight the impact of AKI on patients and their long-term health. AKI is an acute change (within 7 days) in the patients' baseline renal function; specifically, creatinine and/or urine output. AKI covers a wide range of clinical conditions, ranging from mild injury (stage 1) to severe injury (stage 3), which can result in permanent and complete loss of renal function. These three stages of AKI are classified using internationally agreed staging(table 1).

Table 1
Kidney Disease| Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) staging

AKI is a common complication of many other acute illnesses, such as sepsis or dehydration. It is present in 22% of hospital patients, and is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality, with patients being at increased risk of death during their hospital stay, alongside increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), despite the severity of their AKI. While it was previously thought that AKI was completely reversible with no long-term health implications for patients, there is growing evidence that even a single episode of AKI can lead to permanent organ damage. The impact of a single episode of AKI can lead to future AKIs, the development of CKD, and increase the risk of other complications such as cardiovascular diseaseand stroke. Despite its high prevalence and associated morbidity, many AKIs are preventable, or treatable with rapid recognition and treatment. To date, much of the literature has focused on the role of professionals in managing and reducing such risks. Less work has been done to consider the role patients have in altering disease progression through modifying or changing their behaviour.

Acute kidney injury occurred in clinical trials for weight reduction in 7 adult patients (0.4 cases per 100 patient years) receiving WEGOVY versus 4 patients (0.2 cases per 100 patient years of exposure) receiving placebo. Some of these adverse reactions occurred in association with gastrointestinal adverse reactions or dehydration. In addition, 2 patients treated with WEGOVY had acute kidney injury with dehydration in other clinical trials. The risk of renal adverse reactions with WEGOVY was increased in adult patients with a history of renal impairment (trials included 65 patients with a history of moderate or severe renal impairment at baseline), and occurred more frequently during dose titration.

Retinal Disorders in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2for weight reduction, retinal disorders were reported by 6.9% of patients treated with WEGOVY (semaglutide 2.4 mg), 6.2% of patients treated with semaglutide 1 mg, and 4.2% of patients treated with placebo. The majority of events were reported as diabetic retinopathy (4%, 2.7%, and 2.7%, respectively) and non-proliferative retinopathy (0.7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively).

### Preventing acute kidney injury in high-risk patients by temporarily discontinuing medication-an observational study in general practice [^112soBCV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dehydration is a widespread and significant problem, that is more prevalent in infants, elderly and athletes. In healthy patients, dehydration can be resolved quickly by oral rehydration. However, in some cases, dehydration can lead to intravascular volume depletion, which can cause severe complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or hypotension.

Patients with pre-existent chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure, and elderly patients have an increased risk of these complications, especially when suffering from concurrent illnesses that cause fluid loss such as vomiting, diarrhoea and fever. In these groups, volume regulation and water and sodium homeostasis is impaired.

When patients also use drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS -inhibitors), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or diuretics, this risk is even higher. In patients who use RAAS-inhibitors, water and sodium retention is impaired, causing a decrease in blood pressure and renal blood flow. RAAS-inhibitors and NSAIDs also impair glomerular haemodynamics, leading to a diminished glomerular filtration pressure and renal function. Patients who use diuretics, have a higher risk of suffering from pre-renal acute kidney injury. This is due to the fact that diuretics decrease extracellular volume by increasing diuresis. A mild concurrent illness with additional fluid loss such as a period of fever, or vomiting can trigger AKI in these patients.

This 'cocktail' of dangerous factors (fragile patients using RAAS-inhibitors, NSAIDS or diuretics combined with dehydration) has been described in multiple case reports, and retrospective studies. In almost all of these cases, this cocktail ultimately led to severe reversible kidney injury or severe hypotension with haemodynamic collapse. The main causes of dehydration were vomiting and diarrhoea. Guidelines recommend to (consider to) temporarily discontinue high-risk medication in patients at risk for dehydration to prevent complications.

The extent and impact of these situations in general practice is unknown. In this research we aimed to determine the number of patients at risk in general practice, guideline adherence and the incidence of complications.

### Community-versus hospital-acquired acute kidney injury in hospitalised COVID-19 patients [^113DXfEd]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It has been more than 12 months since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China. As of 16th January 2021 more than 90 million confirmed cases and nearly 2 million deaths have been reported worldwide. COVID-19 causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and there is recognition of a growing number of extrapulmonary complications. Acute kidney injury (AKI) appears to be one of the most widely reported complications of the disease and has been associated with significantly worse outcomes. However, studies to date, which originate principally from China and the United States, vary widely in their reported AKI incidence (0.5–46%) and risk factors for AKI remain poorly understood.

The pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19 is presumed to be multifactorial. Histopathological case series describe acute tubular injury as the predominant finding with less frequent descriptions of thrombotic microangiopathy, cast nephropathy, and collapsing nephropathy. There is also debate as to whether there is direct viral injury to the renal parenchyma with conflicting reports regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the proximal tubular epithelium. The clinical factors driving these pathological findings are likely a combination of traditional risk factors for AKI, such as dehydration and predisposing comorbidities, alongside risk factors which may be more specific to COVID-19 disease. Iatrogenic factors are of particular interest in COVID-19 disease due to high requirements for respiratory support, difficulties managing fluid status, and use of nephrotoxic medications. It is therefore possible that the aetiological factors for AKI in COVID-19 will differ between community- and hospital-acquired AKI.

### Trends in hospitalizations for acute kidney injury-United States, 2000–2014 [^111pc4Gq]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury increases the risk of developing or exacerbating underlying chronic kidney disease (gradual loss of kidney function over time). National health (Healthy People 2020;) objectives call for renal evaluation of patients hospitalized for acute kidney injury 6 months after discharge to monitor kidney function and prevent or delay onset of chronic kidney disease. CDC's Chronic Kidney Disease Surveillance System monitors the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and its risk factors (including acute kidney injury) in the U.S. population and tracks progress in its prevention, management, and control.

Improving both patient and provider awareness that diabetes, hypertension, and advancing age are frequently associated with acute kidney injury is important for reversing these trends. Elderly persons have physiologically reduced kidney function and functional reserve with the appearance of global sclerosis, but also more comorbidity than do young adults, all of which heighten older persons' susceptibility to nephrotoxic medicines, dyes used for imaging, and even dehydration, all preventable risks for acute kidney injury. Better recognition of risk factors for acute kidney injury by health care providers might improve the effectiveness of treatment of underlying conditions and prevent or mitigate additional kidney insult to patients, particularly among those hospitalized or in long-term care.

### Fasting during ramadan and acute kidney injury (AKI): a retrospective, propensity matched cohort study [^117HRXGt]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Repeat subclinical AKI from chronic volume depletion has been proposed as predisposing patients to CKD, because volume depletion is associated with CKD prevalence, particularly when coupled with situations that increase water loss such as high temperature and intensive physical activities. However, there is no evidence demonstrating the link between repeated volume depletion and the development of CKD. Even among marathon runners who have a high risk of AKI, there is no evidence of increased risk of CKD. However, dehydration has multiple effects on the kidney and is linked to AKI, also it might lead to CKD. Therefore, in patients with or at increased risk of CKD, hydration is recommended for preserving kidney function. In contrast, dietary restriction could be beneficial for the kidneys. For instance, dietary restriction had a significant nephroprotective effect in rats. Although dietary restriction may offer some renal protection, it has not been clinically effective in preventing contrast-induced AKI at 48 h after percutaneous coronary intervention.

In-hospital mortality rates due to AKI are extremely high and persist after discharge. In addition, the lack of effective treatment for AKI; the associated risk of long-term complications, such as the risk of developing CKD; and the overall high cost of managing AKI, especially for patients who require renal replacement therapy, indicate that the incidence of AKI can place a huge burden on these patients' quality of life and the health care system. Previous studies investigated various AKI risk factors including drug-induced AKI, CKD, diabetes, hypertension, and so forth. However, only limited studies have evaluated the relationship between fasting and the incidence of AKI. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the relationship between fasting and the risk of developing AKI and to identify patients at high risk of developing AKI.

### Acute kidney injury network: report of an initiative to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury [^1112XkX7]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

1. The definition needs to be broad enough to accommodate variations in clinical presentation over age groups, locations, and clinical situations.

2. Sensitive and specific markers for kidney injury are not currently available in clinical practice. Several groups are working on developing and validating biomarkers of kidney injury and GFR which may be used in the future for diagnosis and prognosis.

3. There is accumulating evidence that small increments in serum creatinine are associated, in a variety of settings, with adverse outcomes that are manifest in short-term morbidity and mortality and in longer-term outcomes, including 1-year mortality. Current clinical practice does not focus much attention on small increments in serum creatinine, which are often attributed to lab variations. However, the coefficient of variation of serum creatinine with modern analyzers is relatively small and therefore increments of 0.3 mg/dl (25 μmol/l) are unlikely to be due to assay variation. Changes in volume status can influence serum creatinine levels. Because the amount of fluid resuscitation depends on the underlying clinical situation, the group agreed that application of the diagnostic criteria would be used only after an optimal state of hydration had been achieved.

4. A time constraint of 48 hours for diagnosis was selected based on the evidence that adverse outcomes with small changes in creatinine were observed when the creatinine elevation occurred within 24 to 48 hours and to ensure that the process was acute and representative of events within a clinically relevant time period. In the two aforementioned studies, there was no distinction of underlying CKD or de novo AKI. However, in the study by Chertow and colleagues, the odds ratio for mortality with a change in creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl (25 μmol/l) was 4.1 (confidence interval 3.1 to 5.5) adjusting for CKD. There is no requirement to wait 48 hours to diagnose AKI or initiate appropriate measures to treat AKI. Instead, the time period is designed to eliminate situations in which the increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 is very slow and thus is not 'acute'.

### Association of oliguria with AKI diagnosis, severity assessment, and outcomes… [^116CgFts]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study suggest that oliguria lasting more than 12 hours has major AKI diagnostic implications and is associated with outcomes irrespective of sCr elevations. According to KDIGO criteria, AKI was defined as an increase in sCr level to at least 1. 5 times the baseline value within a 7-day period, or an increase in sCr level by at least
0. 3 mg/dL within a 48-hour time frame. According to the KDIGO criteria, AKI was defined, on an hourly basis, as a 6-hour mean of less than 0. 5 mL/kg/h. An AKI of stage 1 was defined as a 6-hour mean of less than 0. 5 mL/kg/h, stage 2, as a 12-hour mean of less than
0. 5 mL/kg/h; and stage 3, as a 24-hour mean of less than 0. 3 mL/kg/h or a 12-hour mean equal to 0 mL/kg/h. Patients with AKI had a higher 90-day mortality than those without AKI.

Among patients with AKI, 90-day mortality increased with severity: it was 15. 0% in patients with AKI stage 1,
17. 0% in those with AKI stage 2, and 37. 7% in those with AKI stage
3. Our results are also comparable with data from the Finnish Acute Kidney Injury cohort, 20 a multicenter prospective study including 2160 patients, although it relied on modified KDIGO criteria to define oliguria. In that study, oliguria was associated with a significantly higher 90-day mortality only if an episode lasted more than 12 hours. Lower thresholds were explored and more severe episodes lasting for more than 3 hours were also found to be associated with mortality.

### Acute kidney injury [^113LsPJo]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden loss of excretory kidney function. AKI is part of a range of conditions summarized as acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD), in which slow deterioration of kidney function or persistent kidney dysfunction is associated with an irreversible loss of kidney cells and nephrons, which can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). New biomarkers to identify injury before function loss await clinical implementation. AKI and AKD are a global concern. In low-income and middle-income countries, infections and hypovolaemic shock are the predominant causes of AKI. In high-income countries, AKI mostly occurs in elderly patients who are in hospital, and is related to sepsis, drugs or invasive procedures. Infection and trauma-related AKI and AKD are frequent in all regions. The large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. AKI management in critical care settings is challenging, including appropriate volume control, nephrotoxic drug management, and the timing and type of kidney support. Fluid and electrolyte management are essential. As AKI can be lethal, kidney replacement therapy is frequently required. AKI has a poor prognosis in critically ill patients. Long-term consequences of AKI and AKD include CKD and cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, prevention and early detection of AKI are essential.

### Management of acute kidney injury: core curriculum 2018 [^1174XRkG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous disorder that is common in hospitalized patients and associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. When AKI is present, prompt workup of the underlying cause should be pursued, with specific attention to reversible causes. Measures to prevent AKI include optimization of volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Crystalloids are preferred over colloids for most patients, and hydroxyethyl starches should be avoided. Volume overload in the setting of AKI is associated with adverse outcomes, so attention should be paid to overall fluid balance. Currently there are no targeted pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of AKI. The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with AKI is unclear, but is an area of active investigation. Recent studies suggest that AKI is not a "self-limited" process, but is strongly linked to increased risk for chronic kidney disease, subsequent AKI, and future mortality.

### Extrapulmonary clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients [^116Htf3U]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology.

Detection of coronavirus in the kidneys and urine of COVID-19 patients supports the theory that the virus can directly damage the kidneys. Viral infection can induce tubular damage through the deposition of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) complex on tubules and infiltration of CD68 + macrophages in the tubule interstitium. Besides direct infection, indirect mechanisms potentially lead to tubular injury, cytokine storm syndrome, shock/hemodynamic instability, rhabdomyolysis, and hypoxia of kidney tissue. Acute kidney injury may occur as a result of intrarenal inflammation, increased vascular permeability, volume depletion, and cardiomyopathy leading to cardiorenal syndrome type 1(Figure 1). Cytokine release syndrome includes systemic endothelial injury and clinically manifests as pleural effusions, edema, intra-abdominal hypertension, third space fluid loss, intravascular fluid depletion, and hypotension. Extracorporeal oxygenation, invasive mechanical ventilation, and continuous kidney replacement therapy can also contribute to cytokine production. There is a close relationship between alveolar and tubular damage. According to the recent findings in ARDS, it is concluded that there is a probability of bidirectional alveolar–tubular damage in COVID-19 patients. Injured renal tubular epithelium promotes the upregulation of IL-6, which is associated with higher alveolar-capillary permeability and pulmonary hemorrhage. The fluid expansion increases alveolar-capillary leakage and AKI. It worsens renal vein congestion leading to renal compartment syndrome. The possible mechanism of renal disturbances presented by COVID-19 patients is dehydration which has various consequences on the kidney. It causes a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate and AKI. If the volume depletion is not severe, it can be reversed by hydration, but if ischemia persists like in a shock, acute tubular necrosis may occur. Furthermore, rhabdomyolysis and hypoxia are other possibilities. I, direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2 to renal tubular cells, interstitium, or glomeruli is possible, which confirms previous evidence of the direct cytopathic effect of the virus on renal cells.
