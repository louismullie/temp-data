is:
○ a. Theophyline
b. A B-agonist
○ c. An antihistamine
○ d. A corticosteroid
○ e. Cromolyn sodium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication is the preferred first-line therapy for an asthma exacerbation in the emergency department, with options including theophylline, a beta-agonist, an antihistamine, a corticosteroid, and cromolyn sodium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of acute asthma and what "first-line" should achieve. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines (GINA, AAFP, NEEP) recommend as initial therapy. Next, I will examine the evidence base for each option, including randomized trials and meta-analyses. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and address common misconceptions about adjuncts like anticholinergics and magnesium sulfate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: acute asthma is characterized by bronchospasm and airway inflammation, so first-line therapy must rapidly reverse airflow obstruction and begin to suppress inflammation; anything slower or less effective should not be considered first-line in the ED setting, and I need to ensure my choice aligns with this pathophysiology and the need for rapid onset of action [^422389a1].

> I will now examine the guideline consensus. GINA 2025 explicitly recommends frequent inhaled short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) as initial therapy for acute asthma in the ED, with the most cost-effective and efficient delivery by pressurized metered-dose inhaler with spacer; this is echoed by AAFP guidance emphasizing SABA and oxygen to correct hypoxemia as foundational ED care, which supports SABA as the preferred first-line agent [^feae4a2d] [^be70d48d].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative options. Theophylline is not recommended as first-line due to limited incremental benefit and higher adverse effect risk; GINA advises against IV aminophylline/theophylline in routine ED management, and FDA labeling notes conflicting efficacy data with increased adverse effects when added to standard care, so theophylline should not be chosen over SABA [^43fb50ba] [^6bebb964]. Antihistamines have no role in reversing bronchospasm or inflammation in acute asthma, and cromolyn sodium is a mast-cell stabilizer used for prophylaxis, not for acute rescue, so both are inappropriate first-line choices in the ED [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about corticosteroids. Systemic corticosteroids are indeed indicated early in acute asthma to reduce relapse and speed resolution, but they are not the fastest-acting agent for immediate bronchodilation; they should be given within the first hour alongside SABA, yet they do not provide the rapid reversal of airflow obstruction that defines first-line rescue therapy, so they are complementary rather than the preferred first-line bronchodilator [^04b03156] [^d0103655].

> I should double-check the evidence hierarchy. Multiple high-quality sources converge on SABA as first-line: GINA 2025, AAFP 2024, and critical care reviews all position inhaled SABA as the cornerstone of initial ED therapy, with delivery by MDI+spacer or nebulizer depending on severity and cooperation; this alignment across guidelines and reviews strengthens the conclusion that SABA is the correct answer here [^feae4a2d] [^be70d48d] [^b80b10a6].

> But wait, what if someone argues for ipratropium as first-line? I need to clarify that anticholinergics are adjuncts, not replacements, for SABA; GINA recommends adding ipratropium in moderate-to-severe exacerbations to reduce hospitalizations, and Cochrane shows benefit when combined with SABA, yet this supports SABA plus ipratropium in more severe cases rather than replacing SABA as first-line therapy [^ffe4805f] [^a9336359].

> Final answer: The preferred first-line therapy for asthma exacerbation in the emergency department is a beta-agonist, specifically inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), given frequently and delivered optimally by MDI with spacer or nebulizer depending on severity and patient cooperation, with systemic corticosteroids added early to address inflammation and prevent relapse [^feae4a2d] [^04b03156].

---

The preferred first-line therapy for asthma exacerbation in the emergency department is **short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)** [^feae4a2d] (e.g. albuterol) delivered by metered-dose inhaler with spacer or nebulizer, repeated every 20 minutes for the first hour as needed [^5ff0ef99]. SABA rapidly reverses bronchospasm and is the cornerstone of acute management [^b80b10a6]; systemic corticosteroids should be added early to reduce inflammation and prevent relapse [^04b03156] [^d0103655], and ipratropium may be added for moderate-to-severe cases [^ffe4805f]. Theophylline, antihistamines, and cromolyn sodium are not recommended as first-line therapy in the ED [^43fb50ba].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for SABA as first-line therapy

SABAs are the **cornerstone of acute asthma management** because they provide rapid bronchodilation by relaxing airway smooth muscle via beta-2 adrenergic receptor activation, thereby quickly relieving bronchospasm and improving airflow [^b80b10a6]. Their onset of action is within minutes, making them ideal for acute relief in the ED setting [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting SABA use

Multiple guidelines and studies consistently recommend SABA as **first-line therapy** for acute asthma exacerbations:

- **GINA 2025**: Recommends frequent inhaled SABA (salbutamol/albuterol) as initial therapy for acute asthma exacerbations in the ED [^feae4a2d].
- **AAFP 2024**: Emphasizes SABA as foundational therapy for acute asthma exacerbations in the ED [^be70d48d].
- **Cochrane review**: Confirms SABA as first-line therapy for acute asthma exacerbations, with evidence of reduced hospital admissions and improved lung function [^notfound].

---

## Recommended administration method and dosing

SABA can be administered via **metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer** or nebulizer, with MDI plus spacer preferred for its cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and ease of use [^feae4a2d]. Typical dosing involves 2–6 puffs every 20 minutes for the first hour, titrated to response [^e1a09c47].

---

## Role of systemic corticosteroids

While SABA provides immediate relief, **systemic corticosteroids** are essential to address airway inflammation and prevent relapse. Current guidelines recommend administering systemic corticosteroids within the first hour of ED presentation for most patients with acute asthma exacerbations [^04b03156] [^d0103655].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies may be considered based on severity and response to initial treatment:

- **Ipratropium bromide**: Recommended for moderate-to-severe exacerbations, particularly when combined with SABA, to reduce hospitalizations and improve lung function [^ffe4805f] [^a9336359].
- **Magnesium sulfate**: Considered for severe exacerbations not responding to initial therapy, particularly in patients with FEV1 < 25–30% predicted [^7061f270] [^679fa7b4].
- **Oxygen therapy**: Titrate to maintain oxygen saturation ≥ 93% in adults and adolescents [^3a7bcd04].

---

## Why other options are not preferred first-line

- **Theophylline**: Not recommended due to limited efficacy and significant adverse effects, including arrhythmias and gastrointestinal symptoms [^43fb50ba] [^6bebb964].
- **Antihistamines**: No role in acute asthma management as they do not address bronchospasm or inflammation.
- **Cromolyn sodium**: Not recommended for acute management due to limited efficacy and delayed onset of action.

---

## Clinical outcomes with SABA therapy

SABA therapy is associated with **rapid improvement in symptoms**, reduced need for hospitalization, and improved lung function. Early administration of SABA significantly reduces the risk of progression to severe asthma and respiratory failure [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) are the **preferred first-line therapy** for asthma exacerbation in the emergency department, providing rapid bronchodilation and symptom relief. Systemic corticosteroids should be administered early to address inflammation, and adjunctive therapies such as ipratropium and magnesium sulfate may be considered based on severity and response to initial treatment. Theophylline, antihistamines, and cromolyn sodium are not recommended as first-line therapy in the ED setting [^feae4a2d] [^04b03156].

Background

Asthma is an illness that commonly affects adults and children, and it serves as a common reason for children to attend emergency departments. An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management.

Objectives

Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'.

Main Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta 2 -agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta 2 -agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.

### The patient with asthma in the emergency department [^422389a1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease that presents commonly to the emergency department (ED) in acute exacerbation. Recent asthma treatment guidelines have added content dedicated to the management of acute exacerbations. Effective management of an exacerbation requires rapid assessment of severity through physical examination, measurement of peak expiratory flow rate, and response to initial treatment. Most therapies are directed at alleviating bronchospasm and decreasing airway inflammation. While inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen are the initial and often only therapies required for patients with mild moderate exacerbations, high-dose beta agonists and inhaled anti-cholinergics should also be given to patients with severe exacerbations. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous magnesium and Heliox-driven nebulization of bronchodilators should be considered for patients presenting with severe and very severe exacerbations. Early recognition and appropriate management of respiratory failure are required to mitigate the risk of complications including death. Disposition should be determined based on serial assessments of the response to therapy over the first 4 h in the ED. Patients stable for discharge should receive medications, asthma education including a written asthma action plan, and should have follow-up scheduled for them by ED staff. Rapid implementation of evidence-based, multi-disciplinary care is required to ensure the best possible outcomes for this potentially treatable disease.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — in the emergency department, high-dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for hospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A); when added to systemic corticosteroids, evidence is conflicting in adults, and in children early ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids might reduce hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B). Overall, add-on ICS are well tolerated, but the agent, dose and duration remain unclear and cost may be significant; patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS-containing therapy. On discharge home, patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS-containing treatment because severe exacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) and ICS-containing medications significantly reduce asthma-related death or hospitalization (Evidence A); SABA-only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended, and adding ICS to systemic corticosteroids after discharge showed no significant short-term benefit, though post-discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder exacerbations with wide confidence limits.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^34bd996f]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^10aa712a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild asthma — as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–formoterol for symptom relief is supported by randomized evidence, with low-dose ICS–formoterol taken as needed investigated in six randomized controlled trials and showing reduced severe exacerbations by 60–64% compared with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA). Compared with regular ICS, severe exacerbation risk with as-needed ICS–formoterol was similar in blinded studies or lower in open-label pragmatic trials, and a meta-analysis reported the risk of emergency department presentation/hospitalization was 37% lower versus regular ICS–plus as-needed SABA. As-needed ICS–formoterol was as effective as daily ICS for reducing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and reductions in severe exacerbations versus regular ICS (or SABA alone) were independent of baseline characteristics; qualitative research found it was preferred by most patients with mild asthma but emphasized shared decision making is needed.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### Management of asthma exacerbations in the emergency department [^9b863b55]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations occur across a wide spectrum of chronic severity; they contribute to millions of emergency department (ED) visits in both children and adults every year. Management of asthma exacerbations is an important part of the continuum of asthma care. The best strategy for ED management of an asthma exacerbation is early recognition and intervention, continuous monitoring, appropriate disposition, and, once improved, multifaceted transitional care that optimizes subacute and chronic asthma management after ED discharge. This article concisely reviews ED evaluation, treatment, disposition, and postdischarge care for patients with asthma exacerbations, based on high-quality evidence (eg, systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration) and current international guidelines (eg, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3, Global Initiative for Asthma, and Australian guidelines). Special populations (young children, pregnant women, and the elderly) also are addressed. Despite advances in asthma science, there remain many important evidence gaps in managing ED patients with asthma exacerbation. This article summarizes several of these controversial areas and challenges that merit further investigation.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^b80b10a6]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Inhaled Bronchodilators

The cornerstone in management of asthma and COPD exacerbations is inhaled bronchodilators to treat bronchial hyperreactivity and to reduce airflow obstruction (Table 2). First-line therapy is short-acting β-agonists (SABAs). SABAs can be delivered equally effectively using a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device, with a dry power inhaler, or via a nebulizer; however, nebulized administration may be preferred for patients who are in respiratory distress or who are unable to cooperate with inhalers.– Adult patients who are critically ill with severe exacerbations should be treated with short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs) in addition to SABAs. In severe asthma exacerbations managed in the ED, the combination of SABAs and SAMAs resulted in greater improvement in peak expiratory flow to FEV 1 ratio and fewer hospitalizations compared with SABA treatment alone. No quality studies have evaluated the role of SAMAs in COPD exacerbations or among patients in the ICU; however, they are recommended for severe exacerbations.

### Continuous bronchodilator therapy [^f6135bcb]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Inhaled bronchodilators are first-line treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma. Continuous bronchodilator administration is a novel option for the treatment of bronchospasm, which may be more effective than intermittent therapy for patients with severe airflow obstruction. For 2007, coding and billing changes for this modality become effective. This article reviews clinical aspects and outpatient practice management of continuous bronchodilator therapy.

### Emergency physicians' preferences in bronchodilator delivery for asthma exacerbations: a cross-sectional study [^b449cdf7]. The Journal of Asthma (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder characterized by airway inflammation and narrowing often leading to acute exacerbations that necessitate a visit to the emergency department (ED). While life threatening cases usually require bronchodilator delivery by nebulizers, mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations can be treated by bronchodilators delivered either by metered dose inhalers (MDI). Numerous studies have attempted to compare between the two modalities and have drawn similar conclusions in that both are comparable in efficacy with minimal differences. What is evident, however, is that physicians remain inclined to favor nebulizers in the majority of acute asthma exacerbations.

Methods

In this questionnaire-based study, a survey was distributed to physicians who treat asthma exacerbations to examine demographics, knowledge, beliefs, and current practice in regard to bronchodilator therapy.

Results

The majority (90.8%) of physicians prefer short-acting beta agonists via nebulizer, with 9.2% favoring MDI+spacer. Participants include consultants, residents, and specialists across various emergency disciplines. While 90.1% find MDI+spacer equally effective as nebulizers, advantages cited include cost-effectiveness (49.6%), shorter ED stays (63.4%), quicker administration (67.9%), and ease of use (58.8%). Challenges include availability (66.4%) and ineffectiveness in younger patients (45%). Despite this, 65.6% are willing to switch to MDI for initial asthma management in the ED, while 34.4% are resistant.

Conclusion

Concerns about availability and effectiveness in younger patients remain barriers. However, a significant number are willing to adopt MDIs with spacers, indicating potential for broader use with better availability and training.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5908ddac]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting (evaluation), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain pulmonary function testing in patients with asthma exacerbation presenting to the emergency department. Document peak expiratory flow or FEV1, if possible and without unduly delaying treatment, before initiating treatment. Monitor lung function at 1 hour and at intervals until a clear response to treatment has occurred or a plateau is reached.

### Treatment strategies for reducing asthma-related emergency department visits [^cd29ffd6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute asthma exacerbations reflect inadequate long-term disease control. Treatment to control acute asthma exacerbations includes: 1) rapid reversal of airflow obstruction with bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids and reversing hypoxemia with oxygen in the emergency department (ED); 2) preventing early relapse by prescribing beta(2) agonists and oral corticosteroids at discharge and ensuring patients have an adequate supply of their other asthma medications; and 3) preventing future asthma exacerbations and ED visits through effective treatment in primary care. This article discusses each treatment and reviews the role of emergency physicians in treating patients to reverse airflow obstruction and prevent early relapse, future exacerbations, and ED visits by communicating the need for additional asthma control to patients' primary care physicians.

Emergency department management of exacerbations — reassessment and disposition: "ASSESS CLINICAL PROGRESS FREQUENTLY" and "MEASURE LUNG FUNCTION in all patients one hour after initial treatment". If "FEV1, or PEF 60–80% of predicted or personal best and symptoms improved" classify as "MODERATE" and "Consider for discharge planning (see Box 9–5)". If "FEV1, or PEF < 60% of predicted or personal best, or lack of clinical response" classify as "SEVERE" and "Continue treatment as above and reassess frequently". If "continuing deterioration, treat as severe and re-assess for ICU".

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^10fc1cda]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Evaluation and management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation in the emergency department [^e29a3fd3]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Obstructive lung disease includes asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exacerbation of asthma or COPD can result in significant morbidity and mortality, and emergency department (ED) care is often required. ED evaluation should assess risk factors for severe exacerbation and the patient's hemodynamic and respiratory status. Assessments including chest radiograph, point-of-care ultrasound, capnography, and electrocardiogram can assist. First-line treatments for acute exacerbation include bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Noninvasive ventilation, magnesium, ketamine, and epinephrine should be considered in those with severe exacerbation. Mechanical ventilation is challenging and should use an obstructive lung strategy with permissive hypercapnia.

### Evaluation and management of the critically ill adult asthmatic in the emergency department setting [^4b2f4821]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a common reason for presentation to the Emergency Department and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While patients may have a relatively benign course, there is a subset of patients who present in a critical state and require emergent management.

Objective

This narrative review provides evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of patients with severe asthma.

Discussion

It is important to consider a broad differential diagnosis for the cause and potential mimics of asthma exacerbation. Once the diagnosis is determined, the majority of the assessment is based upon the clinical examination. First line therapies for severe exacerbations include inhaled short-acting beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, intravenous steroids, and magnesium. Additional therapies for refractory cases include parenteral epinephrine or terbutaline, helium‑oxygen mixture, and consideration of ketamine. Intravenous fluids should be administered, as many of these patients are dehydrated and at risk for hypotension if they receive positive pressure ventilatory support. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may prevent the need for endotracheal intubation. If mechanical ventilation is required, it is important to avoid breath stacking by setting a low respiratory rate and allowing permissive hypercapnia. Patients with severe asthma exacerbations will require intensive care unit admission.

Conclusions

This review provides evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of severe asthma with a focus on the emergency clinician.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^d0103655]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — systemic corticosteroids — Systemic corticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapse, and in acute care settings should be utilized in all but the mildest exacerbations in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years (Evidence A). Where possible, systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation. Use of systemic corticosteroids is particularly important in the emergency department if initial SABA treatment fails to achieve lasting improvement in symptoms, the exacerbation developed while the patient was taking OCS, or the patient has a history of previous exacerbations requiring OCS. For route of delivery, oral administration is as effective as intravenous, the oral route is preferred because it is quicker, less invasive and less expensive, and OCS require at least 4 hours to produce a clinical improvement.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating adults with acute asthma in the emergency department [^ded677d5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by airways inflammation, constriction of airway smooth muscle and structural alteration of the airways that is at least partially reversible. Exacerbations of asthma can be life threatening and place a significant burden on healthcare services. Various guidelines have been published to inform management personnel in the acute setting; several include the use of a single bolus of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in cases that do not respond to first-line treatment. However, the effectiveness of this approach remains unclear, particularly in less severe cases.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of IV MgSO4 in adults treated for acute asthma in the emergency department.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR) up to 2 May 2014. We also searched www. ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted trial authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults treated in the emergency department (ED) for exacerbations of asthma if they compared any dose of IV MgSO4 with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, and at least two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, risk of bias and numerical data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and we contacted trial investigators to obtain missing information. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios using study participants as the unit of analysis, and we analysed continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences using fixed-effect models. We rated all outcomes using GRADE and presented results in Summary of findings table 1. We carried out subgroup analyses on the primary outcome for baseline severity of exacerbations and whether or not ipratropium bromide was given as a co-medication. Unpublished data and studies at high risk of bias for blinding were removed from the main analysis in sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning 2313 people with acute asthma to the comparisons of interest in this review. Most studies were double-blinded trials comparing a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes versus a matching placebo. Eleven were conducted at a single centre, and three were multi-centre trials. Participants in almost all of the studies had already been given at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids in the ED; in some studies, investigators also administered ipratropium bromide. Ten studies included only adults, and four included both adults and children; these were included because the mean age of participants was over 18 years. Intravenous MgSO4 reduced hospital admissions compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92; I(2) = 28%, P value 0.18; n = 972; high-quality evidence). In absolute terms, this odds ratio translates into a reduction of seven hospital admissions for every 100 adults treated with IV MgSO4 (95% CI two to 13 fewer). The test for subgroup differences revealed no statistical heterogeneity between the three severity subgroups (I(2) = 0%, P value 0.73) or between the four studies that administered nebulised ipratropium bromide as a co-medication and those that did not (I(2) = 0%, P value 0.82). Sensitivity analyses in which unpublished data and studies at high risk for blinding were removed from the primary analysis did not change conclusions. Within the secondary outcomes, high- and moderate-quality evidence across three spirometric indices suggests some improvement in lung function with IV MgSO4. No difference was found between IV MgSO4and placebo for most of the non-spirometric secondary outcomes, all of which were rated as low or moderate quality (intensive care admissions, ED treatment duration, length of hospital stay, readmission, respiration rate, systolic blood pressure). Adverse events were inconsistently reported and were not meta-analysed. The most commonly cited adverse events in the IV MgSO4 groups were flushing, fatigue, nausea and headache and hypotension (low blood pressure).

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides evidence that a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with acute asthma who have not responded sufficiently to oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids. Differences in the ways the trials were conducted made it difficult for the review authors to assess whether severity of the exacerbation or additional co-medications altered the treatment effect of IV MgSO4. Limited evidence was found for other measures of benefit and safety. Studies conducted in these populations should clearly define baseline severity parameters and systematically record adverse events. Studies recruiting participants with exacerbations of varying severity should consider subgrouping results on the basis of accepted severity classifications.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^d09cb637]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

### Are acute asthma presentations to the emergency department an opportunity for optimising long-term management? A qualitative study on beliefs and behaviours of healthcare professionals [^8b4d15a9]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, asthma exacerbations lead to approximately 110 000 ambulance callouts, 120 000 emergency department (ED) visits, 60 000 hospital admissions and 200 000 bed days per year. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the cornerstone of preventative asthma management; however, a systematic review has shown adherence to be low, between 22% and 63%. Poor adherence could contribute to 24% of exacerbations and 60% of asthma-related hospitalisation. It is common for people to take only symptom-relieving short-acting beta agonist (SABA) medication and to use this too frequently.

The Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines recommend a combined inhaler containing ICS/formoterol (such as Symbicort, Fostair, DuoResp and Luforbec), taken either 'as needed', which is known as 'anti-inflammatory reliever' (AIR) therapy or taken both regularly as a preventer and 'as needed', which is known as a 'maintenance and reliever therapy' (MART) regime, in preference to SABA alone or separate ICS and SABA inhalers. This applies to adolescents and adults with asthma, across the range of asthma severities. National guidelines now also advise this approach. This reflects concerns about the risks of SABA overuse (associated with severe exacerbation riskand potential benefits of providing ICS during reliever inhaler use). Overuse of SABA relievers with underprescribing of ICS inhalers is also associated with a greater risk of hospital admission. Problematically, SABA prescription alone potentially reinforces erroneous beliefs that reliever inhalers are more important than preventers. ICS/formoterol inhalers take advantage of the patient's instinct to take medication when symptoms present but have the advantage of concurrently providing anti-inflammatory steroid for improved longer term clinical outcomes.

### Positive expiratory pressure for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations: a randomized controlled trial [^d2e3e838]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of brief, single administration of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy in reducing clinical severity and need for additional second-line therapies and hospitalization in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute asthma.

Study Design

This was a prospective randomized controlled trial of children 2–18 years of age presenting to a tertiary-care academic pediatric ED with moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations from December 2014 to June 2016. Children who continued to have moderate asthma severity after completion of initial therapies (albuterol/ipratropium bromide and corticosteroids) were randomized to receive PEP therapy or standard of care. The primary outcome was change in pulmonary asthma score before and after intervention, as assessed by a blinded physician. Secondary outcomes included need for additional therapies, ED length of stay, and disposition.

Results

A total of 52 patients were randomized to receive either PEP (n? = ?26) or standard therapy (n? = ?26). Study groups were similar in demographics and baseline characteristics. There was no significant difference in primary outcome between groups with a mean change in Pulmonary Asthma Score of 0.92 (± 1.2) in the PEP group and 0.40 (± 1.2) in the standard group (P? = ?.12). There also was no significant difference in need for additional therapies, ED length of stay, and disposition. Mild, self-resolving side effects were observed in 3 subjects receiving PEP therapy.

Conclusion

Single, brief, administration of PEP therapy after completion of first-line therapies does not improve clinical severity in children presenting to the ED with acute asthma.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02494076.

### Inhaled short-acting bronchodilators for managing emergency childhood asthma: an overview of reviews [^4737a888]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

International guidelines provide conflicting recommendations on how to use bronchodilators to manage childhood acute wheezing conditions in the emergency department (ED), and there is variation within and among countries in how these conditions are managed. This may be reflective of uncertainty about the evidence. This overview of systematic reviews (SRs) aimed to synthesize, appraise, and present all SR evidence on the efficacy and safety of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators to treat asthma and wheeze exacerbations in children 0–18 years presenting to the ED. Searching, review selection, data extraction and analysis, and quality assessments were conducted using methods recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration. Thirteen SRs containing 56 relevant trials and 5526 patients were included. Results demonstrate the efficacy of short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) delivered by metered-dose inhaler as first-line therapy for younger and older children (hospital admission decreased by 44% in younger children, and ED length of stay decreased by 33 min in older children). Short-acting anticholinergic (SAAC) should be added to SABA for older children in severe cases (hospital admission decreased by 27% and 74% when compared to SABA and SAAC alone, respectively). Continuous nebulization, addition of magnesium sulfate to SABA, and levosalbutamol compared to salbutamol cannot be recommended in routine practice.

### Ipratropium bromide for acute asthma exacerbations in the emergency setting: a literature review of the evidence [^1a4cbc6f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Since the 1970s, when inhaled anticholinergic agents were first introduced as adjunct therapies for the immediate treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations, several trials have shown varying degrees of benefit from their use as bronchodilators in combination with inhaled short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists and systemic corticosteroids. Although other anticholinergics exist, ipratropium bromide (IB) specifically has emerged as the overwhelming choice of pulmonologists and emergency physicians because of its limited systemic absorption from the lungs when given as an inhaled preparation. However, although the varying trials, predominantly in the emergency department setting, have typically shown a trend toward improved outcomes, none has set forth clear dosing protocol recommendations for use by practicing physicians. It is our goal in this review of the available literature on the use of IB, as an adjunct to inhaled short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists, to summarize practical, evidence-based recommendations for use in the pediatric emergency department setting for acute asthma exacerbations. We also hope to better delineate the most effective dosing regimen in those patients who might benefit most from the addition of IB and to explore proposed additional benefits it may have as a modulator of cholinergic-induced effects from high-dose beta-agonist therapy and viral triggers.

### Parental preference for short-versus long-course corticosteroid therapy in children with asthma presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^a2cf8c1b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic condition affecting children and a prominent chief complaint in pediatric emergency departments (ED). We aimed to determine parental preference between short- and long-term courses of oral corticosteroids for use in children with mild to moderate asthma presenting to our pediatric ED with acute asthma exacerbations. We surveyed parents of asthmatic children who presented to our pediatric ED from August 2011 to April 2012. Questions characterized each patient's asthma severity, assessed parental preference among systemic steroid and inhaled medication delivery options for acute asthma management, and inquired about compliance, medication costs, and intention to follow up. The majority of our parents prefer the use of 1 to 2 days of steroids to 5 days for acute asthma exacerbations in the ED. Thus, dexamethasone is an attractive alternative to prednisone/prednisolone and should be considered in the management of acute asthma exacerbations in the ED.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^ba7dc490]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Multicenter study of chronic asthma severity among emergency department patients with acute asthma [^2c42b11f]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The initiation of controller therapy for asthma depends on chronic asthma severity. To facilitate initiation of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), the preferred controller therapy, in the emergency department (ED), the objective of the study was to describe chronic asthma severity, as defined by the national asthma guidelines, among children presenting to the ED with acute asthma.

Methods

Investigators at 14 U.S. sites prospectively enrolled consecutive children 2–17 years presenting to the ED with acute asthma. Three factors (daytime symptoms, nighttime symptoms, and medication usage) were used to categorize children into four chronic asthma severity groups: intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent or severe persistent.

Results

This multistate cohort of 311 children had a mean age of 7.7 years, was 51% Black, and 89% had a primary care provider (PCP). Regarding chronic severity, 18% were intermittent and 82% persistent: 37% mild persistent, 24% moderate persistent, and 20% severe persistent. Chronic severity groups did not differ by demographics or PCP status. Patients with persistent asthma were more likely to report moderate-severe asthma symptoms (58% versus 19%; p < .001), poor asthma control (2% versus 18%; p = .002), and more ED visits (median, 2 versus 1; p < .001) in the past year. The groups did not differ in acute asthma severity, ED treatment, or admission rate. Rate of discharge prescription for ICSs was low, albeit higher among children with persistent asthma (24% versus 4%; p = .003).

Conclusions

The high prevalence of persistent asthma among ED patients exceeds the prevalence reported previously, and supports ED initiation of ICS, as recommended by national guidelines.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^8facfa30]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 3: Recognize and support education and management plans addressing exacerbation risk for people with all severities of asthma

Asthma exacerbations can occur in all severities of asthma despite guideline-directed treatment. A history of ED visits or hospitalization for an exacerbation increase the risk of future exacerbations, irrespective of severity, patient demographics, or clinical characteristics. Patients with intermittent, mild, and moderate asthma are all at risk for exacerbations, which is often related to unrecognized lack of asthma control.

Recently in the US, approximately 60% of adults and 44% of children were reported to have uncontrolled asthma, with more than 80% of whom had mild or moderate asthma. In an international cohort of 1115 patients classified as GINA Step 1 or Step 2, 25% had uncontrolled asthma and about 33% reported rescue inhaler use in the previous 4 weeks. Based on United Kingdom data from the National Review of Asthma Deaths, up to 45% of patients across asthma severities dies without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided, indicating a need for improved education and management plans.

Appropriate and optimal therapy to minimize symptoms, exacerbations risk, and routine exacerbation assessment and history is important for all patients with asthma, regardless of severity.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^95315a0d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation — criteria for hospitalization versus discharge from the emergency department prioritize that clinical status and lung function 1 hour after treatment are more reliable predictors than arrival status, and provide spirometric thresholds and risk factors to guide decisions. Hospitalization is recommended if pre-treatment FEV1 or PEF is < 25% predicted or personal best, or if post-treatment FEV1 or PEF is < 40% predicted or personal best. Discharge may be possible when post-treatment lung function is 40–60% predicted after considering patient risk factors and availability of follow-up care, and discharge is recommended when post-treatment lung function is > 60% predicted or personal best after considering risk factors and follow-up care availability. Other factors associated with increased likelihood of admission include female sex, older age and non-white race; use of more than eight beta2 agonist puffs in the previous 24 hours; severity indicators such as respiratory rate > 22 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation < 95%, and final PEF < 50% predicted; past history of severe exacerbations; and previous unscheduled office and emergency department visits requiring use of OCS.

### Management of acute asthma exacerbations [^6b2ef94e]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. Criteria for exacerbation severity are based on symptoms and physical examination parameters, as well as lung function and oxygen saturation. In patients with a peak expiratory flow of 50 to 79 percent of their personal best, up to two treatments of two to six inhalations of short-acting beta2 agonists 20 minutes apart followed by a reassessment of peak expiratory flow and symptoms may be safely employed at home. Administration using a hand-held metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is at least equivalent to nebulized beta2 agonist therapy in children and adults. In the ambulatory and emergency department settings, the goals of treatment are correction of severe hypoxemia, rapid reversal of airflow obstruction, and reduction of the risk of relapse. Multiple doses of inhaled anticholinergic medication combined with beta2 agonists improve lung function and decrease hospitalization in school-age children with severe asthma exacerbations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to significantly increase lung function and decrease the necessity of hospitalization in children. The administration of systemic corticosteroids within one hour of emergency department presentation decreases the need for hospitalization, with the most pronounced effect in patients with severe exacerbations. Airway inflammation can persist for days to weeks after an acute attack; therefore, more intensive treatment should be continued after discharge until symptoms and peak expiratory flow return to baseline.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^ee27c27b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department visits annually. Between 12–16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation and this review examines the evidence for using systemic corticosteroids to improve outcomes after discharge from the ED.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez* RCT" register was searched using the terms: a) Asthma OR Wheez* b) Glucocorticoid OR Steroid* AND c) Exacerbat* OR Relapse* OR Emerg*. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to determine if unpublished studies which met the inclusion criteria were available. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials were eligible for selection. Studies were included in this review if they dealt with the outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations using glucocorticoids at discharge and reported either relapse rate or PFTs. Two independent reviewers first identified potentially relevant studies and then selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Agreement was assessed using kappa (k) statistics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers; authors were contacted to verify the extracted data and clarify missing information. When author contact was unsuccessful, missing data were estimated from graphs where possible. Sensitivity, sub-group and overall analyses were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager.

Main Results

A search that yielded 229 references identified 169 (73%) original publications. Reviewers identified 8 studies for potential inclusion (k = 0.76); 18 references were added by searching publication reference lists and contact with authors. Of these 26 articles, a total of 7 were included in the overview. Two studies used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (odds ratio (OR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17, 0.73). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (OR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.82). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta-agonists (weighted mean difference (WMD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI: -5.5, -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI: -0.47, 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI: -0.38, 0.44) in the first 7–10 days, while rarely reported, showed no differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. It appears that IM corticosteroids are similarly efficacious to a 7–10 day tapering course of oral agents. From these results, as few as 13 patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Reviewer's Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an acute exacerbation of asthma significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care and decreases beta-agonist use without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular corticosteroids appear as effective as oral agents.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^7061f270]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV magnesium (as a single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes in adult and pediatric patients not responding to initial treatment and having persistent hypoxemia, and in pediatric patients whose FEV1 fails to reach 60% predicted after 1 hour of care), to reduce hospital admissions, including in adult patients with FEV1 < 25–30% predicted at presentation.

### Combined inhaled β-agonist and anticholinergic agents for emergency management in adults with asthma [^a9336359]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled short-acting anticholinergics (SAAC) and short-acting beta₂-agonists (SABA) are effective therapies for adult patients with acute asthma who present to the emergency department (ED). It is unclear, however, whether the combination of SAAC and SABA treatment is more effective in reducing hospitalisations compared to treatment with SABA alone.

Objectives

To conduct an up-to-date systematic search and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy (SAAC + SABA agents) vs. SABA alone to reduce hospitalisations in adult patients presenting to the ED with an exacerbation of asthma.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS, LILACS, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global and evidence-based medicine (EBM) databases using controlled vocabulary, natural language terms, and a variety of specific and general terms for inhaled SAAC and SABA drugs. The search spanned from 1946 to July 2015. The Cochrane Airways Group provided search results from the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials which was most recently conducted in July 2016. An extensive search of the grey literature was completed to identify any other potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Included studies were randomised or controlled clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy (SAAC and SABA) to SABA treatment alone to prevent hospitalisations in adults with acute asthma in the emergency department. Two independent review authors assessed studies for inclusion using pre-determined criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model and reporting heterogeneity (I²). For continuous outcomes, we reported individual trial results using mean differences (MD) and pooled results as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model.

Main Results

We included 23 studies that involved a total of 2724 enrolled participants. Most studies were rated at unclear or high risk of bias. Overall, participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were less likely to be hospitalised (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.87; participants = 2120; studies = 16; I² = 12%; moderate quality of evidence). An estimated 65 fewer patients per 1000 would require hospitalisation after receiving combination therapy (95% 30 to 95), compared to 231 per 1000 patients receiving SABA alone. Although combination inhaled therapy was more effective than SABA treatment alone in reducing hospitalisation in participants with severe asthma exacerbations, this was not found for participants with mild or moderate exacerbations (test for difference between subgroups P = 0.02). Participants receiving combination therapy were more likely to experience improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) (MD 0.25 L, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.48; participants = 687; studies = 6; I² = 70%; low quality of evidence), peak expiratory flow (PEF) (MD 36.58 L/min, 95% CI 23.07 to 50.09; participants = 1056; studies = 12; I² = 25%; very low quality of evidence), increased percent change in PEF from baseline (MD 24.88, 95% CI 14.83 to 34.93; participants = 551; studies = 7; I² = 23%; moderate quality of evidence), and were less likely to return to the ED for additional care (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; participants = 1180; studies = 5; I² = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) than participants receiving SABA alone. Participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were more likely to experience adverse events than those treated with SABA agents alone (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.20; participants = 1392; studies = 11; I² = 14%; moderate quality of evidence). Among patients receiving combination therapy, 103 per 1000 were likely to report adverse events (95% 31 to 195 more) compared to 131 per 1000 patients receiving SABA alone.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, combination inhaled therapy with SAAC and SABA reduced hospitalisation and improved pulmonary function in adults presenting to the ED with acute asthma. In particular, combination inhaled therapy was more effective in preventing hospitalisation in adults with severe asthma exacerbations who are at increased risk of hospitalisation, compared to those with mild-moderate exacerbations, who were at a lower risk to be hospitalised. A single dose of combination therapy and multiple doses both showed reductions in the risk of hospitalisation among adults with acute asthma. However, adults receiving combination therapy were more likely to experience adverse events, such as tremor, agitation, and palpitations, compared to patients receiving SABA alone.

### The acute management of asthma [^a1cb226b]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or clinic with acute exacerbation of asthma (AEA) can be very challenging varying in both severity and response to therapy. High-dose, frequent or continuous nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy that can be combined with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is the backbone of treatment. When patients do not rapidly clinically respond to SABA/SAMA inhalation, the early use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be considered and has been shown to impact the immediate need for ICU admission or even the need for hospital admission. Adjunctive therapies such as the use of intravenous magnesium and helium/oxygen combination gas for inhalation and for driving a nebulizer to deliver a SABA and or SAMA should be considered and are best used early in the treatment plan if they are likely to impact the patients' clinical course. The use of other agents such as theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist currently does not play a major role in the immediate treatment of AEA in the clinic or the ED but is an important therapeutic option for physicians to be aware of and to consider initiating at the time of discharge from clinic, hospital, or ED to reduce later clinical worsening and readmission to the ED and hospital. A comprehensive summary is provided of the currently available respiratory pharmaceuticals approved for asthma and other airway syndromes. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of medications available for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations and the agents that should be initiated to prevent worsening or additional exacerbations. They need to be familiar with the major potential drug toxicities associated with their use.

### Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma [^0d9a0440]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may also be beneficial in this setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of ICS for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED).

Search Methods

We identified controlled clinical trials from the Cochrane Airways Group specialised register of controlled trials. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched. The latest search was September 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Studies were included if patients presented to the ED or its equivalent with acute asthma, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors. There were three different types of studies that were included in this review: 1) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with no systemic corticosteroids given to either treatment group, 2) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with systemic corticosteroids given to both treatment groups, and 3) studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroids. For the analysis, the first two types of studies were included as separate subgroups in the primary analysis (ICS vs. placebo), while the third type of study was included in the secondary analysis (ICS vs. systemic corticosteroid).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two review authors if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model was used for sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity is reported using I-squared (I(2)) statistics.

Main Results

Twenty trials were selected for inclusion in the primary analysis (13 paediatric, seven adult), with a total number of 1403 patients. Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 12 studies; 960 patients) and heterogeneity (I(2) = 27%) was modest. This represents a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per 100 patients treated with ICS in comparison with placebo. Subgroup analysis of hospital admissions based on concomitant systemic corticosteroid use revealed that both subgroups indicated benefit from ICS in reducing hospital admissions (ICS and systemic corticosteroid versus systemic corticosteroid: OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 5 studies; N = 433; ICS versus placebo: OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 7 studies; N = 527). However, there was moderate heterogeneity in the subgroup using ICS in addition to systemic steroids (I(2) = 52%). Patients receiving ICS demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF: MD 7%; 95% CI 3% to 11%) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1): MD 6%; 95% CI 2% to 10%) at three to four hours post treatment). Only a small number of studies reported these outcomes such that they could be included in the meta-analysis and most of the studies in this comparison did not administer systemic corticosteroids to either treatment group. There was no evidence of significant adverse effects from ICS treatment with regard to tremor or nausea and vomiting. In the secondary analysis of studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroid alone, heterogeneity among the studies complicated pooling of data or drawing reliable conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

ICS therapy reduces hospital admissions in patients with acute asthma who are not treated with oral or intravenous corticosteroids. They may also reduce admissions when they are used in addition to systemic corticosteroids; however, the most recent evidence is conflicting. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma in addition to systemic corticosteroids. Also, there is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy can be used in place of systemic corticosteroid therapy when treating acute asthma. Further research is needed to clarify the most appropriate drug dosage and delivery device, and to define which patients are most likely to benefit from ICS therapy. Use of similar measures and reporting methods of lung function, and a common, validated, clinical score would be helpful in future versions of this meta-analysis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^e1a09c47]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 12–4 — Initial emergency department management of asthma exacerbations in children 5 years and younger outlines immediate therapies and dosing. Supplemental oxygen is delivered by face nasal prongs or mask to maintain oxygen saturation at 94–98%. Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) dosing is 2–6 puffs of salbutamol by spacer, or 2.5 mg by nebulizer, every 20 minutes for the first hour, then severity is reassessed; if symptoms persist or recur, give an additional 2–3 puffs per hour and admit to hospital if > 10 puffs are required in 3–4 hours. Systemic corticosteroids include an initial oral prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum 20 mg for children < 2 years old or 30 mg for children 2–5 years, or intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg 6-hourly on day 1. Additional options in the first hour are to consider adding ipratropium bromide (1–2 puffs by pMDI and spacer; if poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide 250 mcg every 20 minutes for 1 hour only) and to consider nebulized isotonic magnesium sulfate (150 mg) as 3 doses in the first hour for children aged ≥ 2 years with severe exacerbation. If inhalation is not possible, an intravenous bolus of terbutaline 2 mcg/kg may be given over 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of 5 mcg/kg/hour.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^3b601924]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma post–emergency department or hospitalization follow-up — Patients discharged following an emergency department presentation or hospitalization for asthma should be especially targeted for an asthma education program, if one is available, and healthcare providers should take the opportunity to review the patient's understanding of the cause of their asthma exacerbation, modifiable risk factors for exacerbations (including, where relevant, smoking), the patient's understanding of the purposes and correct uses of medications including ICS-containing maintenance treatment and anti-inflammatory reliever, if prescribed, and the actions the patient needs to take to respond to worsening symptoms or peak flows. After an emergency department presentation, comprehensive intervention programs that include optimization of asthma treatment, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education are cost effective and have shown significant improvement in asthma outcomes (Evidence B). Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma, or who have had several presentations to an acute care setting despite having a primary care provider, and follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: management strategies [^be70d48d]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations, defined as a deterioration in baseline symptoms or lung function, cause significant morbidity and mortality. Asthma action plans help patients triage and manage symptoms at home. In patients 12 years and older, home management includes an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination for those who are not using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler for maintenance, or a short-acting beta2 agonist for those using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler that does not include formoterol. In children four to 11 years of age, an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol inhaler, up to eight puffs daily, can be used to reduce the risk of exacerbations and need for oral corticosteroids. In the office setting, it is important to assess exacerbation severity and begin a short-acting beta2 agonist and oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations, with repeated doses of the short-acting beta2 agonist every 20 minutes for one hour and oral corticosteroids. Patients with severe exacerbations should be transferred to an acute care facility and treated with oxygen, frequent administration of a short-acting beta2 agonist, and corticosteroids. The addition of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist and magnesium sulfate infusion has been associated with fewer hospitalizations. Patients needing admission to the hospital require continued monitoring and systemic therapy similar to treatments used in the emergency department. Improvement in symptoms and forced expiratory volume in one second or peak expiratory flow to 60% to 80% of predicted values helps determine appropriateness for discharge. The addition of inhaled corticosteroids, consideration of stepping up asthma maintenance therapy, close follow-up, and education on asthma action plans are important next steps to prevent future exacerbations.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^74fd40be]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma affects over 17.5 million adults in North America and its prevalence continues to rise, as evidenced by the 12.3% relative increase from 2001 (7.3%) to 2009 (8.2%). Worldwide, asthma prevalence ranges from low (underdeveloped countries) to high (developed countries). Asthma is predominantly a chronic disease that can be controlled with appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions; however, exacerbations do not always respond to standard or additional treatment options, leading to urgent visits to health providers, admissions to hospital and, in severe and rare cases, death. In the USA, patients with exacerbations had significantly higher asthma-related healthcare costs: $1740 over 1 year compared with $847 for asthmatics without exacerbations. While patients with acute asthma often seek care in the emergency department (ED), most are successfully treated and subsequently discharged; only 6–12% of adult patients presenting to the ED with an exacerbation of asthma will be admitted.

The understanding and management of acute asthma have advanced considerably in recent years. Current evidence-based guidelines (National Asthma Education and Prevention Plan (NAEPP), Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS)) suggest that early treatment with short-acting β 2 -agonists, inhaled short-acting anticholinergic agents and systemic corticosteroids (SCS) will reduce hospitalisations. On ED discharge, SCS are recommended, and further studies suggest that prescribing inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at discharge can reduce relapse following discharge at least in adult patients. ICS in combination with long-acting β-agonists (ICS/LABA) are more effective than ICS monotherapy in patients with persistent asthma, with the number needed to treat of 19 to prevent one exacerbation. On the other hand, the impact of non-pharmacological interventions (ie, ED-based educational strategies) on relapses remains unclear.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^c6e485e6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation — discharge planning and follow-up specify that prior to discharge, arrangements should be made for a follow-up appointment within 2–7 days (1–2 days for children) and strategies to improve asthma management including medications, inhaler skills and a written asthma action plan should be addressed. All patients should be prescribed ongoing inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment; for adults and adolescents, the preferred regimen after discharge is maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with the anti-inflammatory reliever ICS-formoterol, and in the context of a recent ED visit or hospitalization it would be appropriate to commence treatment with ICS-formoterol in adults and adolescents at Step 4, with the maintenance dose stepped down once fully recovered and asthma has remained stable for 2–3 months. Following discharge, the patient should be reviewed regularly over subsequent weeks until good symptom control is achieved and personal best lung function is reached or surpassed; incentives such as free transport and telephone reminders improve primary care follow up but have shown no effect on long-term outcomes. At follow-up, ensure treatment is optimized to reduce future exacerbation risk, consider switching to GINA Track 1 with the anti-inflammatory reliever ICS-formoterol if not already prescribed, and check and correct inhaler technique and adherence.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs or quasi-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented with acute asthma to the ED or its equivalent, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers.

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper.

Main Results

Seven trials were selected for inclusion, but data were not available for one of them. In the six usable trials, (4 adult, 2 paediatric), a total of 352 patients were studied (179 ICS, 173 non-ICS treated). Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.64). This benefit was confined to patients not receiving concomitant systemic steroids (CS). Patients receiving concomitant CS showed a similar, but non-significant, trend towards reduced admissions compared to placebo treatment (OR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.14). Patients receiving ICS also demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flows (PEFR WMD: 8%; 95% CI: 3, 13%) and forced expiratory volumes (FEV1 WMD: 5%; 95% CI: 0.4, 10%). The treatment was well tolerated, with few reported adverse side effects. A secondary analysis compared ICS alone vs CS alone; in the four trials included, there was significant heterogeneity between the study results for admission rates which precluded meaningful pooling of the study results.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Inhaled steroids reduced admission rates in patients with acute asthma, but it is unclear if there is a benefit of ICS when used in addition to systemic corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence that ICS alone is as effective as CS. Further research is needed to clarify if there is a benefit of ICS when used in addition to CS.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^91e27db1]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 2: Counsel patients on the warning signs and symptoms of loss of asthma control that may precede exacerbations to facilitate initiation of timely and effective treatment to prevent exacerbations or reduce their severity

Counseling patient on warning signs such as an increase in their usual asthma symptoms or new onset of things such as cough that can precede exacerbations could prompt treatment with anti-inflammatory therapy, help mitigate exacerbation severity, and potentially prevent an exacerbation from occurring. Appropriate use of anti-inflammatory therapy (ICS) prior to an exacerbation may decrease use and overuse of health care resources such as the ED or urgent care, SABA and systemic corticosteroids (SCS).

Using an asthma action plan can give patients and families specific parameters for patients to take action in identifying and using early treatment for an exacerbation. Exacerbation triggers and how to address them should be identified.

While spirometry is the gold standard for diagnosing asthma it has limited practical value in exacerbation management. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement can provide objective data on lung function for assessing exacerbation severity and response to treatment. However, frequency and severity of symptoms is a more practical and widely available measure of exacerbation onset and is more sensitive than PEF for most people. For those with poor perception of airflow limitation symptoms, regular PEF monitoring can help proactively identify exacerbation episodes.

Window of opportunity for intervention

About 10–14 days before an asthma exacerbation, progressively rising inflammation often underlies the decrease in lung function (PEF), accompanied by an increase in symptoms, which may result in patients increasing SABA use –. SABA use can provide symptomatic relief, but it does not address airway inflammation and overuse of SABA has been shown to increase risks. The timeframe leading up to an exacerbation may represent a "window of opportunity" to minimize airway inflammation and either prevent or reduce the exacerbation by adding anti-inflammatory therapy, if the patient is not using anti-inflammatory therapy, or scaling up the current anti-inflammatory dose.

GINA recommends the use of an anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR), which is low dose as-needed ICS-formoterol, or ICS-SABA for symptom control rather than SABA-only as a means to improve control and mitigate the risk of a serious exacerbation. Formoterol has the advantage of a fast and long-acting bronchodilator, while salbutamol (albuterol) is also fast but short-acting.

Asthma management — Implementation guidance (use, safety, and counseling for LAMA): The Expert Panel makes suggestions that a LAMA can be used as an add-on to ICS therapy in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled asthma as part of Step 4 therapy, but add-on LABA therapy has a more favorable benefit-harm profile; individuals at risk of urinary retention and those who have glaucoma should not receive LAMA therapy; the small increase in the potential risk of harms from a LAMA may outweigh its benefits in some individuals, particularly in Blacks; LAMA treatment requires appropriate use of specific inhaler devices and clinicians should teach individuals with asthma how to use these devices appropriately; when clinicians prescribe LAMA therapy, they should prescribe this medication for long-term asthma control in the ambulatory setting and that LAMA therapy does not have a role in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma in the ambulatory, emergency department, or inpatient settings; and clinicians should confirm the asthma diagnosis and address factors that often contribute to uncontrolled asthma before considering intensifying therapy by adding a LAMA.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^1d415bbf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Follow-up

Arrange early follow-up after any exacerbation, regardless of where it was managed:

- Review the patient's symptom control and risk factors for further exacerbations.
- Prescribe/continue ICS-containing controller therapy (preferably MART with ICS–formoterol) to reduce the risk of further exacerbations. If already taking controller therapy, continue increased doses for 2–4 weeks.
- Provide a written asthma action plan and, where relevant, advice about avoiding exacerbation triggers.
- Check inhaler technique and adherence.

Asthma outcomes after an ED presentation for acute asthma are significantly improved by comprehensive intervention programs that include optimal controller management, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education (self-monitoring, written action plan, and regular review).

Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma or who have repeat presentations to acute care settings. Follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent ED visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^680519d8]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Discharge management after an asthma exacerbation requires arranging ongoing treatment before the patient goes home, including starting ICS-containing controller treatment or stepping up the dose of existing ICS-containing treatment for 2–4 weeks and reducing reliever medication to as-needed use. If anti-inflammatory reliever (e.g. ICS-formoterol) was replaced with SABA during an emergency department or hospital stay, patients should resume taking as-needed anti-inflammatory reliever instead of SABA before or on discharge; if previously using maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with ICS-formoterol, they should resume MART.

Patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.57). This benefit was evident in the subgroup of patients not receiving concomitant systemic steroids (OR 0.21; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.53). Patients receiving concomitant systemic steroids showed a similar, but non-significant, trend towards reduced admissions compared to placebo treatment (OR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.12). Patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids also demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flows (PEFR WMD: 8%; 95% CI: 3, 13%) and forced expiratory volumes (FEV1 WMD: 5%; 95% CI: 0.4, 10%). The treatment was well tolerated, with few reported adverse side effects.

### Pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: evaluation and management from emergency department to intensive care unit [^315cd17f]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this report is to review available modalities for assessing and managing acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients, including some that are not included in current expert panel guidelines. While it is not our purpose to provide a comprehensive review of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, we review NAEPP-recommended treatments to provide the full range of treatments available for managing exacerbations with an emphasis on the continuum of care between the ER and ICU.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed using the following search terms in different combinations: asthma, children, pediatric, exacerbation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, guidelines, treatment, management, oxygen, albuterol, β2-agonist, anticholinergic, theophylline, corticosteroid, magnesium, heliox, BiPAP, ventilation, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure. We attempted to weigh the evidence using the hierarchy in which meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the strongest evidence, followed by individual RCTs, followed by observational studies. We also reviewed the NAEPP and Global Initiative for Asthma expert panel guidelines.

Results and Conclusions

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and acute exacerbations are a significant burden to patients and to public health. Optimal assessment and management of exacerbations, including appropriate escalation of interventions, are essential to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality. While inhaled albuterol and systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of exacerbation management, escalation may include interventions discussed in this review.

### Stopping long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) for children with asthma well controlled on LABA and inhaled corticosteroids [^2a68d38a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common chronic medical condition among children and is one of the most common causes of hospitalisation and medical visits. Poorly controlled asthma often leads to preventable exacerbations that require additional medications, hospital stays, or treatment in the emergency department. Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) are the preferred add-on treatment for children with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a 'black box' warning for LABA in asthma, and now recommends that they be used "for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved".

Objectives

To compare the effect on asthma control and adverse effects of stepping down to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-only therapy versus continuing ICS plus LABA in children whose asthma is well controlled on combined ICS and LABA therapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, and also searched www. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.who.int/ictrp/en/, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews, and manufacturers' trial registries (GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca). We searched all databases from their inception to the present, and imposed no restriction on language of publication. The most recent search was done in April 2015.

Selection Criteria

We looked for parallel randomised controlled trials of at least eight weeks' duration, available as published full text, abstract only, or unpublished data. We excluded studies including participants with other chronic respiratory comorbidities (for example bronchiectasis). We looked for studies in which children (18 years or younger) whose asthma was well controlled on any dose of ICS and LABA combination therapy were randomised to: a) step-down therapy to ICS alone or b) continued use of ICS and LABA. We included any dose of LABA (formoterol, salmeterol, vilanterol) and any dose of ICS (beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, mometasone, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate, fluticasone furoate, triamcinolone) delivered in a combination inhaler or in separate inhalers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all records identified in the searches. We used a data extraction tool in Microsoft Excel to manage searches and document reasons for inclusion and exclusion, and to extract descriptive and numerical data from trials meeting the inclusion criteria. The prespecified primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring oral steroids, asthma control, and all-cause serious adverse events.

Main Results

Despite conducting extensive searches of electronic databases, trial registries and manufacturers' websites we identified no trials matching the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates, we screened 1031 abstracts, and assessed 43 full-text articles for inclusion. We identified several adult studies, which will be summarised in a separate review (Ahmad 2014). The most common reasons for exclusion after viewing full texts were 'wrong comparison' (n = 22) and 'adult population' (n = 18). Some adult studies recruited adolescents from age 15, but none reported data separately for those under 18.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence from randomised trials to inform the discontinuation of LABAs in children once asthma control is achieved with ICS plus LABA. It is disappointing that such an important issue has not been studied, and a randomised double-blind trial recruiting children who are controlled on ICS plus LABA is warranted. The study should be large enough to assess children of different ages, and to measure the important safety and efficacy outcomes suggested in this review over at least six months. The only randomised evidence for stopping LABA has been conducted in adults; it will be summarised in a separate review.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^0db302b6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma treatment step-down — pre-step-down assessment should account for current treatment, risk factors and preferences, with few data on optimal timing, sequence and magnitude of reductions. Factors associated with greater risk after step-down include a history of exacerbations and/or emergency department visit for asthma in the previous 12 months, and a low baseline FEV1; other predictors include airway hyperresponsiveness and sputum eosinophilia, but these tests are not readily available in primary care. Any treatment step-down should be considered as a therapeutic trial, evaluating symptom control and exacerbation frequency, and before stepping down, the patient should be given a written asthma action plan and instructions for how and when to re-start their previous treatment if their symptoms worsen.

### The use of ipratropium bromide for the management of acute asthma exacerbation in adults and children: a systematic review [^90e5908d]. The Journal of Asthma (2001). Low credibility.

Ipratropium bromide is a quaternary anticholinergic bronchodilator that is commonly used to treat obstructive lung disease. Although ipratropium is not usually employed as a first-line bronchodilator to treat chronic asthma, it has been used extensively in hospital emergency departments as adjunctive therapy for the emergency treatment of acute asthma exacerbation. This review will summarize the physiological actions of ipratropium and the rationale for its use as an anticholinergic bronchodilator. Evidence available from randomized trials and from two meta-analyses is summarized to determine whether the addition of inhaled ipratropium to inhaled beta2-agonist therapy is effective in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation in children and adults. Published reports of randomized, controlled trials assessing the use of ipratropium and concurrent beta2-agonists in adult acute asthma exacerbation were identified by a search of electronic databases, as well as by hand searching. Data from 10 studies of adult asthmatics, reporting on a total of 1377 patients, were pooled in a meta-analysis using a weighted-average method. Use of nebulized ipratropium/beta2-agonist combination therapy was associated with a pooled 7.3% improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.8–10.9%] and a 22.1% improvement in peak expiratory flow (95% CI, 11.0–33.2%) compared with patients who received beta2-agonist without ipratropium. For the three trials in adults reporting hospital admission data (n = 1064), adult patients receiving ipratropium had a relative risk of hospitalization of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.61–1.06). Similarly, randomized controlled studies of pediatric asthma exacerbation and a meta-analysis of pediatric asthma patients suggest that ipratropium added to beta2-agonists improves lung function and also decreases hospitalization rates, especially among children with severe exacerbations of asthma. The adult and pediatric studies did not report any severe adverse effects attributable to ipratropium when it was used in conjunction with beta2-agonists. In conclusion, there is a modest statistical improvement in airflow obstruction when ipratropium is used as an adjunctive to beta2-agonists for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation. In pediatric asthma exacerbation, use of ipratropium also appears to improve clinical outcomes; however, this has not been definitively established in adults. It would seem reasonable to recommend the use of combination ipratropium/beta2-agonist therapy in acute asthmatic exacerbation, since the addition of ipratropium seems to provide physiological evidence of benefit without risk of adverse effects.

### Hospital-based management of acute asthmatic exacerbation: an assessment of physicians' behavior in Taiwan [^8de8d51d]. The Journal of Asthma (2001). Low credibility.

This retrospective study was conducted to assess Taiwanese emergency physicians for their preference in management and adherence to guidelines in treating patients with acute exacerbation of asthma. One hundred twenty patients from hospitals of three different levels were evaluated by reviewing their medical records. Our study revealed that physicians from medical centers and regional hospitals assessed patients more often with arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry; prescribed more doses of beta2-agonist nebulizers; administered more doses of beta2-agonist nebulizers before administering parenteral aminophylline; and prescribed ipratropium nebulizers more often as adjunctive therapy. On the other hand, physicians from district hospitals more frequently prescribed parenteral aminophylline as the first-line medication and more often prescribed only a single dose of beta2-agonist nebulizer. Most emergency physicians in Taiwan did not adhere to guidelines. Specifically, these included omission of peak expiratory flow as the means to assess the severity of asthma exacerbation and response to treatment; suboptimal use of inhaled bronchodilators, such as beta2-agonists and ipratropium; and inappropriate use of parenteral aminophylline as the first-line medication.

### Asthma update: part II. medical management [^b38775cf]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recently updated its guidelines for the management of asthma. An evidence-based approach was used to examine several key issues regarding appropriate medical therapy for patients with asthma. The updated guidelines have clarified these issues and should alter the way physicians prescribe asthma medications. Chronic inhaled corticosteroid use is safe in adults and children, and inhaled corticosteroids are recommended as first-line therapy in adults and children with persistent asthma, even if the disease is mild. Other medications, such as cromolyn, theophylline, and leukotriene modifiers, now are considered alternative treatments and should have a more limited role in the management of persistent asthma. The addition of a long-acting beta2 agonist to an inhaled corticosteroid is superior to all other combinations as well as to higher dosages of inhaled corticosteroids alone. Combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2 agonist is the preferred treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe asthma. Antibiotic therapy offers no additional benefit in patients with asthma exacerbations.

### International perspective on research priorities and outcome measures of importance in the care of children with acute exacerbations of asthma: a qualitative interview study [^cc86245f]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Dominant theme: drivers of treatment decisions (knowledge)

There were similarities among providers in the first-line treatments for children with non-severe asthma, with all clinicians mentioning supplemental oxygen and short-acting beta agonists. There was some variability regarding the indication for steroids in mild-moderate asthma. There was considerable variation in the management of severe asthma: when discussing the use of a particular intravenous agent, the drivers of using escalated therapy and how the outcomes of treatment were measured (Knowledge, Motivation and Goals). Reasons for variation were attributed to personal clinical experience and knowledge of the existing literature.

My experience with magnesium is [that] it seems to be [a] safe and effective therapy. Australia, Paediatric Emergency Physician

I'm probably using aminophylline more in the last one to two years for the severe critical asthma that's going to ICU. Australia, Emergency Physician

Changed threshold of using IV/Oral corticosteroids. In the past reserved them only for patients who did not respond initially to therapy. Nowadays prescribe them to any patient with an exacerbation needing a hospital visit. Based on some research I had read at some point. Tanzania, Emergency Physician

The complexity of treatment decisions was highlighted as outlined below.

I would say that the decision is probably influenced by the time of the shift, whether it's day or night, whether there's a space where… [in] the ward or they're going to be needing ED for a long time, what the feeling of the nurses is. Costa Rica, Respiratory physician

There were different opinions on when respiratory support therapies such as the use of high flow nasal cannulae and non-invasive ventilation were used. (Skills/belief about capabilities)

### Patient-and parent-initiated oral steroids for asthma exacerbations [^466462f7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways affecting an estimated 334 million people worldwide. During severe exacerbations, patients may need to attend a medical centre or hospital emergency department for treatment with systemic corticosteroids, which can be administered intravenously or orally. Some people with asthma are prescribed oral corticosteroids (OCS) for self-administration (i.e. patient-initiated) or to administer to their child with asthma (i.e. parent-initiated), in the event of an exacerbation. This approach to treatment is becoming increasingly common.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patient- or parent-initiated oral steroids for adults and children with asthma exacerbations.

Search Methods

We identified trials from Cochrane Airways' Specialised Register (CASR) and also conducted a search of the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch). We searched CASR from its inception to 18 May 2016 and trial registries from their inception to 24 August 2016; we imposed no restriction on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data; we excluded cross-over trials. We looked for studies where adults (aged 18 years or older) or children of school age (aged 5 years or older) with asthma were randomised to receive: (a) any patient-/parent-initiated OCS or (b) placebo, normal care, alternative active treatment, or an identical personalised asthma action plan without the patient- or parent-initiated OCS component.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results to identify any studies that met the prespecified inclusion criteria. The prespecified primary outcomes were hospital admissions for asthma, asthma symptoms at follow-up and serious adverse events.

Main Results

Despite comprehensive searches of electronic databases and clinical trial registries, we did not identify any studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Five potentially relevant studies were excluded for two reasons: the intervention did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review (three studies) and studies had a cross-over design (two studies). Two of the excluded studies asked the relevant clinical question. However, these studies were excluded due to their cross-over design, as per the protocol. We contacted the authors of the cross-over trials who were unable to provide data for the first treatment period (i.e. prior to cross-over).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence from randomised trials (non-cross-over design) to inform the use of patient- or parent-initiated oral corticosteroids in people with asthma.

### International variation in severe exacerbation rates in patients with severe asthma [^3d7cd055]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Exacerbation frequency strongly influences treatment choices in patients with severe asthma.

Research Question

What is the extent of the variability of exacerbation rate across countries and its implications in disease management?

Study Design and Methods

We retrieved data from the International Severe Asthma Registry, an international observational cohort of patients with a clinical diagnosis of severe asthma. We identified patients aged ≥ 18 years who did not initiate any biologics prior to baseline visit. A severe exacerbation was defined as the use of oral corticosteroids for ≥ 3 days or asthma-related hospitalization/ED visit. A series of negative binomial models were applied to estimate country-specific severe exacerbation rates during 365 days of follow-up, starting from a naive model with country as the only variable to an adjusted model with country as a random-effect term and patient and disease characteristics as independent variables.

Results

The final sample included 7,510 patients from 17 countries (56% from the United States), contributing to 1,939 severe exacerbations (0.27/person-year). There was large between-country variation in observed severe exacerbation rate (minimum, 0.04 [Argentina]; maximum, 0.88 [Saudi Arabia]; interquartile range, 0.13–0.54), which remained substantial after adjusting for patient characteristics and sampling variability (interquartile range, 0.16–0.39).

Interpretation

Individuals with similar patient characteristics but coming from different jurisdictions have varied severe exacerbation risks, even after controlling for patient and disease characteristics. This suggests unknown patient factors or system-level variations at play. Disease management guidelines should recognize such between-country variability. Risk prediction models that are calibrated for each jurisdiction will be needed to optimize treatment strategies.

### Treatment patterns and frequency of key outcomes in acute severe asthma in children: a paediatric research in emergency departments international collaborative (PREDICT) multicentre cohort study [^65752ecb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a frequent reason for a child to attend the emergency department (ED), and one of the most common reasons for paediatric hospitalisation after an ED visit. In the USA, the rate (per population) of paediatric ED visits for asthma increased by 13.3% between 2001 and 2010, while in the UK, it is estimated that a child is admitted to hospital every 20 min due to an asthma exacerbation.

Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations, and respond to first-line treatment with inhaled bronchodilator therapy and systemic corticosteroids. However, a proportion of children require more intensive therapies including intravenous medications, supplemental oxygen, respiratory support, endotracheal intubation and/or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Management of acute severe asthma is complicated by a number of challenges, including the infrequency of its occurrence, a large number of treatment options and wide variation in self-reported and actual practice. Acute asthma has been highlighted as a research priority by multiple paediatric emergency medicine research networks.

A 2015 study from the UK found that 110 (3.4%) of 3238 children with acute asthma presenting to 24 EDs received intravenous therapy: magnesium in 2.1%, salbutamol in 1.9% and aminophylline in 1.6%. More than thirty different intravenous dosing and infusion regimens were identified in these 110 patients. In contrast, a study from the USA found that 10.5% of 61 854 children with acute asthma presenting to seven EDs between 2012 and 2017 received intravenous magnesium. No clinical characteristics explained the variation in intravenous magnesium use in the USA study, and the large difference between use of intravenous magnesium in the UK and USA studies remains unexplained. While intravenous magnesium has been found in meta-analysis to reduce both hospital admission and hospital length of stay (LOS), the quality of evidence is low, mainly due to small sample size.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^6eb90625]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overview.

GRADE is an internationally accepted framework for determining the quality or certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on this evidence. A guideline methodologist not involved in the development of the systematic reviews for this update provided training on GRADE methodology to the Expert Panel and ongoing support and consultation throughout the project. The Expert Panel used the GRADE approach to review the evidence, create evidence profiles for critical and important outcomes, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements.

Prioritization and rating of asthma outcomes.

The Expert Panel discussed asthma outcomes of potential interest and rated the relative importance of each outcome for clinical decision making using the GRADE approach. During this process, the Expert Panel reviewed the definitions of the outcomes in each of the systematic review reports. The outcomes deemed critical to assess for making recommendations across all topic areas were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.

The Expert Panel assessed additional outcomes for specific key questions when these outcomes were relevant to the topic or when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. For example, in some instances, the systematic review reports identified limited or not adequate data on the effect of the interventions listed in the key questions on specific critical outcomes (eg, asthma control). In such cases, the Expert Panel considered available data on a related outcome (eg, asthma symptoms), even though validated outcome instruments were not used in studies or were not available. In this example, the Expert Panel confirmed asthma symptoms as an important outcome based on responses from the focus groups. The Expert Panel then used data on this important outcome to create the evidence profiles and EtD tables for the intervention, based on the available evidence.

After prioritizing the outcomes, the Expert Panel used established thresholds for determining significant improvement, also known as the minimally important difference (MID), for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures. These MID criteria are listed in Table IB. – For outcomes with no MID established in the literature, such as exacerbations, the Expert Panel reached consensuson clinically important differences that were based in part on a review of effect sizes in RCTs in the literature and on their judgments regarding the clinical relevance of a given change. In keeping with the recommendations from the Asthma Outcomes Workshop (2012), treatment with systemic (oral and parenteral) corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were included as core outcome measures for exacerbations. The Expert Panel also included studies that used composite measures of systemic corticosteroids, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations.

### Optimising long-term management in acute asthma presentations to the emergency department: an interview study on patient beliefs [^99038d3a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

Emergency department (ED) attendances with acute asthma are an opportunity for simple medication changes to improve long-term self-management, but patients' beliefs and behaviours need to be considered for interventions to be successful. We explored the health beliefs and behaviours of adult patients who have presented to the ED with asthma and considered their attitudes to ED-based interventions designed to improve long-term asthma control.

Methods

19 semi-structured face-to-face or online patient interviews were conducted in 2021/2022. Eligible participants were patients over age 16 who had attended and were discharged from the ED with an asthma exacerbation. Purposive sampling was undertaken to ensure representation of patients of different ages, ethnicity and gender. Interviews were analysed with reflective thematic analysis.

Results

Themes that reflected the beliefs and behaviours of the patients were: (1) experiences of an asthma exacerbation-the emotional response and self-management during an episode; (2) discharge dilemma-expectations and communication on discharge from ED, impacted by time, language and capacity in the acute environment; (3) do what is best for me-openness to change such as of medication, if rationale and support is provided; and (4) perceptions of asthma medication-reliance on salbutamol, concerns about inhaled corticosteroids, openness to maintenance and reliever therapy inhalers and device preferences.

Conclusion

Patients do not expect longer-term care to be provided in the ED. However, patients trust healthcare professionals to recommend appropriate treatment and are willing to accept a change in medication or inhaler device in this context.

### Dangers of under-treatment and over-treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma [^9061680c]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Could asthma guideline‐driven care (NHLBI, GINA) have prevented his death?

There were fundamental deviations from guideline‐recommended care that, if followed, might have prevented his death.

1. Failure to use the preferred controller therapy, ICS.

If ICS therapy had been prescribed for persistent asthma symptoms during the fall months, the exacerbation leading to his death could have been prevented.

2. Failure to use methods to detect airway obstruction and airway inflammation.

Guidelines recommend regularly monitoring of asthma severity and control using spirometry, ACT (asthma control test) score, and FeNO (fractional exhaled nitric oxide). If this recommendation had been followed, reduced FEV1, persistent symptoms producing a low ACT score, and a high FeNO level indicating airway inflammation likely would have been detected during the fall months and signaled the need to start ICS therapy, which would have reduced the risk of exacerbation and death.

3. Failure to use treatment algorithms to manage acute asthma exacerbation.

According to the most recent GINA guidelines, asthma exacerbations must be treated immediately, based on presentation severity, with mild or moderate severity levels requiring SABA every 20 min for 1 h, prednisolone, supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation of 93%–95%, and frequent reassessment at 1 h or earlier. If the exacerbation is severe or life‐threatening, the patient needs to be transferred to an acute care facility and, while waiting for transfer, is recommended to receive SABA, ipratropium bromide, oxygen, and systemic corticosteroid. This patient was given just one SABA treatment and was neither monitored nor sent to the emergency department for monitoring. If this recommendation had been followed, the patient's failure to adequately respond to the initial albuterol treatment would have been detected and the patient would have received more intensive monitoring and treatment, almost certainly preventing his death.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^3ed126d8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for < 2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient's clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^b7b4c28e]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain close monitoring during exacerbation treatment, and titrate treatment according to the response. Transfer patients immediately to an acute care facility when presenting with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation not responding to treatment or continuing to deteriorate. Obtain close monitoring in patients with little or slow response to short-acting β-agonists.

### Can we predict who will benefit most from biologics in severe asthma? A post-hoc analysis of two phase 3 trials [^72ec46bf]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources

We pooled individual-level data from two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of mepolizumab for severe asthma: the Dose Ranging Efficacy And safety with Mepolizumab (DREAM, 2009/11–2011/12), and the Mepolizumab as Adjunctive Therapy in Patients with Severe Asthma (MENSA, 2012/10–2014/01) studies.

During the 52-week DREAM study, 621 patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive one of the three doses of intravenous mepolizumab (75 mg, 250 mg, 750 mg) or matched placebo every 4 weeks. During the 38-week MENSA study, 576 patients were randomized (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to receive placebo, a 75 mg intravenous dose, or a 100 mg subcutaneous dose of mepolizumab, every 4 weeks. Both studies had similar inclusion criteria related to clinical diagnosis, eosinophilic asthma, and lung function, with details provided in Appendix S1. In addition, both studies required patients to have a confirmed history of 2 or more asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids (OCS) in the preceding 12 months.

Study design and sample

To ensure consistency and achieve a desirable sample size for minimizing potential model overfitting, this study included patients who received placebo or intravenous 75 mg doses of mepolizumab because this regimen was included in both trials. Patients were followed from the date of study enrolment until the end of study period or loss to follow-up. There were no missing data for the current analysis.

Endpoint

The primary endpoint was the absolute reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations with mepolizumab 75 mg compared to placebo in the first 365 days of follow-up. In line with the American Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force definition, a severe exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma which required OCS for at least 3 days, hospitalization, or emergency department (ED) visit requiring systemic corticosteroids. The secondary endpoint was reduction in the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ5) score with mepolizumab 75 mg compared to placebo over the first 365 days of follow-up. The ACQ5 score integrated five questions on asthma symptom control into a 0 (excellent control) to 6 (extremely poor control) scale.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^bafd4cb1]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol

A study protocol was developed a priori to define the objectives, search strategy, eligibility criteria, outcomes of interest, the process for abstracting and synthesising information from eligible studies, and the methods for data analysis. The systematic review conforms to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and was registered with International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42015023844). No ethics approval was required.

Literature search

Comprehensive searches of seven electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, SCOPUS, LILAC, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) were conducted from their inception to June 2015. The search strategy was designed by a health sciences librarian (LD) and comprised controlled vocabulary and keywords. The search used a slightly modified version of an 'emergency room' search filter(see online supplementary appendix A; complete search strategy is available on request).

References were manually selected from the first 10 pages of Google Scholar. In addition, proceedings from important Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) and US Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) conferences held between 2005 and 2015 that involved research presentations were hand-searched. No limits were applied on the basis of date, study design, language or publication status.

Study selection

The review included studies assessing the proportion of adult patients (or adults and children with ≥ 80% of the study population being ≥ 17 years of age) relapsing after receiving treatment in the ED for an asthma exacerbation. Relapse and variables significantly associated with relapse after multivariable modelling were the primary outcomes presented in this review. To be included as factors associated with relapse, studies must have conducted adjusted analyses. Relapse was defined as an urgent visit to any ED, clinic or physician office for worsening asthma symptoms within 4 weeks of the initial ED visit. Secondary outcomes included time between ED discharge and relapse, and medical management received in the ED.

Two reviewers (JH, NA) independently screened the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the literature search. Articles initially deemed relevant and those whose abstracts and titles provided insufficient information were retrieved and independently reviewed (JH, NA) to determine study eligibility. Disagreements were discussed and resolved with a third party (CVR).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^34f7b8a8]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids in children with severe exacerbations — A dose of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 20 mg/day for children under 2 years of age and 30 mg/day for children aged 2–5 years, is currently recommended (Evidence A). Several studies have failed to show any benefits when OCS are given earlier during periods of worsening wheeze managed in an outpatient setting, whereas a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of hospitalization when OCS were administered in the emergency department, but no clear benefit when given in the outpatient setting. A course of 3–5 days is sufficient in most children of this age and can be stopped without tapering, but the child must be reviewed after discharge to confirm recovery. In children discharged from the emergency department, an intramuscular corticosteroid may be an alternative to a course of OCS for preventing relapse, but the risk of long-term adverse effects must be considered and there is insufficient evidence to recommend intramuscular over oral corticosteroids.

### Aminophylline [^6bebb964]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Studies:

Inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids are the treatments of first choice for management of acute exacerbations of asthma. The results of controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of adding intravenous theophylline to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma have been conflicting. Most studies in patients treated for acute asthma exacerbations in an emergency department have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline does not produce greater bronchodilation and increases the risk of adverse effects. In contrast, other studies have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline is beneficial in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in patients requiring hospitalization, particularly in patients who are not responding adequately to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), clinical studies have shown that theophylline decreases dyspnea, air trapping, the work of breathing, and improves contractility of diaphragmatic muscles with little or no improvement in pulmonary function measurements.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5ff0ef99]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting, SABAs, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer inhaled short-acting β-agonists up to 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes for a total of 3 doses if needed to achieve rapid reversal of airflow limitation in patients with mild-to-moderate exacerbations.
Do not administer additional short-acting β-agonists if there is a good response to initial treatment, such as peak expiratory flow > 60–80% of predicted or personal best for 3–4 hours.

Reviewing response during treatment for an exacerbation: During treatment, patients should be closely monitored, and treatment titrated according to their response. Patients who present with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation, who fail to respond to treatment, or who continue to deteriorate should be transferred immediately to an acute care facility, and those with little or slow response to SABA treatment should be closely monitored. For many patients, lung function can be monitored after SABA therapy is repeated, and additional treatment should continue until PEF or FEV1 reaches a plateau or ideally returns to the patient's previous best, after which a decision can be made whether to send the patient home or transfer them to an acute care facility.

### Inhaled steroids for acute asthma following emergency department discharge [^b57476ba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute asthma treated in the emergency department (ED) are frequently treated with inhaled beta(2)-agonists and systemic corticosteroids after discharge. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) following discharge may also be beneficial in improving patient outcomes after acute asthma.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of ICS on outcomes in the treatment of acute asthma following discharge from the ED. To quantify the effectiveness of ICS therapy on acute asthma following ED discharge, when used in addition to, or as a substitute for, systemic corticosteroids.

Search Methods

Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group register, which consists of systematic searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases supplemented by handsearching of respiratory journals and conference proceedings. In addition, primary authors and pharmaceutical companies were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts also were searched. The searches have been conducted up to September 2012

Selection Criteria

We included both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Studies were included if patients were treated for acute asthma in the ED or its equivalent, and following ED discharge were treated with ICS therapy either in addition to, or as a substitute for, oral corticosteroids. Two review authors independently assessed articles for potential relevance, final inclusion and methodological quality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two review authors, or confirmed by the study authors. Several authors and pharmaceutical companies provided unpublished data. The data were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) or relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed effect model and heterogeneity is reported using I-squared (I(2)) statistics.

Main Results

Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion. Three of these trials, involving a total of 909 patients, compared ICS plus systemic corticosteroids versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone. There was no demonstrated benefit of ICS therapy when used in addition to oral corticosteroid therapy in the trials. Relapses were reduced; however, this was not statistically significant with the addition of ICS therapy (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.02; 3 studies; N = 909). In addition, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the two groups for relapses requiring admission, quality of life, symptom scores or adverse effects. Nine trials, involving a total of 1296 patients compared high-dose ICS therapy alone versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone after ED discharge. There were no significant differences demonstrated between ICS therapy alone versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone for relapse rates (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.52; 4 studies; N = 684), admissions to hospital, or in the secondary outcomes of beta(2)-agonist use, symptoms or adverse events. However, the sample size was not adequate to exclude the possibility of either treatment being significantly inferior and people with severe asthma were excluded from these trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy provides additional benefit when used in combination with standard systemic corticosteroid therapy upon ED discharge for acute asthma. There is some evidence that high-dose ICS therapy alone may be as effective as oral corticosteroid therapy when used in mild asthmatics upon ED discharge; however, the confidence intervals were too wide to be confident of equal effectiveness. Further research is needed to clarify whether ICS therapy should be employed in acute asthma treatment following ED discharge. The review does not suggest any reason to stop usual treatment with ICS following ED discharge, even if a course of oral corticosteroids are prescribed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^0953331a]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to include regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment, as-needed reliever medication (low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-short-acting β-agonist, or short-acting β-agonist), and a short course of oral corticosteroids in the discharge medications. Do not prescribe short-acting β-agonist-only treatment. Review inhaler technique and adherence before discharge. Advise patients to use their reliever inhaler only as needed rather than routinely. Schedule a follow-up appointment for 2–7 days later, depending on the clinical and social context.
