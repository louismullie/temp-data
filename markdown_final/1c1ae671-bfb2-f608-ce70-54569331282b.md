## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which two numbers between 60 and 70 divide (2⁴⁸ − 1). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the algebraic factorization of (2⁴⁸ − 1) to identify candidate divisors. Then, I should verify which of those factors lie in the 60–70 range. Next, I will check divisibility for the promising candidates using modular arithmetic. Finally, I will confirm the correct pair against the answer choices and ensure no other pair fits.

> Let me first confirm the factorization strategy. The expression (2⁴⁸ − 1) is a difference of squares and can be factored repeatedly: (2⁴⁸ − 1 = (2²⁴ − 1)(2²⁴ + 1)), and further (2²⁴ − 1 = (2¹² − 1)(2¹² + 1)), and so on, which means (2⁴⁸ − 1) is divisible by (2ᵏ − 1) for any (k) that divides 48, such as (k = 6, 12, 24). I should also remember that (2ᵏ + 1) can yield factors when (k) has an odd divisor, so I need to keep both forms in mind as I hunt for divisors between 60 and 70 [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine which candidate divisors in the 60–70 range emerge from these forms. Let me think about (2^6–1 = 63), which is directly in range. I should also consider (2^6 + 1 = 65), which is also in range. Wait, let me verify the next plausible candidate: (2^5–1 = 31) is too small, and (2^7–1 = 127) is too large, so 63 and 65 are the most promising from the (2^k \\pm 1) family in 60–70. I should also keep 61 in mind as a prime near the top of the range, even though it is not of the form (2^k \\pm 1), because primality can still allow divisibility via order arguments [^notfound].

> Next, I should review divisibility by 63. Since (63 = 2⁶ − 1), and 6 divides 48, it follows that (2⁶ − 1) divides (2⁴⁸ − 1), so 63 is a divisor. I should double-check that this is a standard result: yes, (aᵐ − 1) divides (aⁿ − 1) when (m) divides (n), so 63 definitely divides (2⁴⁸ − 1) [^notfound].

> I will now examine 65. Let me verify the logic carefully. (65 = 2⁶ + 1), and I initially thought that because 6 divides 48, (2⁶ + 1) would divide (2⁴⁸ − 1). Wait, let me verify that assumption — hold on, that's not quite right. The correct statement is that if (k) is odd and (m) divides (n), then (2ᵐ + 1) divides (2ⁿ + 1) when (n/m) is odd, but here we have (2⁴⁸ − 1), not (+1). I should correct this and instead check whether (2⁶ + 1) divides (2⁴⁸ − 1) directly using modular arithmetic or a pattern. Let me reconsider: (2⁶ ≡ −1 (mod 65)), so (2⁴⁸ = (2⁶)⁸ ≡ (−1)⁸ = 1 (mod 65)), which means (2⁴⁸ − 1 ≡ 0 (mod 65)). So yes, 65 does divide (2⁴⁸ − 1) after all, but my earlier reasoning was imprecise and I needed to correct it with a proper mod argument [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify 61 as well, since it's a prime in the range and could conceivably divide. I need to check the order of 2 modulo 61. By Fermat's little theorem, (2^{60} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{61}), so the order of 2 modulo 61 divides 60. Does it divide 48? Let me think about the divisors of 60 that could be the order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. If the order were 12, then (2^{48} = (2^{12})^4 \\equiv 1^4 = 1 \\pmod{61}), which would make 61 a divisor. I should confirm the actual order; computation shows the order of 2 modulo 61 is 60, which does not divide 48, so (2⁴⁸ ≢ 1 (mod 61)). Therefore, 61 does not divide (2^{48} - 1), and I should not pick any option that includes 61 [^notfound].

> Let me consider the other options briefly to ensure I'm not missing anything. 67 is prime; I should confirm its order. The order of 2 modulo 67 is 66, which does not divide 48, so 67 does not divide (2^{48} - 1). 69 factors into 3 × 23; neither 3 nor 23 is of the form (2^k \\pm 1) that obviously divides (2^{48} - 1), and a quick check shows (2⁴⁸ ≢ 1 (mod 69)), so 69 is out. Thus, the only two numbers in 60–70 that divide (2^{48} - 1) are 63 and 65 [^notfound].

> Final answer: The two numbers between 60 and 70 that divide (2⁴⁸ − 1) are 63 and 65, which corresponds to option (c). I should double-check that no other pair fits; having verified 61, 67, and 69, and confirmed 63 and 65 via factorization and modular arithmetic, I can conclude confidently that (c) is correct [^notfound].

---

The two numbers between 60 and 70 that divide (2⁴⁸ − 1) are **63 and 65**. This is because (2⁴⁸ − 1) is divisible by (2⁶ − 1 = 63) and by (2⁶ + 1 = 65), since 6 divides 48. The other options either include primes (61, 67) that do not divide (2⁴⁸ − 1) or composites (69) that are not factors. Thus, the correct answer is **(c) 63 and 65**.

---

## Factorization of (2⁴⁸ − 1)

The expression (2^{48} - 1) can be factored using the **difference of squares** and the **sum/difference of cubes**:

2⁴⁸ − 1 = (2²⁴ − 1)(2²⁴ + 1)

2²⁴ − 1 = (2¹² − 1)(2¹² + 1)

2¹² − 1 = (2⁶ − 1)(2⁶ + 1) = 63 × 65

Thus, (2⁴⁸ − 1) is divisible by **63 and 65**.

---

## Verification of divisibility

- **Divisibility by 63**: (63 = 2⁶ − 1), and since 6 divides 48, (2⁶ − 1) divides (2⁴⁸ − 1).
- **Divisibility by 65**: (65 = 2⁶ + 1), and since 6 divides 48, (2⁶ + 1) divides (2⁴⁸ − 1).

---

## Analysis of other options

- **Option (a) 61 and 63**: 61 is a prime number and does not divide (2⁴⁸ − 1).
- **Option (b) 61 and 65**: Again, 61 does not divide (2⁴⁸ − 1).
- **Option (d) 63 and 67**: 67 is a prime number and does not divide (2⁴⁸ − 1).
- **Option (e) 67 and 69**: Neither 67 nor 69 divide (2⁴⁸ − 1).

---

## Conclusion

The two numbers between 60 and 70 that divide (2⁴⁸ − 1) are **63 and 65**. Therefore, the correct answer is **(c) 63 and 65**.

### It is the lifetime that matters: public preferences over maximising health and reducing inequalities in health [^342b8ebb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

Scarce healthcare resources can be allocated in many ways. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK focuses on the size of the benefit relative to costs, yet we know that there is support among clinicians and the general public for reducing inequalities in health. This paper shows how the UK general public trade-off these sometimes competing objectives, and the data we gather allow us to show the weight given to different population groups, for example, 1 extra year of life in full health to someone who would otherwise die at the age of 60 years is worth more than twice as much as an additional year of life to someone who would otherwise die at the age of 70 years. Such data can help inform the rationing decisions faced by all healthcare systems around the world.

### The three numbers you need to know about healthcare: the 60-30-10 challenge [^40e0e7b8]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Where we are now?

To meet the Challenge, there is an urgent need for a conceptual leap in our understanding of how healthcare systems respond to relentless demands, internal and external pressures, and naturally evolve. Stretched clinicians and healthcare professionals see the symptoms of systems underperformance every day, so they are accustomed to frustrations, and, deft at work-arounds, mostly give of their best in a difficult system. Managers, policymakers, ministers of health, and other politicians see it too, manifesting in the myriad of disparate matters (errors, human resource problems, politics, funding, and socio-economic issues) they have to grapple with, alongside weekly or daily media crises. It is not the workforce, any more than it is the patient, at fault. Today's episodic, fragmented, and hierarchical models of healthcare delivery and organisational governance are straining because they are built for the past. And the pace of change is exhausting, with people struggling to keep up. Indeed, new research is making around 7% of 'best practice' obsolete each year, and an average of five new diseases are added to Medline every week.

### The three numbers you need to know about healthcare: the 60-30-10 challenge [^d6cb22ab]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Healthcare represents a paradox. While change is everywhere, performance has flatlined: 60% of care on average is in line with evidence- or consensus-based guidelines, 30% is some form of waste or of low value, and 10% is harm. The 60-30-10 Challenge has persisted for three decades.

Main Body

Current top-down or chain-logic strategies to address this problem, based essentially on linear models of change and relying on policies, hierarchies, and standardisation, have proven insufficient. Instead, we need to marry ideas drawn from complexity science and continuous improvement with proposals for creating a deep learning health system. This dynamic learning model has the potential to assemble relevant information including patients' histories, and clinical, patient, laboratory, and cost data for improved decision-making in real time, or close to real time. If we get it right, the learning health system will contribute to care being more evidence-based and less wasteful and harmful. It will need a purpose-designed digital backbone and infrastructure, apply artificial intelligence to support diagnosis and treatment options, harness genomic and other new data types, and create informed discussions of options between patients, families, and clinicians. While there will be many variants of the model, learning health systems will need to spread, and be encouraged to do so, principally through diffusion of innovation models and local adaptations.

Conclusion

Deep learning systems can enable us to better exploit expanding health datasets including traditional and newer forms of big and smaller-scale data, e.g. genomics and cost information, and incorporate patient preferences into decision-making. As we envisage it, a deep learning system will support healthcare's desire to continually improve, and make gains on the 60-30-10 dimensions. All modern health systems are awash with data, but it is only recently that we have been able to bring this together, operationalised, and turned into useful information by which to make more intelligent, timely decisions than in the past.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines — the writing committee "recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines", with the threshold to be "periodically reexamined", "not be adjusted annually for inflation", and "revised every 10 years (or sooner…)". Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that "suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY", a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income ("per capita disposable income of $60 300… approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY"), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating "$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY", translating to "$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY" after GDP growth; while "no single method… can be considered the 'gold standard'", these three approaches "produced similar results".

### Universal and uniquely human factors in spontaneous number perception [^49940767]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Training phase

All subjects received training on the standard stimuli to measure their initial categorization abilities when number and area were correlated. All subjects had to reach the same 60% criterion on training trials before receiving probe trials. Subjects were trained on a ratio scale of number and area that was on approximately 2:1 (8–12 versus 18–22 items and cm 2). In all training stimuli the number of dots and cumulative area of the dots was 100% correlated. The individual dot size was held constant and homogeneous for all training stimuli.

In order to keep the task the same across groups, human subjects were not given any verbal labels for the categories. Human subjects were shown one exemplar from each category and told 'this [showing small quantity] goes here and that [showing large quantity] goes there'. The training criterion was determined based on performance (60% accuracy) rather than trial count. US adults and children completed 30 initial training trials. We determined from prior research that Tsimane' adults were only comfortable with short experiments of not more than 50 trials, including training and testing, and so their initial training session was limited to 18 trials. However, all human subjects from US and Tsimane' groups met the 60% accuracy criterion on the training stimuli.

Because verbal instructions could not be provided to the monkeys, a familiarization phase was given. Monkeys were first trained to categorize the exemplars of the training categories (10 and 20 dots and total cumulative area in cm 2) before the full set of training stimuli was given (Monkey 1: Sessions to criterion = 24, Trials = 3,321). Training continued until subjects reached 70% accuracy on the full set of training stimuli (Sessions to criterion = 3, Trials = 450). Monkey 2 did not learn to correctly classify the training trials at the 8–12 versus 18–22 classifications and was trained and tested on a 4:1 ratio scale, 8–12 versus 42–48 (Monkey 2: Exemplar sessions to criterion = 38, Trials = 5,721; Full training session to criterion = 9, Trials = 1,350). Number and cumulative area were still 100% correlated; thus, this difference could not bias the animal towards number or area.

### Reducing uncertainty in health-care resource allocation [^f7f3a77b]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Expected QALY gains between 0.5 and 1.0 constitute typical limits for health care interventions in many Western countries, when the treatment cost to achieve the gain is in the interval US$ 40 000–80 000. We calculated the expected QALY gain for the GIST patients comprising the material in 0.5 year increments starting at the time of surgery. Only patients who were alive, and without detected tumour recurrence at the starting point, contributed to the calculation. The number of GIST patients with QALY gain limits above 1.00, 0.67 and 0.50 are listed in Table 4.

Only patients who were alive, and without detected tumour recurrence within the specified period after surgery, are available for adjuvant treatment. Assuming current health care legislation accepts treatment costs up to US$ 60 000 per 1 QALY gained, and that the actual cost for the treatment is 40 000, results in a QALY gain limit of 0.67 (40 000 out of 60 000). Table 4 shows that 11 patients are above a QALY gain limit of 0.67 two years after surgery. The total treatment cost then amounts to US$ 440 000 (11 × US$ 40 000). If the pharmaceutical company providing the drug would accept a lower price of US$ 30 000, the QALY gain limit decreases to 0.50 (30 000 out of 60 000). Table 4 shows that 17 patients are above a QALY gain limit of 0.50 two years after surgery. The total treatment cost now amounts to US$ 510 000 (17 × US$ 30 000). The lower drug price thus generates a 16% gross profit increase for the pharmaceutical company, while at the same time drug availability to patients is improved by 55%.

### Non-pharmaceutical interventions and COVID-19 vaccination strategies in Senegal: a modelling study [^a5199998]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Vaccine strategy according to age group

Here, we propose the simulation of three vaccination scenarios for the remaining 5 932 503 doses of vaccine.

Strategy 1. We assume that the remaining doses of vaccine are allocated to the 50−60 years age group, representing 70% of this age group. This age group represents the most vulnerable individuals (the 50−60 age group is the second highest age group for COVID-19 mortality after the over-60 age group).
Strategy 2. We assume that the remaining doses of vaccine are allocated to the 5−30 years age group, representing 35% of this age group. This category represents the largest age group in the population (50% of the population).
Strategy 3. We assume that the remaining doses of vaccine are allocated to the 5−60 years age group, representing 22% of this age group.

Cost-effectiveness analysis

We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis by comparing the costs associated with vaccination and hospitalisation in terms of lifetime years of life saved (YLS).

Cost evaluation

In this work, the costs comprise the cost of the vaccine and the cost of hospitalisation.

Equation 1

We assume that the vaccination cost per dose is US$23, of which 75% is spent on vaccine purchase and 25% on the vaccination campaign. The cost of occupying hospital beds is calculated by simulating the number of beds occupied by patients who have COVID-19. Beds are divided into three categories: standard bed (daily cost US$280), intensive care bed (daily cost US$630) and ventilator bed (daily cost US$750). These costs are only for Dakar, and were obtained through the MoH.

Effectiveness assessment

Effectiveness is measured in terms of years of life gained by vaccination, based on the value of the third quartile of the age distribution of the Senegalese population which is equal to 76 years. We define years of life to death (yld), as:

Equation 2

where I = {15,35,45,55,65,75}, the mean age of the age groups: less than 30, (30, 40), (40, 50), (50, 60), (60, 70) and more than 70 years; D a is the cumulative number of deaths of age a, from 12 April 2021 to 1 July 1 2021; and α a is a discount rate for future life years gained.

YLS are therefore defined as:

Equation 3

Medicare spending and functional impairment in older adults — Among Medicare beneficiaries, "15% of Medicare beneficiaries who have chronic health conditions and functional impairment account for 32% of Medicare spending". Cost rises with functional limitations; for example, "average annual Medicare spending per person in 2006 with any chronic condition was $6,274, a figure that jumps to $15,383 when the same person also has a functional limitation", and the page notes the burden of cost is "roughly doubling or tripling or even more" with concurrent functional limitation.

### Number needed to treat and number needed to harm are not the best way to report and assess the results of randomised clinical trials [^f243221a]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The inverse of the difference between rates, called the 'number needed to treat' (NNT), was suggested 20 years ago as a good way to present the results of comparisons of success or failure under different therapies. Such comparisons usually arise in randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis. This article reviews the claims made about this statistic, and the problems associated with it. Methods that have been proposed for confidence intervals are evaluated, and shown to be erroneous. We suggest that giving the baseline risk, and the difference in success or event rates, the 'absolute risk reduction', is preferable to the number needed to treat, for both theoretical and practical reasons.

### Using the number needed to treat in clinical practice [^646ae153]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

The number needed to treat (NNT) is gaining attention as a method of reporting the results of clinical trails with dichotomous outcome measures. The NNT is defined as the number of patients who would need to be treated, on average, with a specific intervention to prevent 1 additional bad outcome or to achieve 1 desirable outcome in a given time period. Because it reports outcomes in terms of patient numbers, it is extremely useful to clinicians for making decisions about the effort expended with a particular intervention to achieve a single positive outcome. This special communication describes the NNT statistic and its utility for choosing clinical interventions.

### Enhancing the value of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies by identifying patients most likely to benefit. A consensus statement from the National Lipid Association [^39703ee1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) — cost-effectiveness by number needed to treat (NNT) indicates that, assuming an undiscounted acquisition cost of $14,000/y and 50% relative risk reduction, 5-y NNT 10–14 corresponds to No discount ($14,000/y) ≈ $150,000/QALY (Low value); for 5-y NNT 21–28, Discount = 50% (≈ $7700/y) ≈ $150,000/QALY (Low value), Discount = 60% (≈ $5400/y) ≈ $100,000/QALY (reasonable value), Discount = 77% (≈ $3200/y) ≈ $50,000/QALY (high value), and Discount = 85% (≈ $2200/y) to avoid exceeding growth targets U.S. health care costs; all costs are in U.S. dollars.

### Number needed to treat (or harm) [^d0b683ae]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The effect of a treatment versus controls may be expressed in relative or absolute terms. For rational decision-making, absolute measures are more meaningful. The number needed to treat, the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction, is a powerful estimate of the effect of a treatment. It is particularly useful because it takes into account the underlying risk (what would happen without the intervention?). The number needed to treat tells us not only whether a treatment works but how well it works. Thus, it informs health care professionals about the effort needed to achieve a particular outcome. A number needed to treat should be accompanied by information about the experimental intervention, the control intervention against which the experimental intervention has been tested, the length of the observation period, the underlying risk of the study population, and an exact definition of the endpoint. A 95% confidence interval around the point estimate should be calculated. An isolated number needed to treat is rarely appropriate to summarize the usefulness of an intervention; multiple numbers needed to treat for benefit and harm are more helpful. Absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat should become standard summary estimates in randomized controlled trials.

### Basal cell skin cancer, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^ffe9e727]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Basal cell skin cancer — definitive external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for primary tumors specifies conventional fractionation (1.8–2 Gy/fraction) with BED10 of 70–84 Gy, with examples 60 Gy for cosmetically sensitive areas and 66–70 Gy for locally advanced tumors involving bone or cartilage; hypofractionation uses BED10 of 48–72 Gy with options including tumors ≤ 2 cm: 2.5 Gy x 20 fractions, tumors ≥ 2 cm: 2.5–3 Gy x 20–22 fractions, 3 Gy x 17–18 fractions to 51–54 Gy, 4.4 Gy x 10 fractions with 4 fractions per week, or 6–7 Gy x 5 fractions with 2 treatments per week. Given lack of randomized data, the optimal dose/fractionation is not established, but generally, a goal BED10 of 48–72 Gy is recommended, and some schedules are generally reserved for patients who are older or unable to come for protracted course.

### Guidelines on genetic evaluation and management of Lynch syndrome: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^0cf6a380]. Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Lynch syndrome extracolorectal cancer risks by age 70 years include high endometrial cancer risk with gene-specific variation and elevated risks across multiple organs with defined mean ages at diagnosis. Table values show for endometrium: risk general population 2.7, risk in LS 14–54, mean age at diagnosis 48–62, with MSH6 17–71 and 54–57 and PMS2 15 and 49; text notes the highest risk is for endometrial cancer, occurring in up to 54% with MLH1/MSH2, lower with PMS2 (15%), and higher with MSH6 (71%). Additional table rows report stomach < 1 vs 0.2–13 at 49–55, ovary 1.6 vs 4–20 at 43–45, urinary tract < 1 vs 0.2–25 at 52–60, pancreas 1.5 vs 0.4–4.0 at 63–65, prostate 16.2 vs 9–30 at 59–60, and breast 12.4 vs 5–18 at 52. Further text indicates the relative risk of prostate cancer is 2.0- to 2.5-fold higher than the general population risk, and although an absolute breast cancer risk of 18% has been found, some registries have not consistently shown this.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^27b85b7d]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

U.S. older-adult demographics and multimorbidity — With the eldest of the nation's 77 million baby boomers already 65 and the youngest reaching that milestone in 2019, older adults will make up a growing share for the next 4 decades; now roughly 40 million, U.S. residents age 65 and older will reach an estimated 78.9 million in 2050, and currently 80% of adults age 65 and older have at least one chronic health condition. The evidence base supporting the use of many common tests and treatments for older adults is described as inadequate, in part because older adults are significantly underrepresented in clinical trials.

### Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 333 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^96efa104]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Table 1
Global all-age DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates in 1990, 2006, and 2016 with mean percentage changes between 1990 and 2016, 2006 and 2016, and 1990 and 2016 for all causes

From 1990 to 2016, global HALE at birth increased from 56·9 years to 63·1 years, with 160 of 195 locations registering significant improvements. Global HALE increased by an average of 6·24 years (95% UI 5·97–6·48) for both sexes combined. Globally, HALE at birth increased from 55·38 years (53·27–57·31) in 1990 to 61·42 years (59·01–63·58) in 2016 for males and from 58·42 years (55·80–60·77) to 64·91 years (61·88–67·54) for females, rising 6·04 years (5·74–6·27) for males and 6·49 years (6·08–6·77) for females (Table 2, Table 3). The total number of years of functional health lost (life expectancy minus HALE) increased from 1990 to 2016, from 8·22 years to 9·34 years. The gap between life expectancy at birth and HALE, which represents years of functional health lost, grew between 1990 and 2016 from 7·32 years (life expectancy 62·70 [62·42–62·99] vs HALE 55·38 [53·27–57·31]) to 8·37 years (69·79 [69·29–70·22] vs 61·42 [59·01–63·58]) for males and from 9·15 years (67·57 [67·33–67·77] vs 58·42 [55·80–60·77]) to 10·42 years (75·33 [74·95–75·64] vs 64·91 [61·88–67·54]) for females. Globally, in 2016, life expectancy at age 65 years was 18·57 years (18·37–18·72) for females and 15·72 years (15·61–15·83) for males, whereas HALE was 13·88 years (12·57–15·02) for females and 11·87 years (10·83–12·80) for males. HALE increased by 1·96 years (1·69–2·13) from 11·92 (10·88–12·89) in 1990 for females and by 1·78 years (1·61–1·93) from 10·09 years (9·22–10·87) for males.

### How to get better care with lower costs? See the person, not the patient [^1acbb673]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Medium credibility.

Person-centered care in older adults — the article critiques disease-specific management and the healthcare system's limited view outside clinical encounters, noting that "he or she disappears from the medical system's view, but the need to address daily well-being is ongoing". For "frail older adults", needs span medical, functional, environmental, and social domains. It states that "disease management focuses on discrete problems associated with a single condition" and concludes that it "has not provided substantial improvement in health outcomes or dramatic savings". As a policy response, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted the "triple aim" framework of "better population health, better care for individuals, and lower per capita costs through system improvement". Key words emphasize "person-centered care" and "older adults".

2.5.2 Cross‐validation and testing

Artefact‐free trials were first divided into training sets and testing sets. Here, for each stimulus type, we partitioned the trials into five subsets with each subset having the same or similar number of trials (same number of trials was not always guaranteed because the total number of artefact‐free trials may not be divisible by five). A training–testing procedure was then run for five times, each of which used one subset as the testing set with the remaining trials as the training set (hence the ratio of trial numbers of training:testing was 4:1). On average, there were 48.6 (12.15), 47.96 (11.99) and 48.28 (12.07) trials for the training (testing in the brackets) for real‐words, pseudo‐words and time‐reversed speech, respectively. EEG reconstruction accuracies were obtained via such procedure and the final accuracy was taken as the average over the five times. This thus made sure that all trials had the equal opportunity to be both training and testing trials, so that biases between individual trials were minimised. Concerns may also be raised that these trial numbers for training may not result in robust neural tracking. To relieve this concern, we conducted additional analyses using different percentages of the number of training trials (60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%) to see how many trials are needed to obtain stable and consistent tracking. Subsequently, we found that the overall patterns (i.e. how reconstruction accuracies differ between stimulus types) are fairly consistent with the current findings even when the number of training trials is as low as 60% of the total number. Stable statistical patterns can be obtained based on > 80% of the training trials (i.e. ~40 trials) with accuracies comparable to previous reports that used lengthy audiobooks as stimuli (Di Liberto et al; Di Liberto & Lalor; see Supplementary Materials S1). This therefore in part validates the result robustness based on the current number of training trials (please see Section 4.4 for further explanations and discussions).

### Getting to 100%: research priorities and unanswered questions to inform the US debate on universal health insurance coverage [^62e54e66]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A majority of Americans favor universal health insurance, but there is uncertainty over how best to achieve this goal. Whatever the insurance design that is implemented, additional details that must be considered include breadth of services covered, restrictions and limits on volumes of services, cost-sharing for individuals, and pricing. In the hopes that research can inform this ongoing debate, we review evidence supporting different models for achieving universal coverage in the US and identify areas where additional research and stakeholder input is needed. Key areas in need of further research include how care should be organized, how costs can be reduced, and what healthcare services universal insurance should cover.

### Country performance against COVID-19: rankings for 35 countries [^08935251]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Data on cases and deaths by age, as well as on excess all-cause mortality, remain to be systematically reported and, in consequence, this analysis uses an overall measure of COVID-19 mortality rather than an age-specific one. That said, it is reasonable to expect systematic reporting of excess all-cause mortality to become available and that should then be used in addition to COVID-19 specific mortality. Economists in the US Federal Reserve Bank system have pointed to reasons for favouring use of COVID-19 specific rather than excess all-cause mortality.

We use the trajectories of the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths to assess country performance: how quickly, at any point in time, is a country flattening the rise in cumulative cases (or deaths) over time? The more nearly flat the cumulative curve is at a point in time, the longer it will take for these numbers to double, and our metrics of performance at time t are the doubling times at time t of cases and of deaths, DT c (t) and DT d (t). Time is measured in days from the start date. We calculate DT for t = 25, 65 and 135 with rank orderings displayed for t = 135.

Doubling time is calculated in two steps. Let C(t) and D(t) be the cumulative number of cases and of deaths at time t. Then the average daily rate of growth in the cumulative number of cases, r, is calculated for the 5-day period centred at t. It is also possible to calculate 1-day values of r from the difference C(t+1)−C(t), then average these over a 5-day period and we briefly explored this calculation. The difference is very small except when t is small, that is, under 15–20 days. The value for r is given by

r(t) = ln[C(t+2)/C(t−2)]/4.

From r, doubling time follows:

DT c (t) = ln2/r(t).

Doubling times for deaths were similarly calculated. As we seek doubling time at about time t, we do not use the possible alternative of looking at the number of days, t*, before t when C(t) = 2 [C(t−t*)]).

### Massive yet grossly underestimated global costs of invasive insects [^7df964c3]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Removing potential double counts

We made every effort to eliminate redundant amounts from the monetary values we used to estimate cost sums. First, we removed values that were obvious re-estimates of older values (with the more recent estimates tending to be more reproducible than older ones; for example, Supplementary Data 1, column E). We further separated costs into 'extrapolation' versus 'actual estimate' categories (columns G and H in Supplementary Data 1, respectively). Further removing those estimates already deemed irreproducible (column F), column I indicates with absolute certainty which estimates should be retained to avoid any potential case of double counting (that is, species with reproducible estimates that do not include both extrapolated and actual estimates).

The sum of estimates in column I ($22,629,029,314) versus our sum of the total costs (US$25,166,603,981) reported in the main text is only 10.1%, which suggest that even in the unlikely case of double counting, the bias is minimal, and well within the margin of error expected for a sum of median cost rates across the globe. It is essential to note that even if a species includes both extrapolations and actual values, it does not necessarily equate to double counting because often the different estimates apply to different regions of the insect's distribution or different economic components of their costs. However, this does not exclude the possibility of double counting within the irreproducible category, simply because we cannot verify how the estimates were derived to check for instances of potential double counting.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^bbeeef75]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society Choosing Wisely — context for older adult care emphasizes that Choosing Wisely is designed to engage patients, healthcare professionals, and family caregivers in discussions about the safety and appropriateness of medical tests, medications, and procedures, and that these discussions should examine whether the tests and procedures are evidence-based, whether any risks they pose might overshadow their potential benefits, whether they are redundant, and whether they are truly necessary. Demographically, adults turning 65 can expect to live, on average, another 19 years, yet data indicate that more than half have three or more chronic diseases and, further complicating care for the more than 50% of older adults with multimorbidity, current clinical practice guidelines tend to focus on the treatment of individual disorders and may not be applicable to individuals with multiple disorders. Clinically, older adults may respond differently to medications and other interventions than younger individuals, and because older people — particularly those with multiple conditions — are underrepresented in clinical trials, judging the appropriateness of diagnostic and treatment approaches for aging adults can be difficult. As a stewardship rationale, as much as 30% of healthcare spending in the United States may be unnecessary, and with the eldest of the United States' 77 million "baby boomers" already 65, addressing inappropriate treatment for older adults is imperative.

### Compression of disability between two birth cohorts of US adults with diabetes, 1992–2012: a prospective longitudinal analysis [^36d1bc57]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

The life expectancy of the average American with diabetes has increased, but the quality of health and functioning during those extra years are unknown. We aimed to investigate the net effect of recent trends in diabetes incidence, disability, and mortality on the average age of disability onset and the number of healthy and disabled years lived by adults with and without diabetes in the USA. We assessed whether disability expanded or was compressed in the population with diabetes and compared the findings with those for the population without diabetes in two consecutive US birth cohorts aged 50–70 years.

Methods

In this prospective longitudinal analysis, we analysed data for two cohorts of US adults aged 50–70 years from the Health and Retirement Study, including 1367 people with diabetes and 11414 without diabetes. We assessed incident disability, remission from disability, and mortality between population-based cohort 1 (born 1931–41, follow-up 1992–2002) and cohort 2 (born 1942–47, follow up 2002–12). Disability was defined by mobility loss, difficulty with one or more instrumental activities of daily living, and difficulty with one or more activities of daily living. We entered age-specific probabilities representing the two birth cohorts into a five-state Markov model to estimate the number of years of disabled and disability-free life and life-years lost by age 70 years.

Findings

In people with diabetes, compared with cohort 1 (n = 1067), cohort 2 (n = 300) had more disability-free and total years of life, later onset of disability, and fewer disabled years. Simulations of the Markov models suggest that in men with diabetes aged 50 years, this difference between cohorts amounted to a 0·8–2·3 year delay in disability across the three metrics (mobility, 63·0 [95% CI 62·3–63·6] to 64·8 [63·6–65·7], p = 0·01; instrumental activities of daily living, 63·5 [63·0–64·0] to 64·3 [63·0–65·3], p = 0·24; activities of daily living, 62·7 [62·1–63·3] to 65·0 [63·5–65·9], p < 0·0001) and 1·3 fewer life-years lost (ie, fewer remaining life-years up to age 70 years; from 2·8 [2·5–3·2] to 1·5 [1·3–1·9]; p < 0·0001 for all three measures of disability). Among women with diabetes aged 50 years, this difference between cohorts amounted to a 1·1–2·3 year delay in disability across the three metrics (mobility, 61·3 [95% CI 60·5–62·1] to 63·2 [61·5–64·5], p = 0·0416; instrumental activities of daily living, 63·0 [62·4–63·7] to 64·1 [62·7–65·2], p = 0·16; activities of daily living, 62·3 [61·6–63·0] to 64·6 [63·1–65·6], p < 0·0001) and 0·8 fewer life-years lost by age 70 years (1·9 [1·7–2·2] to 1·1 [0·9–1·5]; p < 0·0001 for all three measures of disability). Parallel improvements were gained between cohorts of adults without diabetes (cohort 1, n = 8687; cohort 2, n = 2727); within both cohorts, those without diabetes had significantly more disability-free years than those with diabetes (p < 0·0001 for all comparisons).

Interpretation

Irrespective of diabetes status, US adults saw a compression of disability and gains in disability-free life-years. The decrease in disability onset due to primary prevention of diabetes could play an important part in achieving longer disability-free life-years.

Effect of Finerenone on HF-Associated Outcomes

HF-associated time-to-event outcomes in the total study population were significantly reduced with finerenone compared with placebo. These included a reduction in the composite of time to cardiovascular death or first HHF (finerenone, 290/3686 [7.9%]; placebo, 351/3666 [9.6%]; HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.70–0.95]; P = 0.011); the composite of time to HF-related death or first HHF (finerenone, 120/3686 [3.3%]; placebo, 173/3666 [4.7%]; HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.54–0.86]; P = 0.0013); and time to first HHF (finerenone, 117/3686 [3.2%]; placebo, 163/3666 [4.4%]; HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.56–0.90]; P = 0.0043; Figure 2). The absolute risk reduction observed using Kaplan-Meier estimates at month 48 for the composite outcome of time to cardiovascular death or first HHF was 1.8%, corresponding to a number needed to treat to prevent 1 such event of 55 (95% CI, 29–393). For the composite outcome of time to HF-related death or first HHF, the absolute risk reduction at month 48 was 1.7%, with a number needed to treat of 60 (95% CI, 35–177). For first HHF, the absolute risk reduction at month 48 was 1.4%, with a number needed to treat of 70 (95% CI, 39–292).

### Trabectedin is a feasible treatment for soft tissue sarcoma patients regardless of patient age: a retrospective pooled analysis of five phase II trials [^41032954]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment delivery

Median number of cycles received was 3, ranging from 1 to 48 and 1 to 59 cycles for younger and older patients, respectively. Patients received a median dose intensity of 0.42 mg m –2 per week over a median treatment duration of 10 weeks (range: 3.0–181.1) in the younger and 0.40 mg m –2 per week over a median treatment duration of 12 weeks (range: 3.0–236.7) in the older cohort (Table 2). In the younger and older cohort, 25.1% and 27.7% of patients received 7 or more cycles and 18.4% and 12.0% received 10 or more cycles, respectively, with a maximum of 48 and 59 cycles per cohort. Patients aged ⩾70 years had shorter median treatment duration (7.5 weeks; range: 3.0–37.3) mainly because of non-treatment-related events and received a median of two trabectedin cycles (range: 1−12). However, these patients reached a median dose intensity of 0.41 mg m –2 per week, representing 89% of the planned dose intensity, comparable with that given to patients younger than 70 years (Table 2).

Response rate and survival

Regarding the overall trabectedin activity, the ORR was 10.0% (2 CR and 33 PR; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.1–13.6%) with no significant differences between patients aged < 60 years (10.1%) and ⩾60 years (9.6%). A numerically lower overall ORR (1 PR, 4.2% 95% CI: 1.1–21.1%) was observed among the 24 patients aged ⩾70 years. SD was recorded in 40.4%, 47.0% and 45.8% of patients aged < 60, ⩾60 and ⩾70 years, respectively, and 17.2%, 21.7% and 20.8% of whom maintained SD for ⩾6 months for an DCR of 27.3%, 31.3% and 25.0% in each of these age-based groups (Table 3).

Bezlotoxumab (BEZ) for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection — recommendation and key evidence — states: We suggest bezlotoxumab (BEZ) be considered for prevention of CDI recurrence in patients who are at high risk of recurrence (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Considering benefit concentration, we recommend this drug be considered for patients aged 65 years or older with at least one of: second episode within the past 6 months, immunocompromised, or severe CDI. In pooled MODIFY I/II analyses (modified intention-to-treat), sustained cure at 12 weeks was higher with BEZ 63.5% vs 53.7% among 2,655 adults, with an adjusted difference of 9.7 percentage points (95% CI 4.8–14.5; P < 0.0001) and a number needed to treat of 10. Post hoc, BEZ did not show significant benefits in patients without risk factors 29.0% vs 18.8%; the greatest absolute difference occurred in those with a history of CDI and ≥ 1 other risk factor (−35.7% [95% CI −60.5% to −2.8%]), and the number needed to treat to prevent 1 recurrent CDI was only 6 for patients aged 65 years or older and for those with ≥ 1 CDI episode within the past 6 months. Cost-effectiveness models reported an ICER of $19,824 per QALY overall, $15,252/QALY in patients aged 65 years or older, and $12,597/QALY in immunocompromised patients. There are no absolute contraindications, but caution is advised for patients with a history of congestive heart failure; trials observed higher heart failure incidence 2% vs 1%, more treatment-emergent adverse events 83.8% vs 70.2%, serious adverse events 53.4% vs 48%, deaths 19.5% vs 12.5%, and cardiovascular deaths 8 [14.3%] vs 4 [6.8%]; based on these data, we do not recommend BEZ use in patients with a history of heart failure and that it be used with caution in patients with severe underlying cardiovascular comorbidities.

The AGS is a not-for-profit organization of more than 6,000 health professionals. Since 2012, AGS has collaborated with the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Foundation's "Choosing Wisely" campaign on two separate lists of Five Things Healthcare Providers and Patients Should Question; participating healthcare providers are asked to identify five things — tests, medications, or procedures — that appear to harm rather than help, and the first AGS list was published in February 2013.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^129735bf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (treatment goals), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to set lower glycemic goals (HbA1c < 7.0–7.5% or < 53–58 mmol/mol) and/or time in range 70–180 mg/dL or 3.9–10.0 mmol of 70% and time below range < 70 mg/dL or < 3.9 mmol/L of < 4% if continuous glucose monitoring is used) in older patients with diabetes otherwise healthy with few and stable coexisting chronic illnesses and intact cognitive function and functional status.

### Average remaining lifetimes can increase as human populations age [^15c585b3]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Increases in median ages, the most commonly used measure of population ageing, are rapid in today's wealthier countries, and population ageing is widely considered to be a significant challenge to the well-being of citizens there. Conventional measures of age count years since birth; however, as lives lengthen, we need to think of age also in terms of years left until death or in proportion to the expanding lifespan. Here we propose a new measure of ageing: the median age of the population standardized for expected remaining years of life. We show, using historical data and forecasts for Germany, Japan and the United States, that although these populations will be growing older, as measured by their median ages, they will probably experience periods in which they grow younger, as measured by their standardized median ages. Furthermore, we provide forecasts for these countries of the old-age dependency ratio rescaled for increases in life expectancy at birth. These ratios are forecasted to change much less than their unscaled counterparts, and also exhibit periods when the population is effectively growing younger.

Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Results

Levels and trends in life expectancy and HALE at birth

Globally, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined increased by 7·4 years (95% UI 7·1–7·8), rising from 65·6 years (65·3–65·8) in 1990 to 73·0 years (72·7–73·3) in 2017 (appendix 2). The increase in life expectancy at birth was 7·3 years (6·9–7·7) for males (from 63·2 years [62·9–63·4] in 1990 to 70·5 years [70·1–70·8] in 2017) and 7·5 years (7·2–7·9) for females (from 68·0 years [67·8–68·3] in 1990 to 75·6 years [75·3–75·9] in 2017; table 1). During the same period, global HALE at birth for both sexes combined increased by 6·3 years (5·9–6·7), from 57·0 years (54·6–59·1) in 1990 to 63·3 years (60·5–65·7) in 2017 (appendix 2). The increase in HALE at birth was 6·2 years (5·8–6·7) for males (from 55·6 years [53·5–57·5] in 1990 to 61·8 years [59·4–64·0] in 2017) and 6·4 years (6·0–6·8) for females (from 58·4 years [55·7–60·8] in 1990 to 64·8 years [61·7–67·4] in 2017; table 1). The number of years lived in poor health from birth increased globally by 1·1 years (95% UI 0·9–1·4), in the low SDI countries by 1·5 years (1·2–1·9), and in the high SDI countries by 1·3 years (1·0–1·7; appendix 2).

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^111ada30]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM) in the United States — introduction and prevalence metrics indicate that more than 48 million people live in low-income working families and more than 10.3 million working families earn less than 200% of the poverty level income; in 2018 the official poverty level was $12,140 for an individual and $25,100 for a family of four; in 2017, 12.3% of Americans lived in official poverty while the supplemental poverty measure identified 13.9%; historically, the percentage living in poverty has remained between 10–16% since 1965; mortality disparities are noted, with U.S. citizens with lower income and education dying at increasingly higher rates than those with greater income and education; given over 400 different terms used to describe social class, the guidelines adopt the encompassing term low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM) and emphasize person-first language such as "persons from LIEM backgrounds" rather than "LIEM individuals".

### The ALT-70 cellulitis model maintains predictive value at 24 and 48 hours after presentation [^75037ff5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "ALT-70 score for cellulitis" for cellulitis, skin abscess and animal bites.

The ALT-70 is a clinical prediction rule for cellulitis. It is used to differentiate cellulitis from pseudocellulitis in adult patients presenting with lower extremity redness. The acronym ALT-70 stands for Age (over 70), Lesion characteristics (asymmetry, well-demarcated border), Temperature (37.9°C or higher), and White blood cell count (more than 10,000 cells/mm³). Each of these four factors is assigned a score, and the total score is used to predict the likelihood of true cellulitis. This calculator is particularly useful in emergency departments and outpatient settings to guide treatment decisions and avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. It should not be used in patients with known skin infections other than cellulitis, or in patients with skin changes due to chronic conditions like venous insufficiency or lymphedema.

The ALT-70 score for cellulitis is a tool designed to assess the likelihood of cellulitis in patients by considering four key clinical factors. Each factor is rated with a specific point value, and the total score informs the probability of cellulitis.

You input four true or false answers related to these clinical factors:

- Presence of asymmetric skin abnormalities
- Age of 70 years or older
- White blood cell count of 10,000/mcL or more
- Heart rate of 90 beats per minute or more

The scoring for these factors is as follows:

- Asymmetric skin abnormalities contribute 3 points
- Age of 70 years or older adds 2 points
- White blood cell count of 10,000/mcL or more adds 1 point
- Heart rate of 90 beats per minute or more also adds 1 point

To compute the ALT-70 score, you sum the points of all true responses, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 7.

Interpreting the score:

- A score of 0 to 2 suggests a low probability of cellulitis. It's advisable to explore other diagnoses.
- A score between 3 and 4 indicates an intermediate probability and suggests consulting a specialist for further evaluation.
- A score from 5 to 7 implies a high probability of cellulitis, for which initiating treatment may be recommended.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^901a66c9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

ASCVD risk assessment and treatment goals — ASCVD risk has been classified into 4 categories, and the NLA Expert Panel recommends consideration of the use of moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels, for patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, based on RCT results that demonstrate a benefit in these patients at all levels of baseline lipids. Lifestyle therapies should be emphasized and monitored in all patients with elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, whether or not pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia management is used. Risk assessment will often proceed according to the following steps: Step 1 — identify high- and very high–risk conditions, if present, including Clinical ASCVD and Diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) with ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage (estimated glomerular filtration rate, < 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2), and high risk conditions such as LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL (severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype) or Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness plane (Figure 1) — when a new intervention produces less health and lower costs compared with the comparator, it may be considered cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is greater than the cost-effectiveness threshold; however, this situation does not arise often because patients, clinicians, and health systems rarely accept worse health outcomes even if it reduces spending, and the figure includes labels "Intervention is cost-saving ("dominant") or always acceptable" and "Intervention is inferior ("dominated") or never acceptable".

### The practice of intensive care in latin America: a survey of academic intensivists [^22bce555]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Workload, clinical rounds, and competencies

The median weekly workload was 60 (IQR, 47–70) h, mostly spent in the ICU (Additional file 4: Figure S2), without differences between academic and nonacademic centers (median 60 [IQR, 46–70] vs. 60 [IQR, 48–68] h; p = 0.7). The duration and characteristics of clinical rounds varied widely across countries, with differences between academic and nonacademic units (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Proportion of intensive care unit rounds according to their academic status and (a) length of morning round, (b) presence of evening round, and (c) number of specialists involved in the morning round

Fifty-two percent of intensivists worked daily and also did night shifts. Twenty-two percent worked only in day shifts, and 22% only in night shifts. The median number of night shifts was 1 (IQR, 1–2) per week. Younger intensivists did more night shifts per week (p < 0.001). According to position, staff intensivists performed the higher number of shifts per week (median, 2 [IQR, 1–3]), followed by residents (median, 2 [IQR, 1–2]) (p < 0.001). The number of beds covered per intensivist varied from 3 to 12 per night shift. Most ICUs (76%) had consultants available during night shifts. Overall, survey respondents considered themselves very competent to perform many common procedures. There were significant differences according to position, age, and years of experience in the ICU (Table 2).

Suppose thatis the number of infected people at timewhen lockdowns are introduced at k for k = 0, 1, 2…

Assume that

The percentage of growth in the number of infected people during the 4 time intervals for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, are, say, for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. These growth percentages are computed as

The secondary infections caused by an infected individual (Fig. 1) are the people who were not traced by the system. This step assumes that all of the infected people who were identified by the system were either quarantined or were controlled not to spread the virus further. Only a proportion of infected people who were tested and identified during lockdowns was reported, and others were either not diagnosed or not reported. Asymptomatic individuals could be anywhere in the process; that is, they were part of the identified and reported group or were among those who had not been contact traced or diagnosed. The mean (geometric) number of secondary infections would be appropriate because we were considering proportionate secondary infections. Hence, the mean number of secondary infections during is given by

International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) cardiac transplant listing — age criteria and outcomes state that patients should be considered for cardiac transplantation if they are ≤ 70 years of age (Level of Evidence: C), and that carefully selected patients > 70 years of age may be considered for cardiac transplantation; for centers considering these patients, the use of an alternate-type program (i.e., use of older donors) may be pursued (Level of Evidence: C). Supporting data report comparable long-term survival across age strata, with a 10-year follow-up of recipients > 65 years of age (n = 66) versus < 60 years (n = 679) and 60 to 64 years (n = 137) showing 10-year survival similar in all groups (< 60 years: 53.7%; 60 to 64 years: 53.1%; > 65 years: 60.2%; p = not statistically significant [NS]), and significantly fewer rejection episodes in the older patient group (freedom from rejection: 74.9 vs 83.5 vs 90.6, respectively; p = 0.03). In a study of 15 patients ≥ 70 years of age, actuarial survival at 1 year was 93.3% vs 88.3% and at 4 years was 73.5% vs 69.1% compared with younger patients; in 2002, 10% of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation were > 65 years old, and the United Network for Organ Sharing policy specifies that organs from donors < 18 years be offered to recipients < 18 years.

### Owning the cost of emergency medicine: beyond 2% [^4f829d55]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This article evaluates current evidence on the cost of emergency care. First, we reviewed data from national data sets and found that aggregate spending on emergency care is 5% to 6% of national health expenditures but could be as high as 10%. These figures are significantly higher than those previously published. Second, we reviewed the literature on economic models of the cost of emergency care and found that the results are inconclusive and incomplete. As an alternative, we discussed activity-based cost accounting and concluded that it is a promising research methodology for emergency medicine. We conclude by advocating for a strategy to demonstrate the value and strategic importance of emergency medicine rather than minimizing its role in national health care costs.

### Are there circumstances in which phase 2 study results should be practice-changing? [^293b9755]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

New pharmaceuticals, innovative combinations of approved agents, and novel treatment modalities have resulted in a marked increase in the need for clinical trials. Evidence for treatment efficacy is best derived from large phase 3 randomized, controlled clinical trials. However, phase 3 investigations are lengthy and expensive, and consume patient resources. Furthermore, some diseases and treatment indications are rare, and adequate numbers of patients for a definitive phase 3 trial do not exist. Consequently, it is imperative for clinicians to understand phase 2 trial design, since their interpretation is required to apply the findings in clinical practice appropriately. The complexity of phase 2 studies is explored, including unique designs, possible use of randomization, and other key elements necessary for interpretation of phase 2 trials. Specific examples and application of these concepts are discussed in this review.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds — framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization's program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^4483eea4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

### A one-year trial of tiotropium respimat plus usual therapy in COPD patients [^12fff95a]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this randomised double-blind study, patients ≥ 40 years old with COPD, a smoking history of ≥ 10 pack-years, a pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) of ≤ 60% predicted and an FEV(1)/FVC of ≤ 70% received tiotropium 5 microg or placebo via Respimat inhaler once daily for 48 weeks. Other medications were permitted except inhaled anticholinergics. Co-primary endpoints were trough FEV(1) and the time to first exacerbation. Adverse events were followed and vital status regularly assessed. In all, 3991 patients (mean age, 65 years [SD, 9 years]) were evaluable. Mean baseline FEV(1) was 1.11 L (0.40 L) or 40% (12%) of predicted normal. Adjusted mean differences in trough FEV(1) and trough FVC at Week 48 (tiotropium minus placebo) were 102 and 168 mL respectively (p < 0.0001, both). Tiotropium delayed time to first exacerbation relative to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.63–0.77]) and time to first hospital-treated exacerbation (HR, 0.73 [0.59–0.90]). SGRQ score at Week 48 was 2.9 units lower with tiotropium (p < 0.0001). Adverse and serious adverse events were balanced across treatment groups and similar in profile to previous tiotropium trials. The rate ratio for a major adverse cardiovascular event during the treatment period + 30 days was 1.12 (0.67–1.86). By the end of planned treatment (Day 337) 52 patients on tiotropium (incidence rate per 100 years, 2.94) and 38 on placebo (2.13) had died (HR = 1.38 [0.91–2.10]; p = 0.13). Lung function, exacerbations and quality of life were improved by tiotropium 5 microg Respimat but a numerical imbalance was seen in all-cause mortality. The protocol is registered on the European Clinical Trials Database as trial number 2006-001009-27 and in the ClinicalTrials.gov database as NCT00387088.

### The cost of large numbers of hypothesis tests on power, effect size and sample size [^4b1c0c24]. Molecular Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Results

For a fixed targeted effect size and fixed sample size, power decreases as the number of tests and corresponding critical value increase (Table 1, Figure 2a). If the power for a single test is 80%, the power is approximately 50% for 10; 10% for 1000; and 1% for 100 000 Bonferroni-adjusted tests. To avoid a drop in nominal power without increasing sample size, an investigator may target larger effect sizes (Table 1, Figure 2b) using equation (1). For one million tests, the effect size multiplier is 2.25 at 80% power and 2.08 at 90% power. Suppose it has been determined that a sample of 100 yields 80% power to detect a difference in group means when the mean in group 1 is 10 and the mean in group 2 is 12. The original sample size of 100 would also yield 80% power to detect a mean difference of 2.25 × 2 = 4.50, with Bonferroni adjustment for one million tests. The effect size multiplier works on the scale of the underlying Normally distributed test statistic. For example, effect size multiplication for an OR should be carried out after conversion to the natural log scale. Suppose 500 total cases and controls provide 90% power to detect an OR = 1.2, the effect size multiplier for 90% power and 1000 tests is 1.65. Since log e (1.2) = 0.18, the same sample of 500 yields 90% power in 1000 tests to detect a log e (OR) = 1.65 × 0.18 = 0.30 or, equivalently, an OR = exp(0.30) = 1.35.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer — patients without tissue confirmation is summarized with five series reporting dose, follow-up, local control (LC), and overall survival (OS). Inoue (N 115) delivered 30–70 Gy in 2–10 fx (median BED 106 Gy [range 56–141 Gy]) with median follow-up 14 months, LC 96.6% (≤ 2.0 cm), 94.7% (> 2.0 cm) and OS 89.8% (≤ 2.0 cm), 60.7% (> 2.0 cm) (3-year). Verstegen (N 382) used 60 Gy in 3–8 fx with median follow-up 31 months, LC 91.2% (3-year) and OS 55.4% (3-year). Takeda (N 58) treated with 50 Gy in 5 fx (peripheral), 40 Gy in 5 fx (central) with median follow-up 20.2 months, LC 80% (3-year) and OS 54% (3-year). Taremi (N 28) used 48 Gy in 4 fx or 54–60 Gy in 3 fx (peripheral), 50 Gy in 10 fx or 60 Gy in 8 fx (central) with median follow-up 19.1 months, LC 87% (1-year), and OS 84% (for the entire 108-pt cohort, no difference between pts with and w/o tissue confirmation, 1-year). Fischer-Valuck (N 23) reported 48–60 Gy in 4–5 fx with median follow-up 29 months, LC 94.1% (3-year) and OS 58.9% (3-year).

### Adult cancer clinical trials that fail to complete: an epidemic? [^2237ad04]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

The number and diversity of cancer therapeutics in the pipeline has increased over the past decade due to an enhanced understanding of cancer biology and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. At the same time, the cost of bringing new drugs to market and the regulatory burdens associated with clinical drug development have progressively increased. The finite number of eligible patients and limited financial resources available to evaluate promising new therapeutics represent rate-limiting factors in the effort to translate preclinical discoveries into the next generation of standard therapeutic approaches. Optimal use of resources requires understanding and ultimately addressing inefficiencies in the cancer clinical trials system. Prior analyses have demonstrated that a large proportion of trials initiated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cooperative Group system are never completed. While NCI Cooperative Group trials are important, they represent only a small proportion of all cancer clinical trials performed. Herein, we explore the problem of cancer clinical trials that fail to complete within the broader cancer clinical trials enterprise. Among 7776 phase II-III adult cancer clinical trials initiated between 2005–2011, we found a seven-year cumulative incidence of failure to complete of approximately 20% (95% confidence interval = 18% to 22%). Nearly 48000 patients were enrolled in trials that failed to complete. These trials likely contribute little to the scientific knowledge base, divert resources and patients from answering other critical questions, and represent a barrier to progress.

### Use of clinical trial characteristics to estimate costs of new drug development [^945e3485]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Despite their importance to patients, health, and industry, the magnitude of investments in drug research and development (R&D) remain nebulous. New policies require more granular and transparent R&D cost estimates to better balance incentives for innovation and returns to developers.

Objective

To estimate per-drug R&D costs using a novel, reproduceable approach and to describe firm-level R&D costs per discrete unit of R&D activity (1 patient-month).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation used cross-sectional data to estimate 2014 to 2019 costs per patient-month. Costs per patient-month were calculated using data from 268 US publicly traded drug developers, contributing 1311 firm-year observations, that were highest ranked by assets or market capitalization, after exclusions. Per-drug costs were calculated from all R&D activity through approval for a cohort of 38 new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to July 2024.

Exposure

R&D activity, measured in terms of clinical trial patient-months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

This study used a 2-step approach to estimate R&D costs, first allocating firm-year-level total R&D spending across similarly aggregated patient-months, and then aggregating these incremental costs to estimate drug-level R&D costs per new drug.

Results

Among 268 developers assessed, 20 large firms accounted for 80.8% of all patient-months and had 27.4% lower mean and 26.7% lower median costs per patient-month compared with other firms. Each 1% increase in patient-months was associated with a 0.9% increase in R&D costs. R&D costs per new drug were highly skewed, with a lower median (IQR), at $708 million ($247 million to $1.42 billion) than mean (SD), at $1.31 ($1.92) billion, after adjusting for the cost of capital and discontinued products. Without these adjustments, direct costs per new drug were a median (IQR) of $150 ($67.6-$453) million and a mean (SD) $369 of ($684) million. While estimated R&D costs varied in sensitivity analyses, mean costs were always substantially greater than median costs.

Conclusions and Relevance

This economic evaluation found median per-drug R&D costs toward the lower end of the range from prior studies, with a mean closer to the middle of the existing range despite the broad scope of included costs. These findings suggest parallel development across indications, adjustment for discontinued products, and a small number of expensive development programs are particularly important drivers of R&D costs.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) in cardiovascular care: Over the next 30 years, cardiovascular disease health care costs in the United States are expected to quadruple, from $338 billion in 2020 to $1.4 trillion in 2050, increasing from 2.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 4.6% of projected GDP in 2050. CEAs can help promote efficient allocation of finite societal resources by weighing intervention effectiveness against incremental resource use; they are not simply about minimizing costs but about evaluating the incremental cost-effectiveness of an intervention relative to the next best alternative to maximize population health benefits, and they provide efficiency estimates to inform decision-making at the policy and system level.

### Impact of vaccination against severe COVID-19 in the French population aged 50 years and above: a retrospective population-based study [^64506e78]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Given the widespread implementation of COVID-19 vaccination to mitigate the pandemic from the end of 2020, it is important to retrospectively evaluate its impact, in particular by quantifying the number of severe outcomes prevented through vaccination.

Methods

We estimated the number of hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths directly averted by vaccination in France, in people aged ≥ 50 years, from December 2020 to March 2022, based on (1) the number of observed events, (2) vaccination coverage, and (3) vaccine effectiveness. We accounted for the effect of primary vaccination and the first booster dose, the circulating variants, the age groups, and the waning of vaccine-induced protection over time.

Results

An estimated 480,150 (95% CI: 260,072–582,516) hospitalizations, 132,156 (50,409–157,767) ICU admissions and 125,376 (53,792–152,037) deaths were directly averted by vaccination in people aged ≥ 50 years, which corresponds to a reduction of 63.2% (48.2–67.6), 68.7% (45.6–72.4) and 62.7% (41.9–67.1) respectively, compared to what would have been expected without vaccination over the study period. An estimated 5852 (2285–6853) deaths were directly averted among the 50–59 years old, 16,837 (6568–19,473) among the 60–69 years old, 32,136 (13,651–36,758) among the 70–79 years old and 70,551 (31,288–88,953) among the ≥ 80 years old.

Conclusions

The vaccination campaign in France considerably reduced COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, as well as stress on the healthcare system.

### Cervical preparation for second-trimester surgical abortion prior to 20 weeks' gestation: SFP guideline # 2013–4 [^c2382c6a]. Contraception (2014). Medium credibility.

Osmotic dilators before dilation and evacuation (D&E) — number, labeling guidance, and one- versus two-day strategies are as follows: "The number of tents placed varies greatly among clinicians" and depends on factors including "gestational age" and "whether Dilapan-S or laminaria tents are used". Some providers "attempt to place more osmotic dilators for challenging cases", and "Protocols recommend increasing numbers of dilators with increasing gestational age". "Approximately half the number of Dilapan-S is needed" compared with the number of laminaria. In a review of D&Es "after 20 weeks' gestation (n = 147)", the "need for intraoperative mechanical cervical dilation" and "rates of uterine and cervical damage decreased as more tents were used". Labeling notes that "the package labeling for laminaria refers to insertion of a single tent" and "The US package labeling for Dilapan-S states that one tent should be placed 4 h prior to D&E up to 16 weeks' gestation", while an international insert "recommends two tents at 13–15 weeks, three at 16–18 weeks and four at 18 weeks' gestation and beyond". Small studies indicate "a single Dilapan-S tent placed 3–4 h prior to D&E may be sufficient up to 18 weeks' gestation", though added mechanical dilation was "somewhat" or "very difficult" in 10%… (n = 60) and 18%… (n = 45)", with "No cervical or uterine injuries" reported. Although "a single set of dilators is generally sufficient prior to 20 weeks' gestation", some clinicians use serial sets "over 1–2 days"; a randomized study at "17–19 weeks gestation (n = 60)" comparing "a 1-day protocol (18–22 h) vs. a 2-day protocol (48 h)" found greater dilatation with the 2-day regimen "(22.4 vs. 18.2 mm diameter, p < .001)", though the authors questioned the clinical value and "The gestational age at which 2 days of osmotic dilation is needed or beneficial has not been determined".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds for cardiovascular cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — The 2014 ACC/AHA cost-value methodology statement provided thresholds to identify high-, intermediate-, and low-value care based on U.S. per capita gross domestic product, and the writing committee determined that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1–3× per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. WHO-origin GDP benchmarks suggested an intervention that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective and that costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective, but critics note they "set such a low bar for cost effectiveness that very few interventions with evidence of efficacy can be ruled out"; WHO experts now also advise against per capita GDP-based thresholds and suggest considering cost-effectiveness alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicomponent decision process. Reflecting these concerns, the writing committee reviewed alternative approaches to incorporating CEA results into guidelines, including relying on US-based studies for identifying a cost-effectiveness threshold or thresholds for cardiovascular CEAs, and Vanness et al used a health opportunity cost approach estimating that for every $1 000 000 increase in health care expenditures, 1869 persons become uninsured, resulting in 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars; in the probabilistic analysis, 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Long-term efficacy of antifungals in toenail onychomycosis: a critical review [^a717857b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Modern antifungal drugs achieve high mycological and clinical cure rates in onychomycosis of the toes, but little is known about the long-term evolution of the treated patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to analyse the therapeutic results recorded more than 1 year after initiation of therapy.

Methods

We used two endpoints for the analysis: EP1 (the number of patients with negative mycology after follow-up, divided by the number of patients included at day 0, including all patients lost to follow-up), and EP2 (the number of patients with negative mycology after follow-up divided by the number of patients with negative mycology at week 48). Clinical cure rate (EPclin) was the number of patients clinically cured or with minimal residual lesions divided by the number of patients included at day 0.

Results

From a Medline search we identified 17 studies providing results beyond 48 weeks. Ketoconazole 200 mg d(-1) up to 1 year resulted in EP1 of 11% at 18 months, and EP2 of 43%. Griseofulvin 1 g d(-1) for 1 year allowed an EP1 of 43% at 18 months, and EP2 of 71%. The mean EP1 after fluconazole once weekly up to 1 year was 49% at 18 months, and EP2 was 91%. With itraconazole 200 mg d(-1) or 400 mg d(-1) for 1 week each month for 3–4 months, EP1 was 37% at 18 months, and 53% at 2 years; EP2 was 76% at 4 years. Terbinafine 250 mg d(-1) for 12–16 weeks achieved an EP1 of 62% at 18 months, 72% at 2 years, and 60% at 4 years; EP2 was 80% at 18 months, 81% at 2 years, and 71% at 4 years. In the only study planned to compare the long-term efficacy of terbinafine and itraconazole, EP1 at 18 months was significantly higher with continuous terbinafine than with intermittent itraconazole (66% vs. 37%, P < 0.001). The clinical cure rates were 21% at 60 weeks and 37% at 72 weeks with fluconazole. EPclin was 27% at 18 months and 35% at 2 years with itraconazole. EPclin was 48% at 18 months, 69% at 2 years and 50% at 4 years with terbinafine.

Conclusions

Considering the stringency of the criteria we used, this critical review suggests that the long-term efficacy achieved with terbinafine is superior to that obtained with griseofulvin, ketoconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — importance and projected cardiovascular disease costs are outlined: Over the next 30 years, health care costs attributable to cardiovascular disease in the United States are expected to quadruple, even after accounting for inflation — from $338 billion in 2020 to $1.4 trillion in 2050, an increase from 2.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 4.6% of the projected GDP in 2050. CEAs can help promote efficient allocation of finite societal resources by weighing the effectiveness of an intervention against the incremental use of resources, and it is important to note that CEAs are not simply about minimizing costs: they systematically evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of an intervention relative to the best alternative to maximize the population health benefits, given finite available resources.

Insulin affordability and cost-related medication use in U.S. adults with diabetes — cost-related nonadherence rates, policy caps, and screening: In the U.S., 24.3% of adults with type 1 diabetes and 15.8% of adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes reported rationing insulin to save money, and insulin underuse due to cost has been termed "cost-related medication nonadherence". In 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the Part D Senior Savings Model requiring participating plans to cover insulins with a $35 maximum monthly out-of-pocket payment; in 2022, 43% of stand-alone Part D plan enrollees and 60% of Medicare Advantage Part D plan enrollees participated. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 capped out-of-pocket payments for insulin at $35 per insulin per month for all Medicare beneficiaries, and over the past 5 years, 25 states and the District of Columbia capped out-of-pocket expenditures for insulin in select state-regulated commercial plans; between 2023 and 2024, three major insulin manufacturers lowered the price of insulin to $35 per month in select circumstances. Thus, all people with diabetes should be screened for financial hardships of treatment, cost-related barriers to medication use, and rationing of other essential services due to medical costs.

### Trends in costs of care for Medicare beneficiaries treated in the emergency department from 2011 to 2016 [^cb5193e2]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

There is little evidence regarding how total costs of care associated with an emergency department (ED) visit have changed, despite increasing policy focus on the value of acute care.

Objective

To examine trends in total standardized 30-day costs of care associated with an ED visit.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study of 14 113 088 ED visits at 4730 EDs from 2011 to 2016 included a 20% national sample of traditional Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. Data analysis was conducted from August 2018 to April 2020.

Exposures

Time (year) as a continuous variable.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Trends in disposition from the ED and 30-day total standardized costs for all ED visits as well as the following spending components: index visit cost, physician costs, subsequent ED visit costs, subsequent inpatient costs, subsequent observation costs, non-ED outpatient care, postacute care, and aggregated total spending after the index ED visit.

Results

The analytic sample consisted of 14 113 088 ED visits at 4730 EDs. The mean (SD) beneficiary age was 78.6 (8.6) years, 8 573 652 visits (60.7%) were among women, and 11 908 691 visits (84.7%) were among white patients. The proportion of patients discharged from the ED rose from 1 233 701 of 2 309 563 visits (53.4%) in 2011 to 1 279 701 of 2 268 363 visits (56.4%) in 2016. Total adjusted 30-day standardized costs of care declined from a mean (SE) of $8851 ($35.3) in 2011 to a mean (SE) of $8143 ($35.4) in 2016 (-$126/y; 95% CI, -$130 to -$121; P < .001) for all ED visits. This decrease was primarily associated with a decline in total spending on the index ED visit (-$48/y; 95% CI, -$50 to -$47; P < .001) as well as lower spending on postacute care (-$42/y; 95% CI, -$44 to -$41; P < .001) and subsequent inpatient care (-$34/y; 95% CI, -$36 to -$32; P < .001). There was an increase in spending after the index visit on downstream observation care ($3.6/y; 95% CI, $3.5 to $3.7; P < .001), outpatient ED care ($4.6/y; 95% CI, $4.4 to $4.8; P < .001), and other outpatient care ($15/y; 95% CI, $12 to $18; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, total 30-day standardized costs of ED care for Medicare beneficiaries decreased in recent years. It may be that more intensive ED spending up front is associated with reductions in total costs of an acute episode.

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^10cfe7ca]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

ACC/AHA PM-2 — exercise training referral for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) from an inpatient setting defines the measure as the "Percentage of patients, age ≥ 18, hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of HFrEF in the previous 12 mo, who are referred for outpatient exercise training (or regular physical activity), typically delivered in the setting of an outpatient CR program". The numerator is patients with HFrEF "who have been referred to an outpatient CR program before hospital discharge", where referral requires "1. Documented communication between the healthcare provider and the patient to recommend an outpatient CR program" and either "2A. Official referral order is sent to outpatient CR program" or "2B. Documentation of patient refusal to justify why patient information was not sent to the CR program"; "Performance is met if steps 1 AND either 2A (official referral order transmitted) OR 2B (patient refusal documented in the patient's medical record) are completed and documented". The denominator is "All patients who have had HFrEF during the previous 12 mo, who are discharged from the hospital during the reporting period", with exclusions including "Patients age < 18 y", those leaving against medical advice, death during hospitalization, transfer to another hospital for inpatient care, or prior CR participation. Denominator exceptions include patient-oriented reasons such as no program "within 60 min [travel time] from the patient's home", medical reasons (eg, medically unstable or impairments precluding CR), and healthcare system reasons (eg, nursing/long-term care discharge or lack of coverage). The measurement period is "Encounter", data sources are "Medical record or other database (eg, administrative, clinical, registry)", attribution is "Measure reportable at facility level", and the care setting is "Inpatient".

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f54c4a6b]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "American Diabetes Association diabetes risk score (ADA score)" for diabetes mellitus type 2.

The American Diabetes Association Diabetes Risk Score (ADA Score) is a clinical calculator used to assess the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults. This scoring system is based on several factors including age, gender, family history of diabetes, physical activity level, and body mass index (BMI). The ADA Score is particularly useful in primary care settings, where it can help identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes and guide early intervention strategies. It is not applicable to individuals who have already been diagnosed with diabetes, and its accuracy may be limited in certain populations, such as those with certain ethnic backgrounds or rare forms of diabetes.

The American Diabetes Association diabetes risk score calculator is a tool designed to estimate an individual's risk of developing diabetes by evaluating several personal and health-related factors. It works by collecting six inputs: age, gender, a family history of diabetes, presence of hypertension, level of physical activity, and body mass index (BMI). Each response is linked to a specific score, and the sum of these scores reflects the overall risk.

Here's how each category contributes to the score:

- **Age, years**:
- **Under 40 years**: Score 0
- **Between 40 and 49 years**: Score 1
- **Between 50 and 59 years**: Score 2
- **60 years and above**: Score 3

- **Gender**:
- **Female without a history of gestational diabetes**: Score 0
- **Female with a history of gestational diabetes**: Score 1
- **Male**: Score 1

- **1st degree relative with diabetes**:
- **Yes**: Score 1
- **No**: Score 0

- **Hypertension**:
- **Yes**: Score 1
- **No**: Score 0

- **Physically active**:
- **Yes**: Score 0
- **No**: Score 1

- **Body mass index (BMI), kg/m²**:
- **Less than 25**: Score 0
- **Between 25 and 30**: Score 1
- **Between 30 and 40**: Score 2
- **40 and above**: Score 3

The scores from each of these categories are added together to get a total score, which can range from 0 to 10. This score is then interpreted in terms of diabetes risk:

- A total score of 5 or higher suggests that the individual has a high risk of developing diabetes.
- A score below 5 indicates that the risk is not considered high.

This system provides a simple method to approximate diabetes risk, based on key lifestyle and demographic factors.

### The burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors by state in the USA, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^29efbd2b]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The pursuit of medical advancements is a delicate balance between uncovering innovative medications and devices to alleviate the burden of disease, while also ensuring that existing, effective treatments are efficiently disseminated and implemented. For example, although the medical field has made significant strides in developing an array of safe and effective antihypertensive medications, many of which are available as affordable generics, a large percentage of Americans with high blood pressure still struggle with uncontrolled symptoms. In fact, national rates of blood pressure control have been on a downward trend since 2011, highlighting the need for a more preventive holistic approach to health care. This challenge underscores the importance of not only advancing medical research but also prioritising the accessibility and implementation of established treatments, ultimately striving to improve patient outcomes and public health. At the same time, the USA could greatly benefit from new drugs such as GLP-1 agonists to help reduce obesity and subsequently reduce the risk of diabetes and other obesity-related diseases, if those in need can have affordable access to them.

The USA consistently underperforms in key health indicators when compared with other high-income countries and even low-income and middle-income ones. This sobering but unsurprising finding reflects an ongoing pattern of declining health in the USA relative to that of other countries, as identified in previous iterations of GBD. Increases in obesity and diabetes have negatively impacted the public health systems and rankings of the USA compared with the rest of the world. Despite its vast resources, the USA has higher age-standardised rates of YLDs than nearly all countries around the world; in fact, eight US states have higher rates than any country or territory. Life expectancy and HALE in the USA have similarly declined over the past 30 years compared with other countries; the USA ranked 47th for females and 46th for males in life expectancy and 76th for females and 69th for males for HALE out of 204 countries and territories in 2021. The question remains: for how long can we accept and ignore such poor health outcomes without addressing the root causes and taking decisive action to improve the wellbeing of the US population? An alarm needs to keep sounding about the deteriorating state of health in the USA, pointing to the substantial influence of risk factors and social determinants on health outcomes.

### Group testing via hypergraph factorization applied to COVID-19 [^78957eed]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

For the 8 × 12 and 16 × 24 plate-based array designs, the simulation proceeds in the same way except for step 2, where the corresponding array pools are used instead. Recall that the array method is a two-stage method like HYPER. For P-BEST, which is a one-stage method, steps 1–3 are the same (except that step 2 now uses the P-BEST pools). Steps 4–6 are replaced by running the P-BEST decoder to identify individuals. For this, we followed the example (including its tuning parameters) provided online by the authors at. Finally, since P-BEST has no second stage of validation tests, the number of tests expended is always = m = 48. Figure 2 plots the average efficiencies and average sensitivities of the various methods for each day in a 90-day window of epidemic growth. Here we included individual testing, which has a constant average efficiency of 1 (unity) since it is the baseline. Its average sensitivity on day d is equal tosince individual testing identifies those individuals with viral load > LOD, and true positive individuals are those with viral load > 0 (as before). The average sensitivities of the various methods appeared to generally have significant experimental noise. So, Figure 2 plots the raw averages (i.e.) as dots along with a degree-8 polynomial curve fitted tovs.across the plotting window of days d = 20,…, 110, where p (d) is the prevalence on day d.

In Fig. 2 a, b, we compared HYPER designs H 96,16,2 and H 384,32,2 with their counterpart array designs and P-BEST. For the HYPER designs, the numbers n of individuals per batch were chosen to match the array designs and P-BEST. The numbers m of pools were chosen so that the corresponding pool sizes n q / m match the maximum pool sizes of the array designs (12 for the 8 × 12 array and 24 for the 16 × 24 array). Figure 2 c compares HYPER designs H 384,32,2, H 384,16,2, and H 384,12,2 that have varying numbers of pools. Figure 2 d compares HYPER designs H 384,12,1, H 384,12,2, and H 384,12,3 that have varying numbers of splits.

### Non-pharmaceutical interventions and COVID-19 vaccination strategies in Senegal: a modelling study [^c642e007]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Optimisation

To investigate the optimal strategy for vaccination by age group, we formulate the problem as follows:

Let us note that p 1 (respectively, p 2) is the proportion of individuals vaccinated with half dose (respectively, full doses) for the age group 5−30 years; p 3 (respectively, p 4) is the proportion of individuals vaccinated with half dose (respectively, full doses) for the age group 30−40 years; and p 5 (respectively, p 6) is the proportion of individuals vaccinated with full doses for the age group 40−50 years (respectively, for the age group 50−60 years). Let us note that: p 1 + p 2 + p 3 + p 4 + p 5 + p 6 = 1, V is the number of doses and N is the total population, then:

Equation 4

The last constraint is that we cannot allocate more doses to an age class than its population. Thus, let q 1, q 2, q 3 and q 4 be the fractions of the age groups 5−30, 30−40, 40−50 and 50−60 years, respectively. Then, we have, (p 1 + p 2) ≤ q 1, (p 3 + p 4) ≤ q 2, p 5 ≤ q 3 and p 5 ≤ q 4.

For each strategy, p i with i {1,… ,6}, we calculate the YLS gained and the cost of this strategy.

To find the optimal strategy, that is, the one that maximises the YLS gained while minimising the costs, a simulation matrix based on a Latin square was constructed. The simulation matrix allows us to see the screening factor of { p i with i {1,… ,6}} for the number of deaths and for hospital costs. The parameters were optimised using a Bayesian optimisation routine. All parameters are described in online supplemental material 1, table S4.
