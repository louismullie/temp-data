## Question

can you give metformin if ALT is elevated to 54?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an ALT of 54 U/L should alter the decision to use metformin, and how to interpret and manage this. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether ALT 54 represents true hepatic impairment or a mild, possibly normal, transaminase variation. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling actually says about "hepatic impairment" and metformin, and whether that applies to isolated mild ALT elevations. Next, I will review the balance of risks and benefits in patients with mild ALT elevation, especially in the context of NAFLD and compensated liver disease. After that, I should outline a monitoring and dosing strategy centered on renal function and clinical status. Finally, I will consolidate a practical decision framework and double-check edge cases such as lactic acidosis triggers and extracorporeal therapy thresholds to ensure the guidance is safe and reference-aligned.

> Let me first confirm how to interpret an ALT of 54 U/L in context, because I don't want to overcall hepatic disease based on a single number. ALT reference ranges vary considerably across laboratories, often by as much as two-fold, so an ALT of 54 U/L may be within normal for some labs and only mildly elevated for others that use lower upper limits of normal such as 30–40 U/L; in either case, it does not, by itself, establish hepatic impairment [^112nyEMD]. Hold on, I should verify the definition of hepatic impairment relevant to metformin prescribing: labels and guidance refer to clinical hepatic impairment, typically involving reduced synthetic function, hyperbilirubinemia, and/or signs of decompensation, not an isolated mild transaminase elevation, so ALT 54 alone does not meet that threshold [^112migWo] [^notfound] [^1171xQPt].

> I will now examine whether there is evidence of true hepatic impairment or decompensation, because that would change the risk profile for metformin. I need to check albumin and INR for synthetic function, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase for cholestasis, and look for clinical signs such as jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding; absence of these findings supports compensated function rather than decompensation, which is the context in which metformin concerns become more pronounced due to lactic acidosis risk [^1171xQPt] [^114ovbWV] [^114ruWAL]. Wait, let me verify etiologies too, because mild ALT elevations are commonly due to NAFLD in diabetes and may not reflect progressive liver failure; in such cases, the hepatic risk profile with metformin is generally acceptable when overall liver function is preserved [^114ovbWV] [^114ruWAL].

> Next, I should review the FDA prescribing guidance to ensure I'm not missing a label-based contraindication. The labels consistently caution that metformin is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment due to lactic acidosis risk; however, they do not instruct to avoid metformin for a mild, isolated ALT increase, and the boxed warning emphasizes global risk factors such as renal dysfunction, hypoxia, and alcohol excess that amplify lactic acidosis risk rather than hepatocellular enzyme elevations per se [^112migWo] [^1171xQPt] [^111xJty6] [^116KM1EA] [^114deXZH]. I should confirm that the central safety determinant remains renal function, where initiation is contraindicated if eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and discouraged between 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m² without careful consideration, monitoring, and dose limitation [^112migWo] [^11464kH9].

> Now, let me consider the benefit–risk balance in diabetes with mild ALT elevation, because NAFLD is common and cardiometabolic benefits matter. Large-scale and guideline-level data support metformin as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes; metformin is associated with lower mortality and appears safe in many patients with compensated cirrhosis, with benefits likely mediated through cardiometabolic effects rather than direct histologic liver improvement, and there is some evidence of lower ALT linked to weight loss and insulin sensitization in NAFLD contexts [^112gSxmS] [^117McX7o] [^114ruWAL] [^113cCyXQ]. I should double-check the lactic acidosis risk: high-quality evidence suggests that absolute risk is very low, and when cases occur they typically involve additional precipitating factors such as renal failure, sepsis, or hypoxia rather than mild stable liver enzyme abnormalities; rare case reports of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity do exist but are characterized by dramatic enzyme elevations and jaundice, not ALT in the 50s [^117SdiUM] [^1177X1DT] [^111aKhWt] [^114vvBUr].

> Next, I should review a prudent monitoring strategy if metformin is initiated with ALT 54 U/L, because I need to ensure safety signals are captured early. I will confirm baseline labs including a full liver panel, albumin, INR, and eGFR; prioritize renal monitoring at initiation and at least annually, or more often if eGFR is 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m² or the patient is older; and consider repeating liver tests in 6–12 weeks to document stability rather than because the label mandates routine hepatic monitoring for mild ALT elevations [^112migWo] [^115Pd2K2] [^11464kH9]. I should also educate the patient to report nonspecific symptoms that could herald lactic acidosis or hepatic dysfunction, and pause metformin in acute illness, hypoxic states, or before contrast in accordance with product labeling to minimize risk [^111xJty6] [^1171xQPt].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision stance, keeping the key thresholds in view. If ALT 54 U/L is isolated or attributable to stable NAFLD, with normal albumin and INR, no jaundice, no ascites or encephalopathy, and eGFR at least 45 mL/min/1.73 m², then initiating or continuing standard-dose metformin is reasonable, with routine renal monitoring and interval reassessment of liver tests for stability; conversely, if there is suspected acute hepatitis, progressive cholestasis, decompensated cirrhosis, or eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², then avoid or stop metformin and address the underlying condition first [^112migWo] [^11464kH9] [^1171xQPt]. Hold on, I should verify that in compensated cirrhosis the balance often still favors metformin for mortality benefit, but caution and close follow-up remain appropriate, and therapy should be tailored if decompensation occurs [^114ruWAL] [^117McX7o].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the EXTRIP guidance suggested discontinuing extracorporeal treatment when lactate is below 7.35, but that looks like I conflated lactate with pH; let me correct that. EXTRIP recommends initiating extracorporeal treatment in severe metformin poisoning with criteria such as lactate greater than 20 mmol/L or pH 7.0 or lower, with discontinuation generally considered after clinical improvement with pH above 7.35 and lactate reduced to near-normal levels, rather than any lactate threshold of 7.35 mmol/L, which would be physiologically inconsistent; this clarification does not change the outpatient decision about starting metformin with ALT 54 U/L, but it matters for completeness and accuracy [^113EN22s] [^notfound] [^116QtRBA].

> Bottom line, I should confirm and communicate clearly: ALT 54 U/L alone is not a contraindication to metformin; the decision should hinge on overall hepatic function and, most importantly, renal status and intercurrent risk factors for lactic acidosis. In most patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, stable ALT elevation from NAFLD, metformin can be initiated or continued with standard dosing and appropriate monitoring, with strong attention to pausing therapy during acute illness or hypoxia and avoiding use in true hepatic impairment or decompensated cirrhosis [^112migWo] [^1171xQPt] [^112nyEMD] [^112gSxmS].

Yes, **metformin can be initiated** in a patient with an ALT of 54 U/L if there is no evidence of acute or advanced liver disease, as this is only a mild elevation [^112nyEMD] and not a contraindication [^112migWo]. Metformin is **not intrinsically hepatotoxic** [^114vvBUr] and may lower ALT over time through weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity [^113cCyXQ]. Confirm the cause of the elevation [^114NpD4s], assess hepatic impairment [^112migWo], and **monitor liver enzymes and renal function** during therapy [^115Pd2K2].

---

## Clinical significance of ALT 54 U/L

An ALT of 54 U/L is a **mild elevation** [^112nyEMD] and not a contraindication to metformin. ALT reference ranges vary by laboratory and population, with the ULN typically 30–60 U/L; thus, 54 U/L is only slightly above the ULN [^112nyEMD]. Mild ALT elevations are common in T2DM and often reflect NAFLD rather than acute or advanced liver disease [^114NpD4s].

---

## Metformin and hepatic impairment

Metformin is not intrinsically hepatotoxic [^114vvBUr]; although rare hepatotoxicity has been reported, it is generally safe in mild chronic liver disease [^114ruWAL]. The main concern is **lactic acidosis**, which is rare [^117SdiUM] but more likely with significant hepatic impairment due to reduced lactate clearance [^112migWo]. Mild ALT elevations alone do not indicate significant hepatic impairment [^112nyEMD].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines support metformin as **first-line therapy** [^112gSxmS] in T2DM, including patients with mild ALT elevations, provided there is no significant hepatic impairment. Metformin is not recommended in patients with **significant hepatic impairment** due to lactic acidosis risk [^112migWo]. A mild ALT elevation, in the absence of clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment, is not a contraindication.

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

Before starting metformin in a patient with an ALT of 54 U/L, consider the following:

- **Confirm the cause**: Evaluate for NAFLD, alcohol use, medications, or other causes of mild ALT elevation [^114NpD4s].

- **Assess hepatic impairment**: Check bilirubin, INR, albumin, and clinical signs of liver dysfunction.

- **Monitor liver enzymes**: Recheck ALT and AST within 3 months of initiation and periodically thereafter.

- **Monitor renal function**: Obtain baseline eGFR and monitor at least annually, as renal impairment increases lactic acidosis risk [^115Pd2K2].

- **Educate patients**: Advise on symptoms of lactic acidosis (e.g. malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress) and when to seek care [^1171xQPt].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting metformin use in mild ALT elevation

Evidence supports metformin use in patients with mild ALT elevations, including those with NAFLD or mild chronic liver disease [^114ruWAL]. Metformin may lower ALT over time, likely through weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity [^113cCyXQ]. Metformin-associated **lactic acidosis is rare**, and mild ALT elevations alone do not significantly increase this risk [^117SdiUM].

---

## Circumstances requiring caution or contraindication

Metformin should be avoided or used with caution in the following circumstances:

- **Significant hepatic impairment**: Elevated bilirubin, INR, or clinical signs of liver dysfunction.

- **Severe renal impairment**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^115Pd2K2].

- **Acute illness or hypoxia**: Conditions increasing lactic acidosis risk (e.g. sepsis, acute heart failure) [^1171xQPt].

- **Alcohol abuse**: Excessive alcohol intake increases lactic acidosis risk [^116KM1EA].

## Summary table: metformin use in patients with elevated ALT

| **ALT level** | **Clinical significance** | **Metformin use** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild elevation (ALT 54 U/L) | Common in T2DM; often NAFLD | Recommended if no hepatic impairment | Monitor ALT, renal function |
| Moderate elevation (ALT 2–3× ULN) | Possible liver disease | Use with caution; assess hepatic function | Frequent monitoring |
| Severe elevation (ALT > 3× ULN) | Significant liver disease | Contraindicated | Alternative therapy |

---

Metformin can be initiated in a patient with an ALT of 54 U/L if there is **no significant hepatic impairment** [^112nyEMD]. Mild ALT elevations are common in T2DM and do not contraindicate metformin. Confirm the cause of the elevation, assess hepatic function, and monitor liver enzymes and renal function during therapy [^115Pd2K2].

### Metformin hydrochloride [^115Pd2K2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Recommendations to reduce the risk of, and manage, metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below for each of the known and possible risk factors:

- **Renal impairment**: Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment, as metformin is substantially excreted by the kidneys. Clinical recommendations based on the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:
	- Before initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
	- Metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [see Contraindications (4)].
	- Initiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m².
	- Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g. the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
	- In patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.

- **Drug interactions**: The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly those that impair renal function or cause significant hemodynamic changes.

### Aminotransferase levels in clinical practice - what is normal [^112nyEMD]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Purpose of review**: No universal consensus exists as to what the upper limit of normal for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) should be. The purpose of this review is to provide insight into the wide variation in the upper limit of normal for ALT and to highlight key elements resulting in these differences. We also wish to point to potential solutions for standardizing the upper limit of normal.

- **Recent findings**: There are considerable differences in the values for what constitutes a 'normal' ALT serum concentration set by laboratories, with reference values that may vary two-fold between different institutions (from 30 to 60U/l). Key reasons for this include using markedly different reference populations to establish the bounds of normal and differences in analyzers and assays used to quantify ALT levels. A number of studies have attempted to re-evaluate the upper limit of normal and propose new cut-offs that would allow better detection of liver disease.

- **Summary**: The upper limit of normal for ALT continues to vary from one laboratory to another. Despite ongoing efforts, there is still an unmet demand to standardize ALT reference ranges, which is critical for clinical practice. More rigorous inclusion criteria for reference population studies and harmonization in analyzer differences are required to standardize ALT reference ranges universally.

### Effects of metformin and weight loss on serum alanine aminotransferase activity in the diabetes prevention program [^113cCyXQ]. Obesity (2010). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance. We investigated whether metformin or changes in metabolic measurements (weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), or fasting insulin (FI)) improved serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, as a marker for NAFLD, in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). From 1996 to 1999, 2,153 participants without marked elevations of serum ALT at baseline were randomized (1,081 to placebo, 1,072 to metformin) and treated for an average of 3.2 years. ALT increased during the first 2 years of the study and was slightly but significantly lower in the participants randomized to metformin. In regression models adjusted for sex, baseline age, FPG, and FI, these differences remained significant, but disappeared after adjustment for weight, FPG, and FI changes at each examination.

The 3-year cumulative incidence for the development of abnormal ALT concentrations was not significantly different (mean ± s.e. 21.4 ± 1.4% and 24.6 ± 1.4%, P = 0.11) in the metformin vs. placebo groups, but was lower in individuals in both groups who lost more weight by the end of year 1. Specifically, for metformin: 19.4 ± 2.4% vs. 27.5 ± 3.7% for the highest vs. lowest quartile of weight loss; placebo: 18.7 ± 3.4% vs. 28.8 ± 2.6%. Over 3 years of follow-up in persons at high risk for the development of diabetes, serum ALT was consistently lower in those treated with metformin compared with placebo. This effect was mediated by weight loss, indicating that the effects of metformin therapy on ALT is via its effect on weight reduction.

### A claims database analysis of dose-dependency of metformin and incidence of lactic acidosis in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^112TAHny]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The short-term effects of metformin administration on the incidence of lactic acidosis were analyzed. The study presents the number of patient-months and the characteristics of the target patient population for this analysis.

The mean age and percentage of women (69.04 ± 12.80 years and 43.05%, respectively) were the highest in the no metformin group. Additionally, the percentages of patient-months with diagnoses of volume depletion (1.73%) and vitamin B complex administration (0.29%) were also highest in the no metformin group.

- **HD high-dose, LD low-dose**
- **Average ± standard deviation (SD)**: The figures represent the mean values.
- **Volume depletion**: Percentage of patient-months with ICD-10 code E86.
- **Vitamin B complex**: Percentage of patient-months with ATC code A11.

In study 2–1, the incidence rate of lactic acidosis was highest in the low-dose metformin group, with 5.94 (95% CI 5.21–6.73) patient-months per 100,000 patient-months. This was followed by the high-dose metformin group, with 4.35 (95% CI 3.65–5.15) patient-months per 100,000 patient-months, and the no metformin group, with 2.19 (95% CI 2.09–2.29) patient-months per 100,000 patient-months.

In patients who developed lactic acidosis, the mean age in the no metformin group (69.9 ± 15.0 years) was higher than in the other groups prescribed metformin (low-dose: 64.4 ± 11.6 years; high-dose 58.7 ± 12.3 years). The percentage of patients diagnosed with volume depletion and prescribed vitamin B complex was highest in the no metformin group (41.88 and 13.96%), compared to 6.17 and 2.47% in the low-dose group and 18.

### Continuation of metformin use following a diagnosis of cirrhosis significantly improves survival of patients with diabetes [^112dAGbJ]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

The risks and benefits of metformin use in patients with cirrhosis and diabetes are debated. Although data on a protective effect of metformin against liver cancer development have been reported, metformin is frequently discontinued once cirrhosis is diagnosed due to concerns about an increased risk of adverse effects in patients with liver impairment. This study investigated whether the continuation of metformin following a cirrhosis diagnosis improves the survival of diabetic patients. Diabetic patients diagnosed with cirrhosis between 2000 and 2010 who were on metformin at the time of cirrhosis diagnosis were identified (n = 250). Data were retrospectively abstracted from medical records.

Survival of patients who continued versus those who discontinued metformin following a cirrhosis diagnosis was compared using the log-rank test. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using Cox's proportional hazards analysis. Overall, 172 patients continued metformin, whereas 78 discontinued it. Patients who continued metformin had a significantly longer median survival than those who discontinued it (11.8 vs. 5.6 years overall, P < 0.0001; 11.8 vs. 6.0 years for Child A patients, P = 0.006; and 7.7 vs. 3.5 years for Child B/C patients, P = 0.04, respectively). After adjusting for other variables, the continuation of metformin remained an independent predictor of better survival, with an HR of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.24–0.78; P = 0.005). No patients developed metformin-associated lactic acidosis during follow-up.

### Metformin hydrochloride [^1171xQPt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Boxed warning: Warning - lactic acidosis**: Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years or older, having a radiological study with contrast, undergoing surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g. acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Complete boxed warning**: See full prescribing information for a complete boxed warning.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^112mC2FE]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Despite its proven benefits, metformin remains contraindicated in a large segment of the type 2 diabetic population, largely due to concerns over the rare adverse effect of lactic acidosis. The drug is restricted to individuals with normal creatinine levels as a surrogate for renal competence. Other contraindications, such as significant hypoxemia, alcoholism, cirrhosis, and recent radiocontrast studies, also increase the risk for, or the consequences of lactic acidosis, but these are not the focus of this review.

Metformin belongs to the biguanide drug class, which includes phenformin and buformin, developed for lowering glucose in the 1950s. Initial enthusiasm for biguanides diminished over the next two decades due to the growing recognition of their risk of lactic acidosis. A marked reduction in biguanide use occurred in the mid-1970s because phenformin, widely adopted in clinical practice, was implicated in several fatal cases of this severe metabolic decompensation. The association with lactic acidosis eventually led to its withdrawal from the market. Importantly, lactic acidosis with phenformin appears to occur 10–20 times more frequently than with metformin. Unlike metformin, modestly raised phenformin concentrations may reduce peripheral glucose oxidation and enhance peripheral lactate production, which can increase circulating lactate levels. Phenformin levels correlate with lactate concentration, while metformin levels do not.

### Alogliptin and metformin hydrochloride [^116yFsEC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatic effects**: There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking alogliptin, although some reports contain insufficient information to establish the probable cause [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 1.7% of patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), increases in serum alanine aminotransferase three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if a patient is found to have clinically significant liver enzyme elevations and if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets should be interrupted, and an investigation done to establish the probable cause. Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

### ZITUVIMET [^115ojeiF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage**: Take ZITUVIMET orally twice daily with meals. Individualize the dosage of ZITUVIMET based on the patient's regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2,000 mg of metformin hydrochloride (HCl). Do not split or divide ZITUVIMET tablets. The recommended starting dose for patients not currently treated with metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. For patients already treated with metformin, the starting dose should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) along with the dose of metformin already being taken. For patients taking metformin HCl 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of ZITUVIMET is 50 mg sitagliptin and 1,000 mg metformin HCl twice daily.

- **Recommendations for use in renal impairment**: Assess renal function prior to the initiation of ZITUVIMET and periodically thereafter. ZITUVIMET is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. ZITUVIMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m², as these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination ZITUVIMET product.

- **Discontinuation for iodinated contrast imaging procedures**: Discontinue ZITUVIMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure.

### Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117SdiUM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). High credibility.

Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent that has been shown to reduce total mortality compared to other anti-hyperglycemic agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin, however, is thought to increase the risk of lactic acidosis, and has been considered contraindicated in many chronic hypoxemic conditions that may be associated with lactic acidosis, such as cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and pulmonary disease, as well as advancing age.

- **Objectives**: To assess the incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis, and to evaluate blood lactate levels, for those on metformin treatment compared to placebo or non-metformin therapies.

- **Search strategy**: A comprehensive search was performed of electronic databases to identify studies of metformin treatment. The search was augmented by scanning references of identified articles and by contacting principal investigators.

- **Selection criteria**: Prospective trials and observational cohort studies in patients with type 2 diabetes of at least one month duration were included if they evaluated metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, compared to placebo or any other glucose-lowering therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis was recorded as cases per patient-years, for metformin treatment and for non-metformin treatments. The upper limit for the true incidence of cases was calculated using Poisson statistics. In a second analysis, lactate levels were measured as a net change from baseline or as mean treatment values (basal and stimulated by food).

### Metformin, sulfonylureas, or other antidiabetes drugs and the risk of lactic acidosis or hypoglycemia: A nested case-control analysis [^1177X1DT]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Metformin plays a pivotal role in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes by decreasing basal glucose output through the suppression of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver and enhancing glucose disposal in muscle tissue. The most concerning complication, lactic acidosis (pH 4 mmol/l), continues to be a topic of discussion in the literature, although the absolute risk appears to be low. Incidence rates of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use range from 1 to 16.7 cases per 100,000 patient-years.

Salpeter et al. identified all trials and cohort studies conducted between 1959 and 2002 and did not find a single case of lactic acidosis in 36,893 person-years of metformin exposure. Lalau and Race analyzed 49 cases of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use; they found that overall mortality was not correlated with plasma lactate concentrations. Interestingly, plasma metformin concentrations were, on average, three times higher in patients who survived.

All case subjects with lactic acidosis, in addition to metformin use, had acute or chronic comorbidities predisposing them to lactic acidosis. These data suggest that lactic acidosis may be coincidental rather than causally associated with metformin use.

### Avandamet [^114T78sS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Hepatic effects**: Metformin use should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease, as impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis.

	- Rosiglitazone requires measuring liver enzymes prior to the initiation of therapy with Avandamet in all patients and periodically thereafter, based on the clinical judgment of the healthcare professional. Therapy should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal). For patients with mildly elevated liver enzymes (ALT levels ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) at baseline or during therapy with Avandamet, an evaluation should be conducted to determine the cause of the elevation.

	- Initiation or continuation of therapy in patients with mild liver enzyme elevations should proceed with caution, with close clinical follow-up and more frequent liver enzyme monitoring to assess if the elevations resolve or worsen. If at any time ALT levels increase to more than three times the upper limit of normal in patients on Avandamet therapy, liver enzyme levels should be rechecked promptly. If ALT levels persist at greater than three times the upper limit, therapy should be discontinued.

	- If a patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision on whether to continue therapy with Avandamet should be based on these evaluations.

The eligible patients were randomly assigned using a computer-based dynamic allocation method aiming to balance key baseline characteristics. Adjustment factors, such as HbA1c levels and baseline alanine aminotransferase levels greater than 30 IU/L, were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

- **Three models (M1 to M3) were employed**: Each model utilized a different approach to examine the impact of baseline alanine aminotransferase levels on the efficacy of dapagliflozin and sitagliptin.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^114NpD4s]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Individuals with NAFLD frequently have co-morbidities, and as a result, polypharmacy is common. Therefore, a review of prescribed medications, including the use of over-the-counter and alternative/complementary medicines, should be undertaken. Commonly prescribed agents used to treat other conditions may contribute to hepatic fat accumulation (e.g. amiodarone, tamoxifen) or accelerate progression (e.g. methotrexate). Although the published literature is sometimes conflicting, capturing the use of methotrexate, including the duration of exposure and cumulative dose, is particularly relevant. Methotrexate is a potential cofactor promoting persistent transaminitis and/or an increased risk of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients who are overweight or diabetic. After risk assessment, consider recommending the discontinuation of relevant hepatotoxic medications, involving other relevant specialists as necessary.

Moreover, it is important to conduct a medicines use review, as discrepancies between patient-reported and medical record-documented medications exist in more than 50% of patients with liver disease, particularly those taking more than five medications. Practitioners should document a treatment history and medicines use review. The rationalization of medicines that may accelerate disease progression should be considered.

- **Assessment of dietary habits and physical activity**: Poor diet and limited physical activity are common in people diagnosed with NAFLD.

- **Warning: Lactic acidosis**: Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g. acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

### Effects of metformin exposure on survival in a large national cohort of patients with diabetes and cirrhosis [^117McX7o]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

The prognosis of cirrhosis is worsened by type II diabetes mellitus. To manage patients with diabetes, multiple medications including metformin and statins are often co-administered. This study aimed to assess the impact of metformin exposure on mortality, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals with diabetes and cirrhosis, controlling for multiple concomitant exposures.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was performed on patients with cirrhosis diagnosed between January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2016, in the Veterans Health Administration. Marginal structural models and propensity-matching approaches were implemented to quantify the treatment effect of metformin in patients with pre-existing diabetes with or without prior metformin exposure.

- **Results**: Among 74,984 patients with cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus was present before the diagnosis of cirrhosis in 53.8%, and it was diagnosed during follow-up evaluation in 4.8%. Before the diagnosis of cirrhosis, 11,114 patients actively utilized metformin. In these patients, metformin, statin, and angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-2-receptor blocker exposure were independently associated with reduced mortality (metformin hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61–0.75). Metformin was not associated with reduced hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic decompensation after adjustment for concomitant statin exposure. For patients with diabetes before a diagnosis of cirrhosis but no prior metformin exposure, metformin similarly was associated with reduced mortality.

### Efficacy and safety of the glucagon receptor antagonist PF-06291874: A 12-week, randomized, dose-response study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on background metformin therapy [^111gC7RF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The study aimed to conduct a dose-response assessment of the efficacy and safety of the glucagon receptor antagonist PF-06291874 in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using stable doses of metformin. This randomized, double-blind, statin-stratified, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, parallel-group study was conducted in patients with T2DM who were receiving background metformin. After an 8-week, non-metformin oral antidiabetic agent washout period, 206 patients were randomized to placebo or PF-06291874 (30, 60, or 100 mg once daily) for 12 weeks. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and safety endpoints were assessed at baseline and post-baseline.

Dose-dependent mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c for PF-06291874 ranged from -0.67% (-7.29 mmol/mol) to -0.93% (-10.13 mmol/mol), and for FPG from -16.6 to -33.3 mg/dL after 12 weeks of dosing. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low and was similar between groups receiving PF-06291874 and placebo. Small, non-dose-dependent increases in LDL cholesterol (2 mmHg; diastolic BP > 1 mmHg) were observed with PF-06291874. Modest non-dose-dependent median increases were observed across PF-06291874 groups at 12 weeks for alanine aminotransferase (range, 37.6–48.7 U/L vs. placebo) and aspartate aminotransferase (range, 33.3–36.6 U/L vs. placebo); these were not associated with bilirubin changes. Small increases were observed in body weight (< 0.5 kg) in each PF-06291874 group versus placebo.

In conclusion, in patients with T2DM, PF-06291874 significantly lowered HbA1c.

### Combination therapy using metformin or thiazolidinediones and insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus [^111i1uZD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The biguanide, metformin, sensitizes the liver to the effect of insulin, suppressing hepatic glucose output. Thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone enhance insulin-mediated glucose disposal, leading to reduced plasma insulin concentrations. These classes of drugs may also have varying beneficial effects on features of insulin resistance such as lipid levels, blood pressure, and body weight. Metformin in combination with insulin has been shown to significantly improve blood glucose levels while lowering total daily insulin dose and body weight. The thiazolidinediones in combination with insulin have also been effective in lowering blood glucose levels and total daily insulin dose.

Triple combination therapy using insulin, metformin, and a thiazolidinedione improves glycemic control to a greater degree than dual therapy using insulin and metformin or insulin and a thiazolidinedione. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of metformin or thiazolidinediones in type 1 diabetic patients. Although these agents are largely well tolerated, some subjects experience significant gastrointestinal problems while using metformin. Metformin is associated with a low risk of lactic acidosis but should not be used in patients with elevated serum creatinine or those being treated for congestive heart failure.

The thiazolidinediones are associated with an increase in body weight, although this can be avoided with careful lifestyle management. Thiazolidinediones may also lead to edema and are associated with a low incidence of hepatocellular injury.

### Current treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^114ovbWV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Even though metformin does not play a role in the treatment of NASH outside its classical indication in the treatment of diabetes, promising data have been published regarding positive clinical effects of metformin on prognosis (mortality, hepatic decompensation) and even HCC development. Nonetheless, metformin use in NAFLD ACLD is not recommended outside its clinical indication, although if indicated, its pleiotropic effects on clinical outcomes could be beneficial for the individual patient.

Cirrhotic NAFLD patients should generally be seen at the outpatient clinic at least every six months; however, in case of decompensation, those intervals should be shortened at the clinician's discretion. Apart from treating esophageal varices, patients with NAFLD‐associated ACLD should be classified as either "compensated" or "decompensated" since any hepatic decompensation significantly impairs prognosis in cirrhotic patients. Hepatic decompensation is defined as the first occurrence of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and jaundice.

- **Portal hypertension**: This is the leading driver of hepatic decompensation in cirrhotic patients, including those with NAFLD‐associated ACLD.

Finally, in the case of severe deterioration of liver function (indicated by a MELD ≥ 15 or pronounced hepatic decompensation such as refractory ascites or failure of secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding), the option for liver transplantation should be discussed. The patient should be presented to a tertiary‐care liver transplant center.

### Discordant effects on central obesity, hepatic insulin resistance, and alanine aminotransferase of low-dose metformin and thiazolidinedione combination therapy in patients with impaired glucose tolerance [^1157qRMW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) predicts incident type 2 diabetes (T2DM), possibly reflecting early fatty liver and hepatic insulin resistance. Thiazolidinediones and metformin can improve fatty liver and hepatic insulin resistance, respectively. In the Canadian Normoglycemia Outcome Evaluation trial, rosiglitazone/metformin (Rosi/Met, 4/1000 mg) reduced incident T2DM by 66% in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. For insight on the hepatic effects of this therapy in relation to T2DM, we evaluated the temporal changes in waist, hepatic insulin sensitivity (1/Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance), and ALT in the Rosi/Met (n = 103) and placebo (n = 104) arms over a median of 3.9 years.

Waist measurements did not differ between the arms. Hepatic insulin sensitivity improved in the Rosi/Met arm in year 1, but deteriorated thereafter, similar to the placebo arm. In contrast, Rosi/Met lowered ALT in year 1 and maintained this effect throughout the trial. Thus, low-dose Rosi/Met had no effect on central obesity, a transient effect on hepatic insulin sensitivity, and a sustained effect on ALT.

### Dual metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy reduces mortality and hepatic complications in cirrhotic patients with diabetes mellitus [^117SPQA5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) can accelerate the progression of cirrhosis. The potential for oral diabetes medications to counteract the mortality and morbidity of chronic liver diseases is unclear. We compared the effectiveness of dual metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) versus metformin treatment alone in reducing mortality and hepatic complications in cirrhotic patients with T2DM. Propensity score-matched cohorts of T2DM and cirrhosis patients treated with metformin or dual metformin and GLP1-RA therapy were evaluated. Data were obtained from the TriNetX Research Network. The outcomes were all-cause mortality, composite risk of hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Compared to patients on metformin alone, dual metformin and GLP1-RA therapy users had a lower risk for both death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–0.89; P = 0.011) and hepatic decompensation (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46–0.93; P = 0.02) over 5 years. Patients on dual therapy also had a lower risk for HCC (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26–0.74; P = 0.001) compared to mono-metformin therapy patients.

In our multicenter retrospective study, dual therapy was associated with better mortality and morbidity outcomes in cirrhosis patients with T2DM compared to those on metformin alone.

### Diabetes medications and risk of HCC [^114eRMt1]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Metformin was first identified as a potential hepatoprotective medication in 2005 when it was shown to reduce the risk of cancer in patients with diabetes. Since that time, several studies have demonstrated its potential preventative role against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. For example, a meta-analysis by Zhang et al. including three cohort studies and four case-control studies with more than 16,000 diabetic subjects showed that metformin treatment was associated with a 76% reduced risk of HCC (relative risk [RR] 0.24, 95% CI 0.13–0.46, p < 0.001). Importantly, the protective effect of metformin remained significant after adjusting for other risk factors such as the etiology of liver disease.

In the same year, another meta-analysis by Singh et al. showed similar results, with an overall 50% reduced risk of incident HCC among metformin-treated patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.50, 95% CI 0.34–0.73, p < 0.05). Consistent with Zhang et al.'s results, when restricting the analysis to studies that adjusted for the effect of other anti-diabetic medications, the chemo-preventive effect of metformin was still significant and relevant (aOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.75–0.83, p < 0.05). Likewise, in a subgroup analysis of studies that adjusted for the duration and/or severity of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the chemo-preventive effect of metformin still persisted.

These findings were recently confirmed in a study showing that metformin use was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HCC in T2DM (odds ratio [OR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.51–0.68, p < 0.001). Additionally, this study indicated that metformin use was associated with a decreased risk of HCC, providing further evidence of its potential benefits in diabetic patients.

- **Decreased level of consciousness**:

These conditions indicate a heightened need for timely intervention to manage the toxicity effectively.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: A serious complication of a common drug [^113RhPGz]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication of metformin use. It typically occurs in patients who are diabetic and also have other risk factors for lactic acidosis, including kidney and liver conditions, malignancy, or use of certain medications. We report a case of MALA in a man in his 70s with diabetes who presented with gradually worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, including severe abdominal pain and nausea.

He reported these symptoms in the setting of metformin use with an acute kidney injury (AKI), likely brought on by poor oral intake and excessive antibiotic use for a urinary tract infection. He was promptly started on intravenous fluids with a bicarbonate drip to concurrently treat his prerenal AKI and lactic acidosis, which resulted in rapid resolution of his symptoms. Renal function normalized within 12 days of admission. Since diabetic patients commonly use metformin and are also at higher risk of renal dysfunction, this case highlights the vulnerability of this group of patients and the need for increased knowledge and awareness of MALA.

### Management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)-An expert consensus statement from Indian diabetologists' perspective [^114MDXt5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological interventions**: The drugs used in the management of MASLD, albeit with no substantial supportive evidence for continued use, include vitamin E, ursodeoxycholic acid, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, silymarin, and orlistat. A farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, obeticholic acid, has some evidence to modulate bile acid synthesis and improve insulin sensitivity, thus reducing hepatic steatosis.

	- Several off-label medications such as metformin, GLP-1 RA, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, vitamin E, pioglitazone, and ezetimibe have been used with suggestions of some benefits. None of the existing antihyperglycemic agents have proven direct hepatic benefits in MASLD. However, GLP-1 RA, pioglitazone, SGLT2 inhibitors, and metformin are preferred for treating hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM and MASLD as they might have additional hepatic benefits. Insulin therapy is recommended for patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

	- Promising agents that provide direct hepatic benefits include resmetirom. Resmetirom has demonstrated improvement in hepatic fibrosis and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of NASH with fibrosis. Unlike other treatments, resmetirom does not target insulin resistance. As a partial agonist of THR-β, resmetirom promotes lipophagy and hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation, thereby reducing liver fat. However, resmetirom is currently unavailable in India and poses a substantial economic burden.

### Treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with metformin versus lifestyle intervention in insulin-resistant adolescents [^112bQDPW]. Pediatric Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of fatty liver per ultrasound and liver-associated enzymes was measured in a selected cohort of youth with both obesity and insulin resistance, and the effect of metformin on these parameters was evaluated. Fifty obese, multiethnic, insulin-resistant adolescents (mean age 15.1 years, mean body mass index 39.8 kg/m²) were randomized to receive lifestyle recommendations plus either twice per day doses of 850 mg of metformin or a placebo. Fasting and post-glucose challenge biochemistries and liver ultrasounds were compared at baseline and 6 months.

The prevalence of fatty liver was 74%, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 14%, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 14%, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 17%. Fatty liver was mild in 23%, moderate in 31%, and severe in 46%. Fatty liver was more common in male and Hispanic subjects, and elevated ALT was more common in Hispanic subjects. Subjects with fatty liver appeared more insulin-resistant (higher fasting insulin and triglycerides, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and had higher ALT and AST levels.

At 6 months, mean ALT, GGT, and fasting insulin levels improved significantly in all subjects. Fatty liver prevalence (p < 0.04), severity (p < 0.04), and fasting insulin (p < 0.025) improved significantly with metformin compared to placebo. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs with high prevalence and severity in obese, insulin-resistant adolescents. While metformin plus lifestyle intervention appears promising, defining NAFLD therapies capable of preventing fibrosis and cirrhosis requires further study.

### Riomet [^116thJnx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis: There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate to pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, increasing lactate blood levels, which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Riomet. In Riomet-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Riomet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

### Type 2 diabetes and metformin use associate with outcomes of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related, Child-Pugh A cirrhosis [^114XChLg]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Factors that affect the outcomes of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis are unclear. We studied associations of type 2 diabetes, levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and the use of antidiabetic medications with survival and liver-related events in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.

We collected data from 299 patients with biopsy-proven NASH and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis from tertiary hospitals in Spain, Australia, Hong Kong, and Cuba, from April 1995 through December 2016. We obtained information on the presence of type 2 diabetes, level of HbA1c, and use of antidiabetic medications. Cox proportional and competing risk models were used to estimate and compare rates of transplant-free survival, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

A total of 212 patients had type 2 diabetes at baseline, and 8 of 87 patients developed diabetes during a median follow-up time of 5.1 years (range, 0.5–10.0 years). A lower proportion of patients with diabetes survived the entire follow-up period (38%) than patients without diabetes (81%) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 4.23; 95% CI, 1.93–9.29). Higher proportions of patients with diabetes also had hepatic decompensation (51% vs 26% of patients without diabetes; aHR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.005–4.11) and HCC (25% vs 7% of patients without diabetes; aHR, 5.42; 95% CI, 1.74–16.80). Averaged annual HbA1c levels over time were not associated with outcomes. Metformin use over time was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death or liver transplantation (aHR, 0.

### Clinical outcomes with metformin use in diabetic patients with compensated cirrhosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ruWAL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect of metformin in patients with cirrhosis, though no improvement in liver histology has been observed.

- **Aim**: To investigate the impact of metformin on mortality and hepatic decompensation in people with diabetes with compensated cirrhosis.

- **Methods**: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to February 2023 for studies reporting results regarding the impact of metformin on all-cause mortality and hepatic decompensation in people with diabetes with compensated cirrhosis. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I Cochrane tool. R software 4.3.1 was used for all analyses.

- **Results**: Six observational studies were included in the final analysis. Metformin use was associated with reduced all-cause mortality or liver transplantation [hazard ratio (HR): 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37–0.82], while no benefit was shown in the prevention of hepatic decompensation (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.77–1.22). In the subgroup analysis, metformin use was associated with reduced all-cause mortality or liver transplantation (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.38–0.65) in patients with metabolic-associated steatohepatitis cirrhosis, while two studies reported no survival benefit in patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C (HR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.12–1.20).

- **Conclusion**: Metformin use is associated with reduced all-cause mortality, but not with the prevention of hepatic decompensation in people with diabetes with compensated cirrhosis. The mortality benefit is most likely driven by better diabetes and cardiovascular health control.

### Pharmacokinetics of metformin in patients with gastrointestinal intolerance [^117RwbJP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess potential causes of metformin intolerance, including altered metformin uptake from the intestine, increased anaerobic glucose utilization and subsequent lactate production, altered serotonin uptake, and altered bile acid pool.

For this pharmacokinetic study, we recruited 10 severely intolerant and 10 tolerant individuals, matched for age, sex, and body mass index. A single 500 mg dose of metformin was administered, with blood sampling at 12 time points over 24 hours. Blood samples were analyzed for metformin, lactate, serotonin, and bile acid concentrations, and compared across the phenotypes.

The results showed that the intolerant individuals were severely intolerant to 500 mg metformin. No significant difference was identified between tolerant and intolerant cohorts in metformin pharmacokinetics: median (interquartile range [IQR]) peak concentration 2.1 (1.7–2.3) mg/L and 2.0 (1.8–2.2) mg/L, respectively (P = 0.76); time to peak concentration was 2.5 hours; median (IQR) area under the curve (AUC) 0–24 was 16.9 (13.9–18.6) and 13.9 (12.9–16.8) mg/L*h, respectively (P = 0.72). Lactate concentration peaked at 3.5 hours, with a mean peak concentration of 2.4 mmol/L in both cohorts (95% CI 2.0–2.8 and 1.8–3.0 mmol/L, respectively), and similar incremental AUC 0–24 in each cohort: tolerant cohort 6.98 (95% CI 3.03–10.93) and intolerant cohort 4.47 (95% CI -3.12–12.06) mmol/L*h (P = 0.55). Neither serotonin nor bile acid concentrations were significantly different.

In conclusion, despite evidence of severe intolerance in our cohort, there was no significant difference in metformin…

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: A systematic review of case reports and case series [^114ASKk6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There were several interesting but unexpected findings in this study. First, a higher peak level of serum creatinine was associated with favorable survival. Indeed, apparent renal failure may help clinicians generate a high index of suspicion for MALA with appropriate evaluation, resulting in earlier diagnosis and expedient delivery of RRT. On the other hand, patients with a higher serum creatinine level at the initial presentation may also have a relatively indolent disease course rather than an acute episode of fulminant metabolic acidosis and circulatory collapse. However, our data was not sufficient to determine whether the timing of RRT was early or late as it is difficult, if not impossible, to define the onset of MALA. Second, female patients had better survival than male patients. Although it is likely that the efficiency of RRT may be better among female patients due to smaller body size, the information on body mass index (BMI) was rarely available in the published reports. Future prospective research is warranted to clarify the sex difference or the effect of BMI.

- **Limitations**: Although the comprehensive nature of this systematic review can be interpreted as a strength, several limitations deserve particular mention in the work. Publication bias is a critical concern in this study as severe cases with unexpected favorable outcomes may be more likely reported by clinicians and accepted by medical journals. We compared the mortality rate of selected MALA patients between 1995 and 2010 with those from a pharmacovigilance database covering the same time span.

### Metformin-induced hepatotoxicity [^114vvBUr]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Six weeks after discharge, the patient again developed malaise, nausea, and jaundice 24 hours after deciding on his own to take a dose of 850 mg of metformin. Laboratory tests showed total bilirubin 4.8 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 3.8 mg/dL, AST 237 units/L, ALT 764 units/L, GGT 3,318 units/L, and ALP 622 units/L. Continued laboratory tests showed progressive improvement, reaching normal values in four weeks. He has since been treated with gliclazide-modified release (60 mg/day) and remains asymptomatic with good metabolic control (HbA1c 6.8%).

The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity remains difficult due to the lack of reliable markers for use in general clinical practice. In our patient, the exclusion of other diagnostic alternatives, the temporal sequence with positive unintentional rechallenge, and the absence of other drugs all convincingly support the diagnosis of metformin-induced liver damage.

- **Diagnostic process**: Clinical scales may add consistency to the diagnostic process by translating the suspicion of hepatotoxicity into a quantitative score. The CIOMS/RUCAM (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences/Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method) instrument is currently considered the best method for assessing causality in drug-induced hepatotoxicity. It states the following rates: ≤ 1 relationship excluded, 1–2 unlikely, 3–5 possible, 6–8 probable, > 8 highly probable. Our patient scored 13 points, which indicates a certain or very likely diagnosis of metformin-induced liver toxicity.

Metformin is not considered intrinsically hepatotoxic. In fact, metformin may be beneficial in preventing liver damage under certain conditions.

### SPL drug information for metformin hydrochloride [^114yv39Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

There is a boxed warning regarding the use of metformin PO (also known as Riomet) and the risk of lactic acidosis. Exercise extreme caution in patients with renal impairment, those using certain drugs (such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like topiramate), individuals aged 65 years or older, and those undergoing radiological evaluations with contrast, surgery, or other procedures. It is also important to consider patients in hypoxic states (such as acute congestive heart failure), those with excessive alcohol intake, and individuals with hepatic impairment. Assess the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before initiating metformin therapy and monitor it annually, or more frequently, in patients at risk of renal impairment.

### Should restrictions be relaxed for metformin use in chronic kidney disease? No, we should never again compromise safety [^111efm94]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin has been considered first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes for over a quarter of a century. Like other biguanides, metformin can cause lactic acidosis, which is exceptionally rare but fatal. The likelihood of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is substantially higher in patients with kidney impairment and also among those with seemingly normal kidney function who are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Hence, regulatory agencies in many industrialized nations have maintained strict renal restrictions surrounding metformin use.

However, there have been millions of people exposed to metformin for many years, many of whom have serum creatinine values at or close to 1.5 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) much below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², who have not developed lactic acidosis. Thus, controversy remains in this area, and there has been heightened pressure to remove renal restrictions for metformin use.

To provide a discussion on the pros and cons of relaxing the renal restrictions for metformin use, we present a Point-Counterpoint.

- **Point narrative**: Drs. Kalantar-Zadeh and Kovesdy argue that although there is little evidence of the potential benefits of metformin in kidney disease, considering the sheer number of metformin users and the high fatality rate of its associated lactic acidosis, the most appropriate practice is to avoid metformin use in people with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or in those who are at high risk of AKI irrespective of underlying eGFR.

### Metformin-induced cholangiohepatitis [^113Zce25]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced cholangiohepatitis accounts for 20–50% of non-viral chronic hepatitis cases. Metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral anti-diabetic drug from the biguanide class, used in the treatment of overweight and obese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Metformin-induced cholangiohepatitis, with marked elevations in serum liver transaminases and intrahepatic cholestasis, has been infrequently reported. Here, we report a case of acute cholangiohepatitis after the initiation of metformin treatment.

### Risk of acute kidney injury and survival in patients treated with metformin: an observational cohort study [^111jrJbt]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

While the renal safety of metformin is important in its own right, we were also motivated to analyze acute kidney injury (AKI) rates as a proxy for lactic acidosis. It is difficult to ascertain the true incidence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). Observational studies may either overestimate or underestimate the incidence of MALA. Most cases of MALA are multifactorial, with other contributing factors such as sepsis, cardiac, respiratory, or hepatic failure. Studies can be subject to ascertainment bias, with fitter patients being selected for treatment with metformin. In addition, patients on metformin are more likely to have lactate levels measured, leading to the potential overestimation of MALA.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding in isolation cannot be used in observational studies to establish cases of MALA due to a lack of specific code for lactic acidosis. Many studies have not included patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is therefore difficult to establish the safety of metformin in patients with CKD. We examined hospitalizations with AKI in patients treated with metformin, as clinically significant lactic acidosis occurs in the presence of AKI. While we cannot draw conclusions regarding the rates of MALA in patients with CKD, we have shown that metformin use does not adversely affect mortality, which is reassuring. This is arguably more clinically significant than the actual rates of MALA.

### Continuous use of metformin in patients receiving contrast medium: What is the evidence? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FUBrM]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Substantial inconsistencies exist in guidelines regarding recommendations for metformin usage with the administration of a contrast medium. This meta-analysis aimed to determine whether the risks of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) and lactic acidosis increase with metformin use in diabetic patients receiving a contrast medium.

Studies were retrieved from databases from inception to May 15, 2021. Studies comparing the outcomes of using metformin with not using metformin during contrast medium administration were included. The primary outcomes were the incidence of CI-AKI and lactic acidosis. The secondary outcomes were renal function changes from baseline. Data analysis used risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes.

Analyses of two randomized controlled trials and four retrospective cohorts examining a total of 1,459 patients revealed no significant differences in the incidence of CI-AKI (RR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.63) and in changes in renal function measurements (serum creatinine: MD = 0.00 mg/dL, 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.05; estimated glomerular filtration rate: MD = 0.22, 95% CI, -2.47 to 2.91) after contrast medium administration between patients using and not using metformin.

There is no evidence that continuing metformin during contrast medium administration is associated with a higher risk of CI-AKI, lactic acidosis, or renal function deterioration compared to patients who discontinued metformin or who were not using it.

### The criteria for metformin-associated lactic acidosis: The quality of reporting in a large pharmacovigilance database [^113ygZ7t]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The study aims to analyze the quality of pharmacovigilance reporting in cases of 'metformin-associated lactic acidosis' and evaluate whether the criteria for this condition are met.

- **Methods**: We searched for cases meeting the criteria for metformin-associated lactic acidosis [arterial pH < 7.35, lactate > 5 mmol/l (45 mg/dl), and detectable plasma metformin concentration] over a 15-year period (1995–2010) in a pharmacovigilance database of the license holder for metformin (Merck Serono, Lyon, France).

- **Results**: We found 869 reports labeled as 'metformin-associated lactic acidosis' from 32 countries. The criteria for pH, lactate concentration, and metformin concentration were met in 51.2%, 53.3%, and 13.9% of cases, respectively. All three criteria were met in only 10.4% of cases. The percentages for each criterion remained relatively stable throughout the study period.

- **Conclusions**: The role of metformin in triggering metformin-associated lactic acidosis was incorrectly assessed in most patients, and the quality of reporting did not improve over time.

### The effect of metformin and standard therapy versus standard therapy alone in nondiabetic patients with insulin resistance and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): A pilot trial [^112d5m2W]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing in prevalence and is related to underlying insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of metformin on the characteristic histopathologic lesions of NASH. This was a 12-month prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing diet and exercise alone to diet, exercise, and metformin in nondiabetic patients with insulin resistance and NASH.

Patients were randomized to either group A or B.

- **Group A**: Received placebo, dietary counseling, and recommendations for weight loss and exercise four times per week.

- **Group B**: Received long-acting metformin 500 mg daily (titrated to 1000 mg daily) plus dietary counseling, and recommendations for weight loss and exercise four times per week.

Histopathology was assessed at 12 months, and biopsies were scored by two pathologists who were blinded to all data. Twenty-three subjects were screened, and 19 were randomized to either group A (n = 10) or group B (n = 9). Seven of the 10 subjects in group A completed the study, including repeat liver biopsy, while all patients in group B completed the study.

Body mass index improved in both groups, decreasing by 1.7 kg/m² in group A and 0.9 kg/m² in group B (not significant, control versus treatment). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance scores improved in both groups, decreasing by 1.14 in group A and 1.58 in group B (not significant, control versus treatment). No significant difference in histopathology was seen between groups on follow-up liver biopsy. Metformin appeared to have little effect in improvement in liver function.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis in patients with renal impairment solely due to drug accumulation [^1124NBJk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

We suspect that the life-threatening complication of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, solely due to drug accumulation following renal impairment, occurs more frequently than previously reported and is not necessarily associated with other predisposing factors for lactic acidosis.

- **Methods**: During a period of 13 months at a tertiary referral centre, the incidence of lactic acidosis of any etiology was 12.8% (67 of 524 total intensive care unit [ICU] admissions). Metformin-associated lactic acidosis, solely as the result of drug accumulation, was diagnosed in 6% of all patients suffering from lactic acidosis (4 of 67 patients).

- **Results**: These patients presented with severe circulatory shock due to lactic acidosis. We could not identify any predisposing factor for lactic acidosis other than renal impairment. Deterioration of diabetic nephropathy was suspected to be responsible for the accumulation of metformin followed by lactic acidosis, ultimately resulting in multiorgan failure. The diagnosis was supported by extensively elevated serum levels of metformin. Two patients died during ICU treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Our data indicate that the incidence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis solely due to metformin accumulation is possible and underestimated. Symptoms of metformin-associated lactic acidosis are non-specific, and physicians should be aware that metformin, if prescribed to patients with renal impairment, can cause fatal lactic acidosis due to drug accumulation.

### Metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease stages 3a, 3b, or 4 [^115vEH4a]. Diabetes Care (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the use of metformin PO (also known as Riomet) in patients with eGFR 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m²:

- **Avoid use**: Metformin should not be used without consideration of renal function, given the risk of lactic acidosis.

- **Monitor renal function**: Regular monitoring of renal function is imperative to ensure patient safety. It is particularly important to assess the risk of continuing therapy in patients who were initiated on metformin at higher eGFR rates.

- **Dosing considerations**: In some cases, starting metformin at 500 mg once daily, then titrating to 500 mg twice daily if well-tolerated, may be considered. This should be done with close monitoring of renal function. Treatment at a decreased dosage may be maintained for ongoing management, increasing up to a maximum of 500 mg twice daily with careful monitoring.

- **Imaging considerations**: Discontinue metformin before iodinated contrast imaging to mitigate any associated risks.

### Metformin — the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us [^117H2PAq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with a substantial risk for hypoglycemia, and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal.

T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to co-administer with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycemic control, safety, tolerability, and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy, such as effects on body weight, lipids, or blood pressure. In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### Janumet XR [^113DPxQv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Lactic acidosis**: There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with the immediate discontinuation of Janumet XR. In Janumet XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in the reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis, and if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Janumet XR and report these symptoms to their health care provider.

### Should metformin be our antiglycemic agent of choice post-transplantation [^114TkvVw]. American Journal of Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

New onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a major complication associated with solid-organ transplantation, sharing many similarities with type 2 diabetes mellitus. While metformin is recommended as the antiglycemic agent of choice in the general population, guidelines post-transplantation do not endorse metformin with equal importance and promote meglitinides as the agents of choice. Concerns with tolerability and safety of metformin in the complex polypharmacy of transplant recipients are likely causative factors for reluctant prescription among clinicians. However, such practice denies recipients a wide array of benefits attributed to metformin use in the general population. These include attenuation of abnormal glucose metabolism, weight neutrality, improvement in pathophysiological components of the metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, subclinical inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]), lipid-lowering properties, cardiovascular protection, and antineoplastic potential. Whether such benefits translate from the general population to our high-risk recipients requires further investigation. By discussing the evidence of the risk/benefit ratio of metformin, the aim of this article is to promote the safe use of metformin as the first-line antiglycemic agent in the context of solid-organ transplantation for a host of indications that require clinical validation with appropriately designed trials.

### Changes in liver tests during 1-year treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with pioglitazone, metformin or gliclazide [^113Nd1Yv]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of liver damage. Therefore, it is of particular importance to investigate the hepatic effects of drugs used to treat such patients.

- **Methods**: Liver testing results performed in four 1-year, randomized, double-blind studies comparing the effects of pioglitazone, metformin, or a sulphonylurea, gliclazide, in the treatment of over 3,700 patients with Type 2 diabetes have been analyzed.

- **Results**: Pioglitazone caused reductions in mean levels of hepatic enzymes of between 3% and 18%, while gliclazide caused small increases of between 3% and 13%. Metformin treatment showed either small mean increases or decreases. More patients receiving pioglitazone had liver tests within the normal range at the end of treatment (≥ 87%) compared with patients receiving metformin (≥ 80%) or gliclazide (≥ 75%). Slightly fewer patients with pioglitazone than with comparators showed a large increase (> 3 times the upper limit of normal) in alanine aminotransferase levels at any time during treatment (pioglitazone 0.9%, metformin 1.9%, gliclazide 1.9%).

- **Conclusions**: During pioglitazone treatment, there is a reduction in liver enzyme levels. Although the mechanism of this effect is not clear, the results demonstrate potential beneficial effects on the liver during treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes with pioglitazone.

Regarding the use of metformin PO (also known as Riomet) in patients with eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m², the following guidelines should be followed:

- **Use acceptable**: Metformin can be safely used.
- **No dose adjustment required**: Standard dosing is appropriate.
- **Monitor renal function**: Regular monitoring is recommended to ensure kidney function remains stable.
- **Monitor for lactic acidosis**: Vigilance for signs of lactic acidosis is imperative.
- **Discontinue before iodinated contrast imaging in patients with an eGFR 45–60 mL/min/1.73 m²**: It is advised to discontinue metformin prior to procedures involving iodinated contrast to prevent complications.

### Zituvimet [^114LCqmC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of Zituvimet in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed.

- **Sitagliptin**: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), the mean AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score > 9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

- **Metformin**: No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.

- **Effects of age, body mass index (BMI), gender, and race on sitagliptin**: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin.
