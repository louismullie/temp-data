## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a 62-year-old woman with persistent acid reflux despite omeprazole 40 mg daily. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming optimized PPI use and whether the current regimen is adequate. Then, I should verify whether alternative or overlapping conditions could explain persistent symptoms. Next, I will plan for endoscopic evaluation off therapy, followed by appropriate reflux monitoring on or off therapy based on prior proof of GERD. Finally, I will tailor treatment by phenotype, integrate lifestyle measures, and reassess the need for long-term PPI, including deprescribing strategies when appropriate [^116Mt8UF] [^1128iSbs] [^116KAQJJ] [^114wiYDb].

> Let me first confirm the basics before labeling this as refractory GERD. I should verify adherence and timing, ensuring omeprazole is taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, because suboptimal timing is a common cause of apparent PPI failure, and the initial step per ACG 2022 is to optimize PPI therapy with an adequate 8-week trial before escalation or further testing [^1128iSbs] [^116Mt8UF]. Wait, I need to check whether once-daily dosing is sufficient here; if symptoms persist, moving to twice-daily dosing or switching to a different PPI with less CYP2C19 variability can improve acid control, and small physiologic studies suggest differences in acid suppression across PPIs and doses, although clinical differences are modest overall [^114Z42NL] [^112VnoWV]. I should confirm an 8-week optimized regimen response before proceeding [^1128iSbs].

> Hold on, I should verify if more potent acid suppression is appropriate in selected cases. For proven erosive esophagitis that remains active on standard PPIs, potassium-competitive acid blockers such as vonoprazan can achieve very high pH control rates even in PPI-resistant erosive esophagitis, with day 14 pH > 4 time exceeding 90% in randomized data, though this is typically reserved for objectively confirmed acid-driven disease rather than empiric use in unproven GERD [^115RREwk]. Let me consider this only after objective confirmation of ongoing reflux despite optimized PPI therapy [^113sioh5].

> Next, I need to ensure we are not missing alternative or overlapping diagnoses, because a substantial proportion of persistent symptoms on PPIs are functional heartburn, reflux hypersensitivity, eosinophilic esophagitis, dyspepsia, or motility disorders rather than ongoing acid injury. I should double-check symptom phenotype, the presence of alarm features, and any extraesophageal complaints, with a low threshold to explore non-GERD explanations when atypical symptoms predominate, as recommended by ACG and supported by contemporary reviews [^111Kaa27] [^113ZxQtP] [^112VnoWV]. But wait, let me not jump to conclusions; targeted evaluation will follow endoscopy and physiologic testing where indicated [^1128iSbs].

> I will now examine the role of endoscopy and the timing relative to acid suppression. I should confirm that in refractory cases, upper GI endoscopy should be performed after discontinuing PPI 2–4 weeks to improve diagnostic yield and allow biopsies even if the mucosa looks normal, because healing on PPIs can mask esophagitis and missing EoE would be a pitfall; Lyon 2.0 and ACG 2022 both support this approach [^116KAQJJ] [^116P5qro]. Let me verify there are no alarm symptoms; if present, I would expedite endoscopy irrespective of PPI timing, but for typical refractory symptoms without alarms, the 2–4 week PPI washout is preferred to phenotype accurately [^116KAQJJ] [^116P5qro].

> I need to ensure reflux monitoring is chosen and timed correctly. If GERD has never been objectively established, pH monitoring off PPI is recommended to document pathologic reflux, whereas if GERD is already proven and symptoms persist on optimized twice-daily PPI, impedance-pH monitoring on therapy helps distinguish ongoing reflux from hypersensitivity or functional heartburn; ACG 2022 is explicit on these branches, and on-therapy impedance-pH cutoffs such as AET ≥ 1.7% and elevated reflux counts can identify suboptimal suppression [^114wiYDb] [^113sioh5] [^113Kvi5S]. Wait, let me double-check the value of impedance for non-acid reflux; combined MII-pH detects weakly acidic or non-acid reflux linked to symptoms, which standard pH alone would miss, and multicenter data show a meaningful share of persistent symptoms on BID PPI are associated with non-acid reflux events [^112FLuc4] [^1155PMTK].

> I should confirm when esophageal manometry is necessary. If endoscopy and reflux monitoring are unrevealing, or if antireflux surgery is being considered, high-resolution manometry is recommended to assess for disorders such as achalasia or ineffective motility that would alter management and predict surgical outcomes, per ACG 2022 [^115gxqKW] [^111DRQpx]. Hold on, I should verify that manometry also helps localize the LES and improve sensor placement for reflux studies when needed, which strengthens test accuracy [^111DRQpx].

> Now, let me tailor management by phenotype for clarity. If testing demonstrates true refractory GERD with ongoing acid or weakly acidic reflux despite optimized PPIs, I can escalate suppression, consider a bedtime H2 receptor antagonist short-term for nocturnal symptoms recognizing rapid tachyphylaxis, add alginate for postprandial symptoms, and consider baclofen to reduce transient LES relaxations only when there is objective GERD due to side effects; for appropriate surgical candidates with documented abnormal reflux and suitable motility, laparoscopic fundoplication, magnetic sphincter augmentation, or TIF may be offered per ACG 2022 and contemporary reviews [^112391ca] [^117MHSEa] [^113Cts9c] [^112VnoWV]. Wait, I almost overemphasized bedtime H2RA as a durable strategy; I should note its limited utility due to tachyphylaxis within weeks and avoid positioning it as long-term monotherapy for healing [^112391ca] [^117MHSEa].

> If reflux hypersensitivity is identified with normal acid exposure but positive symptom-reflux association, I should avoid further acid escalation and instead use neuromodulators such as low-dose tricyclics or SSRIs, and consider behavioral therapies like CBT or hypnotherapy, maintaining PPIs at the lowest effective dose if any partial benefit exists, as outlined in expert reviews and consensus statements [^1147SEGY] [^112VnoWV] [^113ZxQtP]. Let me reconsider if symptoms are predominantly central or anxiety-driven; in that case, psychological support becomes even more central to outcomes [^113ZxQtP].

> If functional heartburn is diagnosed with normal acid exposure and negative symptom association, I should deprescribe PPIs and pivot to neuromodulation and reassurance, reserving on-demand therapy for intermittent symptoms, consistent with ACG 2022 recommendations to attempt discontinuation when there is no objective GERD and symptoms have resolved on therapy [^115m73YH] [^1169NbAF]. I should double-check that off-therapy reflux testing is negative before stepping off PPIs in persistent cases, in line with guidance to discontinue PPIs when off-therapy testing is negative [^113b6VwP].

> If an alternative diagnosis emerges, I need to treat that specific condition. For eosinophilic esophagitis, topical steroids or dietary therapy follow biopsy confirmation; for peptic stricture, endoscopic dilation with ongoing acid suppression is typical; and for suspected gastroparesis, I should confirm objectively before starting prokinetics, given ACG 2022 advises against prokinetics without documented delayed emptying [^116KAQJJ] [^117MHSEa]. Wait, let me verify dysphagia or impaction history carefully to avoid missing EoE, since biopsies can be normal-appearing endoscopically [^116KAQJJ].

> Parallel to all of this, I need to ensure foundational lifestyle and behavioral measures are in place. Weight loss when overweight, avoidance of late meals, head-of-bed elevation, and attention to trigger foods and alcohol can meaningfully reduce reflux burden and improve outcomes, with supportive data summarized in modern reviews and guidelines on GERD management and phenotypes [^113ZxQtP]. But wait, what if night symptoms predominate; left lateral decubitus and head elevation can be emphasized as low-risk adjuncts [^113ZxQtP].

> Finally, I should reassess longitudinally and consider deprescribing strategies where appropriate. I will titrate PPIs to the lowest effective dose for maintenance, consider step-down from BID to once daily when possible, and in patients without objective GERD consider on-demand therapy or cessation; prolonged wireless pH monitoring off PPI can help identify candidates who can successfully discontinue PPIs, and AGA deprescribing guidance supports either tapered or abrupt discontinuation with bleeding risk assessment prior to stopping [^114tSiyw] [^1169hHEv] [^111KLgrL] [^116LzEir] [^113b6VwP].

> Putting this together for this 62-year-old, I should confirm she is taking omeprazole 40 mg 30–60 minutes before breakfast, then optimize to twice-daily dosing or switch to a different PPI for 8 weeks and reassess symptoms before labeling as refractory. If symptoms persist, I will stop PPIs for 2–4 weeks and perform endoscopy with biopsies; subsequent physiologic testing will be guided by whether GERD is already proven, using off-therapy pH monitoring if unproven or on-therapy impedance-pH if proven and symptomatic on BID PPIs. From there, I will manage according to the resulting phenotype, reserve escalation or antireflux procedures for objectively documented reflux, and integrate lifestyle measures and deprescribing principles to minimize unnecessary long-term PPI exposure [^116Mt8UF] [^116KAQJJ] [^113sioh5] [^114wiYDb] [^113Cts9c].

---

For a 62-year-old woman with GERD and persistent reflux despite omeprazole 40 mg daily, first confirm adherence and timing (take 30–60 minutes before breakfast), then optimize PPI therapy — escalate to 40 mg twice daily if needed [^1128iSbs] [^112VnoWV]. If symptoms persist, perform upper endoscopy after withholding PPIs for 2–4 weeks [^116KAQJJ] [^116P5qro], with biopsies to assess for esophagitis, Barrett's, or eosinophilic esophagitis. If endoscopy is normal or non-diagnostic, obtain esophageal pH-impedance monitoring on PPIs to distinguish acid, non-acid reflux, or functional heartburn [^113sioh5]. Management is then tailored: add a bedtime H2RA or alginates for residual acid reflux [^112VnoWV]; consider baclofen for non-acid reflux [^1147SEGY] [^112FLuc4]; use neuromodulators for functional heartburn [^111NMd8u]; and refer for antireflux surgery or TIF if objective reflux persists despite optimized medical therapy [^113Cts9c] [^112VnoWV]. Lifestyle measures (weight loss, head-of-bed elevation, avoiding late meals) should be reinforced throughout [^113ZxQtP].

---

## Step 1: confirm adherence and optimize PPI therapy

- **Adherence and timing**: Confirm the patient is taking omeprazole 40 mg daily, 30–60 minutes before breakfast; incorrect timing reduces efficacy [^113erHfr].

- **Dose escalation**: If adherence and timing are correct, increase omeprazole to 40 mg twice daily (before breakfast and dinner) [^1128iSbs] [^111eB26M].

- **Alternative PPIs**: If twice-daily omeprazole is ineffective, consider switching to another PPI (e.g. esomeprazole, rabeprazole) due to interpatient variability [^114Z42NL] [^111eB26M].

---

## Step 2: lifestyle modifications

- **Weight loss**: Encourage weight loss if overweight or obese [^113ZxQtP].

- **Head-of-bed elevation**: Elevate the head of the bed by 6–8 inches.

- **Meal timing**: Avoid late meals and large meals [^113ZxQtP].

- **Trigger avoidance**: Avoid dietary triggers (e.g. caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods).

---

## Step 3: diagnostic evaluation

If symptoms persist despite optimized PPI therapy and lifestyle measures, proceed with diagnostic testing:

| **Diagnostic test** | **Indication** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Upper endoscopy with biopsies | - Persistent symptoms <br/> - Alarm symptoms <br/> - Suspected complications (Barrett's, eosinophilic esophagitis) | Off PPIs for 2–4 weeks [^116KAQJJ] [^116P5qro] |
| Esophageal pH-impedance monitoring | - Persistent symptoms despite optimized PPI therapy <br/> - Differentiate acid vs non-acid reflux, functional heartburn | On PPIs [^113sioh5] [^117M4PNS] |
| Esophageal manometry | - Normal endoscopy and pH monitoring <br/> - Evaluate motility disorders <br/> - Pre-surgical assessment | As indicated [^111DRQpx] [^115gxqKW] |

## Step 4: tailored management based on diagnostic findings

### Acid reflux confirmed on pH monitoring

When acid reflux is confirmed on pH monitoring, add a bedtime **H2RA** (e.g. famotidine) to twice-daily PPI for nocturnal acid breakthrough [^111eB26M]. Consider **antireflux surgery** — such as laparoscopic fundoplication or magnetic sphincter augmentation — if symptoms persist despite medical therapy [^113Cts9c].

---

### Non-acid reflux confirmed on impedance monitoring

When non-acid reflux is confirmed on impedance monitoring, consider **baclofen** 5–10 mg three times daily to reduce transient LES relaxations [^1147SEGY], and use **alginate therapy** with alginate-containing antacids to reduce non-acid reflux episodes.

---

### Functional heartburn (normal acid exposure, negative symptom association)

For functional heartburn (normal acid exposure, negative symptom association), consider **neuromodulators** such as low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. nortriptyline 10–25 mg nightly) or SSRIs/SNRIs [^111NMd8u], and **CBT** may improve symptoms and quality of life.

---

## Step 5: consider advanced therapies

If symptoms persist despite optimized medical therapy and diagnostic evaluation, consider **antireflux surgery** — laparoscopic fundoplication or magnetic sphincter augmentation — for documented reflux [^113Cts9c] and **endoscopic therapies** such as transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) or radiofrequency ablation (Stretta) in selected patients [^112VnoWV].

---

## Step 6: follow-up and monitoring

Ensure **regular follow-up** to assess symptom control, medication adherence, and adverse effects, and practice **deprescribing** [^1169hHEv] by considering step-down or discontinuation of PPIs if symptoms resolve, per guidelines [^115m73YH].

---

Persistent GERD symptoms despite omeprazole 40 mg daily require a **structured approach** — confirm adherence, optimize therapy, implement lifestyle changes, and use targeted diagnostics to guide therapy. This strategy improves symptom control and quality of life [^113ZxQtP].

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) failure is very common and may affect up to one-third of PPI consumers. Identifying the underlying mechanisms for PPI failure in each individual patient is essential for treatment success. For residual acid reflux, increasing the PPI dose to twice daily, switching to another PPI, or adding a histamine 2 receptor antagonist could be a successful therapeutic strategy. In patients with duodenogastroesophageal reflux, weak acidic/alkaline reflux, and hypersensitivity to acid reflux, therapeutic modalities that reduce transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation or visceral pain could be entertained. Treatment of PPI failure due to delayed gastric emptying should focus on improving gastric motor activity. Psychological management may supplement any medical or surgical approach toward PPI failure.

### Optimal management of severe symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112VnoWV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder, and empirical proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is often the first step of management; however, up to 40% of patients remain symptomatic despite PPI treatment. Refractory reflux refers to continued symptoms despite an adequate trial of PPI, and management remains challenging. The differential diagnosis is important; other esophageal (e.g. eosinophilic esophagitis) and gastroduodenal disorders (e.g. functional dyspepsia) should be ruled out, as this changes management.

A combination of clinical assessment, endoscopic evaluation, and in selected cases esophageal function testing can help characterize patients with refractory reflux symptoms into esophageal phenotypes so that appropriate therapy can be more optimally targeted. Medical options may then include adding an H2 receptor antagonist, alginates, baclofen, or antidepressant therapy, and there is emerging evidence for bile acid sequestrants and diaphragmatic breathing.

The demonstration of a temporal association of symptoms with reflux events on pH-impedance testing (reflux hypersensitivity) serves to focus the management on modulating esophageal perception and reducing the reflux burden or identifies those with no obvious pathophysiologic abnormalities (functional heartburn). Anti-reflux surgery based on randomized controlled trial evidence has a role in reflux hypersensitivity or continued pathological acid reflux despite PPI in carefully considered, fully worked-up cases that have failed medical therapy; approximately two out of three cases will respond.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^113TVyui]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Patients suspected of having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) should begin with a trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) as the initial diagnostic approach. This recommendation is supported by moderate-grade evidence and has a strong strength recommendation.

In cases where there is no evidence of erosive oesophagitis upon endoscopy, or if endoscopy has not been conducted, a PPI trial is recommended over reflux monitoring. A PPI trial is more cost-effective, less invasive, and more accessible than reflux monitoring. It has been found that high dose, twice-daily PPI trials are more sensitive in comparison to pH monitoring. A symptom frequency reduction of at least 75% yields the highest sensitivity for diagnosing GORD based on pH monitoring.

Therefore, for patients suspected of having GORD, a therapeutic trial should consist of a full dose PPI taken twice daily for four weeks. The trial is considered positive with at least a 75% reduction in symptom frequency.

If patients do not respond to the PPI trial, the PPI should be discontinued, the initial diagnosis reassessed, and if GORD remains a likely diagnosis, the potential benefits of further investigation should be considered.

Patients with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that are refractory to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent approximately 40% of cases and are a common issue in clinical practice. Many of these patients do not have GERD but instead suffer from functional heartburn or a hypersensitive esophagus. After a thorough clinical evaluation and failure to improve with an escalated dose of PPIs, diagnostic investigations can include endoscopy, esophageal manometry, pH testing, esophageal Bilitec, and esophageal impedance with pH monitoring.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition around the world. The management of this disease is often unsatisfactory due to the complexity of patient presentation and suboptimal diagnostic testing when used for those poorly responsive to acid suppressive therapy.

We compare these strategies and outline a clinically relevant approach for this challenging group of patients.

### Management of refractory typical GERD symptoms [^1147SEGY]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of patients with refractory GERD (rGERD) is a major clinical challenge for gastroenterologists. In up to 30% of patients with typical GERD symptoms (heartburn and/or regurgitation), acid-suppressive therapy does not provide clinical benefit. In this review, we discuss the management algorithm for GERD and the features of patients who do not respond to treatment, such as individuals with an incorrect diagnosis of GERD, inadequate PPI intake, persisting acid reflux, and persisting weakly acidic reflux. Symptom response to existing surgical techniques, novel antireflux procedures, and the value of add-on medical therapies, including prokinetics and reflux inhibitors, for rGERD symptoms are discussed. Pharmaceutical agents targeting esophageal sensitivity, a condition that can contribute to symptom generation in rGERD, are also discussed. Finally, based on available published data and our expert opinion, we present an outline of a current, usable algorithm for the management of patients with rGERD. This considers the timing and diagnostic use of pH-impedance monitoring on or off PPI, additional diagnostic tests, the clinical use of baclofen, and the use of add-on neuromodulators such as tricyclic agents and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Endoscopic suturing with muscular after fundus mucoresection for refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease: a new anti-reflux technique [^112dSbUR]. Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old male with a 20-year history of proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) presented with persistent heartburn and regurgitation (GERD-HRQL score 29). High-resolution manometry showed a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring confirmed pathological reflux (DeMeester score: 83.18). The patient underwent endoscopic suturing with muscular after fundus mucoresection (ESFM), a novel hybrid procedure combining endoscopic mucosal resection with fundoplication principles. Following an 8-hour preoperative fasting period, the gastric cardia was endoscopically exposed. Key steps included: mucosal marking at the gastric cardia (1.5 cm × 2 cm area); submucosal injection and circumferential endoscopic mucosal resection; nylon loop placement with clip-anchored muscular plication; and creation of an anti-reflux valve via suture tightening. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with a 3-day hospitalization. At a 3-month follow-up, the patient reported complete resolution of reflux symptoms without dysphagia (GERD-HRQL 7). Repeat endoscopy demonstrated a well-healed plication fold.

### Acid-suppressive effects of rabeprazole, omeprazole, and lansoprazole at reduced and standard doses: a crossover comparative study in homozygous extensive metabolizers of cytochrome P450 2C19 [^114Z42NL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to improve clinical outcomes of the initial therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is critical for intragastric pH to be above 4.0 for more than 20 hours a day (83.3%) and to inhibit nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough, defined as 60 continuous minutes of intragastric pH below 4.0 at night. A "step-down" therapy sometimes fails due to insufficient acid suppression, thus necessitating a comparison of the acid-suppressive effects of proton pump inhibitors.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, 8-way crossover study involving 9 healthy Helicobacter pylori-negative cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 homozygous extensive metabolizers. The intragastric pH was measured for 24 hours on day 7 of treatment with rabeprazole, omeprazole, and lansoprazole, administered orally once daily at reduced and standard doses.

- **Results**: Compared with baseline data (7% [range 5%-20%]), the median values of the 24-hour percent of time that intragastric pH was above 4.0 significantly increased but did not exceed 83.3% under any of the 7 regimens. The regimens included:

- 10 mg rabeprazole (51% [range 28%-78%], P < .01)
- 20 mg rabeprazole (59% [range 36%-83%], P < .01)
- 10 mg omeprazole (26% [range 4%-33%], P < .05)
- 20 mg omeprazole (48% [range 31%-73%], P < .01)
- 40 mg omeprazole (62% [range 47%-87%], P < .01)
- 15 mg lansoprazole (34% [range 5%-51%], P < .05)
- 30 mg lansoprazole (56% [range 20%-76%], P < .05)

Significant differences were observed among 10, 20, and 40 mg omeprazole: 10 mg versus 20 mg (P < .01); 10 mg versus 40 mg (P < .01); and 20 mg versus 40 mg (P < .01).

### Acid and non-acid reflux in patients with persistent symptoms despite acid suppressive therapy: A multicentre study using combined ambulatory impedance-pH monitoring [^112FLuc4]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Empiric proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trials have become increasingly popular, leading gastroenterologists to frequently evaluate gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) patients only after they have "failed" PPI therapy. Combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH (MII-pH) monitoring has the ability to detect gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) episodes independent of their pH and evaluate the relationship between symptoms and all types of GOR. Using this technique, we aimed to characterise the frequency of acid and non-acid reflux (NAR) and their relationship to typical and atypical GOR symptoms in patients on PPI therapy.

- **Methods**: Patients with persistent GORD symptoms referred to three centres underwent 24-hour combined MII-pH monitoring while taking PPIs at least twice daily. Reflux episodes were detected by impedance channels located 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, and 17 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) and classified into acid or non-acid based on pH data from 5 cm above the LOS. A positive symptom index (SI) was declared if at least half of each specific symptom event was preceded by reflux episodes within five minutes.

- **Results**: A total of 168 patients (103 females (61%) and 65 males (39%); mean age 53, range 18–85 years) underwent combined MII-pH monitoring while taking PPIs at least twice daily. One hundred and forty-four patients (86%) recorded symptoms during the study day, and 24 (15%) had no symptoms during testing. Sixty-nine symptomatic patients (48%) had a positive SI for at least one symptom. Of these, 16 patients (11%) were associated with acid reflux…

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^117M4PNS]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

Evidence is graded as moderate with a strong strength recommendation. A retrospective case series of patients undergoing pH monitoring suggests that very few patients (< 4%) have persistent abnormal acid exposure when taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) twice daily. In contrast, 30% of patients exhibit this condition when taking PPIs once daily. Furthermore, the combination necessary for confidently diagnosing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease — excess acid exposure and a significant association between acid reflux and the patient's symptoms — is much less common in studies carried out on acid suppression (3.4%) compared to studies off acid suppression (30.4%). Patients should therefore undergo pH monitoring off all acid suppression to maximize the chance of diagnosing excess acid reflux and a significant symptom association with acid reflux.

- **In patients with heartburn or acid regurgitation symptoms not responding to a PPI twice daily**:
	- If pH/impedance monitoring is required, it should be undertaken on PPIs if the patient has previous pathological endoscopic or pH monitoring findings. The study should be performed off PPIs if there has been no previous demonstration of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

Evidence is graded as low with a conditional/weak strength recommendation. Patients undergoing pH/impedance monitoring in the context of heartburn or acid regurgitation not responsive to twice daily PPIs, who have a high probability of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (from previous endoscopic or oesophageal pH monitoring findings), should undergo further evaluation.

### Patients with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease: Diagnostic tools [^114Zq1A3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who are refractory to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent approximately 40% and pose a significant challenge in clinical practice. Many of these patients do not actually have GERD but may instead suffer from functional heartburn or a hypersensitive esophagus. After a thorough clinical evaluation and the unsuccessful escalation of the PPI dose, various diagnostic investigations may be employed. These include endoscopy, esophageal manometry, pH testing, esophageal Bilitec monitoring, and esophageal impedance with pH monitoring.

### Role of non-acid reflux in patients with non-erosive reflux disease [^1155PMTK]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The data support a role for non-acid reflux as a cause of symptoms in some NERD patients, especially those who do not respond to treatment with PPIs. Although refluxate with pH > 4 is capable of triggering symptoms, the responsible mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Greater esophageal sensitivity, large volume, and proximal extent of refluxate are among the putative mechanisms. Combined impedance-pH is now considered the most sensitive test for reflux detection, and it seems to have a critical role in establishing the relevance of non-acid in reflux-symptoms generation.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: Where is the pendulum swinging now [^111kaPs4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to outline the recent developments in the field of extraesophageal reflux disease and provide clinically relevant recommendations. These recommendations are based on expert opinion and relevant publications from PubMed and Embase. The Clinical Practice Updates Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association proposes the following recommendations:

- **Best practice advice 1**: The role of a gastroenterologist in patients referred for evaluation of suspected extraesophageal symptoms is to assess for gastroesophageal etiologies that could contribute to the presenting symptoms.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Non-GI evaluations by ENT, pulmonary, and/or allergy specialists are essential and often should be performed initially in most patients, as the cause of the extraesophageal symptom is commonly multifactorial or not esophageal in origin.

- **Best practice advice 3**: Empiric therapy with aggressive acid suppression for 6–8 weeks, with a special focus on the response of the extraesophageal symptoms, can help in assessing the association between reflux and extraesophageal symptoms.

- **Best practice advice 4**: No single testing methodology exists to definitively identify reflux as the etiology for the suspected extraesophageal symptoms.

- **Best practice advice 5**: A constellation of patient presentation, diagnostic test results, and response to therapy should be employed in the determination of reflux as a possible etiology in extraesophageal symptoms.

- **Best practice advice 6**: Testing may need to be conducted off or on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, depending on patients' specific situations.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^111ssd36]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

Troublesome typical symptoms alone may be sufficient for antisecretory medication trials, but up-front oesophageal testing is suggested for all other symptom categories and in proton pump inhibitor (PPI) non-responders, prior to invasive GERD management or long-term medical management.

- **Actionable GERD**: This constitutes settings where management requires long-term acid suppression, an escalation of medical management, or consideration of interventional (i.e. not easily reversible) management options for GERD such as laparoscopic fundoplication, magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), endoscopic GERD therapies, or bariatric surgery, where high confidence in GERD diagnosis is essential.

- **GERD definition and diagnosis**: The Montreal consensus defines GERD as the reflux of stomach contents into the oesophagus causing troublesome symptoms and/or complications. However, not all "troublesome" symptoms can be directly linked to reflux of gastric content, and symptoms alone are insufficient for a conclusive diagnosis. Nevertheless, pragmatic continuation of empiric antisecretory therapy is considered appropriate when typical symptoms (heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation) improve with GERD treatment trials, although response could also be due to the placebo effect. In parallel, assumptions of GERD relationships with cough, hoarseness, and other "isolated" extraoesophageal symptoms (i.e. in the absence of typical GERD symptoms) have overestimated atypical GERD diagnoses, leading to inappropriate use of antisecretory drugs, high economic burden, and waste of limited testing resources.

### Esnm/anms consensus paper: Diagnosis and management of refractory gastro-esophageal reflux disease [^114uc6p7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

Up to 40% of patients with symptoms suspicious of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not respond completely to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The term "refractory GERD" has been used loosely in the literature. A distinction should be made between refractory symptoms (i.e. symptoms may or may not be GERD-related), refractory GERD symptoms (i.e. persisting symptoms in patients with proven GERD, regardless of relationship to ongoing reflux), and refractory GERD (i.e. objective evidence of GERD despite adequate medical management).

The present ESNM/ANMS consensus paper proposes using the term "refractory GERD symptoms" only in patients with persisting symptoms and previously proven GERD by either endoscopy or esophageal pH monitoring. Even in this context, symptoms may or may not be reflux-related. Objective evaluation, including endoscopy and esophageal physiologic testing, is requisite to provide insights into mechanisms of symptom generation and evidence of true refractory GERD. Some patients may have true ongoing refractory acid or weakly acidic reflux despite PPIs, while others have no evidence of ongoing reflux, and yet others have functional esophageal disorders overlapping with proven GERD confirmed off therapy. In this context, attention should also be paid to supragastric belching and rumination syndrome, which may be important contributors to refractory symptoms.

### Persistent acid reflux and symptoms in patients with Barrett's oesophagus on proton-pump inhibitor therapy [^116VDHiy]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess both acid gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) suppression in patients with Barrett's oesophagus on proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the predictive value of symptoms. A prospective study design was employed, focusing on patients with Barrett's epithelium (> 3 cm, containing specialized intestinal metaplasia).

Forty-five patients with Barrett's epithelium were recruited. Therapy was adjusted to omeprazole 20 mg twice daily. Oesophageal manometry and 24-hour pH studies were conducted while on treatment. The heartburn score was calculated before and after the PPI dose adjustment. For patients with persisting acid reflux, the omeprazole dose was increased to 20 mg three times daily and pH studies were repeated. Adequacy of GOR suppression, assessed by pH monitoring, was related to the heartburn score (0–3).

- **Results**:
	- Twenty of the 45 patients were symptomatic (mean score 1.9) on pre-study treatment, mainly omeprazole < 20 mg once daily. On omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, only six patients remained symptomatic (mean score 1.6). Ten patients (22%) experienced persisting GOR on omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, with a median % total time with pH < 4 being 8%. Abnormal nocturnal reflux was found in nine patients and abnormal daytime reflux in only four. Heartburn persisted in three of these ten patients (30%). Those remaining symptomatic had more daytime acid reflux than asymptomatic patients with persistent reflux (median percentage daytime at pH < 4 was 13.6% vs. 0.6%, respectively; P < 0.01). By increasing the omeprazole dose to 20 mg three times daily, only three of the ten had persistent acid reflux.

### A randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effect of vonoprazan (20 mg and 40 mg) in patients with proton-pump inhibitor-resistant erosive esophagitis [^115RREwk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

It has been suggested that the persistence of EE despite PPI treatment is due to insufficient inhibition of gastric acid. At both doses, patients treated with vonoprazan in this study were able to achieve 24-hour pH 4 HTRs of 90% or greater after 2 weeks. These results are similar to those observed in phase I studies of vonoprazan in healthy male subjects in Japan and the United Kingdom (UK), as described by Jenkins and coworkers. At day 7, 24-hour pH > 4 HTRs of 83.4% and 100% were observed for subjects in Japan receiving 20 mg and 40 mg of vonoprazan, respectively. For subjects in the UK, 24-hour pH > 4 HTRs of 85.2% and 93.2% were observed for subjects receiving 20 mg and 40 mg of vonoprazan, respectively.

### Revisiting Montreal: New insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^115ZRaeH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

The Montreal definition of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) provided a rationale for acid suppression medication without investigation, thus enhancing the management of the substantial symptom burden in these patients. Increased proton-pump inhibitor use has also highlighted their limitations, with one-third of "typical" symptoms known to be refractory. Most refractory symptoms are ascribed to reflux hypersensitivity (RH) and functional heartburn (FH). RH may be caused by impaired esophageal mucosal barrier function and sensitization of peripheral esophageal receptors. Central sensitization may also contribute to the perception of non-pathologic reflux in RH and the perception of physiological stimuli in FH.

Importantly, mechanisms underlying GERD, RH, and FH are not mutually exclusive, further complicating patient management. Methods used to distinguish GERD from RH and FH are impractical for use in epidemiological studies and pragmatic care and may have limited diagnostic accuracy. This is impeding accurate prevalence estimates, risk factor determination, and the identification of new therapies. Direct assessment of mucosal barrier function by measuring impedance is a promising candidate for improved diagnosis. Ultimately, the concept of GERD as a composite, symptom-based entity needs re-evaluation so that new understandings of upper GI symptoms can direct more precise management.

### Management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms that do not respond to proton pump inhibitors [^111guuSH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment-refractory gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remains a significant problem in the gastroenterology clinic. In recent years, several studies have investigated the assessment and treatment of refractory GERD.

Patients presenting with 'refractory GERD' in fact represent a quite heterogeneous group consisting of those with ongoing reflux-related symptoms and those with reflux-unrelated problems such as functional heartburn, dyspepsia, or even eosinophilic oesophagitis. The greatest symptom indicators of persistent true reflux are retrosternal burning and acid taste in the mouth alone. Combined pH-impedance studies allow detection of reflux regardless of pH, and weakly acidic reflux has been suggested as a mechanism of residual symptoms in some patients. The use of reflux-symptom association calculations may help to determine the symptom causation, but refinement and outcome studies are needed. New treatments of refractory GERD have been disappointing. Surgery remains an option in very carefully selected patients, but again, better outcome studies are required.

Careful history and investigation are required in the assessment of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory patient. Care to exclude alternative diagnoses is needed, and to phenotype those with reflux-related symptoms. Optimization of PPI therapy may help, as may surgery in selected patients.

### Choosing wisely: Recommendations of the American Gastroenterological Association [^114vcG6S]. Choosing Wisely (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), specifically with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the AGA 2012 guidelines recommend titrating long-term acid suppression therapy with PPIs or H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) to the lowest effective dose needed to achieve therapeutic goals for the pharmacological treatment of patients with GERD.

### Ambulatory reflux monitoring guides proton pump inhibitor discontinuation in patients with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms: A clinical trial [^116LzEir]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy fails to provide adequate symptom control in up to 50% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. Although a proportion do not require ongoing PPI therapy, a diagnostic approach to identify candidates appropriate for PPI cessation is not available. This study aimed to examine the clinical utility of prolonged wireless reflux monitoring to predict the ability to discontinue PPIs.

- **Methods**: This double-blinded clinical trial, performed over three years at two centers, enrolled adults with troublesome esophageal symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, and/or chest pain and inadequate PPI response. Participants underwent prolonged wireless reflux monitoring (off PPIs for ≥ 7 days) and a three-week PPI cessation intervention. The primary outcome was tolerance of PPI cessation (discontinued or resumed PPIs). Symptom burden was quantified using the Reflux Symptom Questionnaire electronic Diary (RESQ-eD).

- **Results**: Of 128 enrolled, 100 participants met inclusion criteria (mean age, 48.6 years; 41 men). Thirty-four participants (34%) discontinued PPIs. The strongest predictor of PPI discontinuation was the number of days with acid exposure time (AET) > 4.0% (odds ratio, 1.82; P < .05). Participants with nine days of AET > 4.0% had ten times increased odds of discontinuing PPI compared to participants with four days of AET > 4.0%. Reduction in symptom burden was greater among the discontinued versus resumed PPI group (RESQ-eD, -43.7% vs. -5.3%; p = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: Among patients with typical reflux symptoms, inadequate PPI response, and absence of severe symptoms, prolonged wireless reflux monitoring can effectively guide the discontinuation of PPIs.

### Proton pump inhibitor responders who are not confirmed as GERD patients with impedance and pH monitoring: Who are they [^115dzQqw]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

A short course of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is often used to confirm gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, some patients with PPI-responsive heartburn do not seem to have evidence of GERD on impedance-pH monitoring (MII-pH). The aim of the study was to evaluate patients with reflux symptoms and a negative endoscopy, who respond well to PPIs with MII-pH.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 312 patients with GERD symptoms and negative endoscopy: 144 reported well-controlled symptoms after 8 weeks of PPIs and 155 were non-responders. Symptom relief was evaluated with the GERD Impact Scale and visual analog scale score. All patients underwent MII-pH off-therapy. Thirteen patients were excluded from analysis. Patients were grouped as follows: non-erosive reflux disease (NERD; increased acid exposure time, AET); hypersensitive esophagus (HE; normal AET, positive symptom association, SI/SAP); MII-pH-/PPI+ (normal AET, negative SI/SAP) in the responder group; MII-pH-/PPI- in non-responders.

- **Key results**: MII-pH in PPI responders (symptom relief during PPI therapy > 75%) showed: 79/144 NERD (54.9%); 37/144 HE (25.7%); 28/144 MII-pH-/PPI+ (19.4%). MII-pH-/PPI+ patients reported the same symptom relief when compared with NERD and HE. In the non-responder (symptom relief during PPI therapy < 50%) group, 27/155 patients were NERD (17.4%); 53/155 were HE (34.2%); 75/155 were MII-pH-/PPI- (48.4%). NERD diagnosis was significantly higher in the responder group (p < 0.01).

### Reflux monitoring: On or off therapy [^116Ptbhm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The role of esophageal pH (or impedance) monitoring in diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has evolved over the years. In the era of empiric therapy with potent acid-suppressive agents such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), esophageal reflux monitoring is often reserved for patients with PPI-refractory symptoms. Given the complexity of patient presentations, technological advancement, and emerging data in the field of GERD, two essential questions need to be addressed:

- **Indications for esophageal pH testing**: What are the indications for esophageal pH testing in patients suspected to have GERD?

- **Testing timing and response assessment**: If patients do not respond to aggressive acid suppression, what is the likelihood that they still have reflux; and should the testing be performed at baseline (i.e. off therapy), or is it more important to know whether there is continued reflux despite therapy (i.e. on therapy)?

### Omeprazole-induced cough in a patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116AF5ip]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Persistent cough can be caused by various diseases, such as postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or as an adverse event of drugs like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We report a case of persistent cough associated with high plasma levels of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole in a patient with GERD. This case suggests that cough can be an adverse drug event related to omeprazole, which is otherwise commonly prescribed for managing GERD-related cough. Therefore, physicians should be aware of the onset or exacerbation of cough during omeprazole therapy.

### Patients with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease: Diagnostic tools [^116Yohmm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

A positive study suggests that persistent symptoms are due to insufficient acid inhibition. The likelihood of having an abnormal pH study on PPI treatment varies among different PPI doses. On a once-daily dose, 31% of refractory patients had an abnormal test, compared to only 4% of patients on a double omeprazole dose; 7% of patients with typical and 1% of patients with atypical reflux symptoms. Another study reported that 16% and 32% of symptomatic patients on PPI twice daily and PPI once daily, respectively, had an abnormal pH test. Although the diagnostic yield of on-therapy pH monitoring for refractory patients is low, its clinical utility could be justified by the identification of truly refractory GERD patients who may benefit from additional therapy.

A negative study (normal esophageal acid exposure and negative symptom-reflux correlation) following a trial of drug therapy provides convincing evidence that the patient's symptoms are not related to residual acid reflux. In cases of normal esophageal acid exposure and a positive symptom-reflux correlation, the possibility of esophageal acid hypersensitivity should be considered. A negative pH study on-therapy does not exclude the possibility of underlying reflux that may be a cofactor in a patient's presentation and is being adequately suppressed on PPIs.

Use of the wireless pH system allows pH testing both off and on PPIs in a single test. By combining pH monitoring both off and on therapy, two questions can be answered: 1) does the patient have abnormal esophageal acid exposure consistent with GERD? and 2) whether ref…

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^116Rx1XL]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

**PPIs for GERD**: PPIs represent the mainstay of medical treatment of esophageal manifestations of GERD; however, their benefits (if any) in extra-digestive GERD are still uncertain. Eight-week therapy with standard (once daily) dose PPIs can achieve healing of reflux esophagitis and symptom relief in more than 80% of patients with typical symptoms. When a functional investigation is added to a negative endoscopy in making the diagnosis, PPI efficacy in GERD and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) appears comparable. Being a chronic, relapsing disease, GERD (as well as NERD) requires long-term PPI treatment, which can be continuous, intermittent, or on-demand. Profound and individually tailored maximal acid suppression is needed in patients with Barrett's esophagus not only to control gastroesophageal reflux (GER) but also in the hope to achieve a chemopreventive effect against neoplastic transformation.

### Most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who failed proton pump inhibitor therapy also have functional esophageal disorders [^111eHU1v]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Aims: As many as 45% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) still have symptoms after receiving once-daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. We aimed to compare reflux characteristics and patterns between responders and non-responders to once-daily PPI therapy using combined impedance-pH monitoring.

Methods: Patients who reported heartburn and/or regurgitation at least twice per week for 3 months while receiving standard-dose PPI therapy were assigned to the PPI failure group (n = 16). Patients who reported a complete resolution of symptoms on once-daily PPIs for at least 4 weeks were assigned to the PPI success group (n = 13). We collected demographic data, and subjects completed the short-form 36 and the GERD health-related quality of life questionnaires. Patients then underwent upper endoscopy and combined esophageal impedance-pH monitoring while on PPI therapy.

Results: Four patients in the PPI success group (31%) and 4 patients in the PPI failure group (25%) had abnormal results from the pH test (P = 1.00). Most of the patients in the PPI failure group (75%) were found to have either functional heartburn or reflux hypersensitivity with GERD. Impedance and pH parameters did not differ significantly between the PPI failure and success groups.

Conclusions: We found no difference in reflux characteristics between patients with GERD who had successful versus failed once-daily PPI therapy. Most patients in the PPI failure group (75%) had functional esophageal disorders.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate [^111s45EV]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have revolutionized the medical approach to upper gastrointestinal disorders. Initially developed as a treatment for reflux esophagitis, these potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion have subsequently proven effective for a broad range of syndromes known or suspected to be attributable to acid reflux, acid secretion, or acid hypersecretion. Combined with seemingly excellent safety and tolerance, these broadened indications triggered an exponential increase in PPI use, and consequently, cost worldwide.

Furthermore, PPIs have become a victim of their own success. They are now often prescribed for syndromes of dubious merit, such as "silent reflux". An almost cultish faith in potent acid suppression as a treatment for all that ails the human race has led to a progressive escalation of PPI dosage and potency. Indeed, a vocabulary has emerged around the concept of "PPI failure", often ignoring the possibility that the condition in question had no relationship to gastric acid secretion in the first place. Consequently, it is no surprise that, in less than 30 years, PPIs have evolved from wonder drugs to a major healthcare epidemic.

Coupled with this has been unprecedented scrutiny of the safety of chronic PPI use. It is in this background that Scarpignato et al. author a position paper on "Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases".

### Symptomatic reflux disease: The present, the past and the future [^112391ca]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Reduction of gastric acidity

Although the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is multifactorial, the level of acid secretion in GORD patients is similar to that in asymptomatic controls, with the exception of rare diseases associated with acid hypersecretion, such as Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Nevertheless, the most widely practiced management strategy for symptomatic GORD is reducing gastric acidity.

Within that spectrum, antacids are mostly used for mild symptoms; their onset of action is rapid, but their effect is short-lived. Alternatively, histamine-2 receptor antagonists can be used for on-demand symptomatic treatment. However, in patients with moderate to severe symptoms, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have become the first-line therapy. In general, the differences between available PPIs (esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole) are small.

Patients with an insufficient therapeutic response to the standard dose of one PPI may benefit from switching to another PPI, an increased dose of the same PPI, or a twice-a-day PPI regimen. Additionally, the inclusion of an H2 blocker at bedtime to twice-daily PPI therapy provides enhanced inhibition of nocturnal acid secretion. However, this effect is not clinically relevant and is subject to tachyphylaxis within a few weeks.

### Determinants of gastro-oesophageal reflux perception in patients with persistent symptoms despite proton pump inhibitors [^116MJZgz]. Gut (2008). Low credibility.

Approximately 20% of patients have persistent symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux despite proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The aim of this study was to assess the determinants of reflux perception in patients on PPI therapy.

- **Patients and methods**: 20 patients with typical gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms (heartburn and/or regurgitation), despite double-dose PPIs (twice daily), were included in this study. Ambulatory 24-hour pH-impedance studies were performed in all patients. The characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic reflux episodes were compared. Symptoms were considered globally and separately for heartburn and regurgitation.

- **Results**: A total of 1273 reflux episodes were detected, including 243 (19.1%) acidic, 1018 (80.0%) weakly acidic, and 12 (0.9%) weakly alkaline reflux episodes. Overall, 312 (24.5%) reflux episodes were symptomatic. The only factor associated with reflux perception was high proximal extent (p = 0.037). Compared with regurgitation, reflux episodes associated with heartburn were more frequently pure liquid (p = 0.009) and acidic (p = 0.027), had a lower nadir pH (p < 0.001), were more frequently preceded by acid reflux episodes (p < 0.001), and had a longer reflux bolus clearance time (p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: High proximal extent of the refluxate is the only factor associated with reflux perception in patients on double-dose PPI. However, compared with regurgitation, the composition of the refluxate, sensitisation of the oesophagus by preceding acid exposure, and delayed bolus clearance appear to play a role in heartburn perception.

### Refractory gastrooesophageal reflux disease [^1164yTjE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has facilitated the treatment of gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD) enormously; however, treatment still fails in a small proportion of patients. This small proportion of therapy-resistant patients encompasses a substantial part of the workload of physicians and has become a common clinical problem.

A strong variability in the acid-suppressive effect of PPI treatment exists, depending on compliance, Helicobacter pylori status, and genotype. Nocturnal acid breakthrough does not seem to be a major determinant of refractory GORD. Recent data, however, show that PPI-refractory GORD can result from nonacid reflux episodes.

It is wise to reconsider the diagnosis of GORD in patients who are PPI-refractory. Most patients for whom PPIs are not effective do not have GORD; instead, they suffer from other disorders such as functional dyspepsia. If, after taking a thorough history, the suspicion of GORD is still high, the next step would be to perform upper endoscopy and reflux monitoring. In cases where patients truly have PPI-refractory GORD, therapy can be aimed at oesophageal hypersensitivity, or a surgical solution can be sought.

### Diagnosis and management of patients with reflux symptoms refractory to proton pump inhibitors [^113KTgiP]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Approximately a third of patients with suspected gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are resistant or partial responders to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Many of these patients do not have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease but suffer from functional heartburn or dyspepsia. The potential mechanisms underlying failure of PPI treatment in patients with reflux-related symptoms include persistence of isolated or mixed acid, weakly acidic, bile or gas reflux, impaired oesophageal mucosal integrity, chemical or mechanical hypersensitivity to refluxates, and psychological comorbidity.

After thorough clinical evaluation and failure of empirical changes in PPI dose regime, diagnostic investigations include endoscopy and reflux monitoring with pH or pH-impedance monitoring. If symptoms are clearly related to persistent reflux, baclofen, antireflux surgery, or pain modulators can be considered. If not, pain modulators are the only currently available therapy.

### Patients with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease: Diagnostic tools [^115TmLRE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Management of a patient with refractory GERD symptoms requires a high level of certainty about the initial diagnosis of GERD, so the utility of diagnostic tests based on identification of residual reflux, anatomical, and histological abnormalities of the esophagus is of importance. Although various evaluative tests are available for patients who failed PPI therapy, none of them is considered the gold standard. Upper endoscopy has limited value in discovering GERD-related findings in patients with persistent GERD symptoms on PPIs. Esophageal pH monitoring is commonly performed in patients with refractory GERD symptoms; however, only a minority of these patients continue to report symptoms due to ongoing acid reflux. Bilitec has limited availability in clinical practice. There is evidence supporting the use of combined impedance-pH monitoring as a promising strategy for evaluating symptomatic GERD patients on PPIs. It seems reasonable to propose that before embarking on impedance-pH monitoring on PPI therapy, the presence of GERD should have been previously demonstrated by pH testing off therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111DRQpx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically in the management of refractory disease, ACG 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining esophageal manometry as part of the evaluation for refractory GERD. This is suggested for patients with a normal endoscopy and pH monitoring study as well as for those who are candidates for surgical or endoscopic treatment.

### On-therapy impedance-pH monitoring can efficiently characterize PPI-refractory GERD and support treatment escalation [^113Kvi5S]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

On-therapy impedance-pH monitoring is recommended for patients with documented GERD and PPI-refractory heartburn to determine whether the unremitting symptom is reflux-related.

- **Aims**: To define on-PPI cut-offs of impedance-pH metrics for proper interpretation of on-therapy impedance-pH monitoring.

- **Methods**: A blinded expert review of impedance-pH tracings was performed during double-dosage PPI, prospectively collected from 150 GERD patients with PPI-refractory heartburn and 45 GERD patients with PPI-responsive heartburn but persisting extra-esophageal symptoms. Acid exposure time (AET), number of total refluxes (TRs), post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave (PSPW) index, and mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) were assessed. On-PPI cut-offs were defined and evaluated with ROC analysis and the area under the curve (AUC).

- **Results**: All four impedance-pH metrics significantly differed between PPI-refractory and PPI-responsive heartburn cases. At ROC analysis, AUC was 0.73 for AET, 0.75 for TRs, 0.81 for PSPW index, and 0.71 for MNBI. The best cut-offs were ≥ 1.7% for AET, ≥ 45 for TRs, ≤ 36% for PSPW index, and ≤ 1847Ω for MNBI. The AUC of these cut-offs was 0.66, 0.71, 0.73, and 0.68, respectively. Analysis of the PSPW index and MNBI added to the assessment of AET and TRs significantly increased the yield of on-therapy impedance-pH monitoring in the PPI-refractory cohort (97% vs. 83%, p < 0.0001). Notably, suboptimal acid suppression, as indicated by AET ≥ 1.7%, was detected in 43% of 150 PPI-refractory cases.

- **Conclusions**: We have defined on-PPI cut-offs of impedance-pH monitoring metrics.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^11126SPy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The management of patients with extraesophageal manifestations of GERD remains challenging. In the absence of specific diagnostic methods capable of identifying individuals who might respond to antireflux therapy, an empiric trial of PPI therapy is the common approach. More invasive diagnostic testing should be reserved for those with poor or partial response to the initial PPI therapy to exclude reflux as the cause of patients' persistent symptoms. Future trials are needed to improve these diagnostic problems and identify the subgroup of individuals with extraesophageal reflux manifestations who may benefit from PPI therapy or antireflux surgery.

### pH impedance and high-resolution manometry in laryngopharyngeal reflux disease high-dose proton pump inhibitor failures [^1135WiU6]. The Laryngoscope (2012). Low credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) patients often fail empiric treatment with high-dose, twice-daily (BID) proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Further testing is warranted to determine if nonacid reflux (NAR) or breakthrough acid reflux (BAR) is the cause of symptoms. There is a lack of data on the results of coordinated multichannel intraluminal pH impedance (MII) and high-resolution esophageal manometry (HRM) testing while patients are on high-dose BID PPIs in the LPRD population. This study aims to evaluate if coordinated MII and HRM can aid in the management of patients with persistent LPRD symptoms despite high-dose BID PPIs.

The study was designed as a retrospective case series. MII and HRM were administered to 23 persistent LPRD subjects who had failed 3 months of high-dose BID PPIs. The number and pH of total and proximal reflux episodes, DeMeester score, reflux symptom correlation, and motility/physiology findings were recorded. Subjects were categorized into significant NAR, BAR, or nonsignificant NAR groups.

Results indicated that 52% of subjects had significant NAR and 22% had BAR despite high-dose BID PPIs. Statistically significant differences were found among groups for the MII outcomes of DeMeester score, number of total and proximal reflux events, and nonacid reflux events. HRM demonstrated dysmotility in five subjects.

For recalcitrant LPRD subjects who fail empiric high-dose BID PPI therapy, the study showed significant NAR or BAR in 74% of subjects. Evaluation by MII and HRM performed on PPI therapy proved essential for management.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111NMd8u]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

However, NERD is an umbrella term, including at least four different patient subgroups. Only those for whom acid is implicated in symptom generation (i.e. true NERD and patients with acid hypersensitive esophagus) are clearly responsive to PPIs. This is not the case for patients who are hypersensitive to nonacidic reflux or those with functional heartburn. According to the Rome IV criteria, both acid hypersensitive esophagus (now called reflux hypersensitivity) and functional heartburn are functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, which should no longer be included in GERD. The lack of abnormal acid exposure and symptom-reflux association makes patients with functional heartburn not responsive to PPIs. This subgroup of subjects may benefit from visceral analgesics (e.g. antidepressants).

Although not as frequent as previously suggested, PPI-refractory heartburn, occurring more commonly in NERD than in erosive disease, does nevertheless exist. Some 20% (range 15–27%) of correctly diagnosed and appropriately treated patients do not respond to PPI therapy at standard doses. To ascertain whether they are "truly" PPI-resistant, compliance and adherence to treatment should be checked. Indeed, PPIs are often taken inappropriately, with only 27% of GERD patients dosing their PPI correctly and only 12% dosing it optimally in a USA survey. Although a standard PPI dose can occasionally control symptoms, nocturnal intragastric acidity often remains elevated (with nocturnal acid breakthrough, NAB) in these patients. A split regimen (either standard or double dose) of PPIs b.i.d.

### Role of non-acid reflux in patients with non-erosive reflux disease [^114qQ6cT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

In the era of frequent proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, patients with reflux-like symptoms who do not respond to PPIs represent the majority of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) cases seen in outpatient gastroenterology practice. For those with ongoing symptoms despite acid suppression and normal endoscopy, it is advisable to perform reflux monitoring. Combined impedance-pH monitoring is the preferred evaluation tool under these circumstances, as it detects both acid and non-acid reflux.

- **Clinical significance of non-acid reflux**: Evaluating symptom relationships solely with acid reflux events can lead to an underestimation of patients with real GERD and an overestimation of those with functional heartburn. Using impedance-pH monitoring, only 29% of patients were diagnosed with functional heartburn compared to 39% using pH monitoring alone. A large multicenter study involving 168 patients with persistent symptoms on PPI twice daily therapy found that 53 (37%) of the 144 patients who experienced symptoms had a positive symptom index (SI) for non-acid reflux, while 16 (11%) had a positive SI for acid reflux. A recent study confirmed that in 39% of patients on double daily PPI therapy, non-acid reflux could be the cause of persistent symptoms. Another study using the symptom association probability (SAP) found that 37% of patients had evidence of a reflux-symptom association, with 17% related to acid reflux, 5% to non-acid reflux, and 15% to both acid and non-acid reflux. Moreover, in patients with persistent symptoms on PPI therapy who had esophageal acid exposure within the physiological range and a positive SI for reflux, a temporal relationship between non-acid reflux and symptoms was observed.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^116P5qro]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

To maximize the diagnostic yield, endoscopy should be performed 2–4 weeks after discontinuation of antisecretory therapy in unproven GERD. Since mucosal healing occurs with PPIs (Proton Pump Inhibitors) in approximately 80%, the likelihood of finding significant oesophagitis is greatly reduced if endoscopy is performed after 8 weeks of PPI therapy. To make a conclusive diagnosis in previously unproven GERD and to adequately phenotype patients to NERD versus erosive oesophagitis, endoscopy is optimally performed after withholding PPI therapy. If endoscopy is performed too soon, a lower grade of oesophagitis or no oesophagitis may be observed, which may not accurately represent the GERD phenotype.

While several studies report endoscopic relapse of oesophagitis in approximately 70% at 6 months after PPI withdrawal, the timing of relapse is unknown and is probably related to pretreatment oesophagitis severity. In a small prospective study of 12 patients with healed LA grade C oesophagitis, discontinuation of therapy led to oesophagitis recurrence after just 1 week in 10 patients, with 5 patients demonstrating re-grade C oesophagitis after 2 weeks. However, these results may not necessarily be extrapolated to lower-grade oesophagitis. Therefore, for accurate GERD phenotyping, endoscopy should be performed following a minimum of 2 weeks, but preferably 4 weeks, after PPIs discontinuation.

LA grade B, C, and D oesophagitis and rePeptic stricture on endoscopy while on optimized antisecretory therapy are indicative of refractory GERD. The persistence of inflammatory and/or fibrotic mucosal lesions further supports this assessment.

### Bringing GERD management up to PAR-2 [^111rkdDU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are extremely effective for mucosal healing of reflux esophagitis but are less effective in relieving the symptom of heartburn. PPIs block the secretion of gastric acid, the caustic effects of which have been assumed to be the primary culprit in the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis. However, mounting data suggest that reflux-stimulated, immune-mediated mechanisms may underlie the development of esophagitis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Thus, the future of GERD therapy, particularly for patients who are refractory to PPIs, may involve targeting proteins such as proteinase-activated receptor-2, which play central roles in the generation of immune-mediated esophageal mucosal damage and in eliciting the symptom of heartburn.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease: Expert review [^114iu2Zj]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available evidence and expert advice regarding the clinical management of patients with suspected extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease.

This article provides practical advice based on the available published evidence, including that identified from recently published reviews from leading investigators in the field, prospective and population studies, clinical trials, and recent clinical guidelines and technical reviews. This best practice document is not based on a formal systematic review.

The advice applies to patients with symptoms or conditions suspected to be related to extraesophageal reflux (EER). This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Gastroenterologists should be aware of potential extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux.

### Lessons learned from intragastric pH monitoring [^113erHfr]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is based on the concept that gastric contents, principally acid and pepsin, are responsible for esophageal injury and symptoms of reflux disease. Pharmacologic management in 2001 revolves around the basic principle that control of intragastric pH correlates with esophageal healing and, subsequently, symptom relief. Although the majority of patients respond to a single daily dose of a proton pump inhibitor, many patients with reflux disease are "refractory" even to twice daily doses of these drugs.

Potential reasons for this less than optimal response can be found when carefully examining the intragastric pH responses of healthy subjects and patients with GERD to these agents when taken at various times of the day, in proximity to meals, and in higher doses. In the past several years, we have explored many of these issues in attempting to understand the mechanisms behind the incomplete response to proton pump inhibitors, using combined intragastric and intraesophageal pH monitoring. The "lessons learned" from these and supportive studies are the subject of this review.

### Symptomatic reflux disease: The present, the past and the future [^112q9abr]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Using esophageal pH-impedance monitoring, four phenotypes of poorly responsive patients can be identified, each with unique management considerations.

- **Dealt with easily**: Patients of phenotype 4 can be identified, in whom a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can be excluded, making antireflux therapy of little, if any, use.

- **Complex cases**:
	- **Phenotype 3**: This includes patients who have excessive reflux, but a temporal association between symptoms and reflux episodes is not apparent. Technically, these patients have GORD, but treatment may or may not improve their persistent symptoms. Patients with pulmonary and otolaryngology syndromes typify this phenotype, which can be particularly vexing in view of the absence of any high-level evidence for the effectiveness of any antireflux therapy.
	- **Phenotype 2**: These patients present challenges as they have physiological evidence of GORD, complicated by esophageal hypersensitivity, which diminishes the efficacy of conventional therapy. While there is no high-level evidence in managing this population, anecdotal and mechanistic data support the addition of perception modulators.

- **Straightforward cases**: Patients of phenotype 1 have physiological evidence of GORD, manifested by excessive reflux and a positive symptom association. These patients should benefit from alternative antireflux therapy, whether pharmacological or surgical.

pH-impedance monitoring facilitates the identification of subgroups of patients with symptoms suspected to be caused by reflux, based on the presence or absence of excessive reflux and symptom association.

### Does short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors cause rebound aggravation of symptoms [^1117ncV7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Rebound acid hypersecretion might occur after treatment with proton pump inhibitors. This study examines the potential for rebound aggravation of symptoms following short-term treatment with lansoprazole.

- **Study**: Sixty-two patients (19 men and 43 women; mean age, 54 years; range, 32–77 years) experiencing heartburn and regurgitation, with normal upper endoscopy results, were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial featuring a crossover design. Participants underwent two 5-day treatment periods with either lansoprazole 60 mg once daily or a placebo, arranged in a random order and separated by a 9-day washout period. Reflux, total, and antacid scores were calculated for each treatment period. Higher scores during the placebo period for the group initially given lansoprazole, compared to those first given the placebo, suggested a rebound aggravation of symptoms.

- **Results**: The mean symptom scores recorded during the placebo period for the groups given lansoprazole first and placebo first were as follows: reflux scores of 21.5 and 17.6, respectively (not significant); total scores of 11.2 and 10.3, respectively (not significant); and antacid scores of 8.2 and 7.2, respectively (not significant).

- **Conclusions**: There is no evidence of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days following a 5-day course of lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.

### Stability of gastric secretory inhibition during 6-month treatment with omeprazole in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease [^114PaWtL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

A trend toward relapse of reflux symptoms and esophagitis during long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors has been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the existence of tachyphylaxis to the effect of proton pump inhibitors on gastric acidity and gastroesophageal reflux over time. A total of 23 patients with reflux esophagitis underwent 24-hour intragastric and intraesophageal pH-metry after 7, 90, and 180 days of continued dosing with 20 mg of omeprazole once daily before breakfast.

The total median percentages of time gastric pH < 4 (interquartile range) were 49% (35–70%), 60% (36–76%), and 42% (26–66%) after 7, 90, and 180 days (p = 0.14). Percentages of time gastric pH < 3 were 41%, 54%, and 34%, respectively (p = 0.19). The median percentages of total time esophageal pH < 4 were 1.1%, 2.5%, and 1.1%, respectively (p = 0.70). Healing of esophagitis was achieved in 84% of the patients after 6 months. Heartburn improved in six patients, worsened in three, and was unchanged in 10 patients (p = 0.16). There was no statistically significant relationship between the change in esophageal acid exposure and the change in severity of heartburn.

A dose of 20 mg of omeprazole once daily consistently controlled patients' symptoms and kept gastric acidity at a stable level over a period of 6 months. There is no evidence of diminution in the effects of 20 mg of omeprazole over time that could indicate the development of tolerance.

### Medical therapy of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112p5BTQ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors remain the mainstay of medical therapy in gastroesophageal reflux disease. Despite their increasing use, up to 40% of patients are not fully satisfied with their antireflux therapy. Recent data on efficacy and safety are reviewed, and causes of failure are discussed.

- **Recent findings**: Several randomized studies and a meta-analysis have shown marginal differences in efficacy between various proton pump inhibitor regimens. In subgroups, however, such as severe esophagitis, esomeprazole may be superior. Poor compliance is one of the main causes of failure. Nonacid reflux is likely to play an important role, especially in patients with regurgitation or cough persisting on therapy. Genetic polymorphisms involved in proton pump inhibitor metabolism, Helicobacter pylori infection, or nocturnal acid breakthrough during therapy are probably less important than initially suspected. Recent pharmacological developments include new proton pump inhibitor isomers, potassium competitive acid blockers, and inhibitors of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations.

There are still important unmet needs in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Optimizing acid control is unlikely to improve the condition of the majority of patients with incomplete proton pump inhibitor response. Inhibition of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations remains the major pharmacological target for future drug development.

### Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease that does not respond well to proton pump inhibitors [^114MBxUo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who do not respond to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) given once daily are very common. These therapy-resistant patients have become the new face of GERD in clinical practice over the last decade and presently pose a significant therapeutic challenge to the practicing physician. This review examines the newly accumulated information about the management of PPI failure published over the past two years.

- **Recent findings**: There are diverse mechanisms that contribute to the failure of PPI treatment in GERD patients, and these are not limited to residual reflux. Some causes of PPI failure may coincide in the same patient. Upper endoscopy appears to have limited diagnostic value. In contrast, esophageal impedance with pH testing on therapy provides the most insightful information about subsequent management. Commonly, doubling the PPI dose or switching to another PPI is offered to patients who fail PPI once daily. Failure of such therapeutic strategies is commonly followed by assessment for residual reflux. There is growing evidence about the potential value of compounds that can reduce transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations. Esophageal pain modulators are commonly offered to patients with functional heartburn, although supportive clinical studies are still lacking.

- **Summary**: Management of refractory GERD patients remains an important clinical challenge. Recent studies have cemented the value of impedance-pH testing in pursuing proper treatment.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113ZxQtP]. BMJ (2020). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a multifaceted disorder encompassing a family of syndromes attributable to, or exacerbated by, gastroesophageal reflux that impart morbidity, mainly through troublesome symptoms. Major GERD phenotypes include non-erosive reflux disease, GERD hypersensitivity, low or high-grade esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, reflux chest pain, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and regurgitation-dominant reflux.

GERD is prevalent worldwide, with its epidemiology linked to Western lifestyles, obesity, and the decline of Helicobacter pylori. Due to its prevalence and chronic nature, GERD imposes a significant economic burden measured in physician visits, diagnostics, cancer surveillance protocols, and therapeutics. An individual presenting with typical symptoms has a fivefold risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, yet mortality from GERD is otherwise rare.

The principles of managing GERD are to provide symptomatic relief and minimize potential health risks through lifestyle modifications, diagnostic testing, pharmaceuticals (mainly to suppress or counteract gastric acid secretion), and surgery. However, GERD is usually a chronic recurring condition, necessitating personalized management for each case. While escalating proton pump inhibitor therapy may be relevant in healing high-grade esophagitis, its applicability to other GERD phenotypes, wherein factors such as anxiety, motility, hypersensitivity, and non-esophageal influences may prevail, is highly questionable.

### Omeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease in the first 2 years of life: a dose-finding study with dual-channel pH monitoring [^115prEo9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux occurs in the majority of infants, with severity ranging from asymptomatic to severe esophagitis and failure to thrive. Omeprazole is recognized as a safe and effective treatment for gastroesophageal reflux in older children, at an initial dosage of 0.7 mg/kg/day. To our knowledge, no dose-finding studies have been conducted in children under 2 years of age. The aim of the present study was to prospectively determine the dosage of omeprazole required to treat symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux in children younger than 2 years.

- **Patients and methods**: Children under 2 years with clinical suspicion of gastroesophageal reflux underwent 24-hour dual-channel intraesophageal/gastric pH monitoring. A reflux index above 10% in children under 1 year and above 6% in children older than 1 year was deemed significant. Treatment with omeprazole at an initial dosage of 0.7 mg/kg/day (in 2 divided doses) was followed by a dual-channel pH study after 14 days. The dosage was increased in increments of 0.7 mg/kg/day, and pH studies were repeated until the gastroesophageal reflux was controlled.

- **Results**: Ten children (5 male, 5 female), with a mean age of 7.75 months (range, 1.25–20 months), were investigated. The initial median reflux index was 18.5% (range, 6.5%-56.3%). The follow-up median reflux index improved to 1.6% (0.1%-8.1%) (P < 0.05). The median dosage required was 1.05 mg/kg/day. Four children required 1.4 mg/kg/day, and 1 required 2.8 mg/kg/day.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115m73YH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

For the medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically concerning proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend attempting to discontinue PPIs or switch to on-demand therapy in patients with GERD who do not have erosive esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus if their symptoms have resolved while on PPIs.
