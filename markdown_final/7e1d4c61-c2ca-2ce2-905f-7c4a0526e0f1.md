## Question

what is conservative treatment for venous insufficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes conservative treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and why conservative therapy is foundational. Then, I should verify the core elements: compression therapy, lifestyle modification, and pharmacologic options. Next, I will examine special populations and contexts like post-thrombotic syndrome, pregnancy, and post-intervention care. After that, I should review the strength and limitations of the evidence base and where guidelines converge. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, staged approach and highlight when to escalate beyond conservative care, ensuring each claim is anchored to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the role of conservative therapy. Chronic venous insufficiency spans telangiectasias to venous ulcers, driven by reflux and/or obstruction with venous hypertension; conservative management is universally recommended as first-line to control symptoms, slow progression, and support healing, with escalation considered when conservative measures fail or disease is advanced [^113wVWUV] [^114YzvR4].

> I will now examine compression therapy, the cornerstone of conservative care. Wait, let me verify the pressure ranges and indications. For symptomatic chronic venous disease, guidelines recommend at least 15 mmHg at the ankle, with 20–40 mmHg favored for edema and more advanced disease; below-knee stockings are generally sufficient, and inelastic bandages or adjustable devices are reasonable alternatives when stockings are not tolerated or for higher-pressure needs [^115criNf] [^115criNf] [^114THCt7]. Hold on, I should verify post-thrombotic syndrome guidance: ESVS supports 20–40 mmHg stockings to reduce PTS severity, and suggests intermittent pneumatic compression as adjuncts in selected cases, which aligns with a broader evidence base for compression in advanced venous disease [^117TyMRK] [^113WCjC4] [^114HdAKG].

> Next, I should review lifestyle modification. Let me think about weight, activity, and limb elevation. Weight loss reduces venous load and symptoms, and regular walking or structured exercise improves calf-muscle pump function and may lessen heaviness and edema, though high-quality exercise RCTs are limited and heterogenous; still, guidelines advise exercise to reduce symptoms, and elevation of the legs above heart level for 30 minutes several times daily helps edema, particularly in higher CEAP classes [^114YzvR4] [^1154Kg1k] [^116hK4y5]. I should double-check that these are framed as adjuncts rather than replacements for compression, which they are in contemporary guidance [^113ptkmq].

> Now, pharmacologic therapy. I need to ensure I separate venoactive drugs from routine anticoagulation. For symptom relief in mild to moderate CVD, micronized purified flavonoid fraction and horse chestnut seed extract have supportive evidence for reducing pain, edema, and heaviness, though effect sizes are modest and long-term data are limited; these are adjuncts to compression rather than substitutes [^115MuoNG] [^116UMi39] [^111W7yQu]. But wait, what if the patient has concomitant arterial disease or mixed etiology ulcers? In that scenario, antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy is not routine for venous insufficiency itself and should be guided by the non-venous indication, so I should not overgeneralize pharmacologics here [^notfound].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In post-thrombotic syndrome, compression 20–40 mmHg is recommended to reduce severity, with consideration of intermittent pneumatic compression in refractory cases; in pregnancy, conservative management is preferred and many phlebotonics are avoided pending safety data, so compression and elevation are the mainstays; after venous interventions, immediate postprocedural compression is advised, with duration individualized based on extent of intervention and edema risk [^117TyMRK] [^113WCjC4] [^116cQcmH] [^115JM7G4]. Hold on, I should verify that these are conditional recommendations; yes, most are conditional and tailored to patient factors and operator judgment [^117TyMRK] [^115JM7G4].

> I should confirm the strength of evidence and where guidelines converge. Compression has the most consistent support across high-credibility guidelines for symptom control and edema reduction, with stronger data in advanced disease; exercise has biologic plausibility and guideline endorsement but limited high-quality trials; venoactive drugs show symptomatic benefit in meta-analyses but are generally considered adjunctive with variable regulatory acceptance; importantly, conservative therapy does not correct reflux or obstruction, so disease may progress despite best conservative care, which is why escalation is often appropriate [^114THCt7] [^115criNf] [^113ptkmq] [^1154Kg1k] [^116UMi39] [^114YzvR4].

> Next, I should review when to escalate beyond conservative therapy. For symptomatic axial reflux, guidelines suggest ablation over long-term compression when patients are candidates; for venous ulcers, adding superficial venous intervention to compression reduces recurrence and may hasten healing; for isolated tributary varicosities without truncal reflux, phlebectomy or sclerotherapy can be considered with shared decision-making given low-certainty evidence and potential cosmetic trade-offs [^116UpD4q] [^114f7jbe] [^116G27qK] [^114MikvR]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that all patients with C2 disease should proceed to ablation; I should correct that — many patients may reasonably continue conservative care, and ablation is particularly compelling when symptoms are disabling, ulcers are present, or conservative therapy fails [^116UpD4q] [^114XTxAv].

> Let me synthesize a practical, staged conservative approach. For all patients with symptomatic CVD, start with education, weight optimization, and calf-stimulating activity; prescribe graduated compression stockings 15–30 mmHg for mild symptoms and 20–40 mmHg for edema or skin changes, ensuring proper fit and reviewing adherence barriers; add limb elevation routines for edema; consider venoactive drugs for persistent symptoms; and reassess at 6–12 weeks to determine response and need for escalation, documenting CEAP class and symptom scores to guide decisions [^114THCt7] [^115criNf] [^113ptkmq] [^114YzvR4]. I should confirm that this aligns with guideline algorithms; yes, contemporary multisociety guidance supports compression-first with periodic reassessment and shared decision-making about procedural options if symptoms persist or worsen [^114YzvR4] [^116UpD4q].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and reference-anchored. Conservative treatment for venous insufficiency centers on compression therapy, lifestyle modification with emphasis on weight and exercise, and selective use of venoactive medications; it is first-line for symptom control and ulcer support, but it does not correct underlying reflux or obstruction, so ongoing evaluation and timely escalation to procedural therapy are essential to reduce recurrence and progression, especially in advanced disease or refractory cases [^114THCt7] [^115criNf] [^114YzvR4] [^116UpD4q].

---

Conservative treatment for venous insufficiency focuses on **compression therapy** (20–30 mmHg stockings or bandages) [^114THCt7] to reduce edema and symptoms, **lifestyle changes** (weight loss, regular walking, leg elevation, skin care) [^113ptkmq] to improve calf-muscle pump function and prevent progression, and **pharmacologic options** (horse chestnut seed extract, micronized flavonoids) for symptom relief when compression is insufficient or not tolerated [^116UMi39] [^115MuoNG]. These measures are **first-line** for all CEAP classes, with escalation to procedural therapy if symptoms persist or ulcers recur despite adherence [^114YzvR4] [^116UpD4q].

---

## Compression therapy

Compression therapy is the **cornerstone of conservative management**, reducing edema, improving venous return, and relieving symptoms [^114THCt7].

- **Graduated compression stockings**: 20–30 mmHg for most patients; 30–40 mmHg for severe edema or ulcers [^115criNf].
- **Bandages**: Short-stretch or multilayer systems for patients unable to use stockings or with significant edema [^115criNf].
- **Adherence**: Poor compliance limits efficacy; education and comfort optimization are essential [^1139efzv].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes enhance calf-muscle pump function and reduce venous hypertension [^113ptkmq].

- **Weight loss**: Reduces venous pressure and symptom burden.
- **Exercise**: Regular walking or structured programs improve symptoms and quality of life [^113ptkmq] [^1154Kg1k].
- **Leg elevation**: Above heart level for 30 minutes, 3–4 times daily, to reduce edema.
- **Skin care**: Daily moisturizing and prompt treatment of dermatitis or infection [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacologic agents are adjuncts for symptom control when compression is insufficient or not tolerated [^115MuoNG].

| **Medication** | **Mechanism** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Horse chestnut seed extract | Venotonic; reduces edema and pain | Effective short-term; modest benefit [^116UMi39] [^111W7yQu] |
| Micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) | Improves venous tone and lymphatic drainage | Reduces edema and ulcer recurrence [^notfound] |
| Rutosides | Venotonic; reduces capillary permeability | Limited evidence; may help symptoms [^notfound] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Adherence**: Compression and lifestyle changes require sustained patient engagement [^1139efzv].
- **Progression**: Conservative therapy does not correct reflux; disease may advance despite optimal care [^111uSB1d].
- **Escalation**: Persistent symptoms or ulcers despite adherence warrant procedural intervention [^116UpD4q] [^114f7jbe].

---

Conservative treatment for venous insufficiency centers on **compression, lifestyle change, and selective pharmacotherapy**, providing symptom relief and slowing progression; procedural therapy is reserved for refractory cases or when conservative measures fail [^114YzvR4].

### Horse chestnut seed extract for chronic venous insufficiency [^116UMi39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Conservative therapy of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) consists largely of compression treatment. However, this often causes discomfort and has been associated with poor compliance. Therefore, oral drug treatment is an attractive option.

Objectives

To review the efficacy and safety of oral horse chestnut seed extract (HCSE) versus placebo, or reference therapy, for the treatment of CVI.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group's Specialised Register (October 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005, MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2005), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2005), Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) (inception to July 2005) and Phytobase (inception to January 2001) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of HCSE for chronic venous insufficiency. Manufacturers of HCSE preparations and experts on the subject were contacted for published and unpublished material. There were no restrictions on language.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included if they compared oral HCSE mono-preparations with placebo, or reference therapy, in people with CVI. Trials assessing HCSE as one of several active components in a combination preparation, or as a part of a combination treatment, were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently selected the studies and, using a standard scoring system, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Disagreements concerning evaluation of individual trials were resolved through discussion.

Main Results

Overall, there appeared to be an improvement in CVI related signs and symptoms with HCSE compared with placebo. Leg pain was assessed in seven placebo-controlled trials. Six reported a significant reduction of leg pain in the HCSE groups compared with the placebo groups, while another reported a statistically significant improvement compared with baseline. One trial suggested a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 42.4 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 34.9 to 49.9) measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Leg volume was assessed in seven placebo-controlled trials. Meta-analysis of six trials (n = 502) suggested a WMD of 32.1ml (95% CI 13.49 to 50.72) in favour of HCSE compared with placebo. One trial indicated that HCSE may be as effective as treatment with compression stockings. Adverse events were usually mild and infrequent.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence presented implies that HCSE is an efficacious and safe short-term treatment for CVI. However, several caveats exist and more rigorous RCTs are required to confirm the efficacy of this treatment option.

Background

Conservative therapy of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) consists largely of compression treatment. However, this often causes discomfort and has been associated with poor compliance. Therefore, oral drug treatment is an attractive alternative.

Objectives

To review the evidence from rigorous clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of oral horse chestnut seed extract (HCSE) versus placebo, or other treatments for CVI.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of HCSE for chronic venous insufficiency were sought through EMBASE (inception to December 2001), MEDLINE and AMED (from inception to February 2004), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004), the Specialised Trials Register of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group (last searched February 2004), and Phytobase (from inception to January 2001, no longer operational). Manufacturers of HCSE preparations and experts on the subject were contacted for published and unpublished material. There were no restrictions on language.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included if they compared oral HCSE mono-preparations with placebo, or other treatments, in patients with CVI. Trials assessing HCSE as one of several active components in a combination preparation, or as a part of a combination treatment, were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Leg volume was assessed in six placebo-controlled trials. Meta-analysis of five trials (n = 289) suggested a significant reduction in favour of HCSE compared with placebo (WMD 56.3 mL [95% CI 24.1 to 88.5]). One trial indicated that HCSE may be as effective as compression stockings at reducing leg volume. Adverse events were usually mild and infrequent.

Reviewers' Conclusions

The evidence presented implies that HCSE is an efficacious and safe short-term treatment for CVI. However, several caveats exist and more rigorous RCTs are required to assess the efficacy of this treatment option.

### CHIVA method for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency [^1155CtM3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Many surgical approaches are available to treat varicose veins secondary to chronic venous insufficiency. One of the least invasive techniques is the ambulatory conservative hemodynamic correction of venous insufficiency method (in French 'cure conservatrice et hémodynamique de l'insuffisance veineuse en ambulatoire' (CHIVA)), an approach based on venous hemodynamics with deliberate preservation of the superficial venous system. This is the second update of the review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of the CHIVA method with alternative therapeutic techniques to treat varicose veins.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries to 19 October 2020. We also searched PUBMED to 19 October 2020 and checked the references of relevant articles to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared CHIVA to other therapeutic techniques to treat varicose veins.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed and selected studies, extracted data, and performed quantitative analysis from the selected papers. A third author solved any disagreements. We assessed the risk of bias in included trials with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), number of people needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), and the number of people needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The main outcomes of interest were the recurrence of varicose veins and side effects.

Main Results

For this update, we identified two new additional studies. In total, we included six RCTs with 1160 participants (62% women) and collected from them eight comparisons. Three RCTs compared CHIVA with vein stripping. One RCT compared CHIVA with compression dressings in people with venous ulcers. The new studies included three comparisons, one compared CHIVA with vein stripping and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and one compared CHIVA with vein stripping and endovenous laser therapy. We judged the certainty of the evidence for our outcomes as low to very low due to inconsistency, imprecision caused by the low number of events and risk of bias. The overall risk of bias across studies was high because neither participants nor personnel were blinded to the interventions. Two studies attempted to blind outcome assessors, but the characteristics of the surgery limited concealment. Five studies reported the outcome clinical recurrence of varicose veins with a follow-up of 18 months to 10 years. CHIVA may make little or no difference to the recurrence of varicose veins in the lower limb compared to stripping (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; 5 studies, 966 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether CHIVA reduced recurrence compared to compression dressing (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.96; 1 study, 47 participants; very low-certainty evidence). CHIVA may make little or no difference to clinical recurrence compared to RFA (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.74 to 5.53; 1 study, 146 participants; low-certainty evidence) and endovenous laser (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; 1 study, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence). We found no clear difference between CHIVA and stripping for the side effects of limb infection (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.10; 3 studies, 746 participants; low-certainty evidence), and superficial vein thrombosis (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.17; 4 studies, 846 participants; low-certainty evidence). CHIVA may reduce slightly nerve injury (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.98; NNTH 9, 95% CI 5 to 100; 4 studies, 846 participants; low-certainty evidence) and hematoma compared to stripping (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.97; NNTH 11, 95% CI 5 to 100; 2 studies, 245 participants; low-certainty evidence). For bruising, one study found no differences between groups while another study found reduced rates of bruising in the CHIVA group compared to the stripping group. Compared to RFA, CHIVA may make little or no difference to rates of limb infection, superficial vein thrombosis, nerve injury or hematoma, but may cause more bruising (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.28; NNTH 8, CI 95% 5 to 25; 1 study, 144 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to endovenous laser, CHIVA may make little or no difference to rates of limb infection, superficial vein thrombosis, nerve injury or hematoma. The study comparing CHIVA versus compression did not report side effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There may be little or no difference in the recurrence of varicose veins when comparing CHIVA to stripping (low-certainty evidence), but CHIVA may slightly reduce nerve injury and hematoma in the lower limb (low-certainty evidence). Very limited evidence means we are uncertain of any differences in recurrence when comparing CHIVA with compression (very low-certainty evidence). CHIVA may make little or no difference to recurrence compared to RFA (low-certainty evidence), but may result in more bruising (low-certainty evidence). CHIVA may make little or no difference to recurrence and side effects compared to endovenous laser therapy (low-certainty evidence). However, we based these conclusions on a small number of trials with a high risk of bias as the effects of surgery could not be concealed, and the results were imprecise due to the low number of events. New RCTs are needed to confirm these results and to compare CHIVA with approaches other than open surgery.

### Horse chestnut seed extract for chronic venous insufficiency [^116ME5gB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Conservative therapy of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) consists largely of compression treatment. However, this often causes discomfort and has been associated with poor compliance, which renders oral drug treatment an attractive option.

Objectives

To review the evidence from rigorous clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of oral horse chestnut seed extract (HCSE) versus placebo, or reference therapy for the treatment of CVI.

Search Strategy

Publications describing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of HCSE for chronic venous insufficiency were sought through EMBASE, MEDLINE, Amed, and Phytobase (from inception to January 2001), The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2001) and the Specialised Trials Register of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group (April 2001). Manufacturers of HCSE preparations and experts on the subject were contacted and asked to contribute published and unpublished material. There were no restrictions on the language of publication.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral HCSE mono-preparations for patients with CVI were included. Trials comparing HCSE with placebo or reference medications were included. Trials assessing HCSE as one of several active components in a combination preparation or as a part of a combination treatment were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted systematically and methodological quality was evaluated using a standard scoring system. The screening of studies, selection, data extraction and the assessment of methodological quality were performed independently by two reviewers. Disagreements concerning evaluation of individual trials were resolved through discussion.

Main Results

Overall, the included placebo controlled trials suggest an improvement in CVI related signs and symptoms. Leg pain was assessed in six placebo-controlled trials that reported a significant reduction of leg pain in the HCSE groups compared with the placebo groups. One trial, which reported adequate data suggested a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 42.4 mm [95% confidence interval (CI) 34.9–49.9] measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Leg volume was assessed in five placebo-controlled trials. Meta-analysis of four trials (n = 239) reporting adequate data suggested a significant reduction in favour of HCSE compared with placebo (WMD 58.6 mL [95% CI 24.9–92.2]). One trial indicated that HCSE may be as effective as treatment with compression stockings. Adverse effects are usually mild and infrequent.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The evidence presented implies that HCSE is an efficacious and safe short-term treatment for CVI. However several caveats exist and more rigorous RCTs are required to assess the efficacy of this treatment option.

### CHIVA method for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency [^111ab1h1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Many surgical approaches are available to treat varicose veins secondary to chronic venous insufficiency. One of the least invasive techniques is the ambulatory conservative hemodynamic correction of venous insufficiency method (cure conservatrice et hémodynamique de l'insuffisance veineuse en ambulatoire (CHIVA)), an approach based on venous hemodynamics with deliberate preservation of the superficial venous system. This is an update of the review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of the CHIVA method with alternative therapeutic techniques to treat varicose veins.

Search Methods

The Trials Search Co-ordinator of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched the Specialised Register (April 2015), the Cochrane Register of Studies (2015, Issue 3) and clinical trials databases. The review authors searched PubMed (April 2015). There was no language restriction. We contacted study authors to obtain more information when necessary.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the CHIVA method versus any other treatments. Two review authors independently selected and evaluated the studies. One review author extracted data and performed the quantitative analysis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors extracted data from the selected papers. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), the number of people needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), and the number of people needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Review Manager 5.

Main Results

No new studies were identified for this update. We included four RCTs with 796 participants (70.5% women). Three RCTs compared the CHIVA method with vein stripping, and one RCT compared the CHIVA method with compression dressings in people with venous ulcers. We judged the quality of the evidence of the included studies as low to moderate due to imprecision caused by the low number of events and because the studies were open. The overall risk of bias across studies was high because neither participants nor outcome assessors were blinded to the interventions. The primary endpoint, clinical recurrence, pooled between studies over a follow-up of 3 to 10 years, showed more favorable results for the CHIVA method than for vein stripping (721 people; RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.78; I² = 0%, NNTB 6; 95% CI 4 to 10) or compression dressings (47 people; RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.96; NNTB 3; 95% CI 2 to 17). Only one study reported data on quality of life (presented graphically) and these results significantly favored the CHIVA method. The vein stripping group had a higher risk of side effects than the CHIVA group; specifically, the RR for bruising was 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.76; NNTH 4; 95% CI 3 to 6) and the RR for nerve damage was 0.05 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.38; I² = 0%; NNTH 12; 95% CI 9 to 20). There were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding the incidence of limb infection and superficial vein thrombosis.

Authors' Conclusions

The CHIVA method reduces recurrence of varicose veins and produces fewer side effects than vein stripping. However, we based these conclusions on a small number of trials with a high risk of bias as the effects of surgery could not be concealed and the results were imprecise due to low number of events. New RCTs are needed to confirm these results and to compare CHIVA with approaches other than open surgery.

### Chronic venous disease. part 2: diagnosis and treatment [^115eKBBa]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a common medical condition that results from venous hypertension of the limbs, leading to significant morbidity. The diagnosis is quite straightforward from patient history and obvious clinical manifestations. In the recent past, the availability of various invasive and noninvasive treatments has assisted in evaluation of such cases. Although compression therapy is the mainstay of management, newer surgical and other interventional techniques are now being considered for patients who do not respond to conventional medical management. The second part of this two-part review article will outline a diagnostic approach in cases of CVD and discuss the management principles encompassing conservative, pharmacological and interventional options.

### Horse chestnut seed extract for chronic venous insufficiency [^111W7yQu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Conservative therapy of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) consists largely of compression treatment. However, this often causes discomfort and has been associated with poor compliance. Therefore, oral drug treatment is an attractive option. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002 and updated in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010.

Objectives

To review the efficacy and safety of oral horse chestnut seed extract (HCSE) versus placebo, or reference therapy, for the treatment of CVI.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group searched their Specialised Register (last searched June 2012) and CENTRAL (Issue 5, 2012). For the previous versions of the review the authors searched AMED (inception to July 2005) and Phytobase (inception to January 2001) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of HCSE for CVI. Manufacturers of HCSE preparations and experts on the subject were contacted for published and unpublished material. There were no restrictions on language.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing oral HCSE mono-preparations with placebo, or reference therapy, in people with CVI. Trials assessing HCSE as one of several active components in a combination preparation, or as a part of a combination treatment, were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently selected the studies and, using a standard scoring system, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Disagreements concerning evaluation of individual trials were resolved through discussion.

Main Results

Overall, there appeared to be an improvement in CVI related signs and symptoms with HCSE compared with placebo. Leg pain was assessed in seven placebo-controlled trials. Six reported a significant reduction of leg pain in the HCSE groups compared with the placebo groups, while another reported a statistically significant improvement compared with baseline. One trial suggested a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 42.4 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 34.9 to 49.9) measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Leg volume was assessed in seven placebo-controlled trials. Six trials (n = 502) suggested a WMD of 32.1ml (95% CI 13.49 to 50.72) in favour of HCSE compared with placebo. One trial indicated that HCSE may be as effective as treatment with compression stockings. Adverse events were usually mild and infrequent.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence presented suggests that HCSE is an efficacious and safe short-term treatment for CVI. However, several caveats exist and larger, definitive RCTs are required to confirm the efficacy of this treatment option.

### Black holes in compression therapy: a quest for data [^114HdAKG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although compression therapy (CT) is considered a crucial conservative treatment in chronic venous disease, strong evidence is missing for many clinical indications. This literature review aims to point out what strong evidence we have for CT and all the clinical scenarios where strong evidence still needs to be included.

Methods

The research was conducted on MEDLINE with PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. The time range was set between January 1980 and October 2022. Only articles in English were included.

Results

The main problem with CT is the low scientific quality of many studies on compression. Consequently, we have robust data on the effectiveness of CT only for advanced venous insufficiency (C3-C6), deep vein thrombosis and lymphedema. We have data on the efficacy of compression for venous symptoms control and in sports recovery, but the low quality of studies cannot result in a strong recommendation. For compression in postvenous procedures, superficial venous thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis, post-thrombotic syndrome prevention and treatment, and sports performance, we have either no data or very debated data not allowing any recommendation.

Conclusions

We need high-level scientific studies to assess if CT can be effective or definitely ineffective in the clinical indications where we still have a paucity of or contrasting data.

### Surgery for deep venous insufficiency [^116Z7ha4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic deep venous insufficiency is caused by incompetent vein valves, blockage of large-calibre leg veins, or both; and causes a range of symptoms including recurrent ulcers, pain and swelling. Most surgeons accept that well-fitted graduated compression stockings (GCS) and local care of wounds serve as adequate treatment for most people, but sometimes symptoms are not controlled and ulcers recur frequently, or they do not heal despite compliance with conservative measures. In these situations, in the presence of severe venous dysfunction, surgery has been advocated by some vascular surgeons. This is an update of the review first published in 2000.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical management of deep venous insufficiency on ulcer healing and recurrence, complications of surgery, clinical outcomes, quality of life (QoL) and pain.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases, and the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries to 23 June 2020.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical treatment versus another surgical procedure, usual care or no treatment, for people with deep venous insufficiency.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We were unable to pool data due to differences in outcomes reported and how these were measured. Outcomes of interest were ulcer healing and recurrence, complications of surgery, clinical changes, QoL and pain.

Main Results

We included four RCTs (273 participants) comparing valvuloplasty plus surgery of the superficial venous system with surgery of the superficial venous system for primary valvular incompetence. Follow-up was two to 10 years. All included studies investigated primary valve incompetence. No studies investigated other surgical procedures for the treatment of people with deep venous insufficiency or surgery for secondary valvular incompetence or venous obstruction. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded for risk of bias concerns and imprecision due to small numbers of included trials, participants and events. None of the studies reported ulcer healing or ulcer recurrence. One study included 27 participants with active venous ulceration at the time of surgery; the other three studies did not include people with ulcers. There were no major complications of surgery, no incidence of deep vein thrombosis and no deaths reported (very low-certainty evidence). All four studies reported clinical changes but the data could not be pooled due to different outcome measures and reporting of the data. Two studies assessed clinical changes using subjective and objective measurements, as specified in the clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathophysiological (CEAP) classification score (low-certainty evidence). One study reported mean CEAP severity scores and one study reported change in clinical class using CEAP. At baseline, the mean CEAP severity score was 18.1 (standard deviation (SD) 4.4) for limbs undergoing external valvuloplasty with surgery to the superficial venous system and 17.8 (SD 3.4) for limbs undergoing surgery to the superficial venous system only. At three years post-surgery, the mean CEAP severity score was 5.2 (SD 1.6) for limbs that had undergone external valvuloplasty with surgery to the superficial venous system and 9.2 (SD 2.6) for limbs that had undergone surgery to the superficial venous system only (low-certainty evidence). In another study, participants with progressive clinical dynamics over the five years preceding surgery had higher rates of improvement in clinical condition in the treatment group (valvuloplasty plus ligation) compared with the control group (ligation only) (80% versus 51%) after seven years of follow-up. Participants with stable preoperative clinical dynamics demonstrated similar rates of improvement in both groups (95% with valvuloplasty plus ligation versus 90% with ligation only) (low-certainty evidence). One study reported disease-specific QoL using cumulative scores from a 10-item visual analogue scale (VAS) and reported that in the limited anterior plication (LAP) plus superficial venous surgery group the score decreased from 49 to 11 at 10 years, compared to a decrease from 48 to 36 in participants treated with superficial venous surgery only (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported pain. Within the QoL VAS scale, one item was 'pain/discomfort' and scores decreased from 4 to 1 at 10 years for participants in the LAP plus superficial venous surgery group and increased from 2 to 3 at 10 years in participants treated with superficial venous surgery only. A second study reported that 'leg heaviness and pain' was resolved completely in 36/40 limbs treated with femoral vein external valvuloplasty plus high ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein (GSV) and percutaneous continuous circumsuture and 22/40 limbs treated with high ligation and stripping of GSV and percutaneous continuous circumsuture alone, at three years' follow-up (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We only identified evidence from four RCTs for valvuloplasty plus surgery of the superficial venous system for primary valvular incompetence. We found no studies investigating other surgical procedures for the treatment of people with deep venous insufficiency, or that included participants with secondary valvular incompetence or venous obstruction. None of the studies reported ulcer healing or recurrence, and few studies reported complications of surgery, clinical outcomes, QoL and pain (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Conclusions on the effectiveness of valvuloplasty for deep venous insufficiency cannot be made.

### Treatment of chronic venous insufficiency in Latin America [^112FgD2n]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Venous disease is common in Latin America, with an estimated 68.11% prevalence of chronic venous disease. The diverse social, political, and economic characteristics of the many nations that make up Latin America mean that different conditions affect how these diseases are diagnosed and treated, which may differ markedly from the way they are treated by the health care systems of the United States and Europe. Our goal was to review the current state of treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in Latin America.

Methods

This is a narrative review of the medical literature on the subject and synthesizes sometimes fragmentary information on CVI across a large and diverse region.

Results

CVI represents an unmet medical need in Latin America. Conservative treatments, such as compression stockings, may be used at first, and there are nonpharmacologic and complementary and alternative medicine approaches in use. Endovenous approaches, such as endovenous thermal ablation, have largely replaced surgical interventions. In Europe and the United States, such procedures are mainly carried out in ambulatory facilities, whereas they are mainly performed in the hospital in Latin America.

Conclusions

Recent strong economic growth in Latin America and improvements in social security and health care suggest that innovative approaches to chronic venous disease and CVI will be implemented.

### Echo-sclerosis hemodynamic conservative: a new technique for varicose vein treatment [^115bLGtq]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Treatment of venous insufficiency has been revolutionized by introduction of various less invasive procedures. The echo-sclerosis hemodynamic conservative (ESEC) technique is a completely new treatment of varicose veins that combines ultrasound-monitored sclerosis, innovative sclerotherapy findings, and hemodynamic principles. The objective of venous stasis suppression is achieved by the ESEC technique through a conservative and functional approach that preserves venous drainage and saphenous vessel integrity. The technique is efficient, simple, safe, in-office manageable, and easily repeatable, although it obviously requires training and skill. It may be considered as the primary treatment for most varicose patients. Evaluation of long-term results, with regard to comparison with other techniques, should assess cost efficacy from a lifelong point of view.

### The role of superficial venous surgery in the management of venous ulcers: a systematic review [^114WBPES]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The complicated natural history of venous ulcers requires the continued development and improvement of treatments to ensure the most effective management. Compression therapy or surgical correction of superficial venous incompetence (SVI) are currently the main methods employed for the treatment for venous ulceration (VU). This review compares and summates the healing and recurrence rates for each treatment modality used over the last thirty years.

Methods

Sixty-one articles investigating compression and superficial venous surgical treatments were obtained from a systematic search of electronic databases (Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar) and then an expanded reference list review. Patient demographics, CEAP classification, patterns of venous insufficiency, type of intervention, length of follow up, healing and recurrence rates for venous ulceration was assessed. Inadequate data in seven reports led to their exclusion. Recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) specifically comparing superficial surgery to compression therapy were reviewed and data from non-randomised and/or 'small' clinical studies prior to 2000 underwent summation analysis.

Results

Five RCTs since 2000 demonstrate a similar healing rate of VU with surgery and conservative compression treatments, but a reduction in ulcer recurrence rate with surgery. The effect of deep venous incompetence (DVI) on the ulcer healing is unclear, but sub-group analysis of long-term data from the ESCHAR trial suggests that although surgery results in a less impressive reduction in ulcer recurrence in patients with DVI, these patients appear to still benefit from surgery due to the haemodynamic and clinical benefits that result. The RCTs also highlight that a significant proportion of VU patients are unsuitable for surgical treatment. Summation of data from earlier studies (before 2000), included twenty-one studies employing conservative compression alone resulted in an overall healing rate of 65% (range 34–95%) and ulcer recurrence of 33% (range 0–100%). In thirty-one studies investigating superficial venous surgery, the overall rate of ulcer healing was 81% (range 40–100%) with a post-operative recurrence rate of 15% (range 0–55%). The duration of follow up care in the surgical studies was approximately twice as long as in the conservative studies, which would lend to more reliable recurrence data.

Conclusions

Evidence from the current literature, would suggest that superficial venous surgery is associated with similar rates of ulcer healing to compression alone, but with less recurrence. The effects of post-operative compression and DVI on the efficacy of surgery are still unclear.

### Diagnosis of chronic iliac venous obstruction [^115y9zF2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Stenting has become the first line of treatment for symptomatic chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction in patients with quality-of-life-impairing clinical manifestations who have failed conservative therapy. Patient selection for such intervention is, however, dependent on clear identification of relevant clinical manifestations and subsequent testing to confirm the diagnosis. In this regard, the physician engaged in management of such patients needs to be well-aware of symptoms and signs of chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction, and instruments used to grade chronic venous insufficiency and determine quality of life, in addition to diagnostic tests available and their individual roles. This review serves to provide an overview of the diagnosis of chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction and patient selection for stenting.

### Medical and surgical therapy for advanced chronic venous insufficiency [^116iXgn6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Venous ulceration is the most serious consequence of chronic venous insufficiency. The disease has been known for more than 3.5 millennia with wound care centers established as early as 1500 bc. Unfortunately, still today it is a very poorly managed medical condition by most physicians despite that a great deal has been learned about the pathogenesis and treatment for venous ulcerations. We find that many wound care clinics treat the wound and not the cause of the problem. In this article, we review the basic pathophysiology of advanced chronic venous insufficiency and review the most up-to-date information with regard to medical therapy and different options of surgical therapy to address the underlying venous pathology responsible for chronic ulcers.

Based on a theoretical hemodynamic model, CHIVA (conservative hemodynamic cure for venous insufficiency) is an ultrasound-guided, minimally invasive surgical strategy performed under local anesthesia for the treatment of patients with varicose vein disease. After careful duplex mapping, the surgeon performs flush ligation procedures at the proximal origin of key points of reflux while meticulously maintaining superficial venous drainage to prevent varicosity recurrence. The saphenous veins are preserved. The strategy has been shown in studies to be safe and effective.

### How to evaluate and choose the proper treatments for patients with lower extremity venous disease [^112ZKxGp]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

With an increasing number of interventional and noninterventional treatment options available for venous disorders, it is important that patients undergo a thorough and systematic evaluation. Clinical evaluation should include a personal and family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), varicose veins, and thrombophilia as these factors affect response and recurrence of disease. Patient should undergo diagnostic and quality of life assessment using validated tools to monitor response to treatment. Duplex ultrasound, both deep and superficial veins, documenting both obstruction and reflux is initial imaging with CT and MRI indicated to document pelvic, iliac vein, and IVC patency and pathology. Conservative therapy including compression, healthy lifestyle with diet, and exercise. New and novel interventional therapies are available for patients with venous disease with recent randomized controlled trials and multisocietal guidelines providing evidence-based recommendations for patients with superficial and deep venous disease. Since the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies post venous intervention is not well studied nor standardized, patients should routinely undergo evaluation for ongoing risk of recurrent thrombosis and stent occlusion. Finally, patients should be counseled that superficial and deep venous disease is a chronic and often progressive disease, and follow-up at least annually is recommended.

### Venous leg ulcers: a review of published assessment and treatment algorithms [^112z8LVU]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

Lower leg ulcers can be associated with various underlying pathologies (venous insufficiency, arterial disease, diabetes) or a combination thereof. Proper assessment and diagnosis are important to choose the appropriate course of treatment. When venous disease is suspected, Doppler and Duplex scanning should be used to evaluate the venous and arterial circulations and confirm diagnosis.

Compression is the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic CVD and for venous ulcers. It is underutilized because of a lack of clinician knowledge, unclear referral pathways, local unavailability of compression, and patient unwillingness to receive compression. A fear of adverse events can be another reason for underutilization, but those are very rare if compression is used correctly and contraindications are taken into consideration. Compression, however, is not a long-term solution by itself and the option of interventional correction should be offered early to prevent or slow disease progression and reduce recurrence.

The recognition of lower extremity venous disease as a significant cause of morbidity and lower quality of life, afflicting up to 25% of Western populations, has led to rapid and drastic improvements in treatment options as well as an increasing awareness of the disease. Superficial venous disease, a frequent medical problem encountered in clinical practices, is now a common reason for referral to providers offering a spectrum of interventions. Venous guidelines have been set forth by the American Venous Forum and Society for Vascular Surgery covering simple spider veins to chronic venous ulcerations. (Gloviczki et al.

### Negotiations with health insurers can lead to positive changes in policies toward venous disease [^117Q1KRY]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Many health insurance plan (HIP) policies toward the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) are outdated, formulated by administrators with the advice of physicians unfamiliar with CVI, and are not evidence-based. Denial of appropriate care by the HIP is frustrating to both the patient and provider, leading to delays in care and much time and effort in the appeals process. This led to meeting with the HIPs outlining the problems with their CVI policies. Through education of the HIP medical staff and reviewers, the specialists were then asked to review the policies and recommend changes. As a result of the collegial communications with the HIPs, a number of changes were made in their documents regarding treatment of CVI. These include (1) proper nomenclature for the venous systems, (2) the elimination of the need for chronic analgesic medication, (3) treatment for nonaxial varicose veins, (4) decrease in the required length of conservative (ie, elastic compression stockings) treatment prior to surgery from 12 weeks to 6 weeks, among other changes as well. While HIPs seek to reduce expenses and maximize operating margins, they are also tasked with facilitating appropriate access to necessary medical care for their members. Cooperation among physicians can lead to a dialogue between payers and providers, and can lead to positive changes in HIP policies toward the treatment of venous disease.

### Treatment of chronic venous disorder: a comprehensive review [^115MuoNG]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic venous disorder (CVD) is highly prevalent vascular disorder affecting up to 45% of the general population, with clinical manifestations ranging from teleangiectasias to venous leg ulcers (VLUs). We examined the currently available data in order to provide an updated, comprehensive review on treatment options of CVD. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials, and OpenGrey databases for relevant articles in English published until November 2020. Compression treatment is the mainstay of conservative treatment. Pharmacological treatment can provide significant symptomatic relief and hence it should be considered as part of conservative treatment. Transcutaneous Lacer treatment (TCL) is a safe and effective alternative option to sclerotherapy for treatment of C1 stage. High ligation and stripping (HL/S), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), endovenous thermal ablation (EVTA) systems and non thermal non tumescent ablation (NTNT) systems are safe and efficacious first-line options for treatment of saphenous insufficiency. Interventional treatment of co-existing incompetent perforator veins (IPVs) is not supported by contemporary evidence. Regarding deep venous insufficiency (DVI), treatment of symptomatic femoroiliocaval occlusive venous disease refractory to conservative treatment with percutaneous transluminal venoplasty stenting has produced encouraging results.

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition related to chronic venous disease that may progress to venous leg ulceration and impair quality of life of those affected. Treatments such as physical exercise may be useful to reduce CVI symptoms. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of physical exercise programmes for the treatment of individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 28 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing exercise programmes with no exercise in people with non-ulcerated CVI.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were intensity of disease signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, and incidence of venous leg ulcer. Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, exercise capacity, muscle strength, incidence of surgical intervention, and ankle joint mobility. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included five RCTs involving 146 participants. The studies compared a physical exercise group with a control group that did not perform a structured exercise programme. The exercise protocols differed between studies. We assessed three studies to be at an overall unclear risk of bias, one study at overall high risk of bias, and one study at overall low risk of bias. We were not able to combine data in meta-analysis as studies did not report all outcomes, and different methods were used to measure and report outcomes. Two studies reported intensity of CVI disease signs and symptoms using a validated scale. There was no clear difference in signs and symptoms between groups in baseline to six months after treatment (Venous Clinical Severity Score mean difference (MD) -0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.02 to 2.26; 28 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), and we are uncertain if exercise alters the intensity of signs and symptoms eight weeks after treatment (MD -4.07, 95% CI -6.53 to -1.61; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in ejection fraction between groups from baseline to six months follow-up (MD 4.88, 95% CI -1.82 to 11.58; 28 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Three studies reported on venous refilling time. We are uncertain if there is an improvement in venous refilling time between groups for baseline to six-month changes (MD 10.70 seconds, 95% CI 8.86 to 12.54; 23 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence) or baseline to eight-week change (MD 9.15 seconds, 95% CI 5.53 to 12.77 for right side; MD 7.25 seconds, 95% CI 5.23 to 9.27 for left side; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in venous refilling index for baseline to six-month changes (MD 0.57 mL/min, 95% CI -0.96 to 2.10; 28 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). No included studies reported the incidence of venous leg ulcers. One study reported health-related quality of life using validated instruments (Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study (VEINES) and 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS)). We are uncertain if exercise alters baseline to six-month changes in health-related quality of life between groups (VEINES-QOL: MD 4.60, 95% CI 0.78 to 8.42; SF-36 PCS: MD 5.40, 95% CI 0.63 to 10.17; SF-36 MCS: MD 0.40, 95% CI -3.85 to 4.65; 40 participants, 1 study; all very low-certainty evidence). Another study used the Chronic Venous Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20), and we are uncertain if exercise alters baseline to eight-week changes in health-related quality of life between groups (MD 39.36, 95% CI 30.18 to 48.54; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported no differences between groups without presenting data. There was no clear difference between groups in exercise capacity measured as time on treadmill (baseline to six-month changes) (MD -0.53 minutes, 95% CI -5.25 to 4.19; 35 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise improves exercise capacity as assessed by the 6-minute walking test (MD 77.74 metres, 95% CI 58.93 to 96.55; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Muscle strength was measured using dynamometry or using heel lifts counts. We are uncertain if exercise increases peak torque/body weight (120 revolutions per minute) (changes from baseline to six months MD 3.10 ft-lb, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.22; 29 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference between groups in baseline to eight-week change in strength measured by a hand dynamometer (MD 12.24 lb, 95% CI -7.61 to 32.09 for the right side; MD 11.25, 95% CI -14.10 to 36.60 for the left side; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if there is an increase in heel lifts (n) (baseline to six-month changes) between groups (MD 7.70, 95% CI 0.94 to 14.46; 39 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference between groups in ankle mobility measured during dynamometry (baseline to six-month change MD -1.40 degrees, 95% CI -4.77 to 1.97; 29 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise increases plantar flexion measured by a goniometer (baseline to eight-week change MD 12.13 degrees, 95% CI 8.28 to 15.98 for right leg; MD 10.95 degrees, 95% CI 7.93 to 13.97 for left leg; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). In all cases, we downgraded the certainty of evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of physical exercise in people with chronic venous disease. Future research into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of exercise protocols (intensity, frequency, and time), sample size, blinding, and homogeneity according to the severity of disease.

### Efficacy of complex decongestive therapy on venous flow, internal saphenous diameter, edema, fat mass of the limbs and quality of life in patients with chronic venous insufficiency: a randomized clinical trial [^115DHSGU]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: A single-blind randomized controlled trial.
- **Key Findings**: Complex decongestive therapy improves the quality of life in patients with mild and moderate chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) (C2-C4), and the symptoms that these patients develop, such as pain and heaviness in the lower limbs. These results are related to the improvement of venous flow velocity in superficial and deep veins and the decrease in the diameter of the internal saphenous vein and the fat mass of the limbs.
- **Take Home Message**: Patients with CVI may benefit from complex decongestive therapy treatment because one of the main conservative treatments to relieve CVI symptoms safely and without side effects.

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) of the lower extremities is associated with a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic but cosmetic problems to severe symptoms. This includes telangiectasis (or spider veins), reticular veins, varicose veins, edema, pigmentation and/or eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, atrophie blanche, and venous ulceration. There is a high prevalence of CVI worldwide, estimated to be between 22.00% and 25.95%. However, when talking about chronic venous disease in general, taking into account the milder stages of the disease, it is estimated that the prevalence is even higher, between 63.69% and 69.1%. This disease entails great costs for society and a decrease in productivity.

Complex decongestive therapy (CDT) is the conservative treatment of choice for the treatment of upper and lower limb lymphedema. It is composed of manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), multilayer bandages, skin care, and active kinesitherapy; it can also be complemented with intermittent pneumatic pressotherapy and neuromuscular bandaging. This treatment can also be applied to patients with other circulatory return problems, such as CVI. Although these effects have been little studied, the effectiveness of CDT in reducing symptoms such as heaviness, pain and edema, improving venous flow (VF) and mobility of the joints of the lower extremity, and increasing the quality of life (QoL) of the patient has been demonstrated. The efficacy of the techniques that make up CDT has also been proven separately, including MLD, intermittent pneumatic pressotherapy, active kinesitherapy or therapeutic exercise, and neuromuscular taping.

### 2025 SCAI clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic venous disease: this statement was endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine (SVM) [^111aDM9P]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

SCAI chronic venous disease guidelines — symptomatic varicose veins without truncal vein reflux: the SCAI guideline panel suggests phlebectomy plus conservative management rather than conservative management alone (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that patients who have recurrent symptomatic varicose veins despite treatment of truncal veins and patients without truncal vein reflux but with symptomatic tributary varicose veins may prefer phlebectomy. The guideline panel found no studies that directly compared phlebectomy vs conservative management or vs placebo and was unable to quantitatively assess these data, but the recurrence rate of symptomatic varicosities was lower after phlebectomy than with sclerotherapy both at 1 year (2.1% vs 25%) and at 2 years (2.1% vs 37.5%). Other considerations on the page state that phlebectomy is typically an adjunctive treatment and often requires only local anesthesia, can be performed in an outpatient or office setting, and has a relatively short procedure time with fast recovery.

### Current management of venous ulceration [^112VTiPv]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

It has been estimated that chronic venous insufficiency affects 10 to 35 percent of the entire U.S. population and that 4 percent of people older than 65 have active venous ulcers. The high prevalence of the disease results in an annual expenditure of more than 1 billion dollars a year to the U.S. health care system. To have a rational approach toward patients with venous ulcers, it is important to understand the pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of the disease process, in order to initiate appropriate treatment and prevent venous ulcer recurrence.

### 2025 SCAI clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic venous disease: this statement was endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine (SVM) [^114YzvR4]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

Chronic venous disease — conservative and interventional management is described, stating that the first line of treatment is conservative therapy including compression therapy, venotonic medications, lifestyle changes, weight loss if applicable, and wound care for ulcerative disease; compression garments may be bandages, stockings, Velcro wraps, pneumatic pumps, or combinations, yet conservative therapy may not resolve all symptoms and poor adherence is a well-documented limitation. For superficial venous reflux when conservative therapy fails to control symptoms, invasive treatment has included resection or closure of incompetent truncal veins (great saphenous vein [GSV], small saphenous vein [SSV], accessory saphenous vein) or perforator veins, and ablation has largely replaced surgical stripping. Ablation is divided into thermal and nonthermal modalities; thermal ablation uses radiofrequency or laser energy via a narrow fiber inserted into the target vein, while nonthermal options include mechanochemical ablation, cyanoacrylate adhesive ablation, and foam sclerotherapy, and nonthermal techniques can be complicated by DVT, although it is rare.

Conservative hemodynamic treatment of venous insufficiency (CHIVA) — guideline and evidence — carries "Grade of recommendation 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence B (moderate)" and is noted as appropriate "if performed by a physician who is familiar with the strategy", while the text also states that "CHIVA should only be performed by well qualified surgeons who are dedicated experts in venous hemodynamics and DUS". A 2021 review included six RCTs and 1160 patients and concluded CHIVA may make little or no difference in recurrence compared with stripping (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.46–1.20), RFA (RR, 2.02; 95% CI, 0.74–5.53), or EVLA (RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.01–4.06). In a prospective study of 58 patients, ligation eliminated GSV reflux in all but 5 patients (8%), but saphenous reflux returned in 88% of limbs by 6 months and 46 patients required a second operation. An RCT in 214 limbs reported clinical recurrence at 24 months of 4.3%, 7.2%, and 14.7% for HL&S, RFA, and CHIVA, respectively, with ultrasound recurrences of 7.1%, 13%, and 46.7%; with 80% power, the study found RFA to be noninferior to CHIVA in clinical recurrence.

### Appropriateness of care in superficial venous disease [^113Lxd19]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic superficial venous disease, including superficial venous insufficiency, superficial venous thrombosis, and aneurysms, are prevalent conditions that affect millions of individuals worldwide. With chronic venous insufficiency specifically, the advent of office-based minimally invasive procedures in recent decades has significantly expanded access to outpatient treatment. However, as venous insufficiency is rarely life- or limb-threatening, the clinical diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment indications should be considered carefully when recommending elective intervention. Appropriateness of care guidelines intend to aid providers and patients in the decision-making process, based on the available evidence in the scientific literature, to select the best care for the patient when treating their superficial venous disease.

### Treatment of primary varicose veins has changed with the introduction of new techniques [^113PYs4e]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

New technologies have produced a revolution in primary varicose vein treatments. Duplex ultrasound is now used for preoperative diagnosis, postoperative surveillance, and during many procedures. Ultrasound has also altered our understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic venous disease. Laser and radiofrequency saphenous ablations are common. Classic techniques, such as sclerotherapy, high ligation, stripping, and phlebectomy, have been improved. Magnetic resonance venography, computed tomographic venography, and intravascular ultrasound have improved diagnostic capabilities. New strategies like ambulatory selective varices ablation under local anesthesia (ASVAL) and conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency (CHIVA) raise important questions about how to manage these patients.

### The effect of a connexin43-based peptide on the healing of chronic venous leg ulcers: a multicenter, randomized trial [^116PoUwv]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) develop as a result of chronic venous insufficiency, leading to venous hypertension and small vessel damage. Persistent inflammation within the extracellular matrix of the wound bed and the detrimental upregulation of connexins contribute to dysfunction of wound fibroblasts and keratinocytes and the underlying pathophysiology associated with an impaired wound-healing response in chronic VLUs. In industrialized countries, VLUs affect ∼3% of people over 65 years of age. Given that therapeutic intervention extending beyond 1 year is common, and recurrence rates are ∼60–70%, VLUs present a substantial economic and societal burden on the individual, family, and health-care system.

Conventional treatment protocols involving infection control, nonadherent wound dressing, and limb compression remain the cornerstone of conservative treatment, healing between 30 and 75% of VLUs. The Wound Healing Society suggests incorporation of adjunctive therapies in the treatment of VLUs that remain unresponsive to standard-of-care (SOC) treatment beyond 4 weeks. Randomized controlled trials demonstrate the potential of advanced wound care matrices, such as Apligraf (Organogenesis Inc. Canton, MA). However, such living skin equivalents remain cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive, offer modest improvement over SOC, and may not address the underlying pathophysiology of chronic ulcers.

### Conservative management of symptomatic and / or complicated haemorrhoids in pregnancy and the puerperium [^113F84F6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Haemorrhoids (piles) are swollen veins at or near the anus, normally asymptomatic. They do not constitute a disease, unless they become symptomatic. Pregnancy and the puerperium predispose to symptomatic haemorrhoids, being the most common ano-rectal disease at these stages. Symptoms are usually mild and transient and include intermittent bleeding from the anus and pain. Depending on the degree of pain, quality of life could be affected, varying from mild discomfort to real difficulty in dealing with the activities of everyday life. Treatment during pregnancy is mainly directed to the relief of symptoms, especially pain control. The so-called conservative management includes dietary modifications, stimulants or depressants of the bowel transit, local treatment, and phlebotonics (drugs that cause decreased capillary fragility, improving the microcirculation in venous insufficiency). For many women, symptoms will resolve spontaneously soon after birth, and so any corrective treatment is usually deferred to some time after birth. Thus, the objective of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of conservative management of piles during pregnancy and the puerperium.

Objectives

To determine the possible benefits, risks and side-effects of the conservative management of symptomatic haemorrhoids during pregnancy and the puerperium.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (30 June 2004).

Selection Criteria

Randomised-controlled trials comparing any of the conservative treatments for symptomatic haemorrhoids during pregnancy and the puerperium (such as dietary modifications, stimulant/depressant of the bowel transit, local treatments, drugs that improve the microcirculation in venous insufficiency) with a placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed a methodological assessment for deciding which studies to include/exclude from the review and extracted data.

Main Results

From 10 potentially eligible studies, two were included in this review (150 women). Both compared oral rutosides against placebo. Rutosides seem to be effective in reducing the signs identified by the healthcare provider, and symptoms and signs reported by women, of haemorrhoidal disease. For the outcome no response to treatment: relative risk 0.07, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.20. Regarding perinatal outcomes, one fetal death and one congenital malformation (possible not related to exposure) were reported in the control and treatment group respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

Although the treatment with oral hydroxyethylrutosides looks promising for symptom relief in first and second degree haemorrhoids, its use cannot be recommended until new evidence reassures women and their clinicians about their safety. The most commonly used approaches, such as dietary modifications and local treatments, were not properly evaluated during pregnancy and the puerperium.

### 2025 SCAI clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic venous disease: this statement was endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine (SVM) [^114C7zfM]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

SCAI chronic venous disease guidelines — venous ulcers without truncal vein reflux: the SCAI guideline panel suggests foam sclerotherapy plus conservative management rather than conservative management alone (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Remarks specify that patients with recurrent ulcers or ulcers that do not respond to conservative management may prefer sclerotherapy and that patients with nonhealing ulcers where mixed etiology is suspected (eg, with concomitant PAD) may benefit from arterial revascularization. Evidence includes a single randomized controlled trial from 1973 that directly compared sclerotherapy vs compression therapy in which the treatment group received 0.5 mL sodium tetradecyl sulfate and an increase in ulcers after treatment in the sclerotherapy group was reported (RR, 13.63; 95% CI, 0.07–240.13), and the panel agreed that sclerotherapy is likely more beneficial in this patient population than in patients with symptomatic varicose veins.

### Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg [^114XmjwQ]. AVLS (2013). Medium credibility.

Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg — this introductory page outlines the scope and evidence approach, stating that the American College of Phlebology prepared a summation document reflecting evidence-based recommendations from the Gloviczki paper and other current studies, with additional guidance based on ACP expert consensus where research is sparse yet therapy is considered standard of care. It notes that ultrasound, endovenous ablation devices, foam sclerotherapy and tumescent anesthesia have moved treatment from the operating room to office or radiology settings and that medical necessity policy for chronic venous disease (CVD) has become fragmented and inconsistent across the U.S. The authors suggest that evidence based medical necessity should not vary greatly by geography or insurer and introduce the concept of "medically significant venous insufficiency" or "evidence-based medical significance". They state that medical evidence should determine the definition of medically significant venous insufficiency using a combination of CEAP and VCSS classifications and propose that payers retain this evidence-based definition while choosing whether it becomes a "covered benefit" or a "non-covered benefit", with medical necessity guidelines to follow in summary format.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^113x6GpC]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Venous leg ulcer guideline development methodology — The Venous Ulcer Guidelines Committee was divided into six sub-committee sections (diagnosis; compression; surgery/endovascular; wound care; ancillary; and prevention) and developed key clinical questions: what is the best treatment for active (CEAP C6) venous ulcer, the best treatment for healed venous ulcer (CEAP C5), the best method for preventing recurrence of venous ulcers, and whether progression from CEAP C4 to CEAP C6/C5 can be prevented. The surgery/endovascular and compression sections were selected for a de novo development of specific guideline recommendations, and the committee commissioned an independent group to conduct two systematic reviews evaluating different compression strategies and endovascular and open surgical approaches with a priori protocols. To minimize heterogeneity, the review specified that language "all would be included", limited studies to randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials with cohort, and retrospective large observational case series published in peer-reviewed journals, and stated the target audience is specialists who treat vascular disease and wounds.

### Physical exercise for the treatment of non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency [^116hK4y5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common disease that causes discomfort and impairs the quality of life of affected persons. Treatments such as physical exercise that aim to increase the movement of the ankle joint and strengthen the muscle pump in the calf of the leg may be useful to reduce the symptoms of CVI.

Objectives

To assess and summarise the existing clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of physical exercise programmes for the treatment of individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (May 2016). In addition, the CIS searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) and trial databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing exercise with no exercise programmes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results and selected eligible studies. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We summarised and double-checked details from included studies. We attempted to contact trial authors for missing data, but obtained no further information.

Main Results

We included two trials involving 54 participants with CVI. Many of our review outcomes were not reported or reported by only one of the two studies. The intensity of disease signs and symptoms was measured in both studies but using different scales; we were therefore unable to pool the data. One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups whereas the second reported a reduction in symptoms in the exercise group. In one study, increases in change in ejection fraction compared with baseline (mean difference (MD) 4.88%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.16 to 6.60; 30 participants; P < 0.00001), half venous refilling time (MD 4.20 seconds, 95% CI 3.28 to 5.12; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) and total venous refilling time (MD 9.40 seconds, 95% CI 7.77 to 11.03; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) were observed in the exercise group compared with the control group. One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups with regard to quality of life or ankle range of motion. Although muscle strength assessed by dynamometry at slow speed did not differ between the two groups in this study, variable peak torque at fast speed was lower in the control group than in the exercise group (2.8 ± 0.9 compared with -0.3 ± 0.6, P < 0.03). The incidence of venous leg ulcers, incidence of surgical intervention to treat symptoms related to CVI and exercise capacity were not assessed or reported in either of the included trials. We rated both included studies as at high risk of bias; hence, these data should be interpreted carefully. Due to the small number of studies and small sample size, we were not able to verify indirectness and publication bias. Therefore, we judged the overall quality of evidence as very low according to the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence available to assess the efficacy of physical exercise in people with CVI. Future research into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of exercise protocols (intensity, frequency and time), sample size, blinding and homogeneity according to the severity of disease.

### Venous leg ulcers: a review of published assessment and treatment algorithms [^1168pUb9]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conservative treatment primarily consists of compression therapy and supportive measures (physical therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, and the use of phlebotonics for symptom relief). Other approaches include sclerotherapy, surgical procedures, and endovenous thermal and chemical procedures. These more invasive approaches are often reserved for patients who do not respond satisfactorily to conservative measures, although it has been suggested that earlier use of venous ablation should be considered in symptomatic patients. Early treatment aimed at preventing venous hypertension, reflux, and inflammation could attenuate symptoms and reduce the risk of ulceration if performed early in the course of CVD. The concept of surgical intervention remains valid once an ulcer is present: it is not sufficient to treat the ulcer because the cause of the problem also needs to be addressed. Supporting this idea, a randomized controlled trial, including 500 patients demonstrated that surgery to correct superficial venous reflux combined with compression reduces ulcer recurrence compared with compression alone.

Once a VLU is present (examples shown in Fig. 2), multiple assessment and treatment algorithms have been proposed to optimally manage the condition. An important factor to consider when managing these wounds is the possibility of concomitant arterial disease: a mixed etiology is estimated to affect up to 26% of patients with lower extremity ulcerations. This article will review the literature on VLUs, specifically treatment algorithms, guidelines, and guidance documents, and provide an up-to-date educational resource for practitioners new to the field.

Great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux — ablation plus compression versus conservative therapy: Three studies compared conservative therapy plus GSV ablation (with or without small saphenous vein [SSV] reflux) with conservative therapy alone, and ablation probably decreases the time to ulcer healing (MD, 31.73 fewer days; 95% CI, 45.1–18.3 fewer days) with lower ulcer recurrence at 1 year (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.42–1.13) and 2 years (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18–0.81). In symptomatic venous insufficiency, symptoms improved at 6 weeks (MD, 2.1 lower; 95% CI, 2.9 lower to 1.2 lower). Reported nerve injury rates were 10.6% (delayed ablation group) to 12.5% (early intervention group). Procedural considerations include that saphenous segments with significant tortuosity may be best approached by foam sclerotherapy; nonthermal ablation can be considered for very superficial veins to reduce the risk of skin thermal injury; and nonthermal techniques may reduce the risk of saphenous nerve injury when treating below-knee GSV; compression stockings after thermal ablation result in reduced postprocedural pain without affecting procedural outcomes. Routine follow-up ultrasound to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) may be unnecessary in low-risk patients undergoing thermal ablation, though postprocedural ultrasound monitoring may be appropriate if foam is used. The guideline panel determined there is a net benefit for ablation therapy in addition to compression therapy as opposed to conservative therapy alone in patients with symptomatic GSV reflux with or without SSV reflux, with the greatest benefit in venous ulceration, and in patients without ulcers, the risks and benefits should be discussed and patient values considered as part of a shared decision making process.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic venous insufficiency, more specifically with respect to compression stockings, after interventional treatment, ESVS 2022 guidelines recommend to consider offering postprocedural compression treatment in patients with superficial venous incompetence following ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy or endovenous thermal ablation of a saphenous trunk.

### Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg [^111uSB1d]. AVLS (2013). Medium credibility.

Summary of guidelines for treatment of venous disease — compression therapy: We recommend against compression therapy as a prerequisite therapy for symptomatic venous reflux disease when other definitive treatments such as endovenous ablation are appropriate, and after interventional treatment, we recommend the use of a compression garment in the postoperative period; there is extra benefit to the patient in the form of reduced pain after use of compression, and the compression dosage and duration is at the discretion and clinical judgment of the treating physician. Compression therapy is an effective method for the management of symptoms related to superficial disease but it does not correct the source of reflux, and when patients have a correctable source of reflux definitive treatment should also be offered unless it is contraindicated or unwanted. Superficial venous insufficiency is a chronic disease and we recommend that patients with this disease be counseled to wear a compression garment even after definite treatment has been provided, and we suggest the treatment of some CEAP C2 patients with isolated varices by medical compression hose alone, with a short 1–2 week trial of compression hose appropriate where an alternative etiology of symptoms is considered.

SCAI chronic venous disease — background and methods state that chronic venous disease (CVD) affects over 25 million adults in the United States with quality-of-life symptoms, and treatments range from compression and wound care to invasive options. These guidelines are based on original systematic reviews with support from the Evidence Foundation and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and formulate recommendations. The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong (the guideline panel recommends…) or conditional (the guideline panel suggests…), and two algorithms for the management of symptomatic varicose veins and venous ulcer disease were created to facilitate implementation.

Varicose veins without truncal vein reflux — For patients with symptomatic varicose veins without truncal vein reflux and for patients with venous ulcers without truncal vein reflux, the SCAI guideline panel suggests foam sclerotherapy plus conservative management rather than conservative management alone (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Most patients with symptomatic varicose veins would prefer sclerotherapy over conservative therapy, but some may not, and hyperpigmentation can occur following sclerotherapy and, in some cases, may be permanent.

### Outcomes of free flap reconstruction for chronic venous ulceration in the lower limb: a systematic review [^112BRdrk]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The mainstay of treatment for venous ulceration is conservative wound management and lifelong compression therapy. For patients with recalcitrant ulcers, free flap reconstruction has been proposed as a treatment option to reconstruct the diseased soft tissues as well as the underlying insufficient venous system. This review systematically evaluates the outcomes of free flap reconstruction for chronic venous ulcers in the lower limb.

Method

A protocol was developed a priori and registered on the PROSPERO database. A systematic search of literature was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), clinical trials registries, and OpenGrey from inception to April 2020 according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Studies of patients undergoing free tissue transfer reconstruction for chronic venous ulcers in the lower limb were included.

Results

A total of 5 noncomparative cohort studies featuring 56 patients with 62 recalcitrant venous ulcers treated with 64 free flaps who had a mean age of 50 years (range, 17–76 years) were included, and a narrative analysis undertaken. Mean defect size following ulcer debridement was 153.3 cm² (range, 24–600 cm²). Defects were reconstructed with muscle (n = 39 [60.9%]), fasciocutaneous (n = 23 [35.9%]), and visceral (n = 2 [3.1%]) free flaps, with latissimus dorsi (n = 16, 25%) and rectus abdominis flaps (n = 16, 25%) being the most frequently used. Mean follow-up ranged from 24 to 125 months. Pooled flap survival rate was 95%. No recurrence within the territory of the flap was reported, but there were 20 instances (35.7%) of new ulcers outside of the flap boundaries.

Conclusion

There is currently an absence of evidence to support the use of free flap reconstruction for recalcitrant venous ulcers compared with conventional management. Although evidence suggests that it is technically feasible, there is no evidence to suggest it prevents ulceration outside the reconstructed region. Further studies are necessary to evaluate its effectiveness for venous ulcers in the lower limb.

Guideline 2 — For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reflux in the great or small saphenous vein who are candidates for intervention, we recommend superficial venous intervention over long-term compression stockings (Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of evidence: B (moderate)). For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reflux in the anterior accessory or posterior accessory great saphenous vein who are candidates for intervention, we suggest superficial venous intervention over compression stockings (Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of evidence: C (low to very low)). For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reflux in the superficial truncal veins, we suggest compression therapy for primary treatment if the patient's ambulatory status and underlying medical conditions warrant a conservative approach or, if the patient prefers conservative treatment, for either a trial period or definitive management (Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of evidence: C (low to very low)).

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^117Jk3Tp]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Operative/endovascular management for venous leg ulcers — The quality of evidence to support recommendations for operative and endovascular management is limited to level C evidence, attributed to the absence of comparative prospective RCTs, with the exception of a few studies that address treatment of superficial venous disease. Even the data in the treatment of superficial insufficiency, as suggested by the commissioned meta-analysis, are limited in scope, and the data derived from open procedures (ligation and stripping RCTs) have been extrapolated to results that might be achieved with thermal ablation. Many recommendations regarding healed patients or patients with potential VLU are based on extrapolations from the data obtained from patients with active VLUs, and each specific patient condition needs focused investigation to determine what "best care" is. Several methods of great and small saphenous ablation are under investigation and may provide even less risk for the benefits provided. Deep venous reconstruction has often been reserved for cases in which nothing else has been successful; this treatment option has been a forgotten therapeutic alternative for patients with deep venous insufficiency in whom nonsurgical and superficial venous intervention has been unsuccessful, and there is room to reinvestigate this assumption by comparing repair of deep venous insufficiency vs outflow obstruction interventions in patients who have both conditions.

SCAI chronic venous disease — great saphenous vein (GSV) with or without small saphenous vein (SSV) reflux: For patients with symptomatic GSV with or without SSV reflux, the SCAI guideline panel suggests ablation therapy plus conservative management rather than conservative management alone (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Remarks add that patients without ulcers may reasonably choose conservative management to avoid procedural complications and uncertain benefits; patients with ulcers, disabling symptoms, or failed conservative therapy may prefer ablation therapy; and GSV intervention may affect future bypass conduit suitability, with dilated GSVs possibly unsuitable.

AVM arteriovenous malformation

a Exceptional (asymptomatic lesions with indication for treatment): AVMs of the face in case of functional/aesthetic impairment, AVMs of distal extremities with risk of ischemia due to shunting

Multimodal Treatment

As the study is conducted as an observational trial, all treatment procedures are considered part of the clinical routine. Due to the multimodal treatment in everyday practice, certain comparisons of the most frequent treatment approaches are anticipated at the end. Therapy options being amenable for inclusion include image-guided minimally invasive intervention (embolization), surgery (resection and if necessary plastic reconstruction), medical therapy and conservative treatment including compression therapy. Venous hypertension, insufficiency, and ulcer may be the results of a progredient/decompensated symptomatic AVM caused by AV shunting, increased vein perfusion, and consequent vessel wall weakness. Yet, also in compensated clinical stages, compression can reduce the volume of the venous component of the AVM and alter hemodynamics, thereby potentially reducing pain, hyperhidrosis, and the feeling of heaviness and pressure, especially in the lower extremities.

Venous leg ulcer (VLU) primary prevention — evidence and gaps are summarized as follows: There is "moderate-quality evidence that increased physical activity, improved mobility, and foot exercises decrease VLU recurrence", though "more standardization is required". "Cost-effectiveness of VLU prevention is difficult to rigorously prove" due to trial size and heterogeneity in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). "Adequate compression in a compliant patient with C1-4 disease and the use of evidence-based therapies for treatment with prevention of DVT recurrence should go a long way toward decreasing the incidence of VLU". However, "there is a knowledge gap as to whether adequate compression and skin care or, alternatively, surgical intervention for superficial venous incompetence prevents progression to another clinical disease level, specifically from C4 to C6".
