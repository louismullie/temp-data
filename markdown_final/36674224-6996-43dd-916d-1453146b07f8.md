## Question

Depakote for dementia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Depakote (divalproex sodium) should be used for agitation or behavioral symptoms in dementia, and if so, how to approach dosing, monitoring, and alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether this is an approved indication. Then, I should review randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses for efficacy. Next, I will examine safety signals, especially in older adults with dementia. After that, I need to check major guidelines for consensus recommendations. Finally, I will consider practical prescribing details if, despite the evidence, a cautious off-label trial is contemplated, and I will outline safer, evidence-based alternatives and a decision framework.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status so I don't jump to conclusions. Depakote is FDA-approved for epilepsy, bipolar mania, and migraine prevention; there is no FDA approval for dementia-related agitation or behavioral symptoms, so any use in dementia would be off-label, which already lowers the evidentiary bar I should accept for routine practice [^115MQwEu] [^111tGydh] [^1154grH1].

> Next, I should review the efficacy data. Wait, let me verify the highest-quality syntheses first. Multiple randomized, placebo-controlled trials and Cochrane meta-analyses consistently show no meaningful benefit of valproate preparations for agitation in dementia, with pooled analyses demonstrating little or no effect on agitation scales and, in some cases, worse functional outcomes compared with placebo, despite adequate adherence and therapeutic-level attempts in some studies [^112Q3Sbs] [^1135Ue7r] [^112o2rYT].

> Hold on, I should verify safety signals because even a modest benefit might be acceptable if risks were low; here, the opposite is true. In elderly patients with dementia, valproate is associated with significantly higher rates of somnolence, gait disturbance, tremor, and gastrointestinal adverse effects, and in a large multicenter trial, valproate-treated participants had accelerated brain volume loss over 12 months with greater hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy and a trend toward faster MMSE decline, raising concern for neurotoxicity in this population [^111XxNcy] [^115n8Gmq] [^1144nQ8c].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure I'm aligned with consensus. The American Psychiatric Association advises against routine use of valproate for agitation in dementia, citing lack of efficacy and unfavorable risk profile, and recommends nonpharmacologic strategies first with antipsychotics reserved for severe, dangerous, or highly distressing symptoms; the Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health explicitly recommends do not use valproic acid or divalproex for agitation in dementia, reflecting contemporary evidence and safety concerns [^113gWzYH] [^114iyVd5] [^117MEqXh].

> But wait, what if a clinician is considering a cautious off-label trial despite this? I should double-check dosing guidance for geriatric patients if, after nonpharmacologic measures and antipsychotic trials, valproate is still contemplated. FDA labeling advises reduced starting doses in older adults due to lower clearance and higher free fractions, slower titration, and close monitoring for somnolence, dehydration, and nutritional intake; typical geriatric starting doses cited in practice guidelines are 125–250 mg/day with cautious titration and early level checks, recognizing that most dementia trials used 480–1000 mg/day without clear benefit [^111m9ygu] [^1139rHri] [^113gWzYH].

> I will now examine monitoring requirements so I don't miss key safety labs. Baseline and periodic liver function tests are essential given hepatotoxicity risk, complete blood counts are needed to detect thrombocytopenia, and valproate levels can be checked if used, though the relationship between total levels and clinical effect is imperfect due to nonlinear protein binding; in elderly patients, I should also monitor for hyponatremia, hyperammonemia, and drug interactions, including with carbapenems that can dramatically lower valproate levels and precipitate breakthrough events [^112YbA7u] [^113KrByp] [^1144nQ8c].

> Let me consider alternatives with better evidence so I can offer a practical path. Nonpharmacologic environmental and behavioral interventions are first-line for agitation; if medication is required, short-term, low-dose second-generation antipsychotics such as risperidone have modest efficacy but carry a boxed warning for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, so they should be used only when benefits outweigh risks, at the lowest effective dose, with explicit informed consent, time-limited trials, and scheduled attempts to taper and discontinue; memantine is reasonable for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease and may help some behavioral symptoms, and SSRIs can be considered when depression or anxiety contribute to agitation, again with careful monitoring [^112M2s9o] [^116hnsRH] [^1158gnEH] [^116xAqPi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a small subgroup with secondary mania where valproate could help, but I should verify that. The largest randomized trial in nursing home residents with Alzheimer's and secondary mania showed no superiority of divalproex over placebo, and subsequent reviews concluded that even in these subgroups, evidence of benefit is lacking, reinforcing that routine valproate use for dementia-related agitation is not supported [^112o2rYT] [^112Q3Sbs].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Depakote is not FDA-approved for dementia-related agitation, randomized trials and meta-analyses show no consistent efficacy, and safety concerns are heightened in older adults with dementia, including sedation, falls, and possible accelerated brain atrophy; major guidelines recommend against routine use, so valproate should generally be avoided for this indication, with any off-label trial reserved for exceptional, refractory cases after nonpharmacologic and antipsychotic strategies fail, using the lowest feasible dose, slow titration, and vigilant monitoring with a predefined stop criteria if no benefit emerges [^115MQwEu] [^112Q3Sbs] [^114iyVd5] [^111XxNcy].

---

Depakote (divalproex sodium) is **not recommended** for dementia-related agitation due to **lack of efficacy** and significant adverse effects, including sedation, gait disturbance, tremor, and accelerated brain volume loss [^112Q3Sbs] [^111XxNcy]. It is **not FDA-approved** for dementia-related agitation, and major guidelines (APA, CCSMH) advise against its use [^112o2rYT] [^114iyVd5]. If used off-label, start low (125–250 mg/day), titrate slowly, and monitor closely for adverse effects and drug interactions [^113gWzYH] [^111m9ygu].

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses show **no significant benefit** of divalproex for agitation in dementia:

- **Cochrane review (2018)**: No improvement in agitation vs placebo; higher adverse event rates (sedation, GI symptoms, infections) [^112Q3Sbs].
- **APA guidelines (2007)**: Four placebo-controlled trials showed no efficacy; routine use not recommended [^113gWzYH].
- **JAMA trial (2011)**: No benefit; higher somnolence, gait disturbance, tremor, diarrhea, weakness; accelerated brain volume loss over 12 months [^111XxNcy].

---

## Safety concerns and adverse effects

Divalproex carries **significant risks** in older adults with dementia:

- **Sedation and somnolence**: Common and often dose-limiting; linked to reduced intake, dehydration, and weight loss [^1144nQ8c].
- **Gait disturbance and falls**: Increased risk of injury [^111XxNcy].
- **Cognitive effects**: Possible cognitive worsening and reversible cerebral atrophy reported [^113f6byq].
- **Serious adverse events**: Higher rates vs placebo, including tremor, diarrhea, weakness, and dyspnea [^111XxNcy].

---

## Regulatory status and guidelines

- **FDA approval**: Not approved for dementia-related agitation.
- **APA guidelines**: Do not recommend routine use; consider only if other treatments fail, with close monitoring [^113gWzYH].
- **CCSMH guidelines**: Recommend against valproic acid or divalproex for agitation in dementia [^114iyVd5].

---

## Recommended dosing and monitoring

If divalproex is used off-label, use **conservative dosing and monitoring**:

| **Parameter** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Initial dose | 125–250 mg/day (delayed-release) [^113gWzYH] |
| Titration | Increase by 125–250 mg every 3–7 days as tolerated [^notfound] |
| Target dose | 500–1,000 mg/day (max 1,500 mg/day) [^notfound] |
| Serum level monitoring | 50–100 mcg/mL (adjust to tolerability) [^113KrByp] |
| Monitoring | - CBC <br/> - LFTs <br/> - Valproate levels <br/> - Fluid/nutritional intake <br/> - Sedation <br/> - Falls [^1144nQ8c] |

---

## Drug interactions

Key interactions to consider: **carbapenems** can markedly reduce valproate levels and increase seizure risk; monitor closely or avoid [^1144nQ8c]. Enzyme inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin) increase valproate clearance and may necessitate dose adjustments [^1139rHri].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments

Preferred options include **antipsychotics** — risperidone or aripiprazole for severe agitation or psychosis; use the lowest effective dose and monitor closely [^116hnsRH] — and **non-pharmacological interventions**, which are first-line and include environmental modifications, behavioral strategies, and caregiver education [^117MEqXh].

---

Depakote is **not recommended** for dementia-related agitation due to lack of efficacy and significant adverse effects. If used off-label, apply conservative dosing, slow titration, and close monitoring; consider antipsychotics and non-pharmacological strategies first.

### Divalproex sodium therapy in elderly with dementia-related agitation [^115Dy9qa]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available literature regarding the use of divalproex sodium in the treatment of agitation in elderly patients with dementia.

Data Sources

Clinical trials and review articles were identified by MEDLINE search (1966 - March 2002).

Data Synthesis

The literature provides information regarding the potential benefits and tolerability of divalproex sodium in the treatment of dementia-related agitation. This article analyzes 7 studies to better understand the role of divalproex sodium in the treatment of dementia.

Conclusions

Divalproex sodium may offer a slight benefit to elderly patients suffering from dementia-related agitation. Until better-controlled trials demonstrate statistical significance and comparisons with established treatments are performed, practitioners should use divalproex sodium cautiously.

Conversion to Monotherapy

Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50–100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Depakote therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive Therapy

Depakote may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

The remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two six-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of Depakote ER for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years). Two twelve-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of Depakote ER for the indication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years). One twelve-month study was conducted to evaluate the safety of Depakote Sprinkle Capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged 3 to 10 years).

In these seven clinical trials, the safety and tolerability of Depakote in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Juvenile Animal Toxicology

In studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included retinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in rats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The no-effect dose for these findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2basis.

8.5 Geriatric Use

No patients above the age of 65 years were enrolled in double-blind prospective clinical trials of mania associated with bipolar illness. In a case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12%) were greater than 65 years of age. A higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported accidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor. Discontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear whether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from preexisting medical illness and concomitant medication use among these patients.

A study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)]. The starting dose should be reduced in these patients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

There is insufficient information available to discern the safety and effectiveness of valproate for the prophylaxis of migraines in patients over 65.

5.15 Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics

Carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) may reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure control. Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.1 6 Somnolence in the Elderly

In a double-blind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age = 83 years), doses were increased by 125 mg/day to a target dose of 20 mg/kg/day. A significantly higher proportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically significant, there was a higher proportion of patients with dehydration. Discontinuations for somnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo. In some patients with somnolence (approximately one-half), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss. There was a trend for the patients who experienced these events to have a lower baseline albumin concentration, lower valproate clearance, and a higher BUN. In elderly patients, dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.1 7 Monitoring: Drug Plasma Concentration

Since valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme induction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.1 8 Effect on Ketone and Thyroid Function Tests

Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a keto-metabolite which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test.

There have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate. The clinical significance of these is unknown.

### Chronic divalproex sodium use and brain atrophy in Alzheimer disease [^115n8Gmq]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the effect of the divalproex sodium formulation of valproic acid on brain volumes using MRI in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) and assessed for changes associated with behavioral and cognitive effects.

Methods

Eighty-nine of 313 participants randomized to divalproex or placebo in a 24-month, parallel-group trial received MRI scans at baseline and 12 months. Interval MRI annual percent changes in whole brain, ventricular, and hippocampal volumes were the primary outcomes of interest. Change from baseline in clinical outcomes was assessed at 6-month intervals.

Results

There were no baseline differences between active treatment and placebo groups in age, education, brain volumes, clinical rating scores, or APOE ε4 carrier status. The group treated with divalproex showed a greater rate of decline in left and right hippocampal and brain volumes (-10.9% and -12.4% vs -5.6% and -6.3%, and -3.5% vs -1.4%, respectively), and a greater rate of ventricular expansion (24.5% vs 9.9%) (p < 0.001). Mini-Mental State Examination scores showed a more rapid decline with divalproex through month 12 (placebo = -2.0 ± 4.3, divalproex = -3.9 ± 4.0) (p = 0.037), although there were no changes on other cognitive, behavioral, or functional ratings at 12 and 24 months.

Conclusions

Divalproex treatment was associated with accelerated brain volume loss over 1 year and perhaps with greater cognitive impairment. The long-term clinical effects of these changes are not known.

5.7 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Depakote, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Depakote tablets are intended for oral administration. Depakote tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be crushed or chewed.

Patients should be informed to take Depakote every day as prescribed. If a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. If a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose.

2.1 Mania

Depakote tablets are administered orally. The recommended initial dose is 750 mg daily in divided doses. The dose should be increased as rapidly as possible to achieve the lowest therapeutic dose which produces the desired clinical effect or the desired range of plasma concentrations. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of acute mania, patients were dosed to a clinical response with a trough plasma concentration between 50 and 125 mcg/mL. Maximum concentrations were generally achieved within 14 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day.

There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer term management of a patient who improves during Depakote treatment of an acute manic episode. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no data to support the benefits of Depakote in such longer-term treatment. Although there are no efficacy data that specifically address longer-term antimanic treatment with Depakote, the safety of Depakote in long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated with Depakote for greater than 3 months.

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^117SXof6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5–100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing Depakote or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112o2rYT]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Anticonvulsants for agitation in dementia — carbamazepine and valproate/divalproex: Carbamazepine has support from several nonrandomized and randomized studies that showed modest benefit for agitation at low doses with low side-effect rates over a short treatment period, although a small randomized crossover trial showed nonsignificant decreases. For valproate, four placebo-controlled trials have not demonstrated efficacy. In a 6-week randomized placebo-controlled trial including 172 nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease and secondary mania, divalproex sodium had no more improvement than placebo; another randomized placebo-controlled study with 42 patients found valproic acid 480 mg/day not more effective than placebo for overall agitation. In a separate 6-week randomized placebo-controlled trial with 56 nursing home residents with dementia, 68% of the treatment group improved in agitation compared with 52% of the control group. The largest study, in 153 nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease, found no difference between divalproex sodium (mean dosage of 800 mg/day) and placebo for the primary outcome (agitation).

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^113KrByp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Divalproex sodium dissociates to the valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract. The mechanisms by which valproate exerts its therapeutic effects have not been established. It has been suggested that its activity in epilepsy is related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The relationship between plasma concentration and clinical response is not well documented. One contributing factor is the nonlinear, concentration dependent protein binding of valproate which affects the clearance of the drug. Thus, monitoring of total serum valproate cannot provide a reliable index of the bioactive valproate species.

For example, because the plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent, the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Higher than expected free fractions occur in the elderly, in hyperlipidemic patients, and in patients with hepatic and renal diseases.

Epilepsy

The therapeutic range in epilepsy is commonly considered to be 50 to 100 mcg/mL of total valproate, although some patients may be controlled with lower or higher plasma concentrations.

Mania

In placebo-controlled clinical trials of acute mania, patients were dosed to clinical response with trough plasma concentrations between 50 and 125 mcg/mL [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^115MQwEu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Mania

Depakote (divalproex sodium) is a valproate and is indicated for the treatment of the manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Typical symptoms of mania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas, grandiosity, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possible hostility.

The efficacy of Depakote was established in 3-week trials with patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar disorder who were hospitalized for acute mania [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of Depakote for long-term use in mania, i.e., more than 3 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, healthcare providers who elect to use Depakote for extended periods should continually reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

1.2 Epilepsy

Depakote is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Depakote is also indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures, and adjunctively in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures.

Simple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present.

1.3 Migraine

Depakote is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches. There is no evidence that Depakote is useful in the acute treatment of migraine headaches.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^113gWzYH]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — anticonvulsants for agitation and behavioral symptoms: Carbamazepine is not recommended for the routine treatment of agitation in patients with dementia, and routine use of valproate to treat behavioral symptoms in dementia is not recommended based on the current evidence; most randomized placebo-controlled trials showed no benefit of valproate compared with placebo and a 2004 Cochrane review concluded that valproate formulations were no more effective than placebo and that side effects were more common. Nonetheless, a therapeutic trial of carbamazepine or valproate may be considered in individual cases, and given the potential toxicity of both agents it is important to identify and monitor target symptoms and to discontinue the medication if no improvement is observed. If used, carbamazepine may be given in two to four doses per day, started at a total dosage of 50–100 mg/day, and increased gradually as warranted by behavioral response and side effects or until blood levels reach 8–12 ng/ml; divalproex sodium may be given in two or three doses per day and should be started at 125–250 mg/day, with gradual increases based on behavioral response and side effects or until blood levels reach 50–60 ng/ml (or, in rare cases, 100 ng/ml). Principal adverse effects of carbamazepine include ataxia, falls, sedation, and confusion, with drug interactions through the cytochrome P450 system and rare bone marrow suppression or hyponatremia; valproate's principal side effects are sedation, gastrointestinal disturbances, and confusion.

### Divalproex sodium (divalproex sodiumDelayed-release) [^112tsiip]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

The remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two six-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years). Two twelve-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for the indication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years). One twelve-month study was conducted to evaluate the safety of divalproex sodium sprinkle capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged 3 to 10 years).

In these seven clinical trials, the safety and tolerability of divalproex sodium in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Juvenile Animal Toxicology In studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included retinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in rats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The no-effect dose for these findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2basis.

8.5 Geriatric Use

No patients above the age of 65 years were enrolled in double-blind prospective clinical trials of mania associated with bipolar illness. In a case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12%) were greater than 65 years of age. A higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported accidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor. Discontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear whether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from pre-existing medical illness and concomitant medication use among these patients.

A study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. The starting dose should be reduced in these patients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

There is insufficient information available to discern the safety and effectiveness of valproate for the prophylaxis of migraines in patients over 65.

### Valproate preparations for agitation in dementia [^1135Ue7r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Agitation affects up to 70% of older people with dementia. Valproic acid derivatives have been used for the past 10 years to control agitation in dementia, but no systematic review of the effectiveness of this treatment has been published to date. A systematic review of 2004 examined three randomised, placebo-controlled trials of the effect of valproate therapy on older people with dementia who were agitated. The review was updated (October 2008) to include two additional studies.

Objectives

To determine whether evidence supports the use of valproate preparations in the treatment of agitation of people with dementia.

Search Strategy

The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 7 February 2008 using the terms: valproic OR valproate OR divalproex*. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials with concealed allocation where agitation and dementia of participants were assessed

Data Collection and Analysis

1. Two reviewers extracted data from published trials 2. Odds ratios of average differences were calculated 3. Only "intention to treat" analyses were included 4. Analysis compared participants treated with valproic acid with controls

Main Results

Meta-analysis in 2004 of the pooled results was limited because of the following problems. In Porsteinsson 2001, although the physicians having direct responsibility for patient care were blinded, a non-blinded physician, who had no direct contact with these physicians, adjusted divalproex sodium dosage on the basis of reports from blinded raters and from confidential laboratory reports. Therefore, because the physician who controlled therapy knew which patients were receiving divalproex, the trial did not satisfy the criterion of concealed allocation. In Tariot 2001, 54% of the treated patients dropped out compared with 29% of control patients. Of all treated patients, 22% dropped out because of adverse effects, and the study had to be discontinued prematurely. The third trial (Sival 2002) had a cross-over design. No results from the first phase of the study were available, and although the statistical section stated, "the t-test for independent samples is used to analyse the two-period cross-over trial", because the samples were not independent - they are the same patients in the treatment and placebo groups - a question must be raised about the correctness of the analyses. The valproate preparation used in the trials varied - one used short-acting sodium valproate, one long-acting divalproex sodium, and the third early-onset acting divalproex sodium. Average doses differed (480 mg/d - 1000 mg/d), as did duration of therapy (3 weeks - 6 weeks), and ways of evaluating patients and their response to therapy. A limited meta-analysis, pooling the results concerning adverse effects (Porsteinsson 2001, Tariot 2001) revealed the following: sedation occurred more frequently in patients treated with valproic acid than in controls. Urinary tract infection was more common among patients treated with valproic acid than controls. An updated systematic review (October 2008) of two new studies (Tariot 2005, Herrmann 2007) applied meta-analysis to the effect of valproate on agitation in demented patients and also combined these studies with the earlier reports to examine adverse effects among valproate treated patients. Because the study of Herrmann et al involved a cross-over design, only those results from the first part of this study were included in the updated review. The new meta-analysis of pooled results showed no improvement of agitation among valproate treated patients, compared with controls, and showed an increase in adverse events (falls, infection, gastrointestinal disorders) among valproate treated patients.

Authors' Conclusions

The updated review corroborates the earlier findings that valproate preparations are ineffective in treating agitation among demented patients, and that valproate therapy is associated with an unacceptable rate of adverse effects. More research on the use of valproate preparations for agitation of people with dementia is needed. On the basis of current evidence, valproate therapy cannot be recommended for management of agitation in dementia.

### Valproate preparations for agitation in dementia [^112Q3Sbs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Agitation has been reported in up to 90% of people with dementia. Agitation in people with dementia worsens carer burden, increases the risk of injury, and adds to the need for institutionalisation. Valproate preparations have been used in an attempt to control agitation in dementia, but their safety and efficacy have been questioned.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and adverse effects of valproate preparations used to treat agitation in people with dementia, including the impact on carers.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 7 December 2017 using the terms: valproic OR valproate OR divalproex. ALOIS contains records from all major health care databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials that assessed valproate preparations for agitation in people with dementia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data in meta-analyses where possible. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2009. We found no new studies for inclusion.

Main Results

The review included five studies with 430 participants. Studies varied in the preparations of valproate, mean doses (480 mg/day to 1000 mg/day), duration of treatment (three weeks to six weeks), and outcome measures used. The studies were generally well conducted although some methodological information was missing and one study was at high risk of attrition bias. The quality of evidence related to our primary efficacy outcome of agitation varied from moderate to very low. We found moderate-quality evidence from two studies that measured behaviour with the total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score (range 0 to 108) and with the BPRS agitation factor (range 0 to 18). They found that there was probably little or no effect of valproate treatment over six weeks (total BPRS: mean difference (MD) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.14 to 2.59; 202 participants, 2 studies; BPRS agitation factor: MD -0.67, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.15; 202 participants, 2 studies). Very low-quality evidence from three studies which measured agitation with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index (CMAI) were consistent with a lack of effect of valproate treatment on agitation. There was variable quality evidence on other behaviour outcomes reported in single studies of no difference between groups or a benefit for the placebo group. Three studies, which measured cognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), found little or no effect of valproate over six weeks, but we were uncertain about this result because the quality of the evidence was very low. Two studies that assessed functional ability using the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS) (range 6 to 30) found that there was probably slightly worse function in the valproate-treated group, which was of uncertain clinical importance (MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.98; 203 participants, 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Analysis of adverse effects and serious adverse events (SAE) indicated a higher incidence in valproate-treated participants. A meta-analysis of three studies showed that there may have been a higher rate of adverse effects among valproate-treated participants than among controls (odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.14; 381 participants, 3 studies, low-quality evidence). Pooled analysis of the number of SAE for the two studies that reported such data indicated that participants treated with valproate preparations were more likely to experience SAEs (OR 4.77, 95% CI 1.00 to 22.74; 228 participants, 2 studies), but the very low quality of the data made it difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding SAEs. Individual adverse events that were more frequent in the valproate-treated group included sedation, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), and urinary tract infections.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review corroborates earlier findings that valproate preparations are probably ineffective in treating agitation in people with dementia, but are associated with a higher rate of adverse effects, and possibly of SAEs. On the basis of this evidence, valproate therapy cannot be recommended for management of agitation in dementia. Further research may not be justified, particularly in light of the increased risk of adverse effects in this often frail group of people. Research would be better focused on effective non-pharmacological interventions for this patient group, or, for those situations where medication may be needed, further investigation of how to use other medications as effectively and safely as possible.

### Valproic acid for agitation in dementia [^112ivDTi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Agitation affects up to 70% of older people with dementia. Valproic acid has been used for the past 10 years to control agitation in dementia, but no systematic review of the effectiveness of this drug has been published to date. The current study examines three randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the effect of valproic acid on older people with dementia who were agitated.

Objectives

To determine whether evidence supports the use of valproic acid in the treatment of agitation of people with dementia.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 10 July 2003 using the terms ("agitat" or "distur" or "behavi" or "aggress") and "valproic" or "valproate" or "divalpro". This Register contains articles from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is regularly updated. The reviewers contacted the authors of publications and drug companies manufacturing valproic acid for additional information.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials with concealed allocation where agitation and dementia of participants were assessed

Data Collection and Analysis

1. Two reviewers extracted data from published trials. 2. Odds ratios of average differences were calculated. 3. Only "intention to treat" analyses were included. 4. Analysis compared participants treated with valproic acid with controls.

Main Results

Meta-analysis of the pooled results of the included trials could not be performed because of the following problems. In Porsteinsson 2001, although the physicians having direct responsibility for patient care were blinded, a non-blinded physician, who had no direct contact with these physicians, adjusted divalproex sodium dosage on the basis of reports from blinded raters. Therefore, because the physician who controlled therapy knew which patients were receiving divalproex, the trial did not satisfy the criterion of concealed allocation. In Tariot 2001, 54% of the treated patients dropped out compared with 29% of control patients.

The type of valproate used in the trials varied - one used short-acting sodium valproate, one long-acting divalproex sodium, and the third early-onset acting divalproex sodium. Average doses differed (480mg/d - 1000mg/d), as did duration of therapy (3 wks - 6 wks), and ways of evaluating patients and their response to therapy. A limited meta-analysis, pooling the results concerning adverse effects (Porsteinsson 2001, Tariot 2001) revealed the following: Sedation occurred more frequently in patients treated with valproic acid than in controls Urinary tract infection was more common among patients treated with valproic acid than controls Because of differences in identifying adverse effects it was not possible to pool other observations concerning adverse effects between the two studies that were examined.

Reviewers' Conclusions

The trials reviewed should be regarded as preliminary. Individual reports suggest that low dose sodium valproate is ineffective in treating agitation among demented patients, and that high dose divalproex sodium is associated with an unacceptable rate of adverse effects. More research on the use of valproate preparations for agitation of people with dementia is needed. On the basis of current evidence, valproate preparations cannot be recommended for the treatment of agitation in dementia.

8.5 Geriatric Use

No patients above the age of 65 years were enrolled in double-blind prospective clinical trials of mania associated with bipolar illness. In a case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12%) were greater than 65 years of age. A higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported accidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor. Discontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear whether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from preexisting medical illness and concomitant medication use among these patients.

A study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)]. The starting dose should be reduced in these patients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

There is insufficient information available to discern the safety and effectiveness of valproate for the prophylaxis of migraines in patients over 65.

The capacity of elderly patients (age range: 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to be reduced compared to younger adults (age range: 22 to 26 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

General Information on Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months of valproate therapy. However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination.

Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk. See below, "Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease".

Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions. When Depakote is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably.

2.5 General Dosing Advice

Dosing in Elderly Patients

Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Starting doses in the elderly lower than 250 mg can only be achieved by the use of divalproex sodium tablets. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Dose-Related Adverse Reactions

The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.

G. I. Irritation

Patients who experience G. I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level.

Compliance

Patients should be informed to take divalproex sodium extended-release tablets every day as prescribed. If a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. If a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose.

The remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two six-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years). Two twelve-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for the indication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years). One twelve-month study was conducted to evaluate the safety of depakote Sprinkle Capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged 3 to 10 years).

In these seven clinical trials, the safety and tolerability of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Juvenile Animal Toxicology

In studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included retinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in rats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The no-effect dose for these findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2basis.

6.4 Post m arketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Depakote. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Dermatologic: Hair texture changes, hair color changes, photosensitivity, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, nail and nail bed disorders, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hyperpigmentation, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

Psychiatric: Emotional upset, psychosis, aggression, psychomotor hyperactivity, hostility, disturbance in attention, learning disorder, and behavioral deterioration.

Neurologic: Paradoxical convulsion, parkinsonism

There have been several reports of acute or subacute cognitive decline and behavioral changes (apathy or irritability) with cerebral pseudoatrophy on imaging associated with valproate therapy; both the cognitive/behavioral changes and cerebral pseudoatrophy reversed partially or fully after valproate discontinuation.

Amongst other effects, lithium has been associated with adverse neurological effects 645 and renal disease. 646 Divalproex has been associated with motor side effects 645 and metabolic effects (weight gain and diabetes mellitus). 647 Carbamazepine induces cytochrome P450 enzymes and can reduce the levels of divalproex and other medications. 648 Regarding antipsychotics, which are now very commonly used for BD in older adults, dose reduction may be beneficial in some aging patients to lower the risk of motor, sedation, metabolic syndrome, and cognitive effects. 649 There is an association between mortality and antipsychotics in patients with dementia 650 but it is unclear how this should be managed for patients with BD. Recently there have also been data linking antipsychotics with acute kidney injury. 651

In particular, when lithium is used in this population, lithium level and renal monitoring should occur at least every 3‐6 months, as well as 5‐7 days following a lithium dose adjustment or adjustment of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antiontensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), or thiazide diuretic dosing. 652 Special consideration also needs to be given to dose selection. A post hoc analysis of the STEP‐BD study found that while, on average, older patients required a similar number of medications to younger patients to achieve recovery, lower doses were used. In that sample, over twice as many older patients as younger ones recovered using lithium alone (42% vs 21%, respectively). 653 In general, starting at a lower dose (eg, 150 mg nightly for lithium) is recommended, with gradual adjustments to reach the lowest end of the therapeutic range for adults, with subsequent titration based on tolerability and effectiveness; keeping in mind that some older patients will require similar blood levels as the general adult population in order to achieve remission. Further discussion, including clinical guidance and more detailed treatment recommendations, can be found in the ISBD Task Force report. 654 In light of very limited international guidelines for maintenance treatment of older adults with BD, an ISBD Task Force is currently undertaking a Delphi survey of international experts, and clinicians are advised to consult this as results become available in the future (Shulman K, personal communication).

### Effects of aripiprazole on the QTc: a case report [^1146abHR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The use of neuroleptics in the elderly has been a topic of debate since 2005 when the US Food and Drug Administration issued a black-box warning of increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. Antipsychotic alternatives such as divalproex are sometimes favored on an "off-label" basis to manage agitation in the demented elderly, and antipsychotic use is often clinically necessary to treat psychosis in older adults, with or without dementia. Concurrently, risk for iatrogenic corrected QT (QTc) prolongation on electrocardiogram (ECG) remains a concern with the use of many antipsychotic agents because of its associated potential for fatal arrhythmias.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^112rFLEx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two six-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of divalproex sodium ER for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years). Two twelve-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of divalproex sodium ER for the indication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years). One twelve-month study was conducted to evaluate the safety of divalproex sodium sprinkle capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged 3 to 10 years).

In these seven clinical trials, the safety and tolerability of divalproex sodium in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Juvenile Animal Toxicology

In studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included retinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in rats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The no-effect dose for these findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2basis.

8.5 Geriatric Use

No patients above the age of 65 years were enrolled in double-blind prospective clinical trials of mania associated with bipolar illness. In a case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12%) were greater than 65 years of age. A higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported accidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor.

Discontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear whether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from preexisting medical illness and concomitant medication use among these patients.

A study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. The starting dose should be reduced in these patients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Lower effectiveness of divalproex versus valproic acid in a prospective, quasi-experimental clinical trial involving 9, 260 psychiatric admissions [^1146iuzD]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors examined clinical differences between divalproex sodium and generic immediate-release valproic acid.

Method

This 6-year prospective, quasi-experimental clinical trial compared the effectiveness and tolerability of divalproex and valproic acid. The dependent variables were length of hospital stay, rehospitalization rate, and adverse drug reactions in 9,260 psychiatric admissions.

Results

Inpatients who initially received divalproex sodium had a 32.7% longer hospital stay and 3.8% higher readmission rate than did patients who initially received valproic acid. Initial treatment with divalproex prolonged length of stay by 30.3% in patients treated with divalproex and valproic acid during different admissions. After other variables were controlled by multiway analysis of variance, the hospital stay of patients who continued the initial medication was 15.2% longer (2.0 days) for divalproex than valproic acid. Switching medications was more common for valproic acid, partly because of study design. Medication intolerance occurred in approximately 6.4% more patients taking valproic acid than divalproex. However, switching from valproic acid to divalproex did not significantly prolong length of stay, over that for continuous divalproex, or increase the rehospitalization rate.

Conclusions

Lower peak valproate concentrations with divalproex sodium may have enhanced tolerability but may also explain the lower effectiveness. Extended-release divalproex could lower effectiveness further and require higher doses. Thus, inpatients are better served by beginning with generic valproic acid and by changing to delayed-release divalproex only if intolerance occurs. This would save up to one-third of inpatient costs and two-thirds of a billion dollars yearly in medication costs.

### Divalproex sodium (divalproex sodiumDelayed-release) [^112gN77B]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing divalproex sodium or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.

### Divalproex sodium (divalproex sodiumDelayed-release) [^112R1wzW]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

1.1 Mania

Divalproex sodium is a valproate and is indicated for the treatment of the manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Typical symptoms of mania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas, grandiosity, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possible hostility.

The efficacy of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, USP was established in 3-week trials with patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar disorder who were hospitalized for acute mania [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, USP for long-term use in mania, i.e., more than 3 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, healthcare providers who elect to use divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, USP for extended periods should continually re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

1.2 Epilepsy

Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, USP are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, USP are also indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures, and adjunctively in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures.

Simple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present.

1.3 Migraine

Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, USP are indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches. There is no evidence that divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, USP are useful in the acute treatment of migraine headaches.

Data

Human

In a published study, breast milk and maternal blood samples were obtained from 11 epilepsy patients taking valproate at doses ranging from 300 mg/day to 2,400 mg/day on postnatal days 3 to 6. In 4 patients who were taking valproate only, breast milk contained an average valproate concentration of 1.8 mcg/mL (range: 1.1 mcg/mL to 2.2 mcg/mL), which corresponded to 4.8% of the maternal plasma concentration (range: 2.7% to 7.4%). Across all patients (7 of whom were taking other AEDs concomitantly), similar results were obtained for breast milk concentration (1.8 mcg/mL, range: 0.4 mcg/mL to 3.9 mcg/mL) and maternal plasma ratio (5.1%, range: 1.3% to 9.6%).

A published study of 6 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs measured serum valproate levels during maternal treatment for bipolar disorder (750 mg/day or 1,000 mg/day). None of the mothers received valproate during pregnancy, and infants were aged from 4 weeks to 19 weeks at the time of evaluation. Infant serum levels ranged from 0.7 mcg/mL to 1.5 mcg/mL. With maternal serum valproate levels near or within the therapeutic range, infant exposure was 0.9% to 2.3% of maternal levels. Similarly, in 2 published case reports with maternal doses of 500 mg/day or 750 mg/day during breastfeeding of infants aged 3 months and 1 month, infant exposure was 1.5% and 6% that of the mother, respectively.

A prospective observational multicenter study evaluated the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of AED use on children. Pregnant women receiving monotherapy for epilepsy were enrolled with assessments of their children at ages 3 years and 6 years. Mothers continued AED therapy during the breastfeeding period. Adjusted IQs measured at 3 years for breastfed and non-breastfed children were 93 (n = 11) and 90 (n = 24), respectively. At 6 years, the scores for breastfed and non-breastfed children were 106 (n = 11) and 94 (n = 25), respectively (p = 0.04). For other cognitive domains evaluated at 6 years, no adverse cognitive effects of continued exposure to an AED (including valproate) via breast milk were observed.

### Divalproex sodium [^112DK6FM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Mania

Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are valproate and are indicated for the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features. A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Typical symptoms of mania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas, grandiosity, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possible hostility. A mixed episode is characterized by the criteria for a manic episode in conjunction with those for a major depressive episode (depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities).

The efficacy of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets is based in part on studies of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets in this indication, and was confirmed in a 3-week trial with patients meeting DSM-IV TR criteria for bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed type, who were hospitalized for acute mania [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The effectiveness of valproate for long-term use in mania, i.e., more than 3 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, healthcare providers who elect to use divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for extended periods should continually reevaluate the long-term risk-benefits of the drug for the individual patient.

1.2 Epilepsy

Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are also indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures in adults and children 10 years of age or older, and adjunctively in adults and children 10 years of age or older with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures.

### Psychotropic drug treatment for agitated behaviour in dementia: what if the guideline prescribing recommendations are not sufficient? A qualitative study [^113mXEpE]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Through qualitative exploration, we provided an extensive overview of physicians' considerations when deciding on PD treatment outside the guideline prescribing recommendations for agitated behaviour in dementia. These considerations give us a better understanding of how physicians deviate from the guideline when treatment according to the guideline prescribing recommendations is not sufficient.

Recommendations

We recommend further research into the efficacy of PD treatment in patients with agitated behaviour in dementia, when treated according to a hypothesis of underlying (psychiatric) cause(s) and guideline prescribing recommendations are not sufficient. We suggest to systematically collect and describe cases where this occurs. In addition, we recommend considering less stringent diagnostic criteria for underlying psychiatric disorders of agitated behaviour in dementia (i.e. anxiety and mood disorders), so that medication recommendations from psychiatric guidelines can be used.

### Divalproex sodium [^1139rHri]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems. For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn.

Specific Populations

Effect of Age

Pediatric

The valproate pharmacokinetic profile following administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets was characterized in a multiple-dose, non-fasting, open label, multi-center study in children and adolescents. Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets once daily doses ranged from 250–1,750 mg. Once daily administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in pediatric patients (10–17 years) produced plasma VPA concentration-time profiles similar to those that have been observed in adults.

Elderly

The capacity of elderly patients (age range: 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to be reduced compared to younger adults (age range: 22 to 26 years). Intrinsic clearance is reduced by 39%; the free fraction is increased by 44%. Accordingly, the initial dosage should be reduced in the elderly [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^116xAqPi]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants for depression in dementia — because as many as one-half of such persons do develop dementia within 5 years, caution is urged in ruling out an underlying early dementia in patients with both affective and cognitive symptoms, particularly when the first episode of depression is in old age. When treatment for depression is being considered, patients should be evaluated for conditions that may be causing or contributing to the depression, and clinical consensus supports a trial of an antidepressant in acutely clinically significant, persistent depressed mood in patients with dementia. SSRIs may be preferred because they appear to be better tolerated than other antidepressants, and when a rapid response is not critical a very gradual dosage increase may increase the likelihood that a therapeutic dosage will be reached and tolerated; after prolonged use, medications should be withdrawn gradually whenever possible, in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Treatment of depression may also reduce other neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with depression such as aggression, anxiety, apathy, and psychosis.

### Effect of sodium benzoate on cognitive function among patients with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115pzjij]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

It is important but difficult to treat patients with later-phase dementia, especially those with behavioral and psychological symptoms. Our previous study demonstrated that sodium benzoate, an indirect NMDAR enhancer, benefited cognitive function of both men and women with early-phase dementia. The current study suggests that benzoate may improve cognitive function of women (but not men) with later-phase dementia with behavioral and psychological symptoms, therefore lending support to the previous notion that women may be more susceptible to NMDAR modulation than males, which was based upon animal study.

Psychosis leads to faster cognitive decline in patients with dementia. Though antipsychotics have been widely used for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis, no medications have been approved for the treatment. Benzoate exerted antipsychotic properties in a mouse modeland in patients with chronic schizophrenia; however, it was unable to reduce the psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia in the current study. One of the possible reasons is that the dosage (341.8 ± 121.8 mg/d at week 2, 528.4 ± 248.3 mg/d at week 4, and 622.0 ± 340.6 mg/d at week 6) of the current study appears much lower than that (1000 or 2000 mg/d) used in the studies on schizophrenia. Future studies that examine the effects of higher doses are needed.

### A preliminary double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of divalproex sodium in borderline personality disorder [^116vngHt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Since anticonvulsant agents may be helpful in such symptomatology, we compared divalproex sodium with placebo in patients with borderline personality disorder.

Method

A 10-week, parallel, double-blind design was conducted. Sixteen outpatients meeting Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders criteria for borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 4) or divalproex sodium (N = 12). Change was assessed in global symptom severity (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale [CGI-I]) and functioning (Global Assessment Scale [GAS]) as well as in specific core symptoms (depression, aggression, irritability, and suicidality).

Results

There was significant improvement from baseline in both global measures (CGI-I and GAS) following divalproex sodium treatment. A high dropout rate precluded finding significant differences between the treatment groups in the intent-to-treat analyses, although all results were in the predicted direction.

Conclusion

Treatment with divalproex sodium may be more effective than placebo for global symptomatology, level of functioning, aggression, and depression. Controlled trials with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.

### The effectiveness of divalproate in all forms of mania and the broader bipolar spectrum: many questions, few answers [^11351n4M]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Divalproate (VPA) was the first drug, other than lithium, reported to be efficacious for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Since then, the effectiveness of VPA, alone, in combination, and as maintenance therapy, has been investigated in a number of studies. As a monotherapy, clinical studies revealed that VPA was superior to lithium with regard to being effective in a broader patient population: patients with depressive symptoms concurrent with their mania, patients previously poorly responsive to lithium, patients with more lifetime episodes, and on specific symptoms of elation/grandiosity and reduced need for sleep. In addition, while VPA had superior efficacy versus carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-manic agent, and equivalent efficacy to the anti-psychotic agent olanzapine (OLZ) in manic patients with psychotic manic features, patients showed much better tolerability to VPA than CBZ, anti-psychotics, and, in particular, lithium. Recently, combination therapy (mood stabilizers plus anti-psychotic agents) has shown some advantages compared with monotherapy. Manic symptoms have been observed to improve to a greater extent when the mood stabilizer was co-administered with an anti-psychotic rather than either agent used alone. While only a few maintenance studies have been conducted to date, two randomized studies have indicated consistent trends toward greater efficacy of VPA than lithium, and significant superiority over placebo on most, although not all, measures. In general, VPA provides a well-tolerated treatment that is efficacious for a broad spectrum of manic states and improves outcomes during maintenance treatment.

### An open trial of divalproex sodium in autism spectrum disorders [^114Yvith]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Autism spectrum disorders are characterized by core deficits in social interaction and speech/communication skills, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. Other abnormalities include seizures, electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities, affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression. Divalproex sodium is indicated as both an anticonvulsant in epilepsy and a mood stabilizer in bipolar illness and thus might be useful for these complicating symptoms in autism.

Method

A retrospective pilot study was conducted to determine whether divalproex sodium was effective in treating core dimensions and associated features of autism. Fourteen patients who met DSM-IV criteria for autism, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, both with and without a history of seizure disorders or EEG abnormalities, were openly treated with divalproex sodium. Improvement was assessed via the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale.

Results

Of 14 patients who completed a trial of divalproex sodium, 10 (71%) were rated as having sustained response to treatment. The mean dose of divalproex sodium was 768 mg/day (range, 125–2500 mg/day), and it was generally well tolerated. Improvement was noted in core symptoms of autism and associated features of affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression.

Conclusion

Divalproex sodium may be beneficial to patients with autism spectrum disorders, particularly those with associated features of affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression as well as those with a history of EEG abnormalities or seizures. Of note, all patients with an abnormal EEG and/or seizure history were rated as responders. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution, given the open retrospective nature of the study. Controlled trials are needed to replicate these preliminary findings.

Supplemental considerations for treatment of epilepsy in dementia

We believe that patients with dementia should be given the same attention and care as people without dementia regarding the management of epilepsy. It is important to regularly inquire about potential seizure markers with patients and their caregivers. Potential harms and benefits have to be considered when introducing a new AED and rapid follow‐up ensured. It is the opinion of the authors that the choice of AED in a patient with dementia should be individualized. Due consideration should be given to the individual patient's concomitant pharmacological treatment and comorbidities, adverse effect profile of AEDs, effects on bone health and osteoporosis [97], and the availability of different drug formulations, dosing schedules, and risk of non‐compliance. Monotherapy is recommended, and AEDs are better tolerated when started at low dose with gradual uptitration to as low a dose as possible to achieve seizure freedom. The aim is to minimize dose‐dependent side effects (e.g. worsening of cognitive impairment, impaired gait, sedation, tremor, dizziness, visual disturbances and mood), to which older people are sensitive, and which may be particularly troublesome in patients with dementia. If valproate is considered, it is important to be aware of the risk of valproate encephalopathy (lethargy, reduced attention, behavioral changes) [98].

### Valproic acid, valproate and divalproex in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder [^111zMXAf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder is a recurrent illness that is amongst the top 30 causes of disability worldwide and is associated with significant healthcare costs. In the past, emphasis was placed solely on the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar disorder; recently, the importance of episode prevention and of minimisation of iatrogenicity has been recognised. For many years, lithium was the only mood stabiliser in common use, and it remains an agent of first choice in the preventative treatment of bipolar disorder. However, an estimated 20% to 40% of patients may not respond adequately to lithium. Valproate is an anticonvulsant drug that has been shown to be effective in acute mania and is frequently used in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. When the acceptability of long-term treatment is considered, together with efficacy, the adverse event profile of a medication is also important. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2009.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of valproate continuation and maintenance treatment:a) in preventing or attenuating manic, depressive and mixed episodes of bipolar disorder; b) in preventing or attenuating episodes of bipolar disorder in patients with rapid cycling disorder; and; c) in improving patients' general health and social functioning, as measured by global clinical impression, employment and marital stability.2. To review the acceptability to patients of long-term valproate treatment, as measured by numbers of dropouts and reasons for dropping out, by compliance and by reference to patients' expressed views regarding treatment.3. To investigate the adverse effects of valproate treatment (including general prevalence of side effects) and overall mortality rates.

Search Methods

Search of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register (CCDANCTR) (to January 2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE, (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). No language restrictions were applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing valproate and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating participants with bipolar disorder to long-term treatment with valproate or any other mood stabiliser, or antipsychotic drugs, or placebo. Maintenance treatment was defined as treatment instituted specifically or mainly to prevent further episodes of illness.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data. A double-entry procedure was employed by two review authors. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. For dichotomous data, risk ratios were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For statistically significant results, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH). For continuous data, mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated along with 95% CIs. MDs were used when the same scale was used to measure an outcome; SMDs were employed when different scales were used to measure the same outcome. The primary analysis used a fixed-effect model. Binary outcomes were calculated on a strict intention-to-treat (ITT) basis; dropouts were included in this analysis. When data were missing and the method of "last observation carried forward" (LOCF) had been used to do an ITT analysis, then the LOCF data were used.

Main Results

Six randomised controlled trials (overall 876 participants) lasting 6 to 24 months were included. Two studies (overall 312 participants) compared valproate with placebo, four studies (overall 618 participants) valproate with lithium, one study (overall 23 participants) valproate with olanzapine and one study (overall 220 participants) valproate with the combination of valproate plus lithium. In terms of study quality, most studies reported the methods used to generate random sequence; however, only one study reported enough details on allocation concealment. Four of six included studies described their design as "double blind", but only two trials reported full details about blinding. Valproate was more effective than placebo in preventing study withdrawal due to any mood episode (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.93; NNTB 8), but no difference in efficacy was found between valproate and lithium (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20). Valproate was associated with fewer participants dropping out of treatment for any cause when compared with placebo or lithium (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95 and RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98, respectively). However, combination therapy with lithium plus valproate was more likely to prevent relapse than was monotherapy with valproate (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.96). Significant differences in adverse event frequencies were found, and lithium was associated with more frequent diarrhoea, polyuria, increased thirst and enuresis, whereas valproate was associated with increased sedation and infection.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supports the efficacy of valproate in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder. Clinicians and patients should consider acceptability and tolerability profile when choosing between lithium and valproate-their combination or other agents-as long-term treatment for bipolar disorder.

### Current pharmacologic treatment of dementia: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^116CpvKf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians developed this guideline to present the available evidence on current pharmacologic treatment of dementia.

Methods

The targeted literature search included evidence related to the effectiveness of 5 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacologic therapies for dementia for outcomes in the domains of cognition, global function, behavior/mood, and quality of life/activities of daily living. RECOMMENDATION 1: Clinicians should base the decision to initiate a trial of therapy with a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine on individualized assessment. (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.) RECOMMENDATION 2: Clinicians should base the choice of pharmacologic agents on tolerability, adverse effect profile, ease of use, and cost of medication. The evidence is insufficient to compare the effectiveness of different pharmacologic agents for the treatment of dementia. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.) RECOMMENDATION 3: There is an urgent need for further research on the clinical effectiveness of pharmacologic management of dementia.

Dementia-related psychosis and agitation — antipsychotic efficacy: First-generation antipsychotics have modest benefit over placebo across "seven double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group clinical trials including 252 patients studied over periods of 3–8 weeks", with meta-analysis showing improvement in "59% of the subjects taking antipsychotics and 41% of those taking placebo"; studies used doses "ranging from 66 to 267 mg/day in chlorpromazine equivalents", adverse effects were "common", and "Dropout rates were also high". A more recent meta-analysis found clinically significant improvement in "64%… versus 38%… translating to an effect size of 26%", with "No differences in efficacy… among the different agents" and "Significant side effects… 25% more" with active treatment; another review reported "61% with antipsychotics and 35% with placebo, yielding a treatment effect of 26%". For second-generation antipsychotic risperidone, "Three placebo-controlled trials" are noted; in a fixed-dose study of "625 patients", response rates were "45% and 50% for 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day, respectively… than placebo (33%)… (the 0.5-mg/day dose was not more effective than placebo)", and "Parkinsonism was seen in 21% of patients who received 2 mg/day", concluding "the 1 mg/day represented the most effective dose".

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112hzVdL]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — psychosis and agitation management emphasizes nonpharmacological interventions first with careful risk–benefit assessment. Clinicians must weigh the risk of not treating against the risks of active treatment and the consideration and use of behavioral, psychosocial, and psychotherapeutic treatments is particularly critical. If symptoms cause significant distress or are associated with behavior that may place the patient or others at risk, treatment with low doses of antipsychotic medication is indicated in addition to nonpharmacological interventions, and treatment with an antipsychotic is also indicated if a patient is agitated or combative in the absence of psychosis, with the use of these agents reevaluated and their benefit documented on an ongoing basis. When antipsychotics are ineffective, carbamazepine, valproate, or an SSRI may be used in a careful therapeutic trial, and a low-dose benzodiazepine may prove useful for symptoms limited to specific times or settings, noting problematic side effects in elderly patients. Although mood stabilizers and SSRIs are commonly used for agitation, delusions, and aggression, they have not been consistently shown to be effective or safe and should not be seen as having improved safety or comparable efficacy compared to antipsychotics. As illness evolves, the continued use of any intervention must be evaluated and justified on an ongoing basis, and periodic reevaluation and revision of the treatment plan, including a change in dose, a change in medication, or medication discontinuation, may be indicated, with patients whose initial symptom severity was relatively low potentially more easily withdrawn from psychotropics.

### Acute efficacy of divalproex sodium versus placebo in mood stabilizer-naive bipolar I or II depression: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1118HS3G]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct an exploratory evaluation of the acute efficacy of extended-release divalproex sodium compared to placebo in patients with bipolar I or II depression.

Method

Outpatients aged 18–70 years with mood stabilizer-naive bipolar I or II disorder experiencing a major depressive episode (DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of divalproex sodium monotherapy or placebo. The primary outcome measure was mean change from baseline to week 6 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Secondary outcomes included rates of response and remission, changes in the Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar (CGI-BP) Severity of Illness scores, and changes in anxiety symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. The study was conducted between 2003 and 2007.

Results

Fifty-four subjects with bipolar I (n = 20) or bipolar II (n = 34) disorder were randomly assigned to divalproex or placebo; 67% (36 of 54) met DSM-IV criteria for rapid cycling. Divalproex treatment produced statistically significant improvement in MADRS scores compared with placebo from week 3 onward. The proportions of patients meeting response criteria were 38.5% (10 of 26) in the divalproex group versus 10.7% (3 of 28) for the placebo group (P = 0.017). The proportions of patients meeting remission criteria were 23.1% (6 of 26) for divalproex versus 10.7% (3 of 28) for placebo (P = 0.208). Subgroup analysis revealed no separation between divalproex and placebo for those with bipolar II diagnoses. Nausea, increased appetite, diarrhea, dry mouth, and cramps were the most common side effects.

Conclusions

These data suggest that divalproex sodium is efficacious and reasonably well tolerated in the acute treatment of mood stabilizer-naive patients with bipolar depression, particularly for those with rapid-cycling type I presentations, and that confirmatory large-scale studies are indicated.

Cholinesterase inhibitors — evidence and use in Alzheimer's disease emphasize that given the evidence from randomized controlled trials for modest improvement and the lack of established alternatives, it is appropriate to offer a trial of one of these agents for patients with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease for whom the medication is not contraindicated, and whenever cholinesterase inhibitors are prescribed, patients and their families should be apprised of the limited potential benefits as well as of the potential costs. Many clinicians prescribe these agents across the entire range of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and in patients with moderate medical or psychiatric comorbidity or possible Alzheimer's disease. Across agents, large placebo-controlled trials have suggested similar degrees of efficacy, yet currently available data do not allow a fair, unbiased direct comparison; four head-to-head trials had significant methodological problems and none resolves superiority, and there are also no data on whether or how to switch from one cholinesterase inhibitor to another.

Atypical antipsychotics play a limited role in the management of dementia-related psychosis (DRP). Major adverse outcomes are associated with most antipsychotics in patients with dementia, and guidelines recommend that these drugs not be prescribed for long durations. When treating symptoms of DRP, clinicians should follow guidelines such as using medication only if the patient or others are in distress or danger and starting with low doses. Novel antipsychotics or alternative agents may offer superior efficacy and safety.

Dementia — agitation and psychosis management emphasizes first addressing reversible causes [I], using environmental measures if symptoms are not causing significant danger or distress [I], and considering behavioral measures [III]; if these are unsuccessful or behaviors are dangerous or distressing, judicious pharmacologic treatment may be used [II] with ongoing reevaluation and documentation [I]. Antipsychotic medications are recommended for psychosis [II] and agitation [II], can provide modest improvement in behavioral symptoms [I], and have evidence based mostly on 6–12-week trials with limited research beyond 12 weeks though clinical experience supports use [II]. Antipsychotics must be used with caution at the lowest effective dosage [I], with patients and families advised about potential benefits and risks, particularly mortality [I]; second-generation agents have a black box warning for increased mortality in elderly patients and first-generation agents carry at least a similar risk, with selection based on side-effect profile and patient characteristics [I]. Benzodiazepine benefit is modest but they may have a role for prominent anxiety [III] or on an as-needed basis for infrequent agitation or procedural sedation [II], with lorazepam and oxazepam preferable to longer half-life agents such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide [III]. Anticonvulsants, lithium, and beta-blockers have minimal evidence and are generally not recommended except after other treatments have failed [III]; trazodone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not well studied for non-depressive symptoms but may be appropriate for nonpsychotic patients with agitation, especially with mild agitation or prior antipsychotic sensitivity [III].

Summary of evidence

Eight references [75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82] reporting on the effect of discontinuation of antipsychotics were identified (Figure S4 and Table S13 and S20) from a total of six studies. Three studies were single‐center and three were multi‐center RCTs. A number of references reported on the same two studies. In detail, Devanand et al. [7879] reported on the same study as was the case with Ballard et al. [8182]. In both instances, the studies reported on the same cohort, but outcomes relevant for the PICO were reported in two different studies (e.g. mortality in one study and neuropsychiatric symptoms in another). A recent Cochrane meta‐analysis [83] on discontinuation of antipsychotics assessed three studies not included in the present Guideline. One study did not report on any of the outcomes for the PICO [84] and two did not test a relevant intervention [85, 86] (i.e. did not test the intervention which was defined in the PICO; Table S13). One additional study which was evaluated as satisfying the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for the present Guideline, was included in the present Guideline but had not been included in the previously published Cochrane review [82]. Study duration ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months, with one study reporting 42‐month follow‐up [82]. For studies reporting on mortality, there was a low event rate. Point estimates for relative risk varied from 0.19 to 3.11, with most [75, 77, 78, 79, 80], but not all [82] showing no significant differences. One study reported on serious adverse events (relative risk 2.80, 95% CI 0.98–7.98) [79]. With regard to neuropsychiatric symptoms, two studies reported improvement with discontinuation [80, 81] and two reported improvement with continuation [75, 79]. A single study reported on global cognitive function and found favorable results for discontinuation [mean difference in change from baseline between the two groups 8 (95% CI 2.20–13.80)] [81]. None of the identified studies reported on caregiver burden (Table). Two studies did not include a financial disclosure statement [75, 76]. Four studies reported on conflicts of interest [75, 78, 81, 82] (Table S1).

Level of evidence

The level of evidence was very low.

1 INTRODUCTION

Our increasing lifespan has led to an increased prevalence of diseases of the brain, including Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder with significant cognitive and behavioral deficits, which accounts for almost 80% of cases of dementia (World Alzheimer Report, 2014; World Health Organization, 2015 a). In rare cases, AD is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in specific genes that enhance amyloid burden in the brain; however, the majority of cases are of unknown origin and are termed late‐onset given that symptomatology manifests in older individuals (Tanzi, 1999). The prevalence of AD at 65 years of age is 13% and doubles every 5 years thereafter (World Alzheimer Report, 2014). The World Health Organization estimates that globally there are 47.5 million cases of AD/dementia (Aguero‐Torres et al. 1998) that annually incur costs surpassing $604 billion USD (World Alzheimer Report, 2014). The economic and social burden of AD/dementia is expected to triple by 2050 (World Health Organization, 2015 a).

### Psychotropic drug treatment for agitated behaviour in dementia: what if the guideline prescribing recommendations are not sufficient? A qualitative study [^114mmcq8]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Physicians clearly need guidance on the treatment of agitated behaviour in dementia to close the gap between scientific evidence and clinical practice. This is also commonly noted internationally. The heterogeneity of people with agitation in dementia combined with diagnostic uncertainty and the considerations for personalised PD treatment leads to major treatment challenges for physicians. There is no specific PD that works in all similar cases, which is also commonly noted in the literature, and physicians often try multiple kinds of PDs to find a treatment that works. If the few guideline recommended PDs do not work, physicians will try other PDs. As a result, we found that many different PDs are prescribed for various specifications of behaviour, (hypotheses of) underlying causes, and symptomatic treatment goals. The absence or inconsistency of evidence for specific PDs does not rule out individual effects, since the guideline based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only concerns average effects in average patients. However, there is also a danger in this way of prescribing: by stretching diagnostic criteria and trial and error, the risk of inappropriate prescribing increases. If on the basis of trial and error a drug is tried which is advised against based on high-quality evidence such as RCTs, this may be considered inappropriate prescribing. To reduce this risk of inappropriate prescribing, it might be beneficial to expand the guideline prescribing recommendations beyond RCT-based prescribing recommendations to give physicians more guidance on PD treatment for agitated behaviour in dementia.

In some cases, all treatment fails, which often leads to frustration and feelings of hopelessness. Especially in the case of refractory symptoms, physicians feel sedation is the only option left. Sedation sometimes ends in intermittent or continuous palliative sedation that eventually leads to death. This difficult process has also been described by Veldwijk-Rouwenhorst et al.

Several factors physicians consider during the reanalysis of agitated behaviour are in accordance with guideline recommendations and reported in previous literature; however, participants' 'considerations regarding specific PD choice' are barely represented in (inter)national guidelines. Studies have reported some of these considerations to influence the prescribing of PDs for NPS. In this study, we provide a detailed overview of considerations from physicians' point of view.

There was no difference between groups in change on any secondary outcome. The valproate group had higher rates of somnolence, gait disturbance, tremor, diarrhea, and weakness. Eighty-eight participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline and 12 months; the valproate group showed greater loss in hippocampal and whole-brain volume, accompanied by greater ventricular expansion. The adverse events more likely to occur with valproate included somnolence, gait disturbance, tremor, diarrhea, constipation, weakness, asthenia, and dyspnea; those more likely with placebo included agitation, anxiety, delusions, dizziness, hyperhydrosis, and rash. There were 105 serious adverse events in the placebo group vs 90 in the valproate group, including 12 deaths in the placebo group vs 9 in the valproate group; none were judged to be related to treatment.

Post hoc comparisons suggested possible worsening of some measures of cognition and of function at several time points. Tolerability and adverse events were consistent with prior reports of valproate use in this population and with prescribing information. The adverse event burden suggests that the maximally tolerated valproate dose was achieved in these elderly patients. Adherence was adequate, although blood levels of valproate achieved were relatively low. Valproate appeared to reduce brain volumes after 12 months compared with placebo in these individuals. This result was not associated with cognitive or functional decline using our main clinical outcomes, although the MMSE data suggest greater cognitive decline in the valproate group.

The finding is open to interpretation; however, there are reports of reversible brain atrophy and cognitive impairment in children and young adults, 41–44 and the drug prescribing information states: "Reports have noted reversible cerebral atrophy and dementia associated with valproate therapy". The results of this trial, along with inconclusive results of preliminary trials as well as subsequent negative findings from a large trial, 46 should discourage prophylactic or symptomatic use of valproate in dementia. Given the public health significance of the behavioral features of dementia and the limited safety and efficacy of available psychotropic agents, it is still appropriate to pursue the goal of secondary prevention of agitation and psychosis. Other agents may merit investigation with this type of trial design.
