## Question

Humira antibody

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anti-adalimumab antibodies (also called anti-drug antibodies, ADAs, or anti-therapeutic antibodies, ATAs), including their definition, prevalence, mechanisms, clinical consequences, assay issues, and management implications across diseases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly "Humira antibody" means in clinical practice. Then, I should verify prevalence estimates and why they vary. Next, I will examine the immunologic mechanisms and pharmacokinetic effects. After that, I need to review clinical consequences across indications. Then, I should appraise assay limitations and standardization issues. Finally, I will synthesize management strategies, including therapeutic drug monitoring, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misstate anything: "Humira antibody" refers to anti-adalimumab antibodies (ADAs/ATAs) that patients can develop during treatment, which are distinct from autoantibodies like ANA that adalimumab can also uncommonly induce. I should double-check that distinction and the implication that ADAs can neutralize drug activity and alter clearance, which is consistently described in regulatory and clinical immunogenicity literature [^45091c68] [^c40d86d4].

> Next, I should review prevalence, but wait, let me verify why numbers diverge so much. Reported ADA rates vary widely depending on disease, concomitant immunomodulators, and especially the assay used. In RA cohorts, prospective data show around 25–28% over 12–36 months, with most appearing early, whereas psoriasis cohorts report roughly 49% at 1 year, and IBD cohorts often cite 7–12% in routine practice but higher in some studies. Critically, ELISA-based methods detect antibodies only when drug is low, whereas ECL assays detect ADAs even with circulating drug, explaining much of the heterogeneity [^ec54fd8b] [^288d0a3a] [^90cf08e4] [^0da2aac9] [^0da2aac9].

> I will now examine mechanisms, and I need to ensure I capture both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. ADAs can accelerate drug clearance via immune complex formation and, when neutralizing, can block TNF binding, reducing efficacy. Clinically, higher ADA titers correlate with lower free adalimumab and worse outcomes, and this relationship is consistent across diseases, though the magnitude varies with assay sensitivity and timing of sampling [^c40d86d4] [^ec54fd8b] [^288d0a3a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical impact without anchoring to outcomes. In RA, ADA-positive patients have markedly lower adalimumab concentrations, less often achieve minimal disease activity or remission, and have higher discontinuation for treatment failure. In psoriasis, ADAs correlate with lower drug levels and attenuated response, and interval shortening helps less when ADAs are present. In IBD, low troughs and ADAs predict loss of response, and guidelines endorse TDM to distinguish mechanistic, immune-mediated, and non–immune-mediated failure, guiding escalation versus switching [^ec54fd8b] [^288d0a3a] [^6c86f20d] [^6b348930].

> Next, I should review assay limitations and why standardization matters. ELISA assays generally detect ADAs only when serum adalimumab is below about 2 mcg/mL, causing false negatives at higher drug levels, whereas ECL assays are more drug-tolerant but still not perfectly harmonized. Many studies fail to report assay details, complicating cross-trial comparisons, and regulatory documents emphasize that incidence figures are not comparable across platforms. This means that a negative ADA by ELISA does not exclude immunogenicity if drug is present, and ECL results should be interpreted in clinical context [^a1c8a908] [^cbca8444] [^c40d86d4] [^606ec738].

> Let me think about management, and I should confirm the role of TDM and thresholds. For secondary loss of response, measuring trough adalimumab and ADA helps decide whether to escalate dose/frequency, add an immunomodulator, or switch agent. In RA and PsA, levels at or above about 6–8 mcg/mL associate with better response and survival, whereas very low levels with high-titer ADAs favor switching rather than escalation. In IBD, expert guidance supports TDM to distinguish mechanistic failure from underexposure or ADA-driven loss, and pediatric data suggest dose optimization can suppress low-level ADAs in some cases. Proactive TDM for adalimumab remains controversial; a recent BMJ guideline gives a weak recommendation against routine proactive TDM for adalimumab outside trials, underscoring the need for shared decision-making and local feasibility [^cfc4409d] [^6c86f20d] [^089e11fc] [^4cb3659b].

> But wait, what if the patient is on methotrexate or another immunomodulator? I should confirm that concomitant methotrexate substantially reduces ADA formation and improves durability, which is repeatedly observed in RA cohorts and reflected in labeling. This is why combination therapy is often favored when immunogenicity risk is high or when ADAs emerge, though the benefit is less well established in psoriasis than in RA or IBD [^a1c8a908] [^cbca8444] [^55f3da07].

> I should double-check practical sampling and interpretation details. Trough sampling within 24 hours before the next dose is preferred to minimize drug interference and maximize interpretability, and results should be integrated with symptoms, biomarkers, and adherence. When ADA titers are high with undetectable drug, switching to another anti-TNF or a different class is generally preferred over escalation, whereas low-titer ADA with adequate drug may respond to escalation plus immunomodulator, recognizing that ADA to one anti-TNF increases the risk of ADA to the next [^69ad02ba] [^6c86f20d] [^6b348930].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Anti-adalimumab antibodies are common, variably detected by assay, mechanistically linked to lower drug exposure and reduced efficacy, and clinically associated with worse outcomes across diseases. TDM meaningfully informs management of secondary nonresponse, helping avoid futile escalation and prompting timely switching, while methotrexate co-therapy reduces immunogenicity. Proactive TDM for adalimumab is not yet standard, so reactive TDM at loss of response is the most evidence-aligned approach pending further trials [^ec54fd8b] [^288d0a3a] [^6c86f20d] [^4cb3659b].

Humira (adalimumab) antibodies are **anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)** that develop in 1–12% of patients on adalimumab, with higher rates when used without methotrexate or other immunomodulators [^a1c8a908] [^cbca8444]. ADAs can **reduce drug levels and efficacy**, and are linked to loss of response and treatment failure [^ec54fd8b] [^9ec8f134]. They are detected by ELISA or ECL assays, with ECL less affected by drug interference [^a1c8a908] [^cbca8444]. Management includes switching to another anti-TNF or drug class, adding methotrexate, or dose escalation, guided by therapeutic drug monitoring [^6c86f20d] [^6b348930].

---

## Mechanism of antibody formation

- **Immunogenicity**: Despite being fully human, adalimumab can trigger ADA production, especially with monotherapy or intermittent dosing [^a1c8a908] [^cbca8444].
- **Neutralization**: ADAs can bind adalimumab, reducing free drug and causing loss of efficacy [^c40d86d4] [^ec54fd8b].
- **Clearance**: ADA-drug complexes are cleared faster, lowering trough levels and worsening outcomes [^c40d86d4] [^ec54fd8b].

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

- **Prevalence**: ADAs occur in 1–12% with methotrexate, and 12–26% without, varying by assay and population [^a1c8a908] [^cbca8444].
- **Clinical impact**: ADAs correlate with lower drug levels, reduced efficacy, and higher risk of treatment failure and discontinuation [^ec54fd8b] [^9ec8f134].
- **Disease-specific effects**: ADAs are well documented in RA, psoriasis, and IBD, with the strongest long-term data in RA [^ec54fd8b] [^288d0a3a] [^6c86f20d].

---

## Detection methods

| **Assay type** | **Description** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| ELISA | Common, detects ADAs when drug is low | False negatives if drug > 2 mcg/mL [^a1c8a908] [^cbca8444] |
| ECL | More drug-tolerant, detects ADAs at higher drug levels | Less standardized, variable cutoffs [^a1c8a908] [^cbca8444] |
| RIA | Less drug interference, but radioactive | Limited availability [^8734e41a] |

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)**: Measure drug and ADA levels to guide decisions; low drug with high ADA favors switching; adequate drug suggests escalation [^6c86f20d] [^6b348930].
- **Switching**: Move to another anti-TNF or different class if ADA titers are high and drug is low [^6c86f20d] [^d55c10f4].
- **Combination therapy**: Add methotrexate or other immunomodulators to reduce ADA formation and restore efficacy [^a1c8a908] [^cbca8444].
- **Dose escalation**: Shorten intervals or increase dose if drug is low and ADA is low or absent [^6c86f20d] [^d55c10f4].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies include **methotrexate co-therapy** to lower ADA risk and improve durability [^a1c8a908] [^cbca8444], and **adherence** to regular dosing to reduce intermittent exposure and ADA risk [^c4f302ee].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Patients with ADAs have **higher risks** of treatment failure, discontinuation, and disease progression than those without ADAs [^ec54fd8b] [^9ec8f134]. Early detection and management can **improve outcomes** by enabling timely switches or optimization [^6c86f20d] [^6b348930].

---

Humira antibodies are ADAs that can **impair efficacy**; their impact is mitigated by TDM, switching, combination therapy, and dose escalation, with methotrexate co-therapy reducing risk [^ec54fd8b] [^6c86f20d] [^a1c8a908].

### Anti-TNF drug and antidrug antibody level monitoring in IBD: a practical guide [^544e1102]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) medications, adalimumab and infliximab, play an important role in the management of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. For those in whom anti-TNF is effective, the therapy is associated with fewer symptoms, improved quality of life and disease and surgery-free survival. Unfortunately, up to 30% of patients will fail to respond to anti-TNF drugs while up to 50% of those who do see an initial response will lose response at some point. The introduction of drug monitoring for anti-TNFs, including drug level and antidrug antibody level testing allows a more personalised management of patients and improves patient outcomes. This article reviews the data for the use of anti-TNF monitoring and presents a 'how to' guide for clinicians.

Monitoring

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with HUMIRA, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with HUMIRA.

Discontinue HUMIRA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with HUMIRA, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

Invasive Fungal Infections

If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections.

### Adalimumab for the treatment of Crohn's disease [^0706d8c4]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

The advent of biologic therapy for Crohn's disease has revolutionized our approach to disease management and redefined our goals. Infliximab (Remicade), an intravenously delivered murine-chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha was released in 1998 and shown to have significant benefits in patients with refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease. Since then other anti-TNF strategies have undergone investigation with variable results. Adalimumab (Humira), a self administered, subcutaneous, fully human monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha represents the next generation of therapy. It has demonstrated efficacy for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's in three large double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials. In addition it has demonstrated steroid-sparing properties and the ability to reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life. It is anticipated, given its clinical efficacy, its fully human nature, and the convenience of self administration that it will have a significant effect on the management of Crohn's disease.

Discussion

Based on our review of 111 adalimumab and 206 infliximab studies, a substantial proportion of patients who receive the anti‐TNF monoclonal antibodies adalimumab and infliximab to treat chronic inflammatory disease develop ADA. In a number of these studies, the presence of ADA has been shown to correlate with altered drug clearance and reduced serum levels, contribute to loss of response and increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions in some patients. Therefore, clinicians, patients, researchers and regulators share a particular interest in the immunogenicity profile of these biological agents.

Surprisingly, in the clinical studies of adalimumab and infliximab included in this review, the specific assay format used to test immunogenicity was not reported in approximately one‐quarter to one‐fifth of studies. In studies in which assay format is specified, variations in the formats, including type of assay and cut‐points used, hamper interpretation of study findings and cross‐study comparisons. We found that immunogenicity rates varied widely among inflammatory disease states and immunoassay formats and over years. Nonetheless, our findings support a high prevalence of ADA in adalimumab‐ and infliximab‐treated patients, even if they do not answer important questions about which patients are at risk of developing ADA and losing response to their biological therapy.

5.2.4.6 Secondary loss of response to anti-TNF therapy

Statement 93. We suggest that patients with secondary loss of response to anti-TNF therapy may have serum drug and anti-drug antibody concentrations measured to inform appropriate changes in treatment (GRADE: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.6%).

Secondary loss of response to anti-TNF therapy can occur as a consequence of immune-mediated neutralising antibodies to the drug (although there are likely to be other mechanisms including non-neutralising, drug-clearing antibodies or non-immune-mediated mechanisms). Measurements of drug and antibody levels are helpful in guiding next steps. A retrospective analysis of 247 IBD patients with 330 loss of response events (188 to infliximab and 142 to adalimumab) showed that, following loss of response, trough concentration measurements and anti-drug antibodies could inform the likely outcome of interventions. Patients with either adequate drug concentrations (adalimumab > 4.5 µg/mL or infliximab > 3.8 µg/mL) or positive anti-drug antibodies (adalimumab > 4 µg/mL equivalent or infliximab > 9 µg/mL equivalent) did better by switching to an alternative anti-TNF or an alternative class of drug, whereas patients with low drug concentration and negative antibodies improved with dose increase. A decision analytic model in Crohn's patients losing responsiveness to infliximab showed that a testing strategy was likely to be cost-effective compared with empiric changes in treatment. In a prospective study of IBD patients with secondary loss of response to infliximab, all of whom had a dose increase, mucosal healing occurred in half of patients and was associated with a rise in trough levels. In patients losing response to infliximab and manifesting with 'end of dose' recurrence of Crohn's symptoms, drug levels and anti-drug antibody levels should be checked and consideration given to starting concomitant immunomodulator therapy where this is not already being used. To increase the drug levels of infliximab by shortening the infusion interval to 6 weeks may be as effective as shortening to 4 weeks or giving a 10 mg/kg dose. Once remission has been recaptured over a period of 3–4 months, it may be possible to reduce the dose or stretch the intervals back out again without losing response. In a further retrospective study in 168 Crohn's patients losing response, 112 patients were treated with 10 mg/kg 8-weekly and 56 with 5 mg/kg at 4-week intervals. Sustained response was achieved in 50% who received double dose and 39% of those with interval shortening, OR 1.5 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.9). Doubling the dose is generally more convenient and cost-effective than interval shortening.

### Anti-therapeutic antibodies and their clinical impact in patients treated with the TNF antagonist adalimumab [^84cbe5d7]. Cytokine (2017). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonists, which include infliximab and adalimumab, are widely used for treatment of various chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). However, some patients develop anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) which alter the pharmacokinetics and in some instances neutralize the biological effects of these therapeutics, impacting on clinical outcome. Approximately 10–30% of patients fail to respond to anti-TNF-α therapy and up to 60% of patients who responded initially fail to respond to treatment over time and require either dose-escalation or a switch to an alternative therapeutic to maintain a clinical response. The presence of ATA is thought to be responsible, at least in some patients, for the loss of clinical response.

### Anti-therapeutic antibodies and their clinical impact in patients treated with the TNF antagonist adalimumab [^385de31d]. Cytokine (2017). Low credibility.

5 Conclusion

Interference from therapeutic is an important confounding factor and needs to be mitigated for proper ATA detection. In the ECL antibody assay described here, acid treatment did not significantly increase the ATA incidence. However, we found that measuring adalimumab in the same samples as used for ATA testing is beneficial as the level of therapeutic is an important parameter governing clinical response and appears to be indicative of ATA development which can then be confirmed during follow-up. Routine monitoring of therapeutic and ATA should be considered during adalimumab therapy so as to allow clinicians to personalise treatments with a view to maximizing individual therapeutic outcomes.

### Anti-therapeutic antibodies and their clinical impact in patients treated with the TNF antagonist adalimumab [^3b4a93d5]. Cytokine (2017). Low credibility.

Patients treated with the TNF antagonist adalimumab develop anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA), the prevalence of which varies depending on the assay used. Most assays are compromised due to the presence of adalimumab in the clinical samples. Our objective was to develop an antibody assay, applicable for clinical testing, which overcomes the limitation of therapeutic interference and to further determine the relationship between ATA development, adalimumab levels and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Use of an electrochemiluminescence platform permitted development of fit-for-purpose immunoassays. Serum samples from patients, taken prior to and at 12 and 24weeks of treatment, were retrospectively analysed for levels of adalimumab and ATA. Overall, the antibody prevalence was 43.6% at 12weeks and 41% at 24weeks of treatment. Disruption of immune complexes by acid dissociation, a strategy often adopted for this purpose, only marginally increased the antibody prevalence to 48.7% and 46% at 12 and 24weeks respectively. We found that antibody formation was associated with decreasing levels of circulating adalimumab, but no direct effect on disease activity was evident as assessed using DAS28 for RA patients and BASDAI for PsA and AS patients. However, a negative correlation of free adalimumab trough levels with disease activity scores was observed. Data showed that adalimumab levels can serve as an indicator of ATA development which can then be confirmed by ATA testing. Monitoring of both therapeutic and antibodies should be considered during adalimumab therapy to allow clinicians to personalise treatments for maximal therapeutic outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of adalimumab in difficult-to-treat psoriasis [^d430d9ce]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder, with a prevalence of 2% to 3% worldwide. Psoriatic lesions affecting scalp, nails, palms, and soles are considered difficult-to-treat and require specific management. When psoriasis involves these areas, it may be considered more severe even if the lesions are not extensive. Adalimumab (Humira) is a fully human monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF), administered via subcutaneous injection. It has already been used in the treatment of adults and children with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In literature, few studies investigated its efficacy in difficult-to-treat areas, hence we conducted an observational prospective study of 24weeks to assess its role in patients with difficult to treat psoriasis. We found out a significant improvement in nail and scalp psoriasis, while palmoplantar and genital psoriasis showed an improvement though not statistically significant. Therefore, adalimumab can be used in difficult-to-treat areas with great results, also allowing an improvement in the quality of life of affected patients, both adults and children.

### Utilisation of anti-TNF levels in a UK tertiary IBD centre [^90cf08e4]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain how anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drug and anti-drug antibody levels testing is used in a 'real-world' setting to optimise inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment.

Design

Retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected patient data.

Setting

Tertiary IBD centre in London, UK.

Patients

All patients at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals on anti-TNF who had levels measured between the start of testing in 2012 and October 2014.

Interventions

Anti-TNF drug and anti-drug antibody levels as part of routine monitoring.

Main Outcome Measures

Indication for measuring levels and changes in management made as a result of the levels.

Results

330 infliximab levels were carried out in 199 patients and 143 adalimumab levels were carried out in 103 patients. Levels were primarily done in those with evidence of loss of response; 37% of infliximab levels and 52% of adalimumab levels. Levels resulted in a change in management in 26% of patients in infliximab group and 25% of patients in adalimumab group; however, this was greater in those with loss of response, 62% and 61% respectively. Anti-drug antibodies were detected in 7% of patients.

Conclusions

Our early experience has demonstrated that measuring anti-TNF drug and anti-drug antibody levels can be useful in the optimisation of IBD management. In an increasing number of patients, particularly those with evidence of loss of response, it allows early decisions to be made regarding changing therapy. It also offers the potential for significant cost-saving by preventing pointless dose escalation in the context of therapeutic levels or when high-level anti-drug antibodies are present.

5.11 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Abatacept

In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including HUMIRA is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Immunoassay methods used in clinical studies for the detection of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab and infliximab [^c40d86d4]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Up‐regulation of the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α is a common pathogenic mechanism in a wide array of chronic immune‐mediated inflammatory diseases 1. In clinical trials conducted over nearly two decades, biological agents that block inflammatory responses activated by TNF‐α have been shown to be clinically effective in treating such diseases. However, a substantial proportion of patients do not achieve a response to anti‐TNF therapy, fail to maintain their response after initial improvement and/or develop therapy‐limiting adverse events. In patients with chronic inflammatory diseases who receive anti‐TNF agents, anti‐drug antibodies (ADA) have been associated with loss of response, because of inadequate therapeutic levels caused by increased clearance and/or neutralization of the agent's biological activity and hypersensitivity reactions 2, 3, 4, 5. Given the possible adverse clinical sequelae of treatment‐induced ADA formation, evaluation of ADA and associated outcomes is a critical aspect of patient care in those who receive biological therapy and is required for biological approval by regulatory bodies 6.

Historically, reported ADA prevalence has been inconsistent among studies due, in part, to the various assay formats used to monitor immunogenicity in clinical trials of biologicals in chronic inflammatory diseases 7, 8. Each of the available formats has limitations that can reduce its utility in clinical and research settings and complicate interpretation of findings 9. Some assays have a poor dynamic range and may generate false‐negative results because of interfering interaction with active drug or false‐positive results due to other antibodies, such as rheumatoid factor. Although the various immunoassay platforms have been used successfully to detect and quantify ADA in discrete study populations, few studies have directly assessed findings based on the different methods. Important recommendations for immunoassay validation and alignment of terms, definitions and concepts involving biological immunogenicity have been published in the past decade 6, 10, but the continuing lack of a unified approach to ADA testing throughout trials prohibits a meaningful comparison of the immunogenicity in studies of the same biological or different biologicals. In the present review, we examined the assay formats used in assessing ADA in patients with chronic inflammatory disease treated with the anti‐TNF monoclonal antibodies adalimumab and infliximab, as well as the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes reported, to characterize the impact of ADA assessment in clinical studies.

### Clinical utility and accuracy of point-of-care testing for anti-TNF drug monitoring and loss of response [^f3f82c92]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Messages

What is already known? Point-of-care tests enable rapid measurement of drug concentrations, including anti-TNF agents such as infliximab and adalimumab.

What is new here? Infliximab and adalimumab serum concentrations measured by point-of-care tests are associated with loss of response in inflammatory bowel disease patients.

How can this study help patient care? These findings implicate the potential of point-of-care tests to provide real-time data, facilitating prompt therapy adjustments to improve patient outcomes.

### What next after infliximab? [^4afd107d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

The use of infliximab (Remicade) has revolutionized the care of Crohn's disease (CD) patients who have proved refractory to standard treatment. The use of infliximab is very well tolerated in the majority of patients but in a small subset of patients may lead to the production of antibodies (termed "antibodies to infliximab"-ATI). The production of these antibodies has been associated with the development of both acute and delayed infusion reactions, although even in patients who develop ATIs, these reactions are relatively uncommon. Nonetheless, these reactions may occasionally be severe enough to lead to intolerance to infliximab. Another group of patients, after initially having excellent responses to infliximab, experience an attenuated response or loss of response over time. What is the cause of this loss of efficacy? ATIs may play a role in some patients but other potential reasons for this phenomenon have provoked much debate. The importance of other cytokines after TNF-alpha has been neutralized may be relevant as (this has been shown to be the case in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the idea of beneficial autoimmunity production to TNF-alpha. (Wildbaum G, Nahir MA, Karin N. Beneficial autoimmunity to proinflammatory mediators restrains the consequences of self-destructive immunity. Immunity 2003;19:679–88.) It has been shown that during the course of an autoimmune condition, the immune system mounts a beneficial autoantibody response to proinflammatory mediators. This response counteracts, to a certain degree, the autoimmune pathology. This natural counteraction has been illustrated in animal models of autoimmunity, and there has been evidence demonstrated that this occurs in human RA. Whether this occurs in Crohn's is unknown; infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody containing an approximately 25% murine region. It had been hoped that the development of humanized or fully human monoclonal antibodies would provide therapeutic antibodies that did not induce an immune response. While this has unfortunately not proven to be the case-these products still have significant immunogenicity-these products do present an alternative therapy when infliximab cannot be used. In light of this, adalimumab (Humira) a human monoclonal antibody used for treating rheumatologic conditions has been investigated as an alternate treatment for patients with CD who after initially responding to infliximab experience intolerance or loss of efficacy. Is this a viable alternative?

### Adalimumab (Humira) [^65855404]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adult Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during HUMIRA 40 mg every other week treatment.

Adult Ulcerative Colitis: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of HUMIRA 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively.

Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics

Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified.

Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis: Antibodies to adalimumab by ECL assay were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations in pediatric patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab.

Specific Populations

### Adalimumab (Humira) [^7299893d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCY

SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with HUMIRA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

Discontinue HUMIRA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.

Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before HUMIRA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to HUMIRA use.
Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.
Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.

Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with HUMIRA prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

### A pilot study of adalimumab in infliximab-allergic patients [^b2c89157]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab (Remicade) is highly effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease. A subset of patients experience allergic reactions as a result of antibodies to infliximab (ATIs). The purpose of the current study is to describe the safety and efficacy of adalimumab (Humira) in patients previously allergic or intolerant to infliximab. Adalimumab is an anti-TNF-alpha agent containing only human peptide sequences. Seven patients have been treated with adalimumab who had experienced immediate- or delayed-hypersensitivity reactions to infliximab and one with infliximab-induced lupus. Except for injection site discomfort, adalimumab was well tolerated without signs or symptoms of allergic reactions. One patient who had previously received pooled human immunoglobulin developed a pruritic rash after each dose of adalimumab. Patients with active disease who had previously experienced a robust response to infliximab responded to adalimumab as reflected by an improvement in Harvey-Bradshaw index and inflammatory markers. Based on these preliminary data, adalimumab may be a safe and effective substitute for infliximab-allergic patients. Individuals who have been exposed to human antibodies may be sensitized to other human antibodies such as adalimumab.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^d55c10f4]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

A significant proportion of patients have detectable drug levels and a low titre of anti-drug antibodies. Management in this situation is not clear as antibodies may be transientand, as shown in a post-hoc analysis of the TAXIT trial, infliximab dose escalation can facilitate an adequate trough drug level and can result in clinical response despite the presence of anti-drug antibodies. Starting the patient on immunomodulator therapy (if they are not already on this) can abolish the antibody response and restore efficacy, particularly if combined with an increase in anti-TNF dose.

The presence of low drug levels in the presence of high titre antibodies (and perhaps even low titre antibodies in the context of adalimumab) mandates a switch, ideally within class to an alternative anti-TNF therapy, particularly if the patient has previously shown themselves to be anti-TNF responsive over a prolonged period. Of note, individuals who form antibodies to one biological therapy may be more prone to forming them to a second. In this context, having a low threshold for combining the second biologic with immunomodulator therapy is logical to reduce the risk of future antibody-mediated loss of response.

Many of the published studies on switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab have measured drug and anti-drug antibody concentrations before switching. This may identify patients with low drug levels and/or antibodies, who probably should not switch, with a more appropriate action either to withdraw therapy (if in deep remission) or switch to a different drug class.

5.2.4.7 Annual review of patients on biologics therapy

Good Practice Recommendation 16. IBD patients receiving immunomodulators or biologics should have an annual review of treatment, including consideration of response and treatment continuation, optimisation or cessation (Agreement: 97.7%).

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisals for biological therapies in IBD (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab) recommend annual review. Although there is little evidence to support this, it is sensible to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with both immunosuppressive and biological drug therapy. Patients may be having their treatment in infusion facilities or at home, and a formal clinical review is necessary to ensure that changing circumstances, adverse effects of treatment, long-term clinical remission or other factors do not make it more appropriate to withdraw treatment or substitute alternative therapy.

### Exploring the role of monitoring anti-TNF α drug and antibody levels in the management of inflammatory bowel disease [^bff27fb4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders which often result in significant morbidity or surgery. Current treatment options are not curative and may cause significant adverse effects. The introduction of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) therapy over a decade ago was a welcome addition to the therapeutic armamentarium and revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite their relative success, a significant proportion of patients with IBD fail to respond or subsequently lose response anti-TNFα therapy. This review identifies and explores the role of drug levels and immunogenicity (antibody formation) on the efficacy of anti-TNFα therapy and details how monitoring these parameters may help to optimize the management of patients with IBD.

### Is there a role for therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa on tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors? [^c0632a46]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, adalimumab and infliximab, are at the forefront of biologic therapy for the management of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa, with adalimumab as currently the only approved medication for this condition. In treating patients, primary or secondary lack of response (also termed suboptimal response) is a major burden for both patients and healthcare systems and is a challenge with biologics in part owing to the development of anti-drug antibodies following treatment. To overcome this, therapeutic drug monitoring may be conducted proactively or reactively to a patient's suboptimal response guided by measurements of trough serum drug concentrations and levels of anti-drug antibodies. While strong evidence to support the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring exists in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, current information is limited in the context of hidradenitis suppurativa. We sought to summarize the available evidence and to present the role of therapeutic drug monitoring and other dose optimization strategies in improving clinical response in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa treated with tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors.

Preparing for Treatment Initiation

Before initiating treatment with anti-TNF agents, comprehensive safety checks should be performed as specified in the international and local guidelines, including testing for opportunistic infections and ensuring safe time intervals between preventive live vaccinations and exposure to anti-TNF agents (Fig. 1). During this evaluation, attention should be paid to the contraindications for treatment with infliximab or adalimumab (active tuberculosis or other severe infections, such as sepsis and opportunistic infections; moderate to severe heart failure). Patients with confirmed EIMs require a multidisciplinary team approach for effective management.

Before initiating therapy with an anti-TNF agent, it is good practice to set patient-specific treatment goals. A baseline patient questionnaire completed in the waiting room prior to the consultation can be used to document subjective symptoms and problems, facilitate the following consultation visit, and provide relevant information for ongoing monitoring and patient management (an example clinical follow-up questionnaire is included in the online supplementary data).

TREATMENT SELECTION

Infliximab and adalimumab have been studied extensively in patients with CD; however, prospective, double-blind, double-dummy studies directly comparing the 2 biologics are not available. Most of the available comparative evidence is derived from retrospective and some prospective observational cohort studies, which suggest no major differences in efficacy and safety between infliximab and adalimumab but a higher immunogenicity of the former (see Supplementary Table 2 in the online supplementary data and references therein).

Route and schedule of administration are likely to drive physician and patient preference (Fig. 1). Infliximab is administered intravenously and therefore must be administered over a significant time period in a clinical setting, whereas adalimumab is delivered subcutaneously, allowing for home-based treatment; the 2 therapies also differ regarding the administration schedule (see Therapeutic Scenarios). Treatment with infliximab can be easily tailored according to weight- and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-based dosing adjustments, whereas dose optimization with adalimumab is limited by the 40 mg and 80 mg fixed-dose injections. This difference should be considered in patients with a weight > 80 kg in whom the efficacy of the standard adalimumab dose of 40 mg once every 2 weeks seems to be less pronounced. A similar rationale applies to patients with presumably high drug clearance at baseline, in particular those with low serum albumin levels, high serum CRP concentrations, and obese patients, in whom more flexible dosing with infliximab may help achieve appropriate drug exposure. Physician preference may also be driven by perceptions of differing potency; a US survey indicated that infliximab may be regarded as more potent than adalimumab by both IBD experts and non-expert physicians.

### Adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring improves treatment outcome in patients with psoriasis [^0fd3d1e9]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) or the measurement of drug concentrations (ideally at trough level) and antidrug antibodies are important tools for optimizing biologic therapy. Limited studies evaluated TDM in dermatological indications. A retrospective study of 170 patients with psoriasis who were treated with adalimumab and received TDM reported that adalimumab TDM is practical and promising in routine psoriasis care. However, TDM interpretation requires careful attention to the clinical context to address the controversies and challenges.

### Clinical utility of random anti-tumor necrosis factor drug-level testing and measurement of antidrug antibodies on the long-term treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis [^de164fac]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether antidrug antibodies and/or drug non-trough levels predict the long-term treatment response in a large cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with adalimumab or etanercept and to identify factors influencing antidrug antibody and drug levels to optimize future treatment decisions.

Methods

A total of 331 patients from an observational prospective cohort were selected (160 patients treated with adalimumab and 171 treated with etanercept). Antidrug antibody levels were measured by radioimmunoassay, and drug levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 835 serial serum samples obtained 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of therapy. The association between antidrug antibodies and drug non-trough levels and the treatment response (change in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints) was evaluated.

Results

Among patients who completed 12 months of followup, antidrug antibodies were detected in 24.8% of those receiving adalimumab (31 of 125) and in none of those receiving etanercept. At 3 months, antidrug antibody formation and low adalimumab levels were significant predictors of no response according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria at 12 months (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.71 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.57, 0.85]). Antidrug antibody-positive patients received lower median dosages of methotrexate compared with antidrug antibody-negative patients (15 mg/week versus 20 mg/week; P = 0.01) and had a longer disease duration (14.0 versus 7.7 years; P = 0.03). The adalimumab level was the best predictor of change in the DAS28 at 12 months, after adjustment for confounders (regression coefficient 0.060 [95% CI 0.015, 0.10], P = 0.009). Etanercept levels were associated with the EULAR response at 12 months (regression coefficient 0.088 [95% CI 0.019, 0.16], P = 0.012); however, this difference was not significant after adjustment. A body mass index of ≥ 30 kg/m² and poor adherence were associated with lower drug levels.

Conclusion

Pharmacologic testing in anti-tumor necrosis factor-treated patients is clinically useful even in the absence of trough levels. At 3 months, antidrug antibodies and low adalimumab levels are significant predictors of no response according to the EULAR criteria at 12 months.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on therapeutic drug monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease [^69ad02ba]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Practical aspects of reactive TDM in anti-TNF therapy include timing and assay considerations. The panel recommends that a trough for infliximab or adalimumab be drawn "as close to the next dose as possible (ie, within 24 hours)". Drug trough concentrations are "consistent across different commercial assays", whereas "assays for anti-drug antibodies are not readily comparable". When antibodies are detected, "it is unclear what antibody level is clinically meaningful"; "Low-titer antibodies may be transient and non-neutralizing", and interval shortening and/or dose escalation may optimize troughs in this setting.

### Reprint of "Anti-therapeutic antibodies and their clinical impact in patients treated with the TNF antagonist adalimumab" [^855f63e4]. Cytokine (2018). Low credibility.

Patients treated with the TNF antagonist adalimumab develop anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA), the prevalence of which varies depending on the assay used. Most assays are compromised due to the presence of adalimumab in the clinical samples. Our objective was to develop an antibody assay, applicable for clinical testing, which overcomes the limitation of therapeutic interference and to further determine the relationship between ATA development, adalimumab levels and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Use of an electrochemiluminescence platform permitted development of fit-for-purpose immunoassays. Serum samples from patients, taken prior to and at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, were retrospectively analysed for levels of adalimumab and ATA. Overall, the antibody prevalence was 43.6% at 12 weeks and 41% at 24 weeks of treatment. Disruption of immune complexes by acid dissociation, a strategy often adopted for this purpose, only marginally increased the antibody prevalence to 48.7% and 46% at 12 and 24 weeks respectively. We found that antibody formation was associated with decreasing levels of circulating adalimumab, but no direct effect on disease activity was evident as assessed using DAS28 for RA patients and BASDAI for PsA and AS patients. However, a negative correlation of free adalimumab trough levels with disease activity scores was observed. Data showed that adalimumab levels can serve as an indicator of ATA development which can then be confirmed by ATA testing. Monitoring of both therapeutic and antibodies should be considered during adalimumab therapy to allow clinicians to personalise treatments for maximal therapeutic outcomes.

### Anti-therapeutic antibodies and their clinical impact in patients treated with the TNF antagonist adalimumab [^8af60247]. Cytokine (2017). Low credibility.

We found that for the antibody-positive, therapeutic-negative patients, the ATAs detected are neutralizing. While neutralization could not be confirmed in all ATA positive samples due to adalimumab interference, a previous study has shown that the humoral response is restricted to the idiotype region of adalimumab and all ATA against adalimumab neutralize adalimumab function.

An association was seen between the magnitude of ATA response at 12 and/or 24 weeks of treatment and levels of circulating adalimumab for all patients. Higher ATA levels were associated with lower levels of adalimumab in the samples.

Our data concurs with previous studies in which patients developing ATA during adalimumab treatment show reduced adalimumab levels in comparison with ATA negative patients. There is no agreement as yet on the minimal trough levels of adalimumab required for maintaining patients at low disease level or in remission.

However, in all groups, we observed a negative correlation between trough adalimumab levels and disease activity scores DAS28 and BASDAI at 12 and/or 24 weeks of treatment. No significant difference was found between ATA positive and ATA negative patients when disease activity was evaluated at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment or after an extended period of 12 months. Moreover, ATA positive and ATA negative patients did not significantly differ in terms of EULAR or ASDAS response criteria which classify individual patients in terms of responsiveness to treatment. A possible explanation is that, in our study, the majority of antibody positive samples contain low levels of ATA. While the clinical relevance of such low levels is currently not clear, it is plausible that on further treatment and a longer follow-up including immunogenicity monitoring, a clear picture of the emergence of ATA and its impact on clinical outcome becomes evident. Bartelds et al. showed that in two-thirds of RA patients developing adalimumab antibodies, antibody formation occurs within 28 weeks of treatment but an extended follow-up over 3 years allowed identification of an increasing number of ATA positive patients with impact on disease progression. Association between high ATA levels with clinical non-response was evident.

In this study, based on the limited number of samples evaluated, it is clear that ATAs in patients diminish levels of free therapeutic and so if ATA testing is challenging for clinical laboratories engaged in routine follow-up of patients, assessment of levels of adalimumab and their impact on disease activity can be considered as an indirect approach towards monitoring of ATA formation.

### Adalimumab-adaz (adalimumab) [^7999c48d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-adaz treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.

Monitoring

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-adaz, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-adaz.

Discontinue Adalimumab-adaz if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-adaz, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

Invasive Fungal Infections

If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^8545006c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Infliximab immediate hypersensitivity — when treatment is indicated, patients with an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab should preferably be reexposed through desensitization if skin testing result is positive or if the initial reaction was severe or recurrent despite premedication and/or a slowed infusion rate. The risk of a recurrent reaction with subsequent exposures is around 33% on the first reexposure and progressively decreases thereafter. Anti-infliximab antibodies do not cross-react with adalimumab, although patients who develop anti-infliximab antibodies are more prone to develop adalimumab antibodies and have a higher treatment failure rate with adalimumab; despite these caveats, switching to adalimumab after a hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab can be attempted. For TNF-α inhibitor injection-site or systemic reactions, desensitization could be considered, but desensitization is not a safe method of preventing nonimmediate hypersensitivity reactions to TNF-α inhibitors; switching to another TNF-α inhibitor has not been adequately studied, and some reports note that reexposure to the suspected culprit drug may not necessarily lead to a recurrent reaction.

### Proactive therapeutic drug monitoring of biologic drugs in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis, or psoriasis: a clinical practice guideline [^4cb3659b]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis), or psoriasis taking biologic drugs, does proactive therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) improve outcomes as compared with standard care?

Context and Current Practice

Standard care for immune mediated inflammatory diseases includes prescribing biologic drugs at pre-determined doses. Dosing may be adjusted reactively, for example with increased disease activity. In proactive TDM, serum drug levels and anti-drug antibodies are measured irrespective of disease activity, and the drug dosing is adjusted to achieve target serum drug levels, usually within pre-specified therapeutic ranges. The role of proactive TDM in clinical practice remains unclear, with conflicting guideline recommendations and emerging evidence from randomised controlled trials.

The Evidence

Linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis which identified 10 trials including 2383 participants. Inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis, and psoriasis were grouped together as best current research evidence on proactive TDM did not suggest heterogeneity of effects on outcomes of interest. Proactive TDM of intravenous infliximab during maintenance treatment may increase the proportion of patients who experience sustained disease control or sustained remission without considerable additional harm. For adalimumab, it remains unclear if proactive TDM during maintenance treatment has an effect on sustained disease control or sustained remission. At induction (start) of treatment, proactive TDM of intravenous infliximab may have little or no effect on achieving remission. No eligible trial evidence was available for proactive TDM of adalimumab at induction (start) of treatment. No eligible trial evidence was available for proactive TDM of other biologic drugs in maintenance or at induction (start) of treatment.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued the following recommendations for patients with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis, or psoriasis:1. A weak recommendation in favour of proactive TDM for intravenous infliximab during maintenance treatment2. A weak recommendation against proactive TDM for adalimumab and other biologic drugs during maintenance treatment3. A weak recommendation against proactive TDM for intravenous infliximab, adalimumab, and other biologic drugs during induction (start) of treatment.

Understanding The Recommendations

When considering proactive TDM, clinicians and patients should engage in shared decision making to ensure patients make choices that reflect their values and preferences. The availability of laboratory assays to implement proactive TDM should also be considered. Further research is warranted and may alter recommendations in the future.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patient partners, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations based on a linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis which identified 10 trials including 2383 participants. The panel followed standards for trustworthy guidelines and used the GRADE approach, explicitly considering the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of treatment from an individual patient perspective.

### Clinical utility of random anti-tumour necrosis factor drug testing and measurement of anti-drug antibodies on long-term treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis [^9ec8f134]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Up to 40% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs do not respond because of primary inefficacy or loss of response. Although one explanation is that immunogenicity leads to the development of anti-drug antibodies and low drug concentrations, the clinical usefulness of pharmacological monitoring is debated. Our aim was to assess whether the presence of anti-drug antibodies and non-trough drug concentrations could predict treatment response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anti-TNF drugs.

Methods

331 patients were selected from a multicentre prospective cohort (160 treated with adalimumab, 171 etanercept). Serum samples were collected at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment initiation. Anti-drug antibodies were measured with RIA, drug concentrations with ELISAs, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) at each timepoint. Linear and logistic regression, generalised estimating equation (GEE), and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to test the association and predictive value of anti-drug antibodies and non-trough drug concentrations on treatment response (ΔDAS28).

Findings

835 serial samples were tested (414 adalimumab, 421 etanercept). Anti-adalimumab antibodies were detected in 31 (24.8%) of 125 patients who had completed 12 month follow-up and none of the etanercept patients. The presence of anti-drug antibodies was associated with lower adalimumab concentrations (Spearman r = -0.66, p = 0.0041). At 3 months, anti-drug antibody formation and low adalimumab concentrations were significant predictors of poor treatment response at 12 months (area under curve [AUC] 0.68, 95% CI 0.54–0.81, and 0.66, 0.55–0.77, respectively; and both combined 0.71, 0.57–0.85). Adalimumab concentration was the most significant independent predictor of ΔDAS28 after adjustment for confounders (regression coefficient 0.12, 95% CI 0.06–0.18; p = 0.003). High etanercept concentrations were associated with better treatment response (p = 0.01), but low concentrations at 3 months were not a significant predictor of poor treatment response at 12 months (AUC 0.58, 95% CI 0.46–0.70). In the combined GEE model including adalimumab and etanercept, a body-mass index of 30 kg/m² or more was associated with low drug concentrations (regression coefficient 0.78, 95% CI 0.37–1.18; p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Pharmacological testing in anti-TNF initiated patients is clinically useful even in the absence of trough levels. At 3 months, presence of anti-drug antibodies and low adalimumab concentrations are a significant predictor for poor treatment response at 12 months. Strengths of this study include a large, prospective cohort and use of RIA to measure antibodies (less prone to drug interference). Although non-trough concentrations might have underestimated the frequency of antibodies, their presence still predicted response.

### Adalimumab (Humira) [^cbca8444]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies

HUMIRA has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.10)]. The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with HUMIRA weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of HUMIRA.

Flare of HS, defined as ≥ 25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from HUMIRA treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies.

HUMIRA has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies (14.11, 14.12)]. The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA.

6.2 Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other adalimumab products may be misleading.

There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with HUMIRA are presented in Table 2.

n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed)

aIn patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with HUMIRA monotherapy

bIn patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with HUMIRA monotherapy

### Adalimumab, a fully human anti tumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibody, and concomitant standard antirheumatic therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: results of STAR (safety trial of adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis) [^4a96dcbc]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study, known as STAR (Safety Trial of Adalimumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis), evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab (Humira), a fully human monoclonal tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) antibody, when given with standard antirheumatic therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not adequately responding to such therapies. Standard antirheumatic therapy included traditional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD), low dose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), and/or analgesics.

Methods

In this 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 636 patients with RA were randomly assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously (sc) every other week (n = 318) or placebo (n = 318) while continuing standard antirheumatic therapy. The frequencies of adverse events, serious adverse events, severe or life-threatening adverse events, adverse events leading to withdrawal, infection, or serious infection were the primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were determined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria.

Results

During the study, the majority of patients received concomitant traditional DMARD (83.5%) and/or corticosteroids, NSAID, and/or analgesics (97.3%). Overall, 56.0% of patients continued treatment with one, 23.6% with 2, and 3.9% with ≥ 3 traditional DMARD. At 24 weeks, there were no statistically significant differences between the adalimumab and placebo groups in their respective rates of adverse events (86.5% vs 82.7%), serious adverse events (5.3% vs 6.9%), severe or life-threatening adverse events (11.9% vs 15.4%), or those leading to withdrawal (2.8% vs 2.2%). There were also no statistically significant differences in the rates of infections (52.2% vs 49.4%) or serious infections (1.3% vs 1.9%) between the groups. The incidence and types of adverse events did not vary between adalimumab- and placebo-treated patients by the number of concomitant traditional DMARD (0, 1, or 2). Adalimumab-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients achieved statistically superior ACR20 (52.8% vs 34.9%), ACR50 (28.9% vs 11.3%), and ACR70 (14.8% vs 3.5%) response rates at Week 24 (p ≤ 0.001).

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that addition of adalimumab 40 mg given sc every other week to concomitant standard antirheumatic therapy is well tolerated and provides significant improvements in signs and symptoms of RA. The data indicate that adalimumab is a safe and effective therapeutic option in patients with active RA who have an inadequate response to standard antirheumatic therapy, including one or more traditional DMARD, corticosteroids, NSAID, and analgesics.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^6b348930]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapeutic drug monitoring — has become common, and if active CD is documented in persons receiving anti-TNF therapies, assessment of anti-TNF drug levels and antidrug antibodies should be considered; there can be 3 different scenarios explaining biologic failure (mechanistic failure, immune-mediated drug failure, and non–immune-mediated drug failure), where mechanistic failure occurs with therapeutic drug levels and no antibodies with active mucosal ulceration and a medication within another class should be considered, non–immune-mediated mechanisms occur with subtherapeutic trough concentrations and absent antidrug antibodies, and immune-mediated drug failure is seen with low or undetectable trough concentrations and high titers of antidrug antibodies; published guidance has suggested minimal therapeutic target trough levels — infliximab > 5 µg/mL, adalimumab > 7.5 µg/mL, and certolizumab pegol > 20 µg/mL — patients with a history of anti-TNF antibodies are at greater risk of developing antidrug antibodies to the next in-class agent and combination therapy with immunomodulators such as thiopurines or methotrexate should be considered; there is a suggestion that higher anti-TNF drug levels are associated with better clinical outcomes, but there are no high quality, interventional data available.

### New strategies to address the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors: a systematic analysis [^c4f302ee]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the putative link between antibody formation to adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept, circulating drug levels and clinical outcomes.

Methods

A literature search was conducted using Pubmed from inception to 5th March 2013 of original research articles relating to adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab that investigated the immunogenicity of each drug. Data were extracted to document the disease, anti-TNF-α agent, regimen, study design, use of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, the relationship between drug administration and antibody assessment, the type of immunoassay and cut-off, plasma drug concentration, frequency of antibody and clinical assessments, antibody positivity rate and relationship between antibody positivity and clinical outcome. Studies were stratified by drug, disease area and whether or not concomitant immunosuppressive therapy had been given. All data were tabulated by publication and analyzed descriptively.

Results

A total of 57 original research articles were included in the analysis (infliximab n = 34; adalimumab n = 18; etanercept n = 5). There was considerable heterogeneity in study design, methodology for anti-drug antibody detection and drug bioavailability evaluation. Consequently, it was difficult to compare the immunogenic potential of infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept, particularly because different assays with variable sensitivity and specificity were used. The timing of occurrence and the persistence of anti-drug antibodies appeared to be influenced by administration schedules and concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Monitoring of circulating drug levels and anti-drug antibodies appears to be an emerging and cost-effective strategy for the management of the individual patient.

Conclusions

Monitoring drug and anti-drug antibody levels appears to be a putative strategy for optimal and cost-effective intervention. However studies of consistent and homogeneous design, methodology and duration are warranted to assess the true incidence and consequences of immunogenicity.

### Two cases of disseminated tuberculosis after negative screening before adalimumab treatment for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [^60154c35]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adalimumab (Humira) is a fully human, monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. It is indicated for several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including psoriasisand hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Tuberculosis (TB) is the most prevalent infectious complication with an increase in the diagnosis among patients receiving anti–TNF-α therapy. Therefore, TB screening before biological therapy is extremely important to avoid this complication.

We report 2 cases of patients on adalimumab treatment for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, who have complications with disseminated TB in mammary and intraocular regions, despite negative screening before anti–TNF-α therapy.

### Immunogenicity of anti-TNF α therapy in psoriasis: a clinical issue? [^2fe1d741]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Immunogenicity of antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) agents has been proven to play a significant role in the variability of clinical responses among patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. However, its clinical impact on the outcome of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis receiving anti-TNFα treatment is not yet fully clear. Despite the high rates of efficacy of anti-TNFα agents in psoriasis, a substantial proportion of patients remain who experience a primary or secondary failure or significant side effects, which are potentially ascribable to immunogenicity.

Areas Covered

Topics include immunologic response elicited by anti-TNFα agents, the impact of immunogenicity on treatment response to anti-TNFα and the role played by immunogenicity in the lack of efficacy of anti-TNFα agents (infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept) in psoriasis.

Expert Opinion

Based on data available in the literature and the clinical experience of the authors, this article suggests the optimal approach to drug monitoring and antidrug antibody assay and the most effective use of biologic immunotherapies in this setting. Immunogenicity should be taken into account in the adoption of therapeutic choices in psoriatic patients, such as anti-TNFα agent intensification, or switching to another anti-TNFα agent or a drug with a different mechanism of action.

### Defining the therapeutic range for adalimumab and predicting response in psoriasis: a multicenter prospective observational cohort study [^99e75d7e]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biologic therapies have transformed the treatment paradigm in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Complete disease remission is now achievable in people with psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α) remains the first-line biologic strategy. However, there are wide variations in response, with a significant number of patients not responding (primary treatment failure) or losing response over time (secondary treatment failure). Some of this heterogeneity may be explained by differences in the amount of drug available at the target tissue, which in turn is influenced by adherence and pharmacokinetic covariates such as weight and drug immunogenicity (formation of antidrug antibodies [ADAs]). Therapeutic drug monitoring using measurement of serum drug levels (a proxy for tissue levels) and/or ADAs thus holds potential to optimize management, and a strong correlation between TNF inhibitor serum trough levels, ADAs, and treatment response has been described in IBD, RA, and psoriasis. Indeed, a recent study using adalimumab clinical trial data in 1,212 psoriasis patients reported that responders at 16 weeks had higher adalimumab concentrations than nonresponders (6.3 vs. 2.2 μg/ml). Bodyweight was a significant covariate in the pharmacokinetic model, and the presence of ADAs resulted in lower adalimumab exposure and efficacy.

### Adalimumab (humira) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis… [^4d754bad]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Adalimumab is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug labeled for the adult treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. It is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds and inhibits the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α. SAFETY There have been rare instances of serious infections, malignancies, and neurologic reactions with TNF antagonists, including adalimumab. 1–4 Serious infections can be fatal and include sepsis, opportunistic infections, invasive fungal infections, and tuberculosis. Although rare, increased rates of lymphomas and malignancies have been observed with the use of TNF antagonists.

TOLERABILITY Adalimumab is well tolerated and the discontinuation rate because of adverse effects is similar to placebo. 1 Mild injection site reactions consisting of erythema and/or pain, itching, or swelling will occur in one in five patients and rarely necessitates drug discontinuation. 1 Nonserious infection, including upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, and urinary tract infection, at a rate of one per patient-year will likely occur. 1 However, most patients can continue therapy after infection resolution. 1 Other adverse effects are rash and headache, which occur in less than 5 percent of patients.

1. 7 Clinical response is significantly better if adalimumab is added to the existing therapy. This benefit appears to be most significant if the existing regimen contains methotrexate. 7 There have been no direct comparisons between adalimumab and traditional DMARDs other than methotrexate.

Likewise, TNF-alpha antagonists have not been compared directly, but adjusted indirect comparisons indicate similar response rates.
8. 4 Patients should be evaluated for latent tuberculosis infection before drug administration and monitored for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis disease while on therapy. Those at risk of hepatitis B virus infection should be evaluated for carrier status before adalimumab initiation. Live vaccines should not be administered concurrently in patients receiving adalimumab. 1.

### Anti-therapeutic antibodies and their clinical impact in patients treated with the TNF antagonist adalimumab [^6fb7e6d8]. Cytokine (2017). Low credibility.

Some studies have shown that adalimumab-treated patients develop ATA that are associated with lower serum adalimumab trough levels and loss of clinical response, depending on the magnitude of the immune response. The reported incidence of anti-adalimumab antibodies varies considerably among studies, from less than 5% to over 80% of patients developing ATAs, sometimes transiently. Such variation can be explained not only by differences in the population studied e.g. disease, therapeutic regimen, concomitant treatment with immunosuppressants and follow-up period but also by the heterogeneity in methodology employed for ATA assessment. Antibodies to adalimumab have mainly been detected using radioimmunoassaysor pH-shift-anti-idiotype antigen binding test, but the limitation is that these require use of radioisotopes. Bloem et al.compared antibody assays for evaluation of immunogenicity in adalimumab-treated RA patients and concluded that different assays correlated well quantitatively but differed in their discriminatory potential and ability to identify as positive those samples containing low amounts of ATA. This is not unexpected since accurate detection and quantitative measurement of ATA is fraught with technical problems associated not only with differential assay sensitivity for low and high affinity ATA but also with therapeutic and/or target interference. Mitigation of interference is crucial for a thorough assessment of ATA and is particularly relevant for monoclonal antibody therapeutics which persist in the circulation. Formation of immune complexes between circulating therapeutic and ATA compromises ATA detection and strategies for circumventing therapeutic interference are required. An acid dissociation step is often implemented in the immunoassay, but this has limitations and cannot be applied universally to eliminate therapeutic interference as acid can degrade the ATAs and/or therapeutic and, in some instances, provide false positive results due to increased target interference.

The application of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology for ATA testing has gained prominence in recent years, based on its increased sensitivity, large dynamic range and greater therapeutic tolerance. We therefore evaluated the utility of ECL-based assays and compared ATA results obtained with or without inclusion of acid treatment, in samples from adalimumab-treated patients in three disease groups - RA, AS and PsA. ATA specificity was confirmed by competitive inhibition and the neutralizing potential of the ATAs assessed in a reporter gene assay. As the half-life of adalimumab is 15–19 days, the levels of residual therapeutic were also determined in an ECL assay. Finally, we tried to ascertain if the presence of ATA has any effect on trough levels of adalimumab and on disease progression.

### Immunoassay methods used in clinical studies for the detection of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab and infliximab [^7e061d8a]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

To this point, fewer than half the studies included in this review of adalimumab and infliximab reported findings, either positive or negative, related to the pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety of treatment in patients who did or did not develop an immune response. We hesitate to draw pointed conclusions about the impact of ADA on clinical outcomes because of the aforementioned lack of assay standardization as well as other differences in methodology, therapeutic response measures and patient characteristics. However, in the studies that presented such findings, independent of immunoassay format, investigators consistently reported decreased serum adalimumab and infliximab concentrations in patients with ADA, reduced efficacy and increased rates of infusion‐related reactions in ADA‐positive patients.

Based on our review of the literature, we determined that individual studies generally provide 'high‐level' data on immunogenicity, often with very little detail. On close inspection, multiple confounding factors were uncovered, including the lack of standard terms, standard assays and standardized interpretation (including cut‐points). Although some progress has been apparent in recent years, inspired in large part by recommendations for precise immunogenicity‐related definitions of terms and concepts and assay method validation proposed by expert working groups in this field 6, 10, a lack of standardization and consistency in assay methodology and reporting may hinder this area of research. Several actions may prove to be useful in improving the reliability and interpretation of immunogenicity data for biological agents, including adoption of modern assays that may be more robust with less drug interference, more consistent reporting of the immunogenicity assay methods used and analysis of the potential clinical consequences of ADA formation in published biological studies. Standardization in immunogenicity testing and reporting, as suggested nearly a decade ago by Shankar et al. 6, as well as disease activity measures, may help to advance our understanding of the impact of immunogenicity to biologicals in patients with chronic immune‐mediated inflammatory diseases.

Adalimumab

Similar findings to the infliximab studies have been reported by Bartelds et al. using RIA in RA patients treated with adalimumab. Although adalimumab is a fully human antibody, there still remains the potential to induce human anti-human antibodies. In a prospective cohort study over 28 weeks, the anti-adalimumab antibodies developed in 17% of RA patients and were associated with a reduced improvement in disease activity (mean ΔDAS28, ADAb positive 0.65 ± 1.35 vs ADAb negative 1.70 ± 1.35; P = 0.001). The use of concomitant MTX was related to a lower rate of antibody development than adalimumab monotherapy (12% vs 38%). Immunogenicity was subsequently increased in the context of switching from infliximab to adalimumab due to non-response. Patients who developed prior anti-infliximab antibodies (33/52 switchers, 63%) more often developed anti-adalimumab antibodies compared to anti-TNF naive patients and consequently were less likely to respond to adalimumab compared with patients who did not develop anti-adalimumab antibodies. However, of all the patients without ADAbs to adalimumab, 89% used concomitant MTX compared with only 54% of the patients with anti-adalimumab antibodies (P < 0.0001). The same group also evaluated the impact of immunogenicity in 272 RA patients treated long term with adalimumab, where 28% of patients developed ADAbs over 3 years, the majority (67%) in the first 6 months. The development of ADAb formation was significantly associated with poor rates of remission [DAS28 < 2.6; hazard ratio (HR) 7.1; 95% CI 2.1, 23.4; P < 0.001], reduced likelihood of minimal disease activity (DAS28 < 3.2; HR 3.6; 95% CI 1.8, 7.2; P < 0.001), as well as higher rates of drug discontinuation due to treatment failure (38% vs 14%; HR 3.0; 95% CI 1.6–5.5; P < 0.001). Patients who developed anti-adalimumab antibodies during the 3 years were much less likely to be on concomitant MTX at baseline (52% vs 82%; P < 0.001) and on a lower mean dose (18 vs 25 mg/week; P < 0.005). The use of other concomitant DMARDs such as SSZ and/or HCQ was not associated with such an effect, however, these drugs were used much less frequently (7% of the total RA cohort). Furthermore, prednisolone use or dose was not significantly different in patients who developed ADAbs to those who did not (36%, median dose 7.5 mg/day vs 33%, median dose 5 mg/day, respectively).

### Adalimumab: an anti-TNF agent for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis [^c1a980d8]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) has a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Adalimumab (Humira, Abbott Laboratories) is the first fully human, recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets human TNF. Adalimumab blocks the interaction of TNF with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, thereby neutralising the activity of this cytokine. In clinical trials of patients with PsA, adalimumab significantly reduced both joint and skin symptoms. In addition, structural changes were inhibited, and statistically and clinically significant improvements in measures of disability and quality of life were observed. Adalimumab was generally safe and well tolerated.

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence-and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^cd53fc44]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Serum trough level and detection of antidrug antibodies (2017)

The serum trough level of a biologic depends on many factors, among which are dose and dose frequency, treatment adherence, disease activity, antibody formation and comedication with immunosuppressants. The extent to which the presence or absence of antibodies and the drug serum concentrations correlate to the clinical response depends on the type of biologic and needs further exploration.

At the moment a correlation between trough level concentration and clinical effect has only been demonstrated for adalimumab. 17 A therapeutic algorithm based on serum trough levels has potential to improve adalimumab therapy, but no prospective studies have been performed yet.

Recommendations

It may be useful to determine adalimumab serum trough levels before altering the frequency of administration or stop/switch therapy. A low serum trough level concentration can be caused by antidrug antibodies. The optimal serum trough concentration has been established for adalimumab (3.51–7.00 mg L⁻¹). 18 Measurement of only antidrug antibodies provides limited information.

Biosimilars (2017)

Currently approved biosimilars are available for infliximab (Remsima™, Celltrion Healthcare, Budapest, Hungary; Inflectra™, Hospira, Maidenhead, U.K.; and Flixabi ®, Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, U.S. A.) and for etanercept (Benepali, ® Biogen, Cambridge, MA, U.S. A.; and Erelzi, Novartis Pharma AG, Stein, Switzerland).

Recommendations There are no major objections to starting a registered biosimilar for patients eligible for biological therapy. It is recommended that patients be included in a registry to monitor efficacy and safety. Substitution of a biologic with a biosimilar in patients who are responding well is not recommended, but the decision to switch to a biosimilar in these patients is reserved for the physician and patient. Physicians should take into consideration that long‐term safety data for biosimilars are limited.

It is possible for patients who discontinue a biological therapy (for example for more than 6 months) to restart with a biosimilar. In the case of switching to a biosimilar, it is recommended to administer the first dose of the biosimilar when the old reference product was supposed to be re‐administered and not before, as the old drug may still be partially present in the body, which makes it impossible to attribute side‐effects to either of the two drugs. These recommendations are in line with the Dutch national guideline on biosimilars. 19

Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Patients in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12- month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown.

### Clinical utility of random anti-tumor necrosis factor drug-level testing and measurement of antidrug antibodies on the long-term treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis [^34c046f4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

In patients with a low drug level, a normal BMI, and no antidrug antibodies, the clinician may prompt a discussion with the patient regarding adherence to the medication; we observed that poor adherence or nonadherence was a predictor of low non‐trough levels and also has previously been associated with a poor treatment response 18. Furthermore, 2 patients in our study achieved a good EULAR response at 6 months and 12 months, in the presence of undetectable adalimumab levels in association with high‐titer antidrug antibodies. This would suggest that their disease had entered spontaneous remission, obviating the need for continuation of treatment with an anti‐TNF agent. Therefore, this situation represents a unique opportunity for stopping treatment with these expensive drugs in such responding patients.

In conclusion, in the context of drug non‐trough levels, measurement of adalimumab levels and antidrug antibodies early in the treatment course is predictive of subsequent treatment response. Consideration of these factors, along with BMI and adherence, may help when deciding the best treatment strategy in patients in whom adalimumab does not appear to be effective. To maximize the chances of efficacy, methotrexate treatment should be maintained at the highest dose the patient can tolerate. Etanercept non‐trough levels, while associated with treatment response, were less predictive and unlikely to be clinically useful in isolation.

### Immunoassay methods used in clinical studies for the detection of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab and infliximab [^4b2ec733]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

We examined the assay formats used to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in clinical studies of the anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies adalimumab and infliximab in chronic inflammatory disease and their potential impact on pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes. Using findings of a recent systematic literature review of the immunogenicity of 11 biological/biosimilar agents, we conducted an ancillary qualitative review of a subset of randomized controlled trials and observational studies of the monoclonal antibodies against anti-TNF factor adalimumab and infliximab. Among studies of adalimumab and infliximab, the immunoassay method used to detect antibodies was reported in 91 of 111 (82%) and 154 of 206 (75%) adalimumab and infliximab studies, respectively. In most adalimumab and infliximab studies, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or radioimmunoassay was used [85 of 91 (93%) and 134 of 154 (87%), respectively]. ADA incidence varied widely among assays and inflammatory diseases (adalimumab, 0–87%; infliximab, 0–79%). Pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes were only reported for ADA-positive patients in 38 of 91 (42%) and 61 of 154 (40%) adalimumab and infliximab studies, respectively. Regardless of assay format or biological used, ADA formation was associated with lower serum concentrations, reduced efficacy and elevated rates of infusion-related reactions. Consistent with previous recommendations to improve interpretation of immunogenicity data for biologicals, greater consistency in reporting of assay methods and clinical consequences of ADA formation may prove useful. Additional standardization in immunogenicity testing and reporting, application of modern, robust assays that satisfy current regulatory expectations and implementation of international standards for marketed products may help to improve our understanding of the impact of immunogenicity to biologics.

### Determination of adalimumab and etanercept trough levels and drug antibodies in long-term psoriasis treatment: a single-centre cohort study [^fdd6bcbd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

An algorithm based on measurement of a serum tumour necrosis factor antagonists (anti-TNF) and antidrug antibodies (ADA) has been proposed previously to guide dose escalation or therapy switching in the early (i.e. the first months of) treatment of psoriasis by anti-TNF. In long-term treatment of responding patients with psoriasis, it is usual to empirically reduce standard doses of anti-TNF to reduce exposure while maintaining clinical response. The relationship between serum anti-TNF, ADA levels and clinical efficacy in long-term treated patients with psoriasis has not yet been determined, so the potential role of these parameters in guiding dose escalation in this scenario is unknown.

Aims

To evaluate the relationship between drug/ADA levels and clinical efficacy in a group of patients with psoriasis undergoing long-term treatment with adalimumab or etanercept.

Methods

This was a single-centre, prospective, cohort study of patients with psoriasis receiving adalimumab or etanercept for a minimum of 48 weeks. All patients were started on the standard dose, but some adalimumab users had a reduced frequency of administration. Clinical efficacy was measured using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. Serum concentrations were measured by ELISA. Clinical assessment and blood sample collection were carried out simultaneously within 24 h before the next drug administration.

Results

In total, 21 patients were enrolled (67 simultaneous clinical and serum determinations: 38 receiving adalimumab, 29 receiving etanercept). We did not find any association between serum anti-TNF levels and clinical response. None of the patients developed ADA.

Conclusions

ADA and anti-TNF levels are not related to clinical effectiveness in patients with psoriasis undergoing long-term treatment with adalimumab or etanercept.

Summary

We examined the assay formats used to detect anti‐drug antibodies (ADA) in clinical studies of the anti‐tumour necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies adalimumab and infliximab in chronic inflammatory disease and their potential impact on pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes. Using findings of a recent systematic literature review of the immunogenicity of 11 biological/biosimilar agents, we conducted an ancillary qualitative review of a subset of randomized controlled trials and observational studies of the monoclonal antibodies against anti‐TNF factor adalimumab and infliximab.

Pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes were only reported for ADA‐positive patients in 38 of 91 (42%) and 61 of 154 (40%) adalimumab and infliximab studies, respectively. Regardless of assay format or biological used, ADA formation was associated with lower serum concentrations, reduced efficacy and elevated rates of infusion‐related reactions. Consistent with previous recommendations to improve interpretation of immunogenicity data for biologicals, greater consistency in reporting of assay methods and clinical consequences of ADA formation may prove useful. Additional standardization in immunogenicity testing and reporting, application of modern, robust assays that satisfy current regulatory expectations and implementation of international standards for marketed products may help to improve our understanding of the impact of immunogenicity to biologics.

### To test or not to test? An evidence-based assessment of the value of screening and monitoring tests when using systemic biologic agents to treat psoriasis [^f159b0cc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The development of new treatments for psoriasis provides dermatologists novel ways to help control the disease but raises questions about what laboratory screening tests are required. As of yet, no consensus or guidelines exist for dermatologists to follow and there may be misconceptions about the relative need for screening and monitoring tests in patients treated with biologic agents. Current practice ranges from no testing to blanket screening panels. The purposes of this review are to (1) systematically review the literature on the use of screening and monitoring tests when initiating and continuing biologic treatments (adalimumab, alefacept, efalizumab, etanercept, infliximab) for moderate to severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis; and (2) suggest practical guidelines for dermatologists on which to base such testing. We searched the Cochrane Collaborative Database (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [Cochrane Reviews] and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [Clinical Trials]) and the MEDLINE database using medical subject headings as search terms when available or key words when appropriate. We compiled published data on risk and risk assessment related to systemic psoriasis treatments, used expert opinion where appropriate when published clinical data were not adequately informative, and assigned evidence grades for various screening tests based on standard methods of the US Preventive Services Task Force. Finally, we developed a table of evidence grades for tests used to monitor different systemic medications. There is not strong evidence to recommend most screening tests for monitoring biological treatments. Neither is there strong evidence not to do such testing. Ultimately, from a practical standpoint, it is incumbent on the clinician to consider each patient independently and determine what screening tests are most appropriate for each individual patient.

### A review of the therapeutic management of ulcerative colitis [^93f15e3d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Adalimumab

For over half a decade, infliximab remained the only biologic choice for UC. Over this period, it was noted that some patients receiving infliximab as maintenance therapy would go onto to lose response, which was thought to be primarily mediated by anti-infliximab antibodies. Furthermore, those with antibodies were at higher risk of developing drug-mediated reactions. This prompted the research into alternative treatment options.

Adalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that targets TNFα. Early studies had already shown it to be efficacious in inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. The ULTRA 1 trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of adalimumab in inducing remission in patients with moderate-to-severe UC.

The trial was conducted over 8 weeks as a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled design over multiple centres in North America and Europe. In all, 186 patients were randomised to receive either adalimumab or placebo. Two separate dosing schedules were used in the adalimumab group, ADA 160/80 (160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg at weeks 4 and 6) or ADA 80/40 (80 mg at week 0, 40 mg at weeks 2, 4 and 6).

At week 8, 18.5% (p = 0.031 versus placebo) of patients treated with ADA 160/80 regime and 10% of those treated with ADA 80/40 regime (p = 0.833 versus placebo) were in remission (placebo 9.2%). The high placebo response rate likely contributed to the failure to reach statistical significance. The ULTRA 2 trial served the purpose of gathering longer-term data on efficacy and safetyand found remission rates of 22% at week 52 in those receiving adalimumab (placebo 12.4%). An open label extension study (ULTRA 3) has shown that up to 25% of patients remain in clinical remission 4 years on.

Numerous ADA biosimilars have been approved in recent years, with real-life data limited to observational cohort studies. However, there has been no significant difference in clinical, biochemical and endoscopic outcomes noted in these studies, – thus providing patients with a much larger variety in therapeutic options moving forwards. Interestingly, patients that were intolerant on one biosimilar, were subsequently switched to another biosimilar successfully, further cementing the role of biosimilars in the therapeutic armamentarium of IBD.

### Improved adalimumab dose decision with comprehensive diagnostics data [^d910de25]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Monoclonal antibodies are important in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is the first trial to monitor the effect of adalimumab dose escalation in persistently active RA. The aim of this study was to identify the response to adalimumab to improve the basis for making decision in relation to actual drug capacity in serum.

Methods

The disease activity of RA patients was assessed with CDAI and DAS28 before administration of additional 40 mg adalimumab one week after standard injection. Serum samples were analysed using the recoveryELISA technology, a combination of sandwich ELISA and competitive assay. The recoveryELISA measure the concentrations of free TNF-α, drug level, and the remaining active adalimumab in the patients' sera. An adalimumab concentration of 5.0–10.0 g/mL was defined as the targeted therapeutic window.

Results

Five of 8 patients achieved moderate EULAR response by dose escalation. The results of the free adalimumab and TNF-α neutralisation measurements allowed a separation of the cohort (n = 17) into three groups. Group 1 represents 18% of the patients with free adalimumab level higher 30.0 μg/mL and TNF-α neutralisation above 95%. Group 2 (47%) consists of patients within the therapeutic window with balanced free adalimumab and TNF-α neutralisation values. Group 3 contains 35% of the cohort with low concentrations of free adalimumab and lowest remaining TNF-α-neutralisation capacity. Anti-drug antibodies were detected in four patients but did not prevent response to treatment.

Conclusions

Drug and antigen monitoring using recoveryELISA may support dose decision to avoid unnecessary switch in medication or possible overtreatment.

### Management of anti-drug antibodies to biologic medications in children with inflammatory bowel disease [^089e11fc]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with monoclonal anti- tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) can result in immunogenicity and formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). ADAs are associated with loss of clinical response and worsening disease progression. Data examining treatment interventions to overcome ADA in pediatric patients with IBD are lacking.

Results

Medical records were reviewed from 234 children and adolescents with IBD treated with infliximab or adalimumab who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring (626 tests). All patients who had detectable antibodies were further analyzed. A total 58 patients (24.8%) developed ADA while being treated with infliximab or adalimumab. The incidence of antibody development was 12.9 per 100 person-years of anti-TNF treatment. Twenty-eight patients underwent dose optimization and 54% had undetectable ADA on follow-up monitoring. The mean duration of antibody suppression was 16.8 ± 10.9 months in those who were successfully suppressed with optimization. Patients who switched to a second anti-TNF medication were not more likely to develop antibodies to the second agent.

Conclusions

With limited therapies for IBD and the chronicity of the disease, we advocate salvage of the current anti-TNF through dose optimization in pediatric patients with antibody level < 10U/mL.

### A systematic review on infliximab and adalimumab drug monitoring: levels, clinical outcomes and assays [^5b99c189]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Immunogenicity to therapeutic proteins has been linked to loss of response by a large percentage of patients taking anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agents. Drug monitoring can be extremely useful, allowing physicians to adjust the therapeutic scheme individually. This article aims to systematically review the published data with respect to cutoff levels of infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) and relate them to the methodology adopted for quantification of IFX and ADA levels and clinical outcomes.

Methods

The PubMed database was searched to identify studies focusing on the association between IFX or ADA cutoff levels and clinical outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

Results

Of the 1654 articles initially selected by queries, 20 were included. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to identify cutoff levels of IFX or ADA that correlated with a clinical outcome, but only 6 studies performed the same analysis for antidrug antibody levels. Cutoff levels were different between studies. The methodology chosen for level quantifications, clinical outcomes, and sample size and characteristics were also different. Nevertheless, measurement of drug levels should be performed during maintenance, and with loss of response, with persistent high levels of C-reactive protein, and when mucosal lesions are still present. In these scenarios, drug and antidrug levels were correlated with clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

Concerning drug levels monitoring any methodology is adequate. With respect to antidrug antibody levels, it will be necessary to define a gold standard method or to establish different cutoff levels for different methodologies.

### HUMIRA (adalimumab), abbott laboratories-package insert… [^51e49eda]. FDA (AccessData) (2003). Low credibility.

Autoantibodies In the controlled trials, 12% of patients treated with HUMIRA and 7% of placebo-treated patients that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. One patient out of 2334 treated with HUMIRA developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patient improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with HUMIRA on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Immunogenicity Patients in Studies I, II, and III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab during the 6 to 12 month period. Approximately 5% of adult rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving HUMIRA developed low-titer antibodies to adalimumab at least once during treatment, which were neutralizing in vitro.

Patients treated with concomitant MTX had a lower rate of antibody development than patients on HUMIRA monotherapy. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse events was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients.

### Real-world implementation and outcomes of adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring in psoriasis: a national specialized center experience [^c52e1787]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum adalimumab concentration is a biomarker of treatment response but therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is yet to be implemented in routine psoriasis care. We incorporated adalimumab TDM in a national specialized psoriasis service and evaluated it using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) implementation science framework. We undertook pre-implementation planning (validating local assays) and implementation interventions targeted to patients (pragmatic sampling at routine reviews), clinicians (introduction of a TDM protocol), and healthcare systems (adalimumab TDM as a key performance indicator). Over 5 months, 170 of 229 (74%) individuals treated with adalimumab received TDM. Clinical improvement after TDM-guided dose escalation occurred in 13 of 15 (87%) nonresponders with serum drug concentrations < 8.3 μg/ml (median PASI reduction of 3.2 [interquartile range = 2.2–8.2] after 23.4 weeks) and in all nonresponders who had TDM-guided switch in biologic due to supratherapeutic drug concentrations (> 8.3 μg/ml; n = 2) or positive antidrug antibody (n = 2) (PASI reduction of 7.8 [interquartile range = 7.5–12.9] after 20.0 weeks). Proactive TDM led to dose reduction in five individuals with clear skin and subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic drug concentrations; four (80%) sustained clear skin after 50 weeks (range = 42–52). Adalimumab TDM based on pragmatic serum sampling is clinically viable and may lead to patient benefit. Context-specific implementation interventions and systematic implementation assessment may bridge the biomarker research-to-practice gap.

### Adalimumab serum levels and anti-drug antibodies: associations to treatment response and drug survival in inflammatory joint diseases [^76d80bca]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

TNF-α inhibitors (TNFis) and other biologic drugs have, together with novel treatment strategies such as treat to target, contributed to a revolution in the treatment of inflammatory joint diseases. For patients with RA, PsA and axial SpA (axSpA), remission or inactive disease is now a realistic treatment goal. Nevertheless, despite current therapies and treatment strategies, a large proportion of patients do not respond sufficiently to therapy and approximately half of patients lose efficacy over time. Failure to maintain disease control has a major impact on quality of life and increases the risk of joint destruction for patients with peripheral arthritis. Loss of efficacy can be caused by underexposure to drugs, with or without development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAbs). Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), individualized dosing based on assessment of drug levels and ADAbs, is one strategy suggested to improve the effectiveness of TNFis. TDM provides an opportunity to minimize both under- and overexposure to drugs. While underexposure can lead to loss of efficacy, overexposure increases costs and may predispose patients to adverse events. In addition, timely identification of ADAbs enables early adjustment of treatment, possibly preventing a clinical flare. In order to develop TDM algorithms, therapeutic ranges for the drug in question must be identified. Recently published EULAR points to consider stated that one important barrier to using TDM in clinical care is the current lack of identified therapeutic ranges for most TNFis.

Adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is the most commonly used TNFi worldwide in the treatment of several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory joint diseases. While prior data suggest that adalimumab levels of 4–12 mg/l are associated with treatment response in RA and PsA patients, less is known regarding optimal serum adalimumab levels in axSpA.

Adalimumab has a high immunogenic potential, both in originator and biosimilar products, with ADAb development in 10–60% of patients, depending on the diagnosis and assay used for detection. Except for co-medication with methotrexate, which reduces the occurrence of ADAbs, little is known regarding factors associated with ADAb formation to adalimumab.

The main aim of this study was to explore associations between serum adalimumab levels, treatment response and drug survival in patients with inflammatory joint diseases, with the intention of identifying a therapeutic level. This would allow the development of TDM algorithms for adalimumab that can be validated in prospective clinical trials. Additionally, we aimed to explore the occurrence, risk factors and clinical implications of neutralizing ADAbs.

### Adalimumab serum levels and anti-drug antibodies: associations to treatment response and drug survival in inflammatory joint diseases [^cfc4409d]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

To explore associations between serum adalimumab level, treatment response and drug survival in order to identify optimal drug levels for therapeutic drug monitoring of adalimumab. Also, to assess the occurrence and risk factors of anti-drug antibody (ADAb) formation.

Methods

Non-trough adalimumab and ADAb levels were measured by automated fluorescence assays in serum collected after 3 months of adalimumab treatment in patients with RA, PsA or axial SpA (axSpA) included in the observational NOR-DMARD study. Treatment response was evaluated after 3 months and drug survival was evaluated during long-term follow-up.

Results

In 340 patients (97 RA, 69 PsA, 174 axSpA), the median adalimumab level was 7.3 mg/l (interquartile range 4.0–10.3). A total of 33 (10%) patients developed ADAbs. Findings were comparable across diagnoses. In RA and PsA, adalimumab levels ≥ 6.0 mg/l were associated with treatment response [odds ratio (OR) 2.2 (95% CI 1.0, 4.4)] and improved drug survival [hazard ratio 0.49 (95% CI 0.27, 0.80)]. In axSpA, a therapeutic level could not be identified, but higher adalimumab levels were associated with response. Factors associated with ADAb formation were previous bDMARD use, no methotrexate comedication and the use of adalimumab originator compared with GP2017.

Conclusion

Higher adalimumab levels were associated with a better response and improved drug survival for all diagnoses, with a suggested lower threshold of 6.0 mg/l for RA/PsA. This finding, the large variability in drug levels among patients receiving standard adalimumab dose and the high proportion of patients developing ADAbs encourages further investigations into the potential role of therapeutic drug monitoring of adalimumab.

Material and methods

Samples and patients

Clinical samples were obtained from IBD patients immediately before an ADL infusion (trough levels): blood samples were collected, centrifuged, and serum samples were kept at −80°C until being processed. Spiked samples of known ADL concentrations (1.5, 4.8, 8.0, 11.3, 14.5, 17.8, 21.0, 24.3, 27.5, 30.8 and 34.0 µg/ml) were generated by diluting the appropriate amount of exogenous ADL (Humira ®, AbbVie Inc. North Chicago, IL, USA) into a pool of serum from control donors.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committees of all involved institutions, and all patients signed a written informed consent prior to their participation.

Invasive Fungal Infections

If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection.

5.2.4.4 Drug levels of infliximab and adalimumab

Trough concentrations during and following induction therapy have been shown to correlate with response to therapy for both infliximab and adalimumab. In an analysis of infliximab data from the ACT 1 and ACT 2 UC studies, serum levels at week 8 correlated with clinical response, remission and mucosal healing. This is confirmed in many studies, also showing that undetectable serum levels are often associated with anti-drug antibodies and worse clinical outcomes. The randomised TAILORIX trial assessed use of drug levels in 122 luminal Crohn's disease patients starting infliximab with an immunomodulator, and did not show benefit for treatment intensification starting at week 14 based on regular clinical assessment combined with drug levels and biomarker measurement when compared with clinical assessment only. The TAXIT study recruited IBD patients on stable maintenance infliximab therapy to evaluate trough infliximab levels to guide dosing. In the initial phase, all had their dose optimised with a target level of 3–7 µg/mL. Patients with low trough levels had their dose increased. For Crohn's disease patients there was a corresponding increase in clinical remission. Patients with high trough levels had their dose reduced. Overall this optimisation strategy was shown to be cost-effective. Patients were then randomised to dosing over the following year based on clinical features alone or based on trough levels. There was no difference in remission between the two groups, but there was a lower rate of flare in those randomised to the trough level-based dosing.

As discussed in the Section 4.9.3.1: Infliximab for perianal fistulising disease, higher levels may be required for patients with perianal fistulae. Drug levels vary according to the assay used, and consensus has not yet been achieved on the optimal therapeutic ranges. A flow chart for the use of anti-TNF therapeutic drug monitoring is presented in figure 4.

### Immunoassay methods used in clinical studies for the detection of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab and infliximab [^5b571c49]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted previously to evaluate the available data on the immunogenicity of 10 biological agents and one approved biosimilar agent in studies of autoimmune diseases 11. The search strategy and other methodological aspects of the original SLR, conducted and reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines 12, are presented in detail elsewhere 11 and are summarized briefly below. Using findings of the original SLR, we conducted an ancillary qualitative review focused on immunogenicity assay methods and potential pharmacokinetic and clinical corollaries in a subset of studies of adalimumab and infliximab. For the purposes of this review, the numbers of adalimumab and infliximab studies using each of the different assay types were totalled, the assay timing and cut‐points extracted when available and associated outcomes evaluated; no specific assay formats were selected a priori.

Data sources and search terms

In the original SLR 11 the search terms for treatments, including 'adalimumab' and 'infliximab', were used in combination with terms related to study design and disease states, i.e. rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), non‐radiographic axSpA (nr‐axSpA), psoriasis (Ps), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). For the purposes of the present review, because the majority of published studies containing immunogenicity data have been conducted in patients receiving the anti‐TNF monoclonal antibodies adalimumab and infliximab, only studies of these biologicals were included for analysis.

Relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies were identified in the literature published in English to November 2016 based on electronic searches of the following databases: MEDLINE ®, MEDLINE in Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Embase ®, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Proceedings from major rheumatology, dermatology, gastroenterology and immunology conferences and review papers, editorial reference lists and previously conducted SLRs were searched manually.

### Clinical utility of random anti-tumor necrosis factor drug-level testing and measurement of antidrug antibodies on the long-term treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis [^8734e41a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

A challenge when interpreting the results of immunogenicity studies is wide variation in the reported antidrug antibody frequency, which may be related to several intrinsic patient factors and drug‐related and treatment‐associated factors, including concomitant treatment with DMARDs 10, 11. The diversity of detection methods, timing of the sample collection, as well as the presence of free drug may mask the detection of antidrug antibodies due to drug interference 6, 8. The latter concern may be addressed by performing radioimmunoassay (RIA), which is less susceptible to drug interference compared with enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) 12 and has been used successfully in a clinical setting 5, 13, 14.

To circumvent the issue of drug interference, previous studies used trough‐level serum samples to measure drug concentrations and antidrug antibody levels, obtained immediately prior to administration of the patient's next scheduled dose. For treatment with agents such as adalimumab and etanercept, which are administered subcutaneously by the patient at home, ascertainment of trough levels would most likely require a separate hospital visit after inefficacy of the drug has been determined by the clinician. The practical implications for the patient and the impact on service delivery of obtaining serum antidrug antibody trough levels and drug levels pose additional challenges in clinical practice.

The aims of this study were, first, to investigate whether the presence of antidrug antibodies and/or drug non‐trough levels predict treatment response in a large cohort of RA patients treated with adalimumab or etanercept and, second, to identify pretreatment factors that may predict antidrug antibody formation and/or drug levels that may help optimize future treatment decisions.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring guides the management of Crohn's patients with secondary loss of response to adalimumab [^7c049d6b]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Managing loss of response (LOR) in Crohn's disase (CD) patients remains challenging. Compelling evidence supports therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to guide management in patients on infliximab, but data for other biologics are less robust. We aimed to asses if empiric dose escalation led to improved clinical outcome in addition to TDM-guided optimization in CD patients with LOR to adalimumab (ADA).

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients followed between 2014 and 2016 at McGill IBD Center with index TDM for LOR to ADA was performed. Primary outcomes were composite remission at 3, 6, and 12 months in those with empiric adjustments versus TDM-guided optimization.

Results

There were 104 patients (54.8% men) who were included in the study. Of this group, 81 patients (77.9%) had serum level (SL) ≥ 5µg/ml at index TDM with a median value of 12µg/ml (IQR 6.1–16.5). There were 10 patients (9.6%) who had undetectable SL with high anti-ADA antibodies and 48 (46.2%) received empiric escalation. TDM led to change in treatment in 58 patients (55.8%). Among them, 28 (48.3%) had discontinued ADA, 12 (21.7%) had addition of immunomodulator or steroid, and 18 (31%) had ADA dose escalation. Empiric dose escalation before TDM-based optimization was not associated with improved outcomes at 3, 6, and 12 months, irrespective of SL levels. Clear SL cutoff associated with composite remission was not identified.

Conclusions

Our data do not support empiric dose adjustment beyond that based on the result of the TDM in patients with LOR to ADA. TDM limits unnecessary dose escalation and provides appropriate treatment strategy without compromising clinical outcomes. 10.1093/ibd/izy044_video1izy044.video15768828880001.

### Extent and consequences of antibody formation against adalimumab in patients with psoriasis: one-year follow-up [^288d0a3a]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

In a previously reported cohort of 29 patients with plaque-type psoriasis followed up for 24 weeks, clinically relevant antidrug antibody (ADA) to adalimumab was frequently found. Long-term data were lacking. We now present the extension of this study: 80 patients followed up for 1 year.

Objectives

To assess the extent of ADA and its clinical consequences after 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment for psoriasis in a cohort of 80 patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter cohort study, performed in the outpatient dermatology clinic of 2 academic hospitals, included 80 sequential patients receiving adalimumab therapy for plaque-type psoriasis and had a follow-up of 1 year. Outcome assessors were not aware of the presence of antibodies to adalimumab or the adalimumab serum concentration when assessing patients' Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and personnel analyzing serum samples were blinded to patients' PASI.

Interventions

For 80 patients treated with adalimumab for psoriasis, disease severity (PASI) was assessed, blood samples were collected, and adalimumab and ADA concentrations was determined at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, and 52.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Patient PASI and adalimumab and ADA concentrations.

Results

Antidrug antibody formed in 49% of patients, before week 24 in 90% of them. Adalimumab and ADA concentrations, clinical response and ADA concentration, and adalimumab concentration and clinical response had correlations of -0.872, -0.606, and 0.519, respectively. The adalimumab dose interval was shortened because of lack of efficacy in 15 patients, 7 with and 8 without ADA; improvement in responder status occurred in 1 of 7 and 4 of 8, respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with no ADA formation in the first 24 weeks of treatment have little chance of it in the following 24 weeks. The presence of ADA is strongly correlated with adalimumab concentration and greatly influences clinical response. If ADA is present, dose interval shortening is less useful.

6.2 Immunogenicity

The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products.

There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2.

Table 2. Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with adalimumab

Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6 to 12 month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown.

### Clinical utility of random anti-tumor necrosis factor drug-level testing and measurement of antidrug antibodies on the long-term treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis [^91285c9e]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Predictors of low drug levels in patients treated with adalimumab or etanercept

We used a GEE model to test the longitudinal association of adalimumab levels and antidrug antibodies over 12 months (with adalimumab levels as the dependent variable and antidrug antibody status as the predictor). This demonstrated a strong inverse association between the 2 factors (regression coefficient −4.77 [95% CI −6.39, −3.15], P < 0.0001). To identify additional predictors of low drug levels in all patients (the adalimumab and etanercept groups combined) over 12 months and to obtain an adjusted estimate of the effect of antidrug antibody status on drug level, a logistic regression model for repeated measures (GEE with a logit link for binary outcomes) was used. Thresholds for low adalimumab and etanercept levels were determined using the generated concentration – effect curves (see Supplementary Figure 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at).

After adjustment for multiple confounders, the strongest predictor of low drug levels over time (in patients receiving adalimumab) continued to be antidrug antibody status (regression coefficient 1.27 [95% CI 0.44, 2.07], P = 0.003). Self‐reported adherence data were available for 80.4% of adalimumab‐treated patients and 73.1% of etanercept‐treated patients at all time points over 12 months. Adherence and BMI were also shown to be significant predictors in the fully adjusted model (Table 5). In the combined GEE model including adalimumab and etanercept, a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m² was associated with low drug levels (regression coefficient 0.78 [95% CI 0.37, 1.18], P < 0.0001).

### Adalimumab-bwwd [^8105d185]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-bwwd treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.

Monitoring

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-bwwd.

Discontinue Adalimumab-bwwd if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

Invasive Fungal Infections

If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections.

### Predicting treatment response in psoriasis using serum levels of adalimumab and etanercept: a single-centre, cohort study [^69a8cdbb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A substantial proportion of patients with psoriasis do not respond, or lose initial response to tumour necrosis factor-α antagonists. One possible mechanism relates to subtherapeutic drug levels due to an immunogenic antibody response.

Objectives

To investigate the association between serum adalimumab and etanercept levels, antidrug antibody levels and clinical response in a cohort of patients with psoriasis using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassay.

Methods

In a single-centre cohort of 56 adults with chronic plaque psoriasis initiated on adalimumab or etanercept monotherapy between 2009 and 2011, drug and antidrug antibody levels were measured at the patients' routine clinic reviews (4, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment and the last available observation). Patients' responses at 6 months were stratified into responders [75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index from baseline (PASI 75) or Physician's Global Assessment score of 'clear' or 'nearly clear'] and nonresponders (failure to achieve PASI 50).

Results

After 4 weeks, adalimumab levels were significantly higher in responders compared with nonresponders (P = 0.003) and these higher levels were sustained at 12 and 24 weeks. Anti adalimumab antibodies were detected in 25% of nonresponders (two of eight patients, average 22.5 weeks' follow-up) and none of the responders (n = 23, average 26.1 weeks' follow-up). There was no significant association between etanercept levels and clinical response at 4 weeks (P = 0.317) and no antietanercept antibodies were detected. Lack of serum trough levels may have resulted in underestimation of the prevalence of antidrug antibodies.

Conclusions

Early adalimumab drug level monitoring at 4 weeks may be useful in predicting treatment response and potentially reduce drug exposure (and associated cost) with earlier review of treatment in those with low levels. No conclusions about the value of etanercept drug monitoring can be made due to the paucity of data. Larger studies are now required to assess the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of these assays in personalizing therapy in psoriasis.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^9e1a554f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors — hypersensitivity reactions and diagnosis include that serum sickness–like reactions have been described with infliximab and adalimumab and onset is typically from 5 to 7 days after infusion with features such as fever, malaise, arthralgia/arthritis, and an erythematous (sometimes) urticarial eruption; IgE-mediated reactions account for a subset of immediate reactions to infliximab and may be the cause of some injection-site reactions and also of rare systemic reactions to adalimumab and etanercept. In reactive patients, a positive immediate skin test response to infliximab and anti-infliximab IgEs were seen in 28% (range, 4%-67%) and 41% (range, 13%-70%), respectively. Patients with anti-infliximab IgGs are at increased risk, with relative risk varying from 2.4 to 4.0 for immediate hypersensitivity reactions compared with patients without such antibodies.

### Therapeutic serum level for adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis: explorative analyses of data from a randomised phase III trial [^f06cbf44]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and other biological drugs have revolutionised treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and remission has become an achievable treatment goal. With the introduction of biosimilar medicinal products, and subsequent large cost reductions, access to TNFi has improved. However, some patients either do not respond adequately to treatment or lose treatment response over time, with the risk of irreversible joint damage and loss of physical function highly affecting quality of life. Previous studies have demonstrated large variations in drug exposure among patients on the same standard dose, and lack or loss of effect can be caused by insufficient drug exposure, which is often related to development of neutralising antidrug antibodies (ADAb). To ensure sustainable use of TNFi and other biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), strategies to optimise their efficacy are needed. There is increasing evidence that personalised treatment by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), that is, dose adjustments guided by serum drug level and presence of neutralising ADAb, can improve treatment with TNFi. The Norwegian Drug Monitoring Trial demonstrated that a TDM-based treatment strategy was more effective than standard of care in sustaining disease control in maintenance treatment with the TNFi infliximab. As highlighted by the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) research agenda, prospective studies comparing TDM with usual care are needed for other TNFi as well. In order to develop TDM algorithms for use in clinical trials and every-day patient care, the therapeutic range must be identified for each biological drug.

The TNFi adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is the most widely used biologic drug worldwide. Efficient strategies to optimise its use could improve quality of life and increase access to the drug for millions of patients. However, robust evidence for the therapeutic range is still lacking. Previous data suggest the lower limit of the therapeutic range for adalimumab in RA is close to 5 mg/L and indicate lack of additional benefit of serum levels above 12 mg/L, but robust evidence is lacking, particularly in the context of a randomised phase III trial. This study aims to provide such evidence by analysing longitudinal data from the randomised ADMYRA trial. Data from phase III studies represent a unique opportunity to corroborate the therapeutic ranges suggested in previous studies, enabling future randomised clinical trials to assess TDM-based strategies.

### Drug persistence and need for dose intensification to adalimumab therapy; the importance of therapeutic drug monitoring in inflammatory bowel diseases [^f0e83737]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Current tests for anti-TNF and ADA concentrations are mostly based on enzyme immunoassays. For existing commercially available assays for antibodies, the presence of drug generally interferes with the detection of ADAs. All ADA assays are drug-sensitive to some extent because most assays use the drug itself as labeled detecting antibody. Newer assays, based on high-performance liquid chromatography or the pH shift-anti-idiotype method, which can detect ADAs in the presence of circulating drug have been developed, however most of these methods only available for infliximab and also not accessible in everyday clinical practice.

The strengths of the present study are the harmonized monitoring strategy, prospective collection of clinical and laboratory data. Limitations of the study include the relatively small cohort size, especially in UC. Multiple TDM samples were available only in few patients. Of note, unlike infliximab, there are very few studies evaluating serial TDM measurements in adalimumab therapy. Further investigation is needed applying serial/routine TDM measurements to determine the exact role and usability of routine TDM in adalimumab therapy. In addition, whether TDM for adalimumab needs to be performed at trough remains conflictive in current literature and definitely requires more research. Of note, in a very recent paper by Ward et al. author have shown only little variation in drug levels during maintenance adalimumab therapy assessed on days 4–6, 7–9 and 13–14 (trough level). Importantly, drug levels on day 9 were the best predictor of a therapeutic drug trough level.

### Clinical practice of adalimumab and infliximab biosimilar treatment in adult patients with Crohn's disease [^55a35e7e]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary non-response to therapy. This is the most challenging situation for both the patient and the treating gastroenterologist, as it is associated with a reduced likelihood of a long-term benefit from anti-TNF agents. Although there is no consensus on its detailed definition, primary non-response constitutes a lack of improvement of signs and symptoms after induction therapy (ie, within 14 weeks). Non-response scenarios are detailed below (Fig. 2C).

Non-response of symptoms and biomarkers. If clinical symptoms and inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and fCal) both indicate non-response, low serum trough levels may be used to support dose escalation of the anti-TNF therapy, and in patients receiving infliximab or adalimumab monotherapy, low serum trough levels or low-titer ADAs support the addition of an immunomodulator. If symptoms do not resolve after dose adjustment and/or the addition of an immunomodulator but a decrease in inflammatory biomarkers occurs, continued monitoring is required until response/remission is achieved. Endoscopy or imaging may be performed to corroborate the decrease of inflammatory burden. In parallel, continued TDM may be relevant to confirm that the therapeutic window for the anti-TNF agent has been reached. Once the therapeutic window has been reached, if there is no response after treatment optimization, switching out of class should be considered. In patients who develop high-titer antibodies under induction therapy, a switch within class or to another mode of action should be considered.
Delayed response. Delayed response is defined as response after the induction treatment window (Fig. 2C). This scenario is often characterized by a disconnect between symptoms and biomarkers, where a reduction in symptoms during induction treatment is preceded by an improvement of biomarker levels. Delayed response requires the same therapeutic strategies and monitoring as primary response.
Aggravation of clinical symptoms and inflammatory activity. Some patients may deteriorate during induction treatment. Assuming that TDM reveals therapeutic dose levels, one option in this case would be to discontinue anti-TNF treatment before completing a full induction course, as the patient may have non-TNF driven inflammation. Options for these patients include initiation of an alternative drug with a different mechanism of action, or in severe cases, referral for surgical intervention. However, it must also be considered that TDM may be less useful in induction therapy. Because of this, an additional option is to escalate the dose of the initial drug and evaluate potential response.
Non-response despite early improvement. Some patients display an initial brief improvement in symptoms and/or biomarkers, which rapidly converts into a non-response during induction. These are typically patients with a high inflammatory burden in need of higher drug exposure. TDM and re-initiation of an intensified induction treatment schedule might be helpful, but early ADA formation should be excluded first. In those with high-titer ADAs, a switch to a different anti-TNF should be attempted first, as the initial response suggests potential for additional response with a different anti-TNF agent. If a continued lack of response is observed, therapy with an agent with alternative mode of action should be considered.

### TNF-blocking agents and tuberculosis: new drugs illuminate an old topic [^a1f09a15]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Newer TNF blockers (etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab) have contributed greatly to the control of chronic inflammatory disease. Many of the damaging inflammatory mechanisms that they inhibit are, however, important in maintaining tuberculosis in the latent phase (latent tuberculosis infection or LTBI). There is considerable evidence that links reactivation of LTBI to the use of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments, which appear to result in disruption of the granuloma that normally compartmentalizes but does not kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis during LTBI. This effect can be explained, in part, by directly neutralizing TNF, which plays a key role in tuberculosis immunity. To the clinician, dealing with LTBI in patients on these medications is an important issue. Prescribers should seek local expert help in this regard, as global LTBI treatment regimens differ. Nonetheless, screening for and treating LTBI will prevent reactivation in most patients. LTBI screening should include a careful history, tuberculin skin test and chest radiograph. Prophylactic treatment (e.g. isoniazid for 9 months) should be offered to patients with LTBI, in accordance with local advice. False-negative tuberculin skin test results can be expected in these patient groups. False-negative skin tests also mean that clinicians cannot be complacent about patients on TNF blockers who lack evidence of LTBI. On the contrary, because tuberculosis disease can be lethal, all treated patients should be advised to seek medical attention if symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis emerge. The indications for these successful agents are expanding, and efficient management of the LTBI issue should improve their safety profile.

### Comparison of infliximab with adalimumab for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^35e83fdd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uveitis is a heterogeneous collection of intraocular inflammatory diseases of the uveal tract. The incidence is estimated to be 17–52/100,000 person-years, and 22% of patients with uveitis are at risk of going blind at the same time. Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is relatively more common than infectious uveitis in both adults and children. In a recently published article, NIU contributed to 65.7% of all 1199 patients with uveitis, and another national registry report from Turkey demonstrated that 333 of 442 (75.3%) children with uveitis were NIU. The etiologies of NIU vary widely, such as Behçet's syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), idiopathic uveitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome. In general, the NIU is considered to be a group of autoimmune-mediated disorders.

Corticosteroids, which remain the mainstay of current therapy for NIU, are effective in eliminating inflammation in partial NIU patients, but not so effective in patients with severe and refractory uveitis. Even in patients under control with daily doses of corticosteroids, long-term side effects are a major concern. Therefore, corticosteroid-sparing agents are urgently required.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-α) as a potent, multifunctional, monoclonal antibody not only plays a crucial role in exerting the homeostatic functions of the immune system, but also has shown fairly excellent anti-inflammatory efficacy to manage refractory NIU. What's more, it has corticosteroid-sparing effect. Infliximab (Remicade) and adalimumab (Humira) are two primary anti-TNF-α biologics, and both are full-length bivalent IgG monoclonal antibodies. What distinguishes infliximab from adalimumab is that infliximab is a chimeric protein of 75% human-derived and 25% mouse-derived amino acids whereas adalimumab is a fully human-derived monoclonal antibody agent. Both two agents, clinically adopted as mediators of inflammation, has successfully mitigated NIU in selected patients, but Adalimumab is the only one that has completed phase III studies and has been approved for the treatment of NIU by several countries including China, the United States, Japan and European countries.

### Adalimumab plus methotrexate or standard therapy is more effective than methotrexate or standard therapies alone in the treatment of fatigue in patients with active, inadequately treated rheumatoid arthritis [^b211a655]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Fatigue is an important systemic symptom of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but has rarely been evaluated consistently after initiation of treatment in RA patients. This study examined the effects of adalimumab (HUMIRA, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA), a fully human, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) monoclonal antibody, on reducing fatigue in patients with RA.

Methods

A total of 1526 patients with RA were enrolled in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of adalimumab versus placebo plus methotrexate (MTX) or placebo plus standard antirheumatic therapies. Fatigue was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) fatigue scale questionnaire (which has been validated in RA) at baseline, mid-study, and at the end of the study. Logistic regression models were constructed using baseline demographic variables to test for treatment effect. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the robustness of the data.

Results

At baseline in the 3 trials, patients' fatigue ranged from 27.9–29.7, representing considerable fatigue on the FACIT fatigue scale. Fatigue was significantly and consistently reduced in adalimumab-treated patients in the 3 clinical trials. Relative to placebo plus MTX, the adalimumab 40-mg-every-other-week dosage group reported statistically significantly less fatigue at all time points post-baseline. Improvements between adalimumab and placebo ranged from 3–7 points across all 3 trials, with a 3-4-point change representing a minimum clinically important difference.

Conclusion

Adalimumab treatment was shown to significantly reduce fatigue in patients with moderate to severe RA. Changes in fatigue in all 3 trials were found to be clinically important.

### Adalimumab (Humira) [^94ec3b1e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving HUMIRA, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating HUMIRA and periodically during therapy.

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating HUMIRA, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of ≥ 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).

Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of HUMIRA in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with HUMIRA. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during HUMIRA treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.

### Psoriasis and its treatment with adalimumab [^ca7cb6dc]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Importance Of The Field

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin condition affecting 2–3% of world's population. It affects patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and results in a significant financial burden. Adalimumab is the first fully human monoclonal antibody approved in the US and European countries for the treatment of psoriasis along with other immunomediated diseases.

Areas Covered In This Review

We evaluate outcomes such as efficacy, safety, and quality of life associated with adalimumab in the treatment of psoriasis via a review of the published literature from the past 10 years.

What The Reader Will Gain

This review presents the effects, causes, types and treatment options for psoriasis with a focus on adalimumab with the goal of providing evidence-based guidance in choosing the appropriate therapy for the treatment of psoriasis.

Take Home Message

Adalimumab treatment in two forms 40 mg/every other week and 40 mg/week was reported to be effective and safe compared with placebo and methotrexate. Adalimumab significantly improved patients' HRQOL but some adverse events were reported, therefore vigilance is needed when using adalimumab. As the landscape of psoriasis treatments continues to evolve, adalimumab provides a highly effective and relatively safe treatment option for psoriasis patients.

### Development of antidrug antibodies against adalimumab and association with disease activity and treatment failure during long-term follow-up [^ec54fd8b]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Short-term data on the immunogenicity of monoclonal antibodies showed associations between the development of antidrug antibodies and diminished serum drug levels, and a diminished treatment response. Little is known about the clinical relevance of antidrug antibodies against these drugs during long-term follow-up.

Objective

To examine the course of antidrug antibody formation against fully human monoclonal antibody adalimumab and its clinical relevance during long-term (3-year) follow-up of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Design, Setting, and Patients

Prospective cohort study February 2004-September 2008; end of follow-up was September 2010. All 272 patients were diagnosed with RA and started treatment with adalimumab in an outpatient clinic.

Main Outcome Measures

Disease activity was monitored and trough serum samples were obtained at baseline and 8 time points to 156 weeks. Serum adalimumab concentrations and antiadalimumab antibody titers were determined after follow-up. Treatment discontinuation, minimal disease activity, and clinical remission were compared for patients with and without antiadalimumab antibodies.

Results

After 3 years, 76 of 272 patients (28%) developed antiadalimumab antibodies — 51 of these (67%) during the first 28 weeks of treatment. Patients without antiadalimumab antibodies had much higher adalimumab concentrations (median, 12 mg/L; IQR, 9–16 mg/L) compared with patients with antibody titers from 13 to 100 AU/mL (median, 5 mg/L; IQR, 3–9 mg/L; regression coefficient, -4.5; 95% CI, -6.0 to -2.9; P < .001) and also those greater than 100 AU/mL (median, 0 mg/L; IQR, 0–3 mg/L; regression coefficient, -7.1; 95% CI, -8.4 to -5.8; P < .001). Patients with antiadalimumab antibodies more often discontinued participation due to treatment failure (n = 29 [38%]; hazard ratio [HR], 3.0; 95% CI, 1.6–5.5; P < .001) compared with antiadalimumab antibody-negative ones (n = 28 [14%]). Ninety-five of 196 patients (48%) without antiadalimumab antibodies had minimal disease activity vs 10 of 76 patients (13%) with antiadalimumab antibodies; patients with antiadalimumab antibodies less often had sustained minimal disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) (< 3.2; HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8–7.2; P < .001) compared with antiadalimumab antibody-negative ones. Three of 76 patients (4%) with antiadalimumab antibodies achieved sustained remission compared with 67 of 196 (34%) antiadalimumab antibody-negative ones; patients with antiadalimumab antibodies less often achieved remission (DAS28 < 2.6; HR, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.1–23.4; P < .001) compared with antiadalimumab antibody-negative ones.

Conclusion

Among outpatients with RA in whom adalimumab was started over 3 years, the development of antidrug antibodies was associated with lower adalimumab concentration and lower likelihood of minimal disease activity or clinical remission.

5.7 Increased Risk of Infection when Used with Anakinra

Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of HUMIRA and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.8 Heart Failure

Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with HUMIRA. HUMIRA has not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using HUMIRA in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully.

5.9 Autoimmunity

Treatment with HUMIRA may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.3)]. If a patient develops symptoms and findings suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis following treatment with HUMIRA, discontinue treatment and evaluate the patient.

5.10 Immunizations

In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of subjects with RA, no difference was detected in anti-pneumococcal antibody response between HUMIRA and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with HUMIRA. Similar proportions of subjects developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between HUMIRA and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in subjects receiving HUMIRA. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on HUMIRA may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving HUMIRA.

It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating HUMIRA therapy. Patients on HUMIRA may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines.

The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to HUMIRA in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4)].

Impact of ADA immune response

Pharmacokinetic and/or clinical outcomes (efficacy and/or safety) in ADA‐positive patients were reported in 42 and 40% of adalimumab and infliximab studies, respectively. In 15 of 38 (39%) adalimumab studies 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 18 of 62 (29%) infliximab studies 19, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, ADA‐positive patients had lower serum concentrations of the biological than ADA‐negative patients. The association between biological serum concentrations and ADA formation was evident in inflammatory disease states and immunoassay formats. Differences in serum concentrations between ADA‐positive and ‐negative patients were found to be statistically significant in nine of 38 (24%) adalimumab studies 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30 and 12 of 62 (19%) infliximab studies 24, 27, 28, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44. For example, in an observational cohort study of 115 patients with AS who received adalimumab, after 24 weeks of treatment serum levels of the biological were significantly higher in ADA‐negative patients than in ADA‐positive patients [12.7 mg/l (interquartile range = 8.2–18.0) versus 1.2 mg/l (0.0–2.0); P < 0.001] 22. Similarly, in a prospective cohort study conducted in 327 patients with Crohn's disease, mean [standard deviation (s.d.)] trough infliximab levels were 7.4 (11.9) μg/ml and 1.6 (3.6) μg/ml at week 8 in patients who were ADA‐negative and ADA‐positive, respectively 39. In addition, at this time‐point a significantly higher proportion of ADA‐negative patients had therapeutic infliximab trough levels (defined as ≥ 3 μg/ml) compared with ADA‐positive patients (76 versus 14%; P < 0.001).

### The role of antidrug antibodies in ustekinumab therapy and the impact of methotrexate [^5eb93e90]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The introduction of biopharmaceuticals in targeted treatment strategies for rheumatic diseases has considerably improved patient outcomes. One obstacle of biologics, however, is their potential immunogenicity, which might limit sustained efficacy. Despite improved manufacturing procedures including the production of genetically humanized or even fully human recombinant antibodies, patients may still elicit immune responses towards their biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) during prolonged periods of repetitive therapeutic application. This drug-related immunogenicity includes the formation of antidrug antibodies (ADA) that can impair the biotherapeutics' mode of action through alterations in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.

As the number of biotherapeutics introduced into the market is expected to further increase over the next few years, immunogenicity and its implications on drug safety and treatment outcome will remain a relevant parameter for drug evaluation and treatment recommendations. In this regard, previous studies have already demonstrated the significance of drug-associated but also the impact of disease- and patient-related factors. While some studies report increased safety hazards or impaired pharmacokinetic properties due to immunogenicity, other data do not support any negative impact of ADA formation on biologic treatment.

Thus, the broad usage of biotherapeutics in different disease entities with the growing availability of biosimilars will remain an increasing challenge for integration of data on immunogenicity, interpretation of clinical information and demands for a personalized treatment approach.

Most of the present knowledge on the clinical impact of ADA formation has been obtained from studies in RA and accordingly extrapolated from these well-established findings to other disease entities in different therapeutic contexts. However, the validity of this approach is limited since it neglects disease- and drug-specific predispositions for ADA formation. This is illustrated by contradicting data for the impact of add-on conventional synthetic DMARD treatment to bDMARDs in the prevention of ADA formation in different disease entities. While a meta-analysis of 936 patients with RA or inflammatory bowel disease by Garcês et al. revealed that ADA formation was mitigated by concomitant immunomodulators such as azathioprine, MTX or mercaptopurine, another study in psoriasis patients illustrated that add-on MTX remained completely ineffective in reducing the immunogenicity of the TNF inhibitor adalimumab.

The SERENE-CD trial is currently investigating high (160 mg at week 0, 1, 2, and 3) versus standard (160 mg at week 0 followed by 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg at week 4) adalimumab induction dosing regimens. Although the study is ongoing, early results have not shown a significant difference in the rate of clinical remission at week 4 or endoscopic remission at week 12 between the high or standard doses.

Switching from infliximab to adalimumab is extremely common in clinical practice and is often a result of convenience or financial burden rather than clinical necessity. The SWITCH trial investigated the impact of electively switching treatments from intravenous infliximab to subcutaneous adalimumab in patients with well-controlled CD. Results demonstrated that this elective switch was associated with loss of tolerance and loss of efficacy within 1 year and as such, led to worse outcomes in the CD patients. Due to the limited number of approved biological agents, this study highlighted the importance to adhere with the first anti-TNF agent unless there is loss of response or tolerance.

Immunogenicity

Anti-TNF drugs are highly effective in the management of CD but treatment failure is a common downfall to these medications. The personalised anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease study (PANTS) aimed to identify specific clinical and pharmacokinetic factors that predicted primary non-response. Their multivariate analysis demonstrated that the only factor independently associated with primary non-response was low drug concentration at week 14 for both infliximab and adalimumab. For both drugs, suboptimal drug concentrations at week 14 predicted immunogenicity, with the formation of anti-drug antibodies.

### Adalimumab around the world: comparative analysis of products characteristics and patient support systems [^543ab090]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a crucial cytokine in immune-mediated conditions. By inhibiting TNF-α's interaction with cell surface receptors, it effectively reduces immune and inflammatory responses in various autoimmune or immune dysregulation diseases. Humira ®, the original adalimumab formulation manufactured by AbbVie (North Chicago, IL, USA), received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for rheumatoid arthritis in 2002. It subsequently gained FDA approvals for Crohn's disease in 2007 and ulcerative colitis in 2012. Other indications across different jurisdictions to date include juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic plaque psoriasis, non-infectious uveitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa.

Biological therapies are costly. In 2018, the global market for TNF-α inhibitors, including adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab, was worth US$40 billion annually, with Humira ® accounting for half of these sales. Biosimilars are highly similar versions of the original reference brand of a biological medicine that demonstrate comparable safety and efficacy in treating the same diseases. One major benefit is the reduction in expenditures for biological therapies through increased market competition. This is exemplified by the introduction of biosimilars of etanercept and infliximab, resulting in notable price reductions of the originators. The adalimumab biosimilars market is evolving, particularly with the gradual expiration of Humira ® 's patents worldwide. In 2014, the Indian company Cadila (now known as Zydus Lifesciences Limited, Ahmedabad, India) launched Exemptia, the world's first adalimumab biosimilar, in the Indian market. This milestone was facilitated by the Indian Patent Act passed in 1970, where product patents are not recognized in India. Subsequently, product-specific patent protection for Humira ® ended in most European Union countries and Australia in 2018 and in the United States in 2023.
