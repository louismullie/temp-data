## Question

Is the up rolling eye related to focal or generalized seizure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether upward rolling of the eyes is related to focal or generalized seizures, and how to interpret that sign clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy and mechanisms that produce eye movements during seizures. Then, I should verify which seizure types classically include upward eye deviation and whether that implies focal or generalized onset. Next, I will review exceptions and mimics that can confuse the picture, including nonepileptic paroxysmal eye movement disorders and medication effects. After that, I should consider age-related patterns and lateralizing value. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based approach anchored in video-EEG and guideline-based evaluation, while double-checking for pitfalls in relying on a single semiologic sign.

> Let me first confirm the basic framework: seizures are classified as focal (localized onset) or generalized (bilateral networks from onset), and eye movement semiology can be seen in both, so upward eye rolling is not pathognomonic for either category and must be interpreted in context of the entire event and EEG correlation [^112J5LNL] [^115NMExk].

> I will now examine the classic generalized seizure context. Generalized tonic–clonic seizures frequently include upward rolling of the eyes during the tonic phase, often alongside stiffening, vocalization, and rhythmic jerking; this is well described in pediatric and general seizure education materials and aligns with core teaching on convulsive semiology [^112J5LNL]. Wait, let me verify the photosensitive generalized syndromes: eyelid myoclonia with absences (EMA) characteristically shows rapid eyelid jerks with upward eyeball deviation on eye closure, reinforcing that upward ocular deviation can be part of generalized epilepsies, particularly those with photosensitivity [^113NLE5A] [^116XBk2h].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; upward eye deviation also occurs in focal seizures. Forced, sustained conjugate upward deviation (versive upgaze) is a recognized ictal sign in focal seizures arising from frontal or parieto-occipital regions, often contralateral to the seizure focus, and can be accompanied by head version and impaired awareness depending on spread [^notfound]. Let me consider pediatric focal autonomic epilepsy: Panayiotopoulos syndrome commonly features ictal emesis and autonomic changes, with eye and/or cephalic deviation occurring in a meaningful subset, again reflecting focal occipital or posterior network involvement rather than primary generalized epilepsy [^114wWJzz] [^111j6Hau].

> Next, I should review the lateralizing value. Tonic eye version is classically taught as a lateralizing sign, typically contralateral to the hemisphere of seizure onset; however, I need to check reliability, especially in infants. In a blinded video-EEG series of infants, tonic eye version was unreliable for lateralization and could be ipsilateral, contralateral, or variable within the same patient, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret directionality without corroborating data [^111v3eP9]. But wait, what if the event evolves with forced head version followed by body rotation? In gyratory seizures, forced head version preceding rotation tends to lateralize contralaterally, which can support a focal frontal onset when present, though this is a different movement phenotype than isolated upward rolling [^112Kpxv4].

> I need to ensure I account for mimics and non-epileptic paroxysmal eye movement disorders. Paroxysmal tonic upward gaze in infancy presents with sustained conjugate upward deviation, often with ataxia, normal consciousness, and no epileptiform correlate on EEG; it is typically benign and may respond to acetazolamide in CACNA1A-related cases, underscoring that not all upward gaze events are seizures [^111Fsk46] [^112PNerW]. Let me also consider Glut1 deficiency: aberrant gaze saccades with rapid, multidirectional eye–head movements, preserved alertness, and no EEG correlate are characteristic and can precede epilepsy; a ketogenic diet is beneficial for the underlying disorder, so recognizing this pattern prevents mislabeling as seizures [^112JDAeG] [^114yLGGF]. I should double-check medication effects too: oculogyric crisis from dopamine blockade can produce sustained upward deviation and can be mistaken for versive seizures, but the clinical context and medication history usually clarify this [^114ncTWE].

> Let me think about age-related patterns. In infants and young children, paroxysmal eye movement events are common, and many are nonepileptic. Video-EEG series show that isolated paroxysmal eye movements often lack epileptiform correlates, so routine EEG is low yield unless other concerning features are present, which means I should avoid anchoring on "eye rolling" alone in this age group [^116NvCxd]. In contrast, when upward eye deviation occurs within a clearly generalized convulsion or in the setting of photosensitive generalized epilepsy, a generalized mechanism is more likely, whereas when it accompanies autonomic symptoms, emesis, or postictal deficits, a focal posterior onset with spread becomes more plausible [^112J5LNL] [^113NLE5A] [^114wWJzz].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach. Because semiology is insufficient on its own, concurrent video-EEG is the gold standard to determine whether upward eye movements are ictal, to classify focal versus generalized onset, and to identify mimics. Relying on eyewitness descriptions of signs like eye deviation is notably unreliable, reinforcing the need for objective recordings rather than inference from history alone [^117JEu8F] [^116DdFbH]. But wait, I should verify scalp EEG limitations: focal seizures, especially in deep or limited networks, may be underdetected on scalp EEG, so a nonlocalizing or even normal EEG does not exclude focal epilepsy; integration with MRI, clinical semiology, and, when indicated, intracranial recordings improves localization and classification accuracy [^114eTsTu] [^112Fqgdp].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. Upward rolling or deviation of the eyes is not specific for focal versus generalized seizures; it is seen in generalized tonic–clonic seizures and in generalized photosensitive syndromes like EMA, and it is also a recognized versive manifestation of focal seizures arising from frontal or parieto-occipital regions, particularly when accompanied by forced head version and other lateralizing features [^112J5LNL] [^113NLE5A]. Therefore, I should not use upward eye rolling alone to classify seizure type; instead, I need to integrate the entire semiology, ictal and interictal EEG, neuroimaging, and age-appropriate differential diagnoses to avoid misclassification and to identify treatable mimics or syndromes such as Glut1 deficiency or paroxysmal tonic upward gaze [^116KTFSo] [^112JDAeG] [^111Fsk46].

> Finally, I should double-check key caveats. First, versive forced upward deviation is more suggestive of a focal seizure with spread than a primary generalized event, but even tonic eye version can be unreliable for lateralization in infants, so I must corroborate with EEG and imaging before concluding laterality [^111v3eP9]. Second, absence of tongue biting, incontinence, or prolonged postictal confusion makes a generalized tonic–clonic seizure less likely, but their presence supports it; still, these are supportive clues, not definitive on their own [^114kgphu]. Third, if photosensitivity is suspected, I should pursue photic stimulation during EEG and consider syndromes like EMA, where upward eye deviation with eyelid myoclonia on eye closure is a defining feature [^113NLE5A].

Eye rolling is most often a sign of **generalized seizures** (especially tonic-clonic and absence seizures) [^112J5LNL] [^113NLE5A] and reflects diffuse cortical involvement with bilateral synchronous discharges. It can also occur in **focal seizures** with secondary generalization [^114pUDFp] or when the seizure spreads to brainstem eye movement centers, but it is less specific for focal onset [^111v3eP9]. Accurate classification requires correlating the semiology with EEG [^114eTsTu] and clinical context, as eye rolling alone is not sufficient to distinguish focal from generalized seizures [^115NMExk].

---

## Clinical significance of eye rolling in seizures

Eye rolling, or upward deviation of the eyes, is a common ictal manifestation, particularly in **generalized seizures** [^112J5LNL]. It is typically associated with **loss of consciousness** and bilateral synchronous epileptiform discharges on EEG [^115NMExk]. However, eye rolling can also occur in focal seizures — especially with secondary generalization [^111g33eU] or when the epileptiform activity spreads to brainstem structures controlling eye movements [^notfound].

---

## Eye rolling in generalized seizures

Generalized seizures involve **bilateral hemispheric involvement** from onset, and eye rolling is a hallmark feature of several generalized seizure types:

- **Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS)**: Eye rolling is commonly observed during the tonic phase, often accompanied by loss of consciousness, muscle stiffening, and rhythmic jerking movements [^112J5LNL].

- **Absence seizures**: Brief episodes of eye rolling or upward deviation may occur, typically associated with brief lapses in consciousness and generalized spike-wave discharges on EEG [^115u6NsE].

- **Eyelid myoclonia with absences (EMA)**: Characterized by rapid eyelid jerks and upward eyeball deviation, often triggered by eye closure and associated with generalized polyspike-wave discharges [^113NLE5A].

In generalized seizures, eye rolling reflects **diffuse cortical involvement** and is typically accompanied by bilateral synchronous epileptiform discharges on EEG [^115NMExk].

---

## Eye rolling in focal seizures

Focal seizures originate in a **localized brain region**, and eye rolling may occur when the epileptiform activity spreads to brainstem structures responsible for eye movement control. Examples include:

- **Focal seizures with secondary generalization**: Eye rolling may occur as the seizure spreads from a focal onset to involve both hemispheres, often accompanied by loss of consciousness and generalized tonic-clonic movements [^112J5LNL].

- **Occipital lobe seizures**: Eye rolling or nystagmus may occur due to involvement of cortical areas controlling eye movements, often accompanied by visual symptoms such as hallucinations or visual loss [^116dVsZE].

- **Frontal lobe seizures**: Forced eye deviation or rolling may occur due to involvement of the frontal eye fields, often accompanied by other motor manifestations such as head turning or complex motor behaviors [^114HLzC9].

In focal seizures, eye rolling is typically accompanied by **other focal neurological signs** or symptoms, and the EEG often shows localized epileptiform discharges corresponding to the seizure focus [^111g33eU].

---

## Diagnostic considerations and EEG correlation

Accurate classification of seizures with eye rolling requires **careful clinical evaluation** and correlation with EEG findings [^113sguZn]. EEG is essential for distinguishing between focal and generalized seizures by identifying the pattern and distribution of epileptiform discharges [^113sguZn]. Generalized seizures typically show bilateral synchronous discharges, whereas focal seizures show localized or lateralized discharges [^113sguZn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **comprehensive clinical evaluation**, including detailed history, neurological examination, and EEG recording, to accurately classify seizures with eye rolling [^116KTFSo]. Eye rolling alone is not sufficient to distinguish between focal and generalized seizures and must be interpreted within the broader clinical and electrophysiological context [^113u6tXc].

## Eye rolling in focal vs. generalized seizures

| **Feature** | **Generalized seizures** | **Focal seizures** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset | Bilateral hemispheric involvement from onset | Localized onset with possible secondary generalization |
| EEG findings | Bilateral synchronous epileptiform discharges | Localized or lateralized epileptiform discharges |
| Associated symptoms | - Loss of consciousness <br/> - Generalized tonic-clonic movements <br/> - Absence spells | - Localized motor or sensory symptoms <br/> - Aura <br/> - Focal neurological deficits |
| Examples | - Generalized tonic-clonic seizures <br/> - Absence seizures <br/> - Eyelid myoclonia with absences | - Focal seizures with secondary generalization <br/> - Occipital lobe seizures <br/> - Frontal lobe seizures |

Eye rolling is most commonly associated with **generalized seizures**, particularly tonic-clonic and absence seizures [^112J5LNL]. It can also occur in focal seizures, especially with secondary generalization or when the seizure spreads to brainstem structures controlling eye movements [^111g33eU]. Accurate classification requires **correlation with EEG findings** and comprehensive clinical evaluation, as eye rolling alone is not sufficient to distinguish between focal and generalized seizures [^114eTsTu].

5 CONCLUSION

Our results indicate that eye movement disorders may be present early in the course of an IEM, and can be a characteristic symptom. This is in particular the case for patients with NP‐C and Kearns‐Sayre syndrome. However, apart from these few exceptions, the type of eye movement disorder does not point in the direction of specific IEMs. Symptoms, including eye movement disorders, are very heterogeneous in IEMs, and this variety in symptoms seems to be an important characteristic of IEMs. It is important to note that in adolescents and adults with eye movement disorders, the presence of movement disorders, psychiatric symptoms, or cognitive deficits should raise the suspicion of an underlying IEM, as in our cohort 83% of the late‐onset patients presented with one or more of these additional symptoms.

### Illusory shadow person causing paradoxical gaze deviations during temporal lobe seizures [^116WGryX]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Generally, activation of the frontal eye field during seizures can cause versive (forced) gaze deviation, while non-versive head deviation is hypothesised to result from ictal neglect after inactivation of the ipsilateral temporo-parietal area. Almost all non-versive head deviations occurring during temporal lobe seizures are directed to the side of seizure onset, so in derogatory cases it is worth while explaining the paradoxical event. We present a patient with a paradoxical direction of gaze deviation during temporal lobe seizures with an unexpected explanation. Electrocortical stimulation of the temporo-parieto-occipital junction elicited an irrepressible urge to look towards an illusory shadow person besides the patient. Paradoxical non-versive gaze deviations in temporal lobe seizures may be due to illusory experiences masked by postictal amnesia.

This article reports on three children who underwent an electroencephalographic examination. All three showed the feature of asymmetric lambda waves, which is usually interpreted as a pathologic focal phenomenon. The report documents that asymmetric lambda waves and photic driving might be normal variants, not requiring further investigation.

Treatment-related adverse events were dose-dependent and included dizziness, somnolence, headache, and fatigue; discontinuations most commonly resulted from dizziness and somnolence. A Class III study reported a significantly higher adverse event rate with titration rates of < 7 days. Conclusions state EZG is probably effective as add-on therapy for TRAFE (3 Class II studies).

### Rolling in the deep: surface EEG seizures viewed through the lens of stereo EEG [^115qHL2b]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this studyare the investigation of a relatively large number of patients with diverse pathologies. The recordings were concurrent and extensive. A thorough cluster analysis methodology was deployed to reconcile the extensive heterogeneity. On the other hand, correlations were retrospective and limited by the available intracerebral electrodes that were implanted based on individualized electroclinical hypotheses and anatomical constraints (∼60% of the cases achieved seizure freedom eventually). Despite all good intents for an unbiased approach, the reviewers of both the scalp and the intracranial EEG recordings were not blinded to the patients' clinical and radiological data (∼65% of the cases were lesional). Albeit representative, a single seizure was evaluated per patient, introducing selection bias, particularly since individualized anti-seizure medication withdrawal or rescue drugs administration may have inevitably affected some of the collected variables (e.g. intracranial-scalp EEG propagation/latency and seizure duration). Finally, when drawing conclusions about scalp EEG utility, one should also remember that straight-forward cases were not implanted and, hence, excluded from this analysis. Conversely, several implanted cases did not have adequate scalp EEG coverage to be included, although they did not substantially differ in their characteristics from those that did.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^113SZ676]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope versus epileptic seizure — historical and eyewitness features help distinguish the cause of transient loss of consciousness: In epilepsy movements last ~1 min whereas in syncope they are seconds, and in syncope movements only occur after the onset of unconsciousness and after the fall. Syncope is usually triggered; epilepsy rarely is. A tongue bite is more common in epilepsy and is on the side of the tongue whereas it is the tip in syncope, and urinary incontinence occurs in both. Post-event recovery differs, with patients may be confused post-ictally a long time in epilepsy versus syncope where clearheadedness is usually immediate. Table 13 adds that with seizure tonic–clonic movements are usually prolonged and their onset coincides with loss of consciousness, whereas with syncope they are always of short duration (< 15 s) and they start after the loss of consciousness.

The Case

A 14-month-old boy unresponsive to verbal and tactile stimulation with high fever (temperature 39°C) was admitted to a primary care hospital ≈30 minutes after the onset of generalized febrile convulsions that did not respond to 2 doses of rectal diazepam (5 mg). His weight was 8 kg, all extremities were warm and well perfused, his heart rate was 140 beats per minute (bpm), and oxygen saturation was 93% in ambient air. Initial clinical examination showed no purpuric or petechial lesions, no heart murmurs or pulmonary rales, and no palpable enlargement of the liver or spleen. The boy had been healthy until 2 days earlier, when rhinorrhea, mild pharyngitis, and cough developed without signs of lower respiratory tract involvement. On the day of admission, he vomited once in the morning and than refused to drink. In the afternoon of the same day, a high fever developed, and seizures began, with extension and struggling of all extremities but without opisthotonos. The patient initially turned both eyes upwards but later stared straight ahead with no spontaneous eye movements and fixed pupils of 3 to 4 mm in diameter.

Epilepsy and seizure semiology

The median age of epilepsy onset was 3.4 months (range from 4 days to 18 months). About half of patients had epilepsy onset between 0 and 3 months (19/34), while the other half (15/34) had initial seizures between 3 and 18 months of life.

At the onset, most patients showed focal seizures (55.8%), followed by generalized epileptic spasms (44.1%) and tonic seizures (32.3%). Myoclonic seizures (11.7%) and generalized tonic–clonic seizures (5.8%) were less common. Focal seizures were characterized by both motor and non-motor components, and often included sudden awakening during sleep, fear, ictal eyes blinking, facial flushing, followed by asymmetrical tonic contraction or clonic seizures. Overall, 47% (16/34) of patients at the onset had more than one type of seizures among focal motor and non-motor seizures, tonic seizures, and epileptic spasms. Among patients with early-onset epilepsy (< 3 months), 73.6% (14/19) had focal motor seizures, followed by spasms in 8 patients (42.1%), and tonic seizures in 6 patients (31.5%). Whereas in cases with epilepsy onset after 3 months of life, tonic seizures were more frequent (53.3%, 8/15), as well as spasms (53.3%, 8/15). On note, generalized tonic clonic seizures were not reported in the early-onset group but in 2 of 15 patients within the group with 3–18-month seizure onset. Generalized tonic–clonic seizures, when not present at the onset, appeared later during lifetime (5.8% vs 23.5%). In our cohort of patients, HTSS or HTSS-like, even if occurring in different orders (i.e. first tonic seizures, then hypermotor phase and spasms, or hypermotor phase at last) was reported in 6/34 patients (17.6%) at any lifetime point. In 5 patients, HTSS or HTSS-like appeared at the onset, whereas in one patient, they occurred in the next phases of the disease. At the last long-term evaluation, focal seizures were confirmed to be the most frequent (50%), followed by spasms (38.2%), tonic seizures (26.4%), generalized tonic–clonic seizures (23.5%), and myoclonic seizures (2.9%).

Table V, VI

Bizarre movements and other subtle seizures were the most common seizure type (34.15%). This was followed by focal seizures (26.83%) being almost in the same proportion as the generalized pattern (24.39%). Generalized seizure type (25.71%) was the commonest seizure type occurring within the first two days of life. This was followed by focal (23.81%) and tonic seizure type (13.33%) respectively. Twitching of the corner of the mouth/lips (11.43%), blinking of the eyes (4.76%) and autonomic imbalance (3.81%) were also common during this period of onset. After age of onset of seven days, generalized (26.32%) and focal seizures type (26.32%) were the commonest seizure types. This was followed by tonic seizures type. Crying (5.26%) and grinning / facial twitching (5.26%) were also common subtle seizures type occurring after the age of onset of seven days.

RESULTS

Description of 3 representative cases.

Patient 1.

A 10-year-old boy developed episodes of unusual eye movements, associated with nodding head movements that appeared to follow the direction of the eyes, at age 1 month (video 1 at). During the episodes, he was awake and at times responded by smiling, and at other times appeared upset. Episodes seemed to be precipitated by excitement and typically lasted 10–20 minutes. Rarely, episodes lasted up to 1 hour. A peak frequency of 10–15 episodes per month occurred at age 4–5 months. Episode frequency decreased towards the end of infancy and ceased by age 8 years.

The patient developed intractable epilepsy at age 3 months. His first seizures were myoclonic and atonic. At age 2 years, he developed absence seizures, and at age 3 years, generalized tonic seizures. He experienced other paroxysmal events including episodic choreoathetosis, limb dystonia associated with crying and drooling, and episodes of lethargy and generalized paralysis.

The patient was started on a KD at age 7 years. His seizures, paroxysmal neurologic events, motor and language skills, attention span, and mood all improved.

Brain MRI was normal and investigations for occult neuroblastoma were negative. Glut1 DS was diagnosed at age 10 years (table 1, patient 1). Examination at age 10 years revealed a head circumference at the 25th percentile, lower limb spasticity, and cerebellar dysfunction with dysarthria, limb dysmetria, and a mixed spastic-ataxic gait.

### Clinical reasoning: a young adult with new seizures and chapeau de gendarme [^1143cB9d]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The evaluation of new seizures is a common clinical query for neurologists. It can be challenging to delineate between the numerous etiologies of new focal or generalized seizures and, if focal, to localize their onset. In this case report, we present a 26-year-old patient with a new onset of stereotyped events concerning for seizures featuring facial grimacing, dystonic left-hand posturing, and convulsions with immediate return to baseline. Throughout the case, we highlight a stepwise diagnostic approach to the evaluation of new-onset seizures, discuss clues that seizure semiology can provide for localization of ictal onset, and review a novel and atypical presentation of a disease entity frequently encountered by neurologists.

### Eye rolling as a manifestation of clobazam toxicity in a child with epilepsy [^111GH69M]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

A four-year-old male with symptomatic generalized epilepsy presented with ataxia, eye rolling, and episodes of back arching which were of non-epileptic origin following the introduction of clobazam at 0.75mg/kg/day. Concurrent antiepileptic medication was lamotrigine at 13mg/kg/day. Clobazam plasma levels were within the normal range, while N-desmethylclobazam (DCLB) concentrations were between five and seven times above the upper limit of the normal range. The plasma elimination half-life for DCLB was prolonged, suggesting a genetic variability in DCLB metabolism leading to toxicity. Reduction in the dose of clobazam to 0.3mg/kg/day was associated with resolution of the non-epileptic neurological symptoms, reduction in DCLB plasma levels, and maintenance of seizure control.

### Seizures and epilepsy in association with neurocysticercosis: a nosologic proposal [^11165AXF]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

ILAE Approaches to Seizures and Epilepsy Associated With NCC

Seizure Semiology vs Location of Cysticerci

In people with 1–2 viable or degenerating cysts, there is generally a good correlation between the topographic location of the cysts and the inferred semiological localization of seizure onsets. This, however, may not be the case with calcified lesions, in which the correspondence might be less often forthcoming. Some calcified lesions might be coincidental, considering an alternative epileptogenic substrate, etiologic factor, or even wholly asymptomatic, as demonstrated in population-based studies from endemic regions. In any case, a detailed clinical assessment focused on the initial symptoms and signs of the seizure proves invaluable in ascertaining the association between the implied seizure-onset or epileptogenic zone and the location of the cysticercus. However, when multiple parenchymal cysticerci exist, the correspondence between semiological and anatomical localizations can become challenging.

A logical first step is determining seizure types per the current ILAE classification scheme. It may be assumed that all seizures are focal in onset. In many instances, a focal onset might not be evident, and in such cases, the label unknown onset is preferred. The initial symptom or manifestation is paramount in delineating seizure types. Accordingly, the terms focal aware and focal with impaired awareness seizures might be used in parallel with or independent of a motor vs nonmotor onset. Generalized seizures, particularly myoclonic, myoclonic-atonic, atonic, absence, atypical absence, eyelid myoclonias, and spasms, do not occur in NCC unless the person has concomitant generalized epilepsy.

### Hand-biting and hand-waving paroxysms in epilepsy [^111cPDAe]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 20-year-old ambidextrous female student with a 15-year history of refractory seizures was admitted to the epilepsy department for a second opinion on her diagnosis and treatment. She developed frequent motor paroxysms at the age of 4–5 years, which appeared resistant to antiepileptic therapy and which have continued to the present day. Over the last 8 years she also had five generalised tonic-clonic seizures. There is a family history of epilepsy on the maternal side. The first type of episode is characterised by left-hand flickering, associated with head turning and loss of awareness. During the second type of attack the patient demonstrates vigorous hand biting which starts without warning. The patient appears disorientated subsequently. EEG telemetry was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of both epilepsy and non-epileptic attacks. Literature reports of the relevant cases are discussed.

### How generalised are secondarily "generalised" tonic clonic seizures? [^115AM1rb]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, epileptic seizures with focal onset and subsequent generalised motor involvement are referred to as secondarily generalised seizures. The purpose of this study was to investigate the degree of electrophysiological generalisation in seizures that are clinically secondarily generalised. Intracranial EEG recordings of secondarily generalised tonic-clonic seizures were visually and quantitatively analysed for the presence of epileptiform activity. In 24 (26%) of 93 seizures recorded from 17 (27%) of 64 patients, intracranial EEG channels were found that never recorded epileptiform activity during secondarily generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Our results demonstrate that seizures that are secondarily generalised clinically are not always generalised electrophysiologically. This may have therapeutic implications.

### Nystagmus in clinical practice: from diagnosis to treatment – A comprehensive review [^116AU6by]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Oculopalatal Tremor

It is characterized by continuous and rhythmic movements of the soft palate, combined with pendular nystagmus. It occurs after injury to the brainstem or the cerebellar region. Results from lesions affecting the Guillain–Mollaret triangle (red nucleus, inferior olive, and dentate nucleus). Denervation hypersensitivity in the inferior olivary nucleus produces rhythmic impulses that are relayed to ocular motor and palatal muscles, causing pendular eye movements and palatal tremor. Occurs months after brainstem stroke, typically in the medullary region; low-frequency vertical or torsional nystagmus is characteristic.

Oculomasticatory Myorhythmia

It is characterised by smooth, continuous, slow (1–3 hz), pendular, convergent-divergent nystagmus with concurrent contractions of the masticatory muscles and rhythmic movements of the limbs. It has also been observed in Whipple's disease in the central nervous system. Localized to brainstem and thalamus, involving oculomotor nuclei, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, and limbic pathways. Whipple's disease causes inflammatory infiltration leading to rhythmic central discharges manifesting as slow convergent-divergent eye movements, jaw contractions, and limb jerks. Pathognomonic of CNS Whipple's disease; should prompt PCR or biopsy confirmation.

Seesaw Nystagmus

Disconjugate nystagmus in which one half-cycle consists of slow-phase elevation and intorsion of one eye and synchronous depression and extorsion of the other eye. The next half-cycle consists of slow or fast phases in the opposite direction. Linked to lesions in the diencephalon, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and parasellar region, disrupting vertical–torsional gaze integration. Imbalance in otolithic and interocular torsional circuits leads to one eye elevating and intorting while the other depresses and extorts. Often associated with chiasmal or midbrain lesions; may indicate parasellar tumors or craniopharyngioma.

Epileptic Nystagmus

Nystagmus occurring during epileptic seizure activity is unilateral and horizontal, beating opposite the side of ictal discharge, and preceded by gaze deviation. Most of these occur as focal or generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Originates from the parieto-occipital cortex, spreading to frontal eye fields during ictal discharge. Seizure discharges drive contralateral saccadic commands, resulting in involuntary fast eye movements beating away from the epileptogenic focus. Always unilateral and horizontal, accompanied by gaze deviation; diagnosis is confirmed with EEG correlation.

Infants were included if they had video-EEG monitoring at our institution, and were seizure-free for at least 12 months after epilepsy surgery. Lateralizing signs and seizure symptomatology were classified based on blinded video review.

Results

We analyzed 100 seizures from 19 infants (1 to 32, mean 13 months of age) (1 to 14 seizures per patient). Potential lateralizing signs were seen in 58 seizures from 12 infants, including unilateral clonic jerking (8 patients); forced, sustained tonic version of the eyes to one side (7 patients); predominantly unilateral infantile spasms (5 patients); unilateral tonic stiffening of an arm and leg (2 patients); nystagmus (2 patients) and postictal hemiparesis (1 patient). Except for tonic eye version, each of the signs was contralateral to the hemisphere of seizure-onset in all but one patient who had predominantly ipsilateral spasms and clonic arm activity. Tonic eye version was contralateral in 3 patients, ipsilateral in 1 patient, and toward either side in different seizures in 3 patients.

Conclusion

Reliable lateralizing signs included focal clonic activity and predominantly unilateral spasms. Focal tonic activity, nystagmus and postictal hemiparesis were also consistently contralateral but were observed only in few patients. Tonic eye version was unreliable and could not be used to lateralize seizure onset. The sequence of eye and head version evolving to generalized tonic clonic convulsions was not seen in this age group.

### Practice parameter: evaluating a first nonfebrile seizure in children: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology, the Child Neurology Society, and the American Epilepsy Society [^116KTFSo]. Neurology (2000). Medium credibility.

First nonfebrile seizure — key history and examination features include documenting health at seizure onset ("febrile, ill, exposed to illness, complaints of not feeling well, sleep deprived") and ictal symptoms such as "Aura: Subjective sensations", "Behavior: Mood or behavioral changes before the seizure", "Preictal symptoms: Described by patient or witnessed", "Vocal: Cry or gasp, slurring of words, garbled speech", "Motor: Head or eye turning, eye deviation, posturing, jerking (rhythmic), stiffening, automatisms (purposeless repetitive movements such as picking at clothing, lip smacking); generalized or focal movements", "Respiration: Change in breathing pattern, cessation of breathing, cyanosis", "Autonomic: Pupillary dilation, drooling, change in respiratory or heart rate, incontinence, pallor, vomiting", and "Loss of consciousness or inability to understand or speak". Symptoms following seizure (postictal) include "Amnesia for events, Confusion, Lethargy, Sleepiness, Headaches and muscle aches, Transient focal weakness (Todd's paresis), Nausea or vomiting".

### Paroxysmal tonic upgaze presenting as a clinical isolated syndrome [^116ap3ro]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

We report a 3.5-year-old boy with sudden onset of episodic upward deviation of the eyes that led to diagnosis of paroxysmal tonic upgaze. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed right-hand side dominant bilateral hyperintense lesions in the mesencephalon and the thalamus on T2-weighted images. These lesions suggested a demyelinating pathology. Corticosteroid treatment was started. The episodes of upward eye deviation and the lesions on magnetic resonance imaging completely resolved after 3 days and 3 months, respectively. After 2 years of follow-up, he was symptom-free. Our patient with an isolated brain stem syndrome and no mental status changes was diagnosed as having a clinical isolated syndrome.

### Unidirectional whole body turning: a new lateralising sign in complex partial seizures [^114t4J72]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The lateralising significance of unidirectional whole body turning in patients with complex partial seizures (CPS) arising from the temporal lobe was evaluated.

Methods

A total of 330 patients undergoing long term video-EEG study were included. "Unidirectional whole body turning" was defined as rotation of the trunk, head, and limbs by > 90 degrees and lasting > 10 s. EEG correlates, MRI, and SPECT findings were compared and outcome after surgery was noted for patients with follow up data for > 1 year.

Results

Unidirectional whole body turning was observed in 13 patients with a mean age of 18 ± 8 years. Concordance of the side of whole body turning with the EEG focus and MRI findings was observed in 11 of the 13 patients (84.7%) and in 26 of 28 seizures (92.8%). The six patients who underwent temporal lobectomy or resection of lesion, opposite to the direction of body turning, had good seizure outcome.

Conclusion

Unidirectional whole body turning is a new lateralising sign in temporal lobe CPS with good predictive value for epileptogenic focus contralateral to the direction of turning.

### Pediatric occipital spikes at a single center over 26 years and the significance of tangential dipole [^116g6DJj]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric occipital epileptiform discharges occur in various clinical settings, including self-limited and treatment-resistant epilepsies. The study objective is to determine electro-clinical predictors for prognosis in children with occipital epileptiform discharges.

Methods

205 patients with occipital epileptiform discharges were classified into seizure groups: self-limited occipital (SLO) (n = 57), including Panayiotopoulos and Gastaut syndrome; non-self-limited occipital (non-SLO) (n = 98), including various seizure etiologies; genetic-generalized (n = 18); febrile (n = 5); and no-seizure (n = 27) groups. Electro-clinical features of the SLO and non-SLO were compared, as this is of most clinical relevance.

Results

The median age of seizure onset was 3 years (range: 0–19). Occipital epileptiform discharges with frontal/central positivity were present in both groups, but more common in the SLO than non-SLO groups; 21/57 (36.8%) and 19/98 (19.4%), respectively (P < .022). However, when occipital epileptiform discharges with tangential dipoles (P < .048) were accompanied by abnormal ictal eye movements (P < .037), they were predictive of SLO epilepsy.

Conclusions

In our cohort, occipital epileptiform discharges with tangential dipole detected by visual analysis and abnormal ictal eye movements were predictive of SLO epilepsy.

### Generalized seizures… [^112J5LNL]. AAP (2025). Medium credibility.

Physicians categorize seizures into two main categories based on how much of the brain is affected at the start of the seizure:

1. Generalized seizures – Involve the whole brain.
2. Focal seizures – Start in one area of the brain. Families/caregivers should consult with their child's physician to identify the seizure type as their behavior, risk of injury and treatment depend upon what kind of seizures they have. Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizures These are the most common and recognized type of generalized seizure. The child or adolescent may cry or groan and then often lose consciousness, become stiff, and begin to move arms and legs in a jerking/rhythmic movement. Their eyes may roll back, and they may have drooling or foaming at the mouth. Convulsive seizures occur in about 5 out of every 100 people at some time during childhood.

It is important to note that not everyone who has a single convulsive seizure will go on to develop epilepsy. Additional information about tonic clonic seizures can be found here. Focal Seizures Focal Aware Seizures These seizures begin in one part of the brain and symptoms will vary depending on the area of the brain involved. For example, these seizures can cause uncontrolled movement of parts of the body or sensory changes such as things smelling or tasting strange to the child or adolescent. During these seizures, the child is aware and alert but unable to respond to others or have control of their body movements. These seizures usually last between a few seconds to 2 minutes. Note: These seizures were previously called "simple partial" seizures, but that term is no longer used. Additional information about focal aware seizures can be found here.

Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures These seizures begin in one part of the brain, and symptoms will vary depending on the area of the brain involved. During these seizures the child or adolescent may be confused, consciousness is impaired and they likely are unaware of their surroundings. The child may have unusual behaviors like making repetitive movements, mumbling, running or screaming. These seizures can occur when the child is sleeping. This type of seizure can last one or two minutes, after which the child may be frightened or confused. Note: These seizures were previously called "complex partial" seizures, but that term is no longer used.

### Functional definition of seizure provides new insight into post-traumatic epileptogenesis [^115DBD4Z]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1
Clinical features of pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients presenting short neocortical seizures

Patient 1 (Fig. 8 A) is a 19-year-old man who suffered severe traumatic brain injury at six years of age from a sporting accident. The first recognized convulsive seizure occurred a few weeks later, and others followed every few months. Complex partial seizures consisting of fluttering of eyes, confusion and speech impairments also occurred frequently but were not initially recognized. They were later noted to occur several times per week and were found to be refractory to several anti-epileptic drugs. Invasive monitoring confirmed the ictal sites to be in left inferior frontal region. The patient was seizure-free after surgery. Patient 2 (Fig. 8 B) is a 31-year-old woman who sustained severe closed head injury, from a motor-vehicle accident, at age 2. Seizures were diagnosed at age 23. Typical complex partial seizures started with a period of staring and unresponsiveness, with head turning towards the right, which could be followed by body hemiclonic movements and tonic–clonic convulsions. Seizures were refractory to several anti-epileptic drugs. Invasive monitoring confirmed the onset of the typical complex partial seizures to be in the left lateral superior frontal region. The patient was seizure-free after surgery. Both Patients 1 and 2 presented short electrographic seizures originating in the same ictal site as the longer complex partial seizures, which were distant from motor areas. These brief seizures were not reported by patients, nor were they associated with any detectable external behaviour, but were electrographically identical to the onset of the patient's longer complex partial seizures. Patient 3 (Fig. 8 C) was a 22-year-old man, with long standing developmental delay who suffered from as many as 100 complex partial or secondarily generalized tonic–clonic seizures per month. Scalp video-EEG monitoring demonstrated typical focal seizures lasting > 1 min and with onset suspected to be in the left lateral frontoparietal neocortex. During ECoG monitoring, several of the patient's typical complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures were captured, but it also became clear that the patient suffered many shorter seizures manifested only by brief runs of right eye blinking ('twitching') that were often unnoticed by the patient but recognized by family members as the earliest signs of seizures. Additional surface skin EMG electrodes were placed peri-orbitally to the right eye to capture the earliest clinical manifestations of seizures. Eye-twitching episodes, lasting < 5 s, each correlated with brief discharges limited to a few contacts over the left sensori-motor cortex. The ECoG changes appeared to precede EMG changes by ∼200 ms. Patient 4 (Fig. 8 D) was a 47-year-old woman, with a history of perinatal infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory, and subsequent cerebral palsy with mild left spastic hemiparesis. The patient experienced two dozen complex partial seizures and two secondarily generalized tonic–clonic seizures per month. The seizures lasted > 1 min and were manifested by movements on the left side including left hand twitching and posturing. Scalp video-EEG monitoring captured multiple focal simple and complex partial seizures suspected to begin in the right lateral hemispheric neocortex. Invasive ECoG monitoring was carried out with additional skin surface electrodes placed over left forearm, upper arm, face and leg areas to identify the earliest clinical manifestations of the seizures. Monitoring showed typical complex partial seizures with onset in the contralateral primary motor cortex. The patient also had brief simple partial motor seizures with cortical ECoG signals lasting < 2 s with associated EMG activity from the contralateral pectoralis muscle. Both Patients 3 and 4 presented short electrographic seizures originating in the same ictal site, within sensory-motor areas, as the longer complex partial seizures. These brief seizures were similar in ECoG appearance to the initial portion of longer complex partial seizures, and were accompanied by evident ictal behaviour consisting of twitching of the corresponding contralateral muscles as confirmed by simultaneous skin-EMG recordings.

### Evaluation after a first seizure in adults [^114kgphu]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for first seizure in adults, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend to look for findings most predictive of a seizure, such as tongue biting, head turning or twisting, limb jerking, and urinary incontinence when evaluating a patient for possible seizures.

### Why you may need a neurologist to see a comatose patient in the ICU [^114MxEUn]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Eye movements are good indicators of injury

Spontaneous eye movements are underdiagnosed and underappreciated. Many of them indicate severe structural brain injury, although they do not specifically localize, other than to diffuse cortical injury. Important spontaneous eye movements are ping-pong eye movements, vertical nystagmus, ocular bobbing, but also vertical conjugate eye deviation. In a prospective study on post-CPR coma, specifically targeted to examine eye movements, eye deviation downward or upward deviation appeared in nearly one in two patients. Upward deviation is often followed by downward deviation and a poor prognosticating sign.

Not all that seizes is a seizure

Many critically ill patients move repeatedly, and not all shivering is myoclonus. In fact, shivering, rigor, or nonsustained clonus is often misinterpreted as myoclonus. Myoclonus status epilepticus is an unusual presentation, often seen after prolonged CPR or exsanguination, and is vigorous and forceful, with jerks involving all four limbs and significant facial distortions, all in association with upward eye jerks.

Could we practice with fewer EEGs"?

It is not common to diagnose status epilepticus in an acutely comatose patient without any evidence of a prior seizure, history of seizures or major predispostion for seizures. Or could we practice, at least, with fewer EEGs? The circumstances surrounding critical illness could make patients more vulnerable to seizures; however, while few patients in the ICU have seizures, many more undergo an EEG. Moreover the interpretation of abnormal EEG, s in these patients remains far from accurate. If the published studies are true-and I think they are-even if nonconvulsive status epilepticus is found.etc nonconvulsive status epilepticus is found, management of nonconvulsive status may not necessarily lead to better outcome if associated with irreversible cortical injury. EEG's may indicate prognosis but only with burst-suppression or flat background in an undrugged patient but generations of neurologists have known that. But EEG in a comatose patient should never be used to make important decisions on care.

### Ictal head version in generalized epilepsy [^11233BGe]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Focal physical signs may occur with generalized seizures. The authors retrospectively reviewed video-EEG studies of 20 patients with apparent primary generalized epilepsy to assess the frequency of head version during generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Five patients (25%) demonstrated forced head version, including two with turning to the right and left on consecutive seizures. Forced head turning can occur in generalized epilepsy and may not necessarily indicate focal seizure origin.

### Efficacy of 48 hours dose of phenytoin in prevention of early post-traumatic seizure [^115fv9WF]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

The patients were observed for seizures over a period ending on the seventh day after trauma; the primary outcome, thus, being the incidence of EPTS in the patient cohort. For reasons of logistic limitations, the diagnosis of seizures was by clinical observation only. Seizure was defined as episodes of focal or generalised repetitive jerky movements, rigid violent muscle contraction/spasm, upward rotation of the eyes, sustained deviation of the eyes or head to one side, starring spells, sudden fall or posturing with or without small gusts of respiration or frothing of saliva. The occurrence of seizure was usually observed for in our practice by any of the members of the neurosurgery team, casualty medical officers and nursing staffs, and sometimes, even by patients' relatives. The nursing staff also usually maintain seizure charts for such patients of interest.

The statistical significance of the difference in the rates of EPTS between the two study groups was determined with the Chi-square test. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Epileptic nystagmus (EN) is characterized by repetitive eye movements as a symptom of seizure activity. Two cases of EN are reported including ictal EEG, video recordings and MRI. In addition, we review the published cases and pathophysiological background of EN. The cardinal cortical region for EN is located at the junction of Brodmann areas 19/37/39 correlating with the main epileptogenic region observed in the analyzed cases.

### Can semiology predict psychogenic nonepileptic seizures? A prospective study [^116DdFbH]. Annals of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Reducing health and economic burdens from diagnostic delay of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) requires prompt referral for video electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring, the diagnostic gold standard. Practitioners make VEEG referrals when semiology suggests PNES, although few semiological signs are supported by well-designed studies, and most VEEG studies neglect to concurrently measure how accurately seizure witnesses can ascertain semiology. In this study, we estimate the value of eyewitness-reported and video-documented semiology for predicting PNES, and we measure accuracy of eyewitness reports.

Methods

We prospectively interviewed eyewitnesses of seizures in patients referred for VEEG monitoring, to inquire about 48 putative PNES and ES signs. Multiple, EEG-blinded, epileptologists independently evaluated seizure videos and documented the presence/absence of signs. We used generalized estimating equations to identify reliable video-documented PNES and ES signs, and we compared eyewitness reports with video findings to assess how accurately signs are reported. We used logistic regression to determine whether eyewitness reports could predict VEEG-ascertained seizure type.

Results

We analyzed 120 seizures (36 PNES, 84 ES) from 35 consecutive subjects. Of 45 video-documented signs, only 3 PNES signs ("preserved awareness", "eye flutter", and "bystanders can intensify or alleviate") and 3 ES signs ("abrupt onset", "eye-opening/widening", and postictal "confusion/sleep") were significant and reliable indicators of seizure type. Eyewitness reports of these 6 signs were inaccurate and not statistically different from guessing. Consequentially, eyewitness reports of signs did not predict VEEG-ascertained diagnosis. We validated our findings in a second, prospective cohort of 36 consecutive subjects.

Interpretation

We identified 6 semiological signs that reliably distinguish PNES and ES, and found that eyewitness reports of these signs are unreliable. We offer suggestions to improve the accuracy of eyewitness reports.

### Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy: is there overlap? [^116dANbZ]. Brain (2004). Low credibility.

Although epileptic photosensitivity is well known, its genetics and syndromic associations are incompletely understood. Seizures triggered by photic stimulation are usually a manifestation of the idiopathic generalized epilepsies, especially juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), or of the occipital epilepsies. Idiopathic photosensitive occipital epilepsy (IPOE) is a focal epilepsy with colourful elementary visual auras, often with conscious tonic head and eye version; myoclonus is not a feature. All seizures are induced by photic stimuli. We describe four families with phenotypic overlap between JME and IPOE. Families were identified if two or more affected individuals had visual auras and electro-clinical features of an idiopathic epilepsy. Family members underwent detailed electro-clinical assessment. In addition, 40 unrelated JME probands were investigated systematically for unrecognized features of IPOE (visual aura and conscious head version). There were 12 affected individuals in four families; 11 were female. Clinical onset was at 8–21 years of age. Of 10 patients with visual auras, six had conscious head version and five also experienced myoclonic jerks; eight had non-photic induced tonic-clonic seizures (TCS). Of the remaining individuals, one had myoclonic jerks and occipital spikes; the other had TCS without visual aura or myoclonic jerks. Of 10 patients with EEG studies, eight had generalized spike and wave (GSW) and six had occipital spikes. All had photosensitivity with GSW and four had additional occipital spikes. Of the 40 JME probands, six had visual aura and/or conscious head version; five of these were photosensitive. There is overlap between the clusters of clinical features used to diagnose IPOE and JME. Half of the affected individuals in our families with visual aura had myoclonic jerks; the former is characteristic of IPOE and the latter of JME. Importantly, visual aura is not regarded as part of JME, nor myoclonus part of IPOE, but our data emphasize that these symptoms may occur in both disorders. Moreover, two-thirds of individuals with visual aura had spontaneous TCS; the latter feature is not described in IPOE. Additionally, we demonstrate that visual aura and conscious head version are under-recognized features of JME, particularly among photosensitive patients. These findings could be explained by shared genetic determinants underlying IPOE and JME. Understanding the genetic basis of these disorders must account for the striking female predominance, the variable phenotypes associated with photosensitivity and the overlap of clinical features classically regarded as distinguishing focal and generalized syndromes.

Results

Case presentation

The patient was the second child of healthy non-consanguineous parents. This patient was born on an uneventful full-term cesarean delivery with a birth weight of 3.55 kg. However, the global developmental delay (GDD) was found in our patient with difficulty to head control, roll over, eyes following objects, and feeding in her three-month-old. Furthermore, her weight gains slowly after birth, weighing only 5.5 kg at 3 months old.

She was admitted to our hospital due to intermittent fever, seizures, eyes upward rolling and salivation when she was 3 months old. She was initially diagnosed with epilepsy and developmental delay for the abnormal electroencephalograph (EEG) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) results. EEG showed the background rhythm slowed down and mixture multiple foci-spikes, spike waves, and sharp waves (Fig. 1 A). There were frequent focal subclinical or clinical seizures arising from the left frontotemporal (Fig. 1 B). An abnormal signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum was shown in MRI (Fig. 1 D). Her intermittent fever was gradually controlled through anti-infection treatment. However, the status seizures failed to remission for continuous adjustment the types and dosages of antiepileptic drug.

Fig. 1
EEG and MRI results in patient with NARS2 heterozygous variant. A EEG results showed multiple foci-spikes, spike waves, and sharp waves when patient was 3 months and 20 days old. B The patient exhibited upward rolling of the eyes and salivation, while the EEG shows synchronization with low to medium amplitude fast wave rhythm in the left frontotemporal. C The EEG presented highly irregular burst suppression patterns when patient was 4 months and 16 days old. D At the age of 3 months and 12 days, the diffusion-weighted image (DWI) revealed a small and slightly high signal shadow in the corpus callosum. while an apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC) showed a slightly low signal intensity. E At the age of 4 months and 15 days, the T1-weighted image showed abnormalities in bilateral symmetry signal, and decreased white matter in bilateral cerebral

### Eye movement disorders and neurological symptoms in late-onset inborn errors of metabolism [^115A9fFF]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Disorders of Lipid Metabolism

Signs of abetalipoproteinemia occur early in life and progress with time. Neurological manifestations resulting from vitamin deficiency often begin in the first or second decade of life. Low vitamin E in particular can cause progressive neurological symptoms affecting the peripheral and central nervous system. Adult patients show malabsorption, steatosis, abnormal liver transaminases, and neurological signs. 21 Abnormalities of eye movements are typical, including progressive gaze disturbances attributed to paresis of the medial rectus muscles and a characteristic pattern of dissociated nystagmus. The latter consists of an intense nystagmus, but with limited range in the adducting eye, and a less‐intense nystagmus, but with full range, in the abducting eye. Patients complain of trouble reading and of difficulties associated with impaired convergence. Saccades are slow and hypometric. Vestibular nystagmus and optokinetic nystagmus have abnormal or absent quick phases. 44 A low‐fat diet with reduced long‐chain fatty acids and fat‐soluble vitamin supplements is recommended. 21

Late‐onset cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is characterized by tendon xanthomas, psychiatric symptoms, and neurological symptoms, including pyramidal, cerebellar, and extrapyramidal signs in the second or third decade of life. 21, 45 Patients show abnormal pursuit, increased saccadic intrusions, multistep saccades, and antisaccade deficits. 46 Chenodeoxycolic acid and statin therapy are an effective treatment and can prevent neurological involvement if started early. 21, 47, 48

Disorders of Carbohydrate Metabolism

Symptoms of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency usually occur early in life, but may present in adolescence or adulthood. In the late presentation form, paroxysmal exercise‐induced dyskinesia occurs that predominantly manifests as dystonia, chorea, and ballism. Epilepsy is also observed. 49 Abnormalities of eye movements are common and may be highly characteristic brief multidirectional paroxysmal episodes of rapid eye movements in combination with head movements in the same direction, a phenomenon called aberant gaze saccades. 50 Eye rolling and fluttering, strabismus, opsoclonus, and limitation of vertical eye movements have also been described. 50, 51, 52 Early diagnosis is important because this disorder can be treated with a ketogenic diet. 21

### Evidence for three-dimensional cortical control of gaze from epileptic patients [^114HLzC9]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Electrophysiological studies in primates indicate that the eye fields of the cerebral hemispheres control gaze in three-dimensional space, and contain neurons that encode both conjugate (versive) and vergence eye movements. Two patients with epilepsy who exhibited disconjugate contraversive horizontal eye movements are described, one during electrical stimulation of the frontal eye fields and the other during focal seizures. We postulate that these eye movements resulted from combined contralateral version and vergence, and suggest that human cortical eye fields also govern visual search in a three-dimensional world, shifting the point of fixation between targets lying in different directions and at different depths.

### Paroxysmal eye-head movements in glut1 deficiency syndrome [^112JDAeG]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Our patients' episodes were characterized by apparently involuntary repeated gaze saccades. Symptoms almost always emerged during the first 6 months of life, a time when the visual system is undergoing rapid maturation, and the ability to suppress reflexive saccades to visual stimuli develops. Because neurons in the dorsal raphe and the substantia nigra pars reticulata discharge at high rates except during eye movements, it is possible that their activity is compromised by the glucose deficiency of Glut1 DS, allowing the release of inappropriate saccades. Insufficient energy supply to meet demand is one mechanism that has been postulated to underlie other paroxysmal events in Glut1 DS. Consistent with this hypothesis, eye movement episodes were precipitated by fatigue, excitement, or fasting, and responded favorably to the KD in some patients.

The possibility that these episodes represent a type of focal seizure that is not detectable by scalp EEG cannot be fully excluded, but is unlikely. Preserved alertness, absence of other typical clinical manifestations of seizures, and normal ictal EEG suggest that these events are nonepileptic. The majority of patients had coexisting epilepsy, which manifested at a similar age to the eye movement episodes in 10 patients (table 1). In 6 patients, the first seizure did not occur until 7–21 months after the onset of the eye movement episodes.

Eye movement episodes emerged before age 6 months in 83% of our patients. Among the 8 patients for whom the course of the episodes was known, events decreased in frequency by late infancy, and disappeared in all but one patient by age 8 years. Thus these episodes represent an age-dependent manifestation of the disease that is likely related to a specific stage of brain development. Other features of Glut1 DS also occur in an age-dependent manner: for example, seizures tend to be more prominent in infancy and childhood, and improve or even disappear by adulthood, while dystonia and other paroxysmal movement disorders tend to develop later in childhood or during adolescence.

Verbal description of the eye movement episodes by parents and doctors was highly variable. Some descriptions were strikingly vivid and accurate, but many were imprecise. For example, the movements were often described as eye rolling in the medical chart, but video review clearly demonstrated that the eye movements were rapid. Associated head movements (nodding, bobbing, or back and forth) were documented in only 50% of patients, but head movements were present in all but 1 of the 18 video episodes that we reviewed. This highlights the diagnostic challenge posed by rare and unusual symptoms for which there is not a recognized medical term.

### Rolling in the deep: surface EEG seizures viewed through the lens of stereo EEG [^112Fqgdp]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Stereotactic electroencephalography (stereo EEG) offers an opportunity to study in situ brain physiology and pathology, even in regions "invisible" by scalp recordings. Yet, stereo EEG signal acquisition requires meticulous attention to trajectory planning. In that regard, preimplantation scalp recordings play a cardinal role in deciding the need for further investigation and the shape that this will take. Background knowledge of scalp-intracranial EEG correlations can assist in careful navigation of such decisions and has therefore attracted increased scientific interest in the past decades.

The current studyexpands our knowledge in the field by examining simultaneous surface-stereo EEG recordings from 129 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) undergoing surgical evaluation. Patients with poor scalp EEG coverage, noninterpretable scalp EEG, no seizures, and nonlocalizing stereo EEG seizures were excluded. For each patient, the most representative seizure was analyzed on the scalp by 2 epileptologists blinded to the stereo EEG recordings and intracranially by group consensus during a multidisciplinary conference. In addition to its morphology and topography, other ictal characteristics such as duration and latency between intracranial and surface EEG seizures were evaluated. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified 6 scalp EEG seizure patterns ("normal", "blurred", "temporal", "posterior", "diffuse suppression", and "frontal"). None of them was specific to a single intracerebral topography. Yet, the "temporal" cluster was typically ipsilateral in the theta/delta range and corresponded preferentially to mesial temporal localization, the "posterior" cluster was ipsilateral or contralateral alpha range or slow frequencies corresponding preferentially to temporal localization (though occipital and parietal seizures were typically in that group too), the "diffuse suppression" cluster was typically bilateral and corresponded to mesial and insulo-opercular localization and the "frontal" cluster was characterized by bilateral fast frequencies corresponding preferential to a frontal localization. The short and longest seizure duration were seen with the "normal" and the "temporal" scalp EEG profile, respectively.

A patient was transferred for management of "medication-refractory seizures" after failure of levetiracetam and valproate dual therapy. She had a life-long history of two types of events: periods in which she would rapidly and uncontrollably lapse into unconsciousness, and spells in which she would "pass out" but maintain consciousness, the latter happening with increasing frequency in association with laughing, as of late. She also reported hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. A clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy was made. The prevailing pathophysiological concept of narcolepsy details "partial intrusions of REM" sleep into wakefulness. Healthy REM sleep includes generalized atonia, but with preservation of eye movements, respiratory function, and sphincter tone. Cataplexy recapitulates this pattern, and is often induced by extreme emotions, laughter in this case. Despite generalized and severe weakness and areflexia during this patient's cataplectic events, she was able to volitionally move her eyes, which is consistent with the physiology of REM sleep. The diagnosis of cataplexy is often missed, due to clinicians being unfamiliar with the findings and the lack of ability to induce sufficient emotional responses to trigger an episode. This example of cataplexy is also quite characteristic of the "cataplectic facies". The ability to observe the infrequently observed phenomenon of cataplexy serves as a reminder that consciousness is preserved, as are extra-ocular muscle movements.

### Idiopathic paroxysmal tonic upward gaze [^117UpJn5]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal tonic upward gaze constitutes a neuro-ophthalmologic syndrome characterized by episodes of sustained conjugate upward deviation of the eyes, normal horizontal gaze, and ataxia. Its pathogenesis is unknown, and the etiology is heterogeneous. The prognosis is variable. We present a case of "idiopathic paroxysmal tonic upward gaze" with a positive clinical course and spontaneous remission.

### Child presenting to the ED with prolonged autonomic symptoms followed by generalized seizure activity [^1169K4sJ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A 5-year-old girl presented to the emergency department (ED) with a parental complaint of vomiting and seizure-like activity. The patient had been in her normal state of health before the onset of this activity and had had no recent illnesses. Shortly after the child had gone to bed, she awoke complaining of feeling sick to her stomach. Over several minutes the child became less responsive to questioning, followed by rightward eye and head deviation and vomiting. Following this, the child's eyes remained fixed in a rightward gaze and she was no longer responsive to questioning despite appearing awake. On the way to the hospital the child became flaccid, which was shortly followed by further vomiting and right upper extremity jerking and finally full upper extremity convulsive activity. In the ED, the child remained in this state for approximately 90 minutes despite the use of intravenous diazepam. Gradually, she became responsive to parental stimulation and questioning.

### Fixation-off sensitivity and generalized epileptic EEG induced by eyes closed [^116hELqv]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

This report describes a female with eyelid fluttering with absence seizures, infrequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and mild mental retardation. Interictal and video-electroencephalography evaluations revealed normal activity while eyes were open but continuous generalized discharges with eyes closed (eyes closed induced abnormality), as well as fixation-off sensitivity. This patient is in the group of a pure and distinct clinical form of fixation-off sensitivity cryptogenic generalized epilepsy.

### De novo variants in DENND5B cause a neurodevelopmental disorder [^114pUDFp]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

(C) Histogram graphs showing the distribution of clinical features and brain MRI abnormalities in the cohort of subjects harboring DENND5B variants. Abbreviations: CCH, corpus callosum hypoplasia; DD, developmental delay; ID, intellectual disability; NA, not available; OCH, optic chiasm hypoplasia; OFC, occipito-frontal circumference; WM, white matter.

Behavioral disorders were present in three subjects. These included attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in #1, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in #2 and #5, and a combination of anxiety, compulsiveness, and behavioral dysregulation in #5 (Table S5). Hand stereotypies were observed in two subjects (#2 and #5) and sleep disorders in two individuals (#1 and #5). Four subjects showed hypotonia, either truncal (#1) or generalized (#3-#5). Additional neurological manifestations were heterogeneous and included dysarthria (#3), dystonia (#1), and spasticity (#1). Macrocephaly was present in subjects #1 (2.6 SDS) and #2 (3.19 SDS), whereas microcephaly was observed in individual #3 (−2.48 SDS).

Seizures were reported in three subjects (#1, #3, and #5) (Table S5). While a single episode of febrile seizures occurred in subject #1, recurrent epileptic manifestations were observed in #3 and #5. Subject #3 experienced monthly multifocal seizures and partial seizures with secondary generalization since the age of 1 year. The electroencephalogram (EEG) at onset showed signs of a left anterior temporal partial epilepsy in the context of a slowing of the background activity. Follow-up EEG further showed an involvement of the right frontal region, with features suggestive of a focal cerebral dysfunction. This subject became seizure-free with a combination antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy featuring oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, zonisamide, clobazam, and lamotrigine. Subject #5 presented with recurrent focal seizures in the first year of life, associated with episodes of behavioral arrest and impaired consciousness. These manifestations typically lasted a few seconds and were characterized by staring and backwards rolling of the eyes.

### Clinical and genetic study on a Chinese patient with infantile onset epileptic encephalopathy carrying a PPP3CA null variant: a case report [^116LbAKC]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Five months later, the follow-up V-EEG demonstrated slower background rhythms and frequent clusters of generalized or multi-focal poly-spike discharges. During the interictal stage, fragmented atypical hypsarrhythmia discharges appeared. The observed seizure of the patient was developed into three types this time: generalized myoclonic seizures, epileptic spasms and atypical absence seizures. For generalized myoclonic seizures, single or double rapid proximal jerks in one lateral upper limb could be observed during the episode. V-EEG results revealed synchronous bursts of generalized slow spike-and-waves accompanied by 50 ms bursts of myoelectricity at deltoid muscles. For epileptic spasms, the patient remained awareness and consciousness during the episodes. Nodding, bending or upward staring could be observed. Each episode lasts very short for only 1–1.5 s, and was isolated and discontinued. V-EEG result demonstrated complex of high amplitude slow waves and low-amplitude high-frequency activities during the episodes. Synchronous EMG demonstrated 0.5–1 s bursts of myoelectricity followed by 1–2 s transient generalized voltage suppression at rhomboid muscles. For atypical absence seizures, the patient would have less movement and slow mild head bobbing, lasting for 8–30 s per episode. V-EEG revealed rhythmic generalized slow spike-and-wave discharges activity (1.5–2.5 Hz).

A month later, the latest follow-up V-EEG demonstrated slower background rhythms and frequent clusters of generalized or multi-focal sharp wave, spike-and-wave, as well as slow spike-and-wave discharges. During the interictal stage, generalized rhythmic slow spike-and-wave with irregular spikes was presented. Generalized myoclonic seizure, epileptic spasms and atypical absence seizures can still be identified.

### Paroxysmal tonic upgaze in children: three case reports and a review of the literature [^111Fsk46]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In clinical practice, nonepileptic paroxysmal events during infancy and childhood are common reasons for parents and caregivers to seek for medical advice. These events are mostly unrecognized and considered as an epileptic seizure because of the clinical features resembling an epileptic seizure. Paroxysmal tonic upgaze, which consists of recurrent episodes of sustained upward deviation of the eyes and incomplete downward saccades, and normal horizontal eye movements without impairment of consciousness, is a diagnostic challenge for the pediatrician and pediatric neurologist. In general, the entity was defined as an apparently benign phenomenon with normal investigations and eventual complete resolution of the symptoms, although some authors reported on patients with associated neurologic signs, such as ataxia, developmental delay, and abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging finding.

Methods

The patients were 3 children (1 boy and 2 girls) who were between 5 and 18 months old experiencing rapid ocular movements with sustained conjugate upward deviation of the eyes. Their attacks, which were recorded using a video or electroencephalogram system, were also investigated comprehensively, including neurologic examination, electroencephalograms, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and metabolic tests. Paroxysmal tonic upgaze attacks have decreased in number or disappeared in 2 patients, but 1 patient exhibited mild abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging and had relatives with epilepsy.

Conclusions

In conclusion, paroxysmal tonic upgaze is an apparently benign phenomenon with unclear pathophysiology of various proposed mechanisms such as genetic predisposition, immaturity of the brain stem, neurotransmitter depletion, or immune dysregulation. It is important to recognize the clinical presentation of paroxysmal tonic upgaze and distinguish the disorders from epilepsy for deciding the treatment and prognosis of the patients.

### Central nervous system hyperexcitability associated with glutamate dehydrogenase gain of function mutations [^113u6tXc]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe seizure phenotypes associated with the hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia syndrome (HI/HA), which is caused by gain of function mutations in the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH).

Study Design

A retrospective review of records of 14 patients with HI/HA.

Results

Nine patients had seizures as the first symptom of HI/HA, and six had seizures in the absence of hypoglycemia. No electroencephalogram (EEG) background abnormalities were identified. In four patients, EEG recordings during seizures in the setting of normal blood glucose contained generalized epileptiform discharges. EEGs of three of these patients showed 0.5- to 2-second generalized irregular spike-and-wave discharge at 3 to 6 Hz corresponding to eye blinks, eye rolling, or staring. The EEG of the fourth patient consisted of 20 seconds of generalized regular spike-and-wave discharge at 3 Hz in the clinical context of staring and unresponsiveness. In two patients, seizure control worsened with carbamezapine or oxcarbezapine treatment.

Conclusions

In patients with HI/HA, generalized seizures are common and can occur in the absence of hypoglycemia. The drugs carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine should be used with caution for treatment. Pathogenesis of epilepsy in these patients may be related to effects of GDH mutations in the brain, perhaps in combination with effects of recurrent hypoglycemia and chronic hyperammonemia.

### Ictal EEG in benign partial epilepsy in infancy [^114eDLfA]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to further clarify ictal electroencephalographic findings of patients with benign partial epilepsy in infancy in order to better understand its neurophysiologic features. The study group consisted of 13 infants with definite benign partial epilepsy in infancy, in whom ictal electroencephalograms were recorded and its benignity was confirmed at 8 years or more. The seizure manifestation was reviewed on the basis of video findings in eight patients in whom simultaneous video-electroencephalography recording was available. In the other five patients, the seizure manifestations were determined according to the observations of physicians, nurses, or technicians. Thirteen seizures from eight patients were complex partial, and six seizures from six patients were secondarily generalized ones. Ictal discharges at the onset of a seizure were focal in all seizures. The site of the origin of seizures was in the temporal area in 10 of 13 complex partial seizures, whereas it was in the parietal or occipital area in all 6 secondarily generalized seizures. Among 13 complex partial seizures, paroxysmal discharges remained focal throughout the seizures in 6 seizures, whereas they spread to one hemisphere in the other 7 seizures. Motion arrest or decreased responsiveness was uniformly observed. Lateral eye deviation was commonly recognized in complex partial seizures, whereas head rotation was observed only in seizures in which hemispheric propagation of ictal discharges was observed. Ictal electroencephalographic findings of patients with benign partial epilepsy in infancy were relatively uniform, suggesting the homogeneity of patients with benign partial epilepsy in infancy.

### Occipital lobe epilepsy surgery: treating seizures in the posterior cortex [^116dVsZE]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE) is an uncommon type of extratemporal epilepsy constituting roughly 2–13% of symptomatic partial epilepsies and epilepsy surgery cases. Over two-thirds of patients with OLE present with two characteristics: (1) ictal semiology compatible with an occipital seizure focus (e.g., ictal blindness, visual perceptual disturbance, eye blinking, nystagmus), and (2) lateralizing features referable to the posterior cortex (e.g., visual field defects, contralateral head deviation). The remaining one-third of patients present with ≥ 2 seizure types, indicative of spread to other lobes. A common representation of this cortical spread is the altered mental status and generalized tonic-clonic activity seen in patient with OLE. While the key clinical symptoms include visual hallucinations, it may be difficult to elicit on history, especially from children, and are not always present.

### Epidemiology, classification… [^113sguZn]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

4 Epilepsies and epileptic syndromes are currently classified as localized or generalized, based on clinical and electroencephalographic changes. 5 A generalized epilepsy or epileptic syndrome results in seizures that involve the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally and symmetrically at the time of onset. In contrast, a partial epilepsy produces seizures that originate in a specific region of the cerebral cortex. The seizures may be associated with signs or symptoms peculiar to their region of origin, and they may occur with or without mental status changes or loss of consciousness. Partial epilepsy, the most common type of epilepsy in the elderly, is often the result of localized cortical dysfunction. 3, 6 These seizures are associated with subdural hematoma, stroke, and CNS infection. They also can occur with systemic metabolic conditions such as uremia, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and alcohol withdrawal. A five-year study.

Seizure recurrence after a stroke can be immediate, or it may not happen for several years. 9 Recurrences are more common after hemorraghic or severe ischemic strokes with cortical involvement and late onset of the first seizure. 8, 10 Of the degenerative disorders, Alzheimer's dementia and amyloid angiopathy are known major causes of seizures. 11 Advanced Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a risk factor for new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures in older adults. 12 It is associated with a 10 percent prevalence of seizures, particularly late in the illness. 11 An increased prevalence of seizures also has been documented with other types of dementia. 11 Status epilepticus has been defined as a single generalized seizure lasting more than five minutes or a series of seizures lasting longer than 30 minutes without the patient regaining consciousness. The greatest increase in the incidence of status epilepticus occurs after the age of 60 years.

13 The most dramatic clinical presentation is generalized convulsive seizures. Nonconvulsive seizures may cause sudden changes in behavior and cognition. A study 14 of 342 patients with status epilepticus who had their first seizure after 60 years of age found that cerebrovascular disease was the leading cause, followed by head trauma. Status epilepticus also can occur because of hypoxia, hyperglycemia, intracranial infection, brain tumors, and drug intoxication or withdrawal.

### De novo missense variants in CHTF18: the potential to expand the clinical spectrum of cohesinopathies [^113beEve]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Individual 3

A 3-year-old female was referred to the Genetics Department at 21 months of age. She presented with global developmental delays, hypotonia, seizures, and an abnormal brain MRI. Prenatal ultrasound showed possible corpus callosum dysgenesis and oligohydramnios. Fetal MRI at gestational age 37 weeks showed non-specific imaging anomalies, including generalized asymmetric shallow polymicrogyria with slightly thinned abnormal white matter and asymmetric lateral ventricles dilatation and prominent third ventricle, extremely thin corpus callosum with relative sparing of the splenium and absent cavum septum pellucidum, dysmorphic and undifferentiated basal ganglia, and small kidneys. Neurology examination at 6 months of age showed motor delay. She had generalized hypotonia with diminished deep tendon reflexes. She could not sit, even with support, but could raise her head on prone posture and could maintain head posture. At age 13 months, she had recurrent vomiting and presented with a focal seizure affecting the right side (eyes and neck deviated to the right side, right side was stiff with jerking, and she was unconscious). She was started on levetiracetam for seizure control. An EEG showed left-sided slowing with no definitive epileptiform discharges. Physical examination at age 3 years revealed brachycephaly, deep-set eyes, prominent low-set ears, global developmental delay, and lack of language. She saw speech-language pathology for dysphagia and was not able to suck from a straw. Physiotherapy noted improvement, including use of bilateral hands as she initiated to catch small toys, active movement of her bilateral lower limbs, and ability to roll over independently. Follow-up brain MRI included periventricular white matter loss, thinning of the corpus callosum, secondary supratentorial ex vacuo ventriculomegaly, mildly simplified sulcation pattern without significant cortical thickening, and questionable area of polymicrogyria involving the posterior perisylvian fissure. ES identified a de novo missense variant in the CHTF18 gene c.2027T > G (p. Leu676Arg). This variant is absent from population databases (gnomAD), strongly conserved, and predicted to be damaging by computational tools (Table 2).

### Poststroke seizure: optimising its management [^111zsZWA]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The recognition and diagnosis of PSS, however, have not always been an easy task. In fact, most PSS occurred in patients who already had significant neurological deficits, so the new symptoms originated by seizures may be hidden or ignored. In certain instances, PSS present as only subtle clinical findings, such as focal, intermittent eye deviation or nystagmus, mild facial twitching, or focal sensation changes; other PSS cases may only have worsening of motor deficit, impaired speech or fluctuating stroke recovery. Moreover, patients with PSS may have no focal motor or sensory signs, and only present with altered mental status and behaviour arrest. These cases of subclinical/non-convulsion seizures or SE can only be confirmed by electroencephalogram (EEG). Claassen et al in their study of continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring in intensive care unit (ICU) patients reviewed 570 consecutive patients who underwent cEEG, among them 37% were stroke-related (19% subarachnoid haemorrhage, 7.9% ICH and 9.8% ischaemic stroke). The authors found that seizures were detected in 19% of patients who underwent cEEG monitoring; the seizures were exclusively non-convulsive in 92% of these patients. According to the definition proposed in this study, seizures were considered convulsive if any of the following was described: 'generalized tonic-clonic seizures', 'grand mal seizures', 'convulsions', 'rhythmic jerking', 'rhythmic twitching' or similar descriptions. If none of these was present and cEEG confirmed seizures, the seizures were considered non-convulsive, whether or not subtle movements (eg, subtle facial twitching, eye deviation, nystagmus) were observed. Miyaji et al recently reported 127 patients with PSS, 29% of them were non-convulsive seizures. Among them, 60 patients (47%) developed into SE, including 11 patients (9%) without convulsion.

### Paroxysmal eye-head movements in glut1 deficiency syndrome [^114yLGGF]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective:

To describe a characteristic paroxysmal eye–head movement disorder that occurs in infants with Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS).

Methods:

We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 101 patients with Glut1 DS to obtain clinical data about episodic abnormal eye movements and analyzed video recordings of 18 eye movement episodes from 10 patients.

Results:

A documented history of paroxysmal abnormal eye movements was found in 32/101 patients (32%), and a detailed description was available in 18 patients, presented here. Episodes started before age 6 months in 15/18 patients (83%), and preceded the onset of seizures in 10/16 patients (63%) who experienced both types of episodes. Eye movement episodes resolved, with or without treatment, by 6 years of age in 7/8 patients with documented long-term course. Episodes were brief (usually < 5 minutes). Video analysis revealed that the eye movements were rapid, multidirectional, and often accompanied by a head movement in the same direction. Eye movements were separated by clear intervals of fixation, usually ranging from 200 to 800 ms. The movements were consistent with eye–head gaze saccades. These movements can be distinguished from opsoclonus by the presence of a clear intermovement fixation interval and the association of a same-direction head movement.

Conclusions:

Paroxysmal eye–head movements, for which we suggest the term aberrant gaze saccades, are an early symptom of Glut1 DS in infancy. Recognition of the episodes will facilitate prompt diagnosis of this treatable neurodevelopmental disorder.

### Hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy with paroxysmal tonic upgaze and absence of psychomotor development [^113E6BZU]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathies are characterized by a substantial and permanent deficit in myelin deposition in the brain. Although our knowledge and understanding of the etiology of white matter diseases has progressively increased, many cases with this disorder remain undiagnosed, despite extensive evaluations. Recently, new disease entities have been defined by combining magnetic resonance imaging pattern recognition and clinical features. We describe a 1-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish girl with a hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy, who presented in the neonatal period with episodes of sustained paroxysmal tonic upward gaze, roving eye movements, pendular nystagmus, and severe hypotonia, with the later appearance of pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs and no development. In addition, she has dysmorphic signs. This clinical picture is not consistent with any of the previously described hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathies and may represent a new entity.

### Saccadic eye movements in neurological disease: cognitive mechanisms and clinical applications [^112Tr2sr]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Epilepsy

In focal epilepsy, there is an "enduring predisposition to epileptic seizures", required as part of the International League Against Epilepsy's definition of epilepsy, which is presumed to be due to structural or functional disruption in the brain. Temporal lobe epilepsy, most often seen with associated hippocampal sclerosis, remains archetypal for focal epilepsies due to its relative prevalence. Still, the location of seizure foci can be varied, and the causes can be wide ranging. Cognitive impairment in epilepsy is common and thought to be multifactorial, with contributions from structural disruption and ictal–interictal dysfunction. The adverse effects of antiseizure medications contribute further to cognitive dysfunction. It is not surprising then that ocular motor dysfunction was found among 51 patients with focal, drug-resistant epilepsy. These patients demonstrated increased AS latency and error rates and overall poorer accuracy compared to control. In a subgroup analysis, the authors demonstrated that only the temporal lobe and left hemispheric epilepsies contributed to prolonged AS latency. Conversely, patients with right hemispheric epilepsies demonstrated larger magnitudes of AS inaccuracy. These changes reflect increased processing speeds related to left hemispheric dysfunction and the right hemisphere's dominant role in spatial attention. Seen within the context of focal epilepsy, ocular motor testing and saccadic parameters therefore have the potential to localise lesions. Of note is the absence of ocular motor tasks from this study that make specific demands on memory. Impaired verbal memory is an established finding in epilepsy, especially in association with the hippocampal atrophy seen in TLE. Furthermore, the cognitive adverse effects of antiseizure medications were not quantified.

Outside of tertiary centres with comprehensive epilepsy programmes, neuropsychological evaluation of patients with epilepsy in general is not routine. Cognitive profiles in various epileptic syndromes and epileptogenic localisations continue to be described, and ocular motor testing potentially offers a more accessible modality to both identify issues with cognition and contribute to the localisation of epilepsies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of occipital brain lesions in children [^115skcqb]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the early years of life, behavioural methods provide preliminary data on the extent of visual deficits and require further assessment from preschool age to study the impact of neurological damage on perceptual development. As early as preschool age, specific procedures can be used to assess visual fields, for face recognition and object identification, and to access stored visual knowledge about objects.

Seizures originating from the occipital lobes can be hard to detect clinically, especially in young or non‐verbal children. Semiology typically includes positive and negative visual symptoms (visual hallucinations, blurring or loss of vision), oculomotor phenomena, rapid eye blinking, occasionally autonomic features, alterations in awareness, and possible additional manifestations depending on the spread of the epileptic discharge to other areas.

Depending on the type, extent, and location of the disease process, specific neurological deficits may occur and may have different prognostic outlooks.

### Panayiotopoulos syndrome: a benign childhood autonomic epilepsy frequently imitating encephalitis, syncope, migraine, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis [^114wWJzz]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Panayiotopoulos syndrome is a common idiopathic childhood-specific seizure disorder formally recognized by the International League Against Epilepsy. An expert consensus has defined Panayiotopoulos syndrome as "a benign age-related focal seizure disorder occurring in early and mid-childhood. It is characterized by seizures, often prolonged, with predominantly autonomic symptoms, and by an EEG [electroencephalogram] that shows shifting and/or multiple foci, often with occipital predominance".

Objective

The purpose of this review is to provide guidance for appropriate diagnosis and management of Panayiotopoulos syndrome.

Clinical Features

Autonomic epileptic seizures and autonomic status epilepticus are the cardinal manifestations of Panayiotopoulos syndrome. Autonomic seizures in Panayiotopoulos syndrome consist of episodes of disturbed autonomic function with emesis as the predominant symptom. Other autonomic manifestations include pallor (or, less often, flushing or cyanosis), mydriasis (or, less often, miosis), cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory alterations, incontinence of urine and/or feces, hypersalivation, and modifications of intestinal motility. In approximately one fifth of the seizures the child becomes unresponsive and flaccid (ictal syncope) before or often without convulsions. Cardiorespiratory arrest is exceptional. More-conventional seizure symptoms often appear after the onset of autonomic manifestations. The child, who was initially fully conscious, becomes confused and unresponsive. Eyes turn to one side or gaze widely open. Only half of the seizures end with brief hemiconvulsions or generalized convulsions. Convulsive status epilepticus is extremely rare. Autonomic symptoms may be the only features of the seizures. Half of the seizures in Panayiotopoulos syndrome last for > 30 minutes, thus constituting autonomic status epilepticus, which is the more common nonconvulsive status epilepticus in normal children. Two thirds of seizures occur during sleep.

Epidemiology

Panayiotopoulos syndrome probably affects 13% of children aged 3 to 6 years who have had 1 or more afebrile seizures and 6% of such children in the 1- to 15-year age group.

Diagnostic Tests

An electroencephalogram is the only investigation with abnormal results, usually showing multiple spikes in various brain locations.

Pathophysiology

Panayiotopoulos syndrome is probably the early-onset and Rolandic epilepsy the late-onset phenotype of a maturation-related benign childhood seizure-susceptibility syndrome. Ictal epileptic discharges in Panayiotopoulos syndrome, irrespective of their location at onset, activate autonomic disturbances and emesis, to which children are particularly vulnerable. The symptoms/sequence of autonomic seizures and autonomic status epilepticus in Panayiotopoulos syndrome are specific to childhood, and they do not occur in adults.

Prognosis

Panayiotopoulos syndrome is remarkably benign in terms of seizure frequency and evolution. Autonomic status epilepticus imparts no residual neurologic deficit. The risk of epilepsy in adult life seems to be no higher than in the general population. However, autonomic seizures are potentially life-threatening in the rare context of cardiorespiratory arrest, an area in which additional study is required. MISDIAGNOSIS: The clinical features of Panayiotopoulos syndrome are frequently mistaken as nonepileptic conditions such as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis. The consequence is avoidable misdiagnosis, high morbidity, and costly mismanagement.

Management

Education about Panayiotopoulos syndrome is the cornerstone of management. Prophylactic treatment with antiepileptic medication may not be needed for most patients. Autonomic status epilepticus in the acute stage needs thorough evaluation; aggressive treatment may cause iatrogenic complications including cardiorespiratory arrest.

### Distinguishing epileptic vs. nonepileptic staring in children… [^115u6NsE]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Staring spells are common in children and may be epileptic or nonepileptic. The diagnosis is typically based on parental reports of the episode and results of electroencephalography. Other diagnostic information includes abnormal results on neuroimaging, focal findings on neurologic examination or the presence of other seizure types in addition to the staring spells. Confirming a diagnosis can be difficult when staring is the only symptom and the results of the EEG are within normal limits. Rosenow and associates sought to increase the diagnostic certainty of the parental interview by identifying questions specific and sensitive for nonepileptic and epileptic staring spells. A 25-item questionnaire exploring the types and setting of symptoms for staring spells was given to the parents or guardians of 40 children who presented with staring spells.

Questions focused on physical behaviors that characterized the staring episode, such as arrest of activity, unresponsiveness, eye blinking, upward eye rolling, myoclonic twitches, body stiffening, dropping of the head or jaw and body rocking. Other questions addressed patient age at onset, duration and frequency of the episodes, the presence of learning difficulties and the person who initially identified the episodes. Of the 40 patients identified for the study, 17 had absence seizures with generalized seizure patterns seen on routine EEG, and 23 had nonepileptic staring spells diagnosed after a full clinical evaluation by a specialist. Children with nonepileptic staring spells had normal findings on routine EEG. Questions regarding the features of the staring episode were not useful, as both types of episodes were characterized by a dazed or vacant expression, sudden onset and abrupt cessation. Learning problems were identified with equal frequency in both groups.

A family history of staring spells or epileptic seizures was more common among the children in the absence-seizure group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Of the items on the questionnaire, only a few showed significant differences between the two groups. Children in the nonepileptic-staring group were more responsive to touch, did not interrupt play and were first identified as having a staring spell by a teacher or a health professional. Body rocking was reported exclusively in this group, but in only 13 percent of patients. Features that were highly specific for absence seizures included limb twitching, upward eye movements and urinary incontinence during staring episodes.

### Why brains behave differently: insights from eye movement disorders [^112LtZVj]. Experimental Eye Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The variability in the evolution, phenomenology, and response to treatment of diseases, even among patients with the same genetic mutation or identical structural or metabolic insults, is a common challenge in contemporary neurology and neuroscience. Why does the human brain react so differently to the same disease or treatment? Genetic variability among individuals might be part of the answer. Epigenetics, how the activity of genes changes with changes in the environment also contributes to the variability. Genes determine the expression profile of molecules within and on the surface of neurons, such as ion channels. This profile influences membrane physiology, which in turn affects the behavior (or misbehavior) of neural circuits and thus the disease phenomenology. The physiology of circuit behavior is extremely complex. In this context, studying eye movements is valuable because normal ocular motor physiology is better understood, the structural correlates of ocular motor disorders are clearer, and the behavioral outcomes of these disorders can be precisely measured and interpreted with mathematical models. Here, we review three disorders characterized by unwanted oscillations of the eyes. While their structural correlates are relatively well defined, the phenomenology and response to treatment of these disorders are surprisingly variable. Mathematical models suggest that the mechanisms for the diverse phenomenology of these three diseases are centered on genetically determined variability in the physiology of neuronal membranes and the internal connections of neural circuits.

### Does the primary literature provide support for clinical signs used to distinguish psychogenic nonepileptic seizures from epileptic seizures? [^111hNkiH]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) represent a diagnostic challenge. When trying to distinguish between PNES and epileptic seizures (ES), clinicians rely on the presence or absence of several clinical signs. The purpose of this review is to establish the extent to which these signs are supported by primary data from the literature. A Medline search was used to identify primary studies that used video-EEG to define the presence or absence of different clinical signs in PNES and ES. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. 34 studies matched the inclusion criteria. A specific sign was considered well supported by the data from the primary literature if we were able to identify at least two controlled studies demonstrating its usefulness and if the data from other studies were supportive. There is good evidence from the literature that long duration, occurrence from apparent sleep with EEG-verified wakefulness, fluctuating course, asynchronous movements, pelvic thrusting, side-to-side head or body movement, closed eyes during the episode, ictal crying, memory recall and absence of postictal confusion are signs that distinguish PNES from ES. Postictal stertorous breathing proved to distinguish convulsive PNES from generalised tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) and should be added to the list of useful clinical signs. The final clinical diagnosis should encompass all available data and should not rely on any single sign alone.

### Diagnostic yield of electroencephalograms in infants and young children with frequent paroxysmal eye movements [^116NvCxd]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal eye movement events are common in children. Many infants and young children are referred for a routine or a video-electroencephalography study. When epileptic, these events form part of a seizure and rarely occur as an isolated ictal event. The yield of the electroencephalogram in determining the nature of isolated paroxysmal eye movement episodes has not been reported. We reviewed our experience with video-electroencephalography studies in patients referred for paroxysmal eye movements. Twenty-one cases were analyzed, of which almost half were cognitively normal. All video-electroencephalography studies captured events that were found to be nonepileptic, including 6 records with interictal epileptiform activity. The semiology of the events differed between cognitively impaired individuals, who had more lateral eye deviation episodes, and normal patients, who showed blinking as a major manifestation. In conclusion, video-electroencephalography studies are probably not indicated in infants and young children with paroxysmal eye movements as their sole complaint.

### Noninvasive electromagnetic source imaging of spatiotemporally distributed epileptogenic brain sources [^1143T8dV]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

ICA and component selection

In order to denoise the data and extract the TBF, we applied ICA to our EEG signals. The manner, in which ICA was applied to interictal spikes and ictal signals was different.

The ictal recordings were initially filtered between 1 and 30 Hz to remove high-frequency noise, as well as enormous muscle artifacts which spectrally span broad frequency bands. Ictal dominant frequencies are mainly in the lower frequency range, rarely exceeding 15 Hz. After initial filtering, channels that showed huge movement artifacts (or other high amplitude artifacts) were interpolated with the recordings of the four closest neighboring channels and in rare cases noisy channels were removed (2 patients and up to 4–6 electrodes).

An interval of 10 s prior to seizure onset (where seizure onset time was marked by trained epileptologists), up until seizure termination time, was selected for component analysis in each seizure (in two patients where seizures lasted for more than 2–3 min only the first 2 min were selected). Typically, intervals of 30–90 s were selected for subsequent ICA analysis (which is the typical seizure length in our cohort of patients).

After the intervals were selected for each seizure in every patient, they were fed into the ICA module available in EEGLAB. An independent component decomposition of ictal data using the logistic infomax ICA algorithm was performed, using the EEGLAB toolbox (version 14.1.1b). ICA decomposes the ictal data recoded in EEG into spatially fixed and temporally independent sources.

After components were formed, artifact components such as eye movement or eye blinks which have distinct spatial (high activity in the anterior electrodes) and temporal features (sharp high amplitude spikes at blinking or eye rolling moments), were visually identified and rejected. Movement artifacts demonstrate abnormally invariant wide-frequency activity and occasionally abnormally spatially focused topographical potential scalp maps. These well-known artifacts were rejected to form clean and denoised EEG recordings.

### Paroxysmal eye-head movements in glut1 deficiency syndrome [^116b9hH7]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Patient 3.

A 6-year-old boy experienced, at age 4 months, an episode of abnormal eye movements that his parents likened to "someone following a fly". He had further episodes approximately once per month during the first year of life. The episodes lasted less than 1 minute and occurred towards the end of the day when he was tired. As he became older, he complained of dizziness during the episodes without associated nausea, vomiting, or headaches. The events' frequency gradually decreased, and at age 5 years he had his last episode. He never had clinical seizures. EEGs were normal on 2 occasions.

On examination at age 6 years, head circumference was between the 3rd and 10th percentiles. The patient was restless, distractible, and impulsive, but cooperative and able to follow simple instructions. He had lower limb spasticity and hyperreflexia, mild dysarthria, truncal ataxia, intention tremor, poor coordination, and difficulty carrying out complex motor tasks. The diagnosis of Glut1 deficiency was confirmed by the finding of low CSF glucose concentration, reduced erythrocyte glucose uptake, and SLC2A1 analysis (table 1, patient 3).

Video analysis.

We reviewed home video examples of 18 individual episodes from 10 patients.

The episodes were characterized by frequent movements of the eyes and head. Several features were consistent across all patients. The eye movements were rapid, consistent with saccades, and were followed by epochs of fixation as if they were normal gaze shifts. Movements occurred in multiple directions, were clearly separated in time by intervening periods of fixation, and were often accompanied by a head movement in the same direction (figure 1, videos 1–3). In particular, we never observed 2 eye movements in immediate succession without a brief period of fixation between them.

Figure 1
Eye–head gaze saccades

In each of these 3 gaze shifts, movement of the eyes is followed by a head movement in the same direction. There is a period of fixation between eye movements (total time: 1.8 seconds, interval between frames: 150 ms).

### Vertical conjugate eye deviation in postresuscitation coma [^1178CsBL]. Annals of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Vertical eye deviation in hypoxic coma is considered to be rare. In contrast, we found that in a consecutive series of 50 postresuscitation comatose patients, 28 (56.0%) developed tonic upward or downward eye deviation. We suggest that both the upward and the downward deviations resulted from diffuse cerebrocerebellar damage sparing the brainstem. Upward deviation is an early sign, whereas downward deviation appears later and generally implies a transition to the vegetative state.

### Unusual focal ictal pattern in children with eyelid myoclonia and absences [^116XBk2h]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Eyelid myoclonia is a type of epileptic seizure characterized by marked jerking of the eyelids, often associated with jerky upward deviation of the eyeballs. It can be triggered by eye closure. The ictal electroencephalographic pattern of eyelid myoclonia consists of generalized polyspike waves at 3 to 6 Hz. Eyelid myoclonia can be a component of the clinical seizures seen with idiopathic, symptomatic, or cryptogenic generalized epilepsy. The objective of this study was to describe the unusual focal ictal electroencephalogram features of two patients with developmental delay and eyelid myoclonia. To the best of our knowledge, this unique electroencephalogram finding was not previously described.

### Panayiotopoulos syndrome: epidemiological and clinical characteristics and outcome [^111j6Hau]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to analyse the epidemiological, clinical and evolutional characteristics of Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) in order to facilitate the diagnosis in daily clinical practice. Thirty-seven medical records of patients diagnosed with PS were reviewed and the epidemiological and clinical features, results of complementary studies and evolutional data were collected. Mean age at diagnosis was 5.4 years. Female/male ratio was 2.1. The majority of seizures occurred during sleep (67.2%). They usually begin with autonomic manifestations or vomiting (70.1%). Ictal eye and/or cephalic deviation and progression to partial or generalized convulsions were also quite frequent. EEG showed occipital spikes in 28 patients (75.7%). Besides, 71.3% of recurrences were observed in the first 6 months after diagnosis, and 82.9% of the patients had no seizures beyond 2 years from diagnosis. One patient with an atypical development was recorded. The PS is a relatively frequent epileptic syndrome in paediatric age, especially in pre-school children. Although its semiological sequence is fairly typical, the unspecific clinical and neurological characteristics complicate the diagnostic suspicion. Prognosis is excellent; however, it would be convenient to keep a strict evolutional follow-up in these patients as an atypical evolution might occur.

### Paroxysmal eyelid movements: a confusing feature of generalized photosensitive epilepsy [^111q2N38]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent, frequent, nonepileptic paroxysmal eyelid movements were observed in 19 children and adults with well-controlled generalized epilepsy.

Methods

Patients were identified from five epilepsy centers.

Results

Seventeen patients were female and two male. All had generalized photosensitive epilepsy requiring antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In two children, paroxysmal eyelid movements began 2 to 4 years before their epilepsy was noted; in the remainder, it was noted when epilepsy was first diagnosed. Age at last follow-up was 8 to 38 years (average 21 years) with average follow-up of 9 years. All patients showed photosensitive generalized spike-wave discharges on EEG. Paroxysmal eyelid movements were a source of diagnostic confusion, but direct examination and video during EEG recording distinguished the attacks from absence seizures. In all cases, the epilepsy is completely or nearly completely controlled with AEDs, but the paroxysmal eyelid movements have not resolved with age. In 12 cases, there was a family history of the eyelid disorder without epilepsy. Videos of patients and an affected parent are available on the Neurology Web site.

Conclusion

There is an association between paroxysmal eyelid movements and photosensitive generalized epilepsy, creating diagnostic confusion.

### Micturition-induced seizures: a rare form of reflex epilepsy [^115AQskG]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reflex seizures are referred to as epileptic seizures that are consistently precipitated by a specific sensory stimulus. Reflex seizures induced by micturition are very rare, and few cases have been described.

Methods

This study reports a case of an 11-year-old girl with seizures provoked by micturition with reference made to previously reported cases in the literature. Seizures were characterized by head and eye deviation to the right, flexed dystonic posturing of the left upper limb, extension of the right upper limb, and eventual generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Ictal electroencephalogram revealed clear electrographic evolution from the midcentral region with secondary generalization. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head was normal. Seizures were treated with a combination of lacosamide and clobazam.

Conclusions

A midcentral ictal focus is in keeping with previous reports of this area as a potential epileptogenic center for micturition-induced seizures.

### Functional definition of seizure provides new insight into post-traumatic epileptogenesis [^111iF3hE]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Acquired partial seizures lasting < 5 s on the ECoG are of strong experimental and clinical interest because they have several properties that render them very promising targets for mechanistic, translational and clinical studies of epileptogenesis. First, these short seizures in the rat are clinically relevant since similar acquired focal seizures also occur in humans (Fig. 8). We were able to identify four pharmacoresistant patients who presented with short chronic recurrent spontaneous focal EEEs with electrographic appearance similar to short grade 1 seizures in the rpFPI rat. Similar to what we observed for the neocortical epileptic focus induced by rpFPI (Fig. 2), all short seizures in humans occurred in the same ictal sites as longer complex partial seizures, indicating that the neocortical epileptic focus generates a range of epileptic activities in the human as it does in the rat. In two of these patients (Fig. 8 C and D), these short seizures occurred in motor cortex areas and were associated with a mild stereotyped ictal behaviour (eye blinking or muscle twitching) that, while subtle and easily missed, could be reliably detected by EMG. When similar EEEs occurred distally from the motor cortex (Fig. 8 A and B), as expected, they were not associated with detectable behavioural output. We believe that, depending on the neocortical location of the focus, brief EEEs would probably go unnoticed because of the lack of apparent ictal behaviour. We conclude that short seizures observed in head-injured rats are not a feature of the small rodent brain, but one of genuine epileptic foci. Second, these short partial seizures in the rat, while readily detected by ECoG, are mostly invisible on scalp EEG (Fig. 7), just as most short ECoG seizures are in humans (Cukiert et al; Binnie). By performing simultaneous epidural ECoG and scalp EEG in rpFPI-injured animals we were able to determine that no grade 1 and only ∼38% of grades 2 and 3 seizures were detected by scalp EEG. The onset of ECoG seizures could never be appreciated by the scalp EEG, which only picked up the activity when it had spread to a sufficiently large volume of cortex. Yet, the experimental conditions greatly favoured the detection of short seizures by scalp EEG in the rat compared to the human. Indeed, the rat has a significantly thinner skull and scalp, and the montage employed placed the parietal scalp electrode much closer (∼0.5 cm) to the neocortical focus in the rat than what typically occurs with a standard 10–20 electrode montage in humans (∼2 cm if in a gyrus; ∼5 cm if in a sulcus). Third, rpFPI-induced epilepsy is progressive in both the number of seizures and their duration (D'Ambrosio et al.), and while short EEEs may occur at any time point after rpFPI, they are present in 100% of the animals investigated, most commonly 2–4 weeks post-injury (Fig. 9 A). Thus, these are the earliest and most common markers of PTE that can be identified after head injury in the rat. Therefore, short EEEs constitute a powerful preclinical endpoint for a number of crucial studies. They are the ideal markers to guide the screening for prophylactic treatments of PTE, as all animals present them by week 5 post-rpFPI (Fig. 9). There is no need to wait longer periods post-injury for more severe electrical or behavioural manifestation of PTE to occur in the FPI rat to screen for antiepileptogenic compounds, which will allow for faster and more powered preclinical screening. Drugs that are effective for short seizures could then be tested for their effect at later times post-injury on longer or subcortical seizures, allowing characterization of the effect of drugs on different pro-epileptic mechanisms and anatomical foci. Also, the identification of the earliest frank partial seizures arising after an insult will help address the longstanding question of whether and how 'seizures beget seizures' and cause brain damage (Sutula et al; Cavazos et al; Sutula and Pitkanen; Holmes).

### Gyratory seizures revisited: a video-EEG study [^112Kpxv4]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Gyratory seizures (GSs) have been rarely described in generalized as well as in focal epilepsies. They were defined as a rotation around the body axis during a seizure for at least 180 degrees. The mechanisms of generation are unknown and have been discussed controversially. The aim of this investigation was to further delineate seizure semiology and assess a possible lateralizing and localizing value of GSs.

Methods

The authors screened 277 consecutive patients with intractable epilepsies referred to a University Hospital for presurgical evaluation between 1998 and 2004 for GSs: 169 had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), 47 frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), 38 generalized epilepsies (GE), and 23 had extratemporal or multifocal epilepsy.

Results

Twelve patients showed gyratory movements in 17 seizures. Eight had FLE and four TLE (p < 0.001). In 58% (7/12), the gyratory movement was initiated by a forced versive movement of the head followed by a rotation toward the contralateral side of seizure onset. In 42% (5/12), the gyratory movement was not preceded by a forced head version. In these seizures, the direction of the rotation was toward the side of seizure onset.

Conclusions

The direction of rotation lateralizes seizure onset zone in focal epilepsy depending on the seizure evolution: 1) gyratory seizures (GSs) starting with a forced version of the head ensuing into a body rotation lateralize seizure onset zone contralateral to the direction of rotation. 2) In GSs without a preceding gyratory forced head version, the direction of rotation is toward the side of seizure onset. GSs occur more frequently in frontal lobe epilepsy than temporal lobe epilepsy, while none of our patients with GSs had generalized epilepsies.

### Paroxysmal tonic upward gaze complicating Angelman syndrome [^1113wxTs]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Paroxysmal tonic upward gaze is a childhood oculomotor syndrome characterized by episodes of conjugate upward deviation of the eyes. Its pathogenesis is unknown, and the etiology is heterogeneous.

Patient Description

We describe a 2-year-old girl with Angelman syndrome who developed paroxysmal tonic upward gaze at 9 months of age. She presented with developmental delay, blond hair, jerky movements, ataxia, and epilepsy. Genetic testing revealed a maternal deletion of 15q11–13, confirming Angelman syndrome.

Conclusions

This is the first report of Angelman syndrome complicated by paroxysmal tonic upward gaze. Both transient paroxysmal tonic upward gaze and Angelman syndrome have been associated with dopaminergic neurons. We speculate that the dopaminergic abnormalities present in Angelman syndrome may cause paroxysmal tonic upward gaze.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^116sweur]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) — definition, phenotypes, and manifestations are described as seizure activity seen on electroencephalogram (EEG) without clinical findings associated with GCSE; two distinct phenotypes include the "wandering confused" patient presenting to the emergency department with a relatively good prognosis or chronic epileptic syndromes, and the acutely ill patient with severely impaired mental status with or without subtle motor movements such as rhythmic muscle twitches or tonic eye deviation in the setting of acute brain injury; for these guidelines the focus is on the acutely ill patient with impaired mental status, a type that frequently follows uncontrolled GCSE and is often encountered in the intensive care setting; the semiological spectrum is highly variable with negative symptoms including an increase in confusion, aphasia, lethargy, and staring, and positive symptoms including agitation/aggression, automatisms, blinking, crying, delirium, delusions, echolalia, facial twitching, laughter, nausea/vomiting, nystagmus/eye deviation, perseveration, psychosis, and tremulousness.

### A novel epilepsy phenotype in a young girl with a pathogenicGene variant [^11382UGV]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Her mother described also episodes of blank staring, followed by spreading hypertonia with upward ocular deviation, recurring on a monthly basis, first interpreted as oppositional behaviors in a child with frail emotional regulation. However, episodes increased in frequency, associated with motor phenomena, that is, left head turning and axo-rhizomelic tonic posturing leading to falls. At 4 years of age, we performed prolonged video electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, which revealed abundant posterior spike-and-wave discharges, mainly centered in the right parieto-occipital areas, and independent left centroparietal spikes (Figure 1). We interpreted her paroxysmal disturbances as focal impaired-consciousness seizures and introduced levetiracetam 60 mg/kg/d. However, as behavioral worsening was reported, we switched treatment to valproic acid 30 mg/kg/d. After 14 months, the patient is seizure-free and the EEG normalized. Sporadic temper tantrums are still present, yet her behavioral profile has remarkably improved.

### Diagnostic approach to paediatric movement disorders: a clinical practice guide [^111giW8U]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Phenotype

Step 1. Is it a movement disorder?

The first step is to distinguish normal, physiological developmental motor patterns and pathological movement disorders. Infantile fidgety movements and startles resembling chorea and myoclonus normally disappear around the age of 3 months. 4 Dystonic‐like features may appear from birth and can persist until the age of 16 years. 4 The development of goal‐directed movements (3–6mo) coincides with the occurrence of ataxic‐like features which can persist until the age of 12 years. 4 It may be difficult to distinguish physiological developmental motor patterns from pathological movement disorders. Children should be monitored to evaluate how the movement pattern develops. In general, physiological patterns will subside with typical psychomotor development. Besides developmental features, other neurological diseases (such as epilepsy) may resemble movement disorders.

Step 2. Classify the movement disorder phenotype and which movement disorder is the most prominent

The second step is to classify the movement disorder phenotype and denote which movement disorder is the most prominent. Clinical clues can be used to distinguish between different movement disorder phenotypes. Movement disorders are classified into three major groups: hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders and ataxia. In children, hyperkinetic movement disorders are more prevalent and include tics, dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, stereotypies, and tremor. Hypokinetic movement disorders, including Parkinsonism, are rare in children. Ataxia is not a hypo‐ or hyperkinetic movement disorder, but includes disorganized and poorly executed movements, and is relatively common in children. 5

Hyperkinetic movement disorders

Tics

Tics are defined as sudden, rapid, recurrent, non‐rhythmic movements or vocalizations (Video S1, online supporting information; descriptions of the videos are found in Appendix S1, online supporting information). 6 A distinction is made between motor and phonic tics and each is subdivided as simple or complex. Simple motor tics comprise a single muscle or localized muscle group, such as eye blinking. Complex motor tics involve either a cluster of simple actions or a coordinated sequence of movements. Simple phonic tics include sounds and noises such as humming or sniffing, whereas complex phonic tics comprise the repetition of words, syllables, or phrases. Positive clues are a waxing and waning course, worsening by stress or excitement, the report of a premonitory sensation, and brief voluntary suppressibility followed by a rebound. 1, 7

### CHD2 variants are a risk factor for photosensitivity in epilepsy [^113NLE5A]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Photosensitivity is a heritable abnormal cortical response to flickering light, often manifesting as EEG changes called a photoparoxysmal response. Photoparoxysmal response may occur with seizures, and in normal subjects, or with neuropsychiatric disorders. The photoparoxysmal response is age-dependent: prevalence in healthy children is between 1.4 and 8.3%, dropping to < 1% in adults. Photosensitive epilepsy is a reflex epilepsy, with seizures triggered by visual stimuli. A population-based study in Great Britain determined that the annual incidence of epilepsy with photoparoxysmal response was 1.1 per 100 000 in the overall population, and 5.7 per 100 000 between 7 and 19 years of age. About 40% of people with photosensitive epilepsy only have seizures on exposure to visual stimuli. Photosensitive seizures also feature in specific epilepsy syndromes, with other seizure types, and in non-syndromic epilepsies. Examples include juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, other genetic generalized epilepsies (GGE), idiopathic photosensitive occipital epilepsy, and other focal, symptomatic occipital, and progressive myoclonic, epilepsies. The archetypal photosensitive syndrome is eyelid myoclonia with absences (EMA), a GGE characterized by rapid eyelid jerks and upward eyeball deviation on eye closure: photosensitivity is an essential feature.

A 29-year-old woman presented with a witnessed convulsion, with semiology consistent with a focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizure. Routine EEG supported a syndromic diagnosis of idiopathic generalised epilepsy with photosensitivity. We discuss the clinical utility of seizure semiology, highlighting the caveat that over-reliance or sole reliance on the ictal semiology may result in an erroneous diagnosis of focal epilepsy in someone with a generalised epilepsy.

### Definition and diagnostic criteria of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy [^115x4EDJ]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Seizures are abrupt in onset and offset, typically brief (< 2 minutes), and have a highly stereotyped motor pattern within individuals. The primary clinical expression consists of "hypermotor" events, characterized by vigorous hyperkinetic features (complex body movements with kicking or cycling of limbs and rocking body movements), usually with vegetative signs, vocalization, and emotional facial expression. Asymmetric tonic/dystonic seizures with or without head/eye deviation are also observed.

Seizures may be preceded by abrupt arousal or a distinct aura. Awareness of episodes is not uncommon. Typically, patients with SHE present a series of sleep-related motor events becoming increasingly long and complex, even on the same night. Clinical features range from brusque stereotyped arousals (i.e. paroxysmal arousalor minor motor events), repeated throughout the night or arising intermittently, with an almost periodic pattern, to complex hypermotor seizures as described above and, more seldom, protracted ambulatory behavior known as epileptic nocturnal wandering. These events can last longer than 2 minutes. These different seizure manifestations tend to coincide in the same patient, with the shorter events developing into more prolonged and complex attacks. Patients with SHE may complain of unsatisfactory sleep and daytime tiredness. However, they do not have significantly more daytime sleepiness than controls.

Distinction from arousal parasomnias usually relies on clinical history (frequency, clustering, and timing with respect to sleep onset of the attacks), even though EEG–polysomnography (PSG) may be required in some challenging cases. A personal or familial history of arousal parasomnias is common in patients with SHE, making shared pathophysiologic pathways plausible in these conditions.

The majority of patients have normal intelligence. However, intellectual disability and behavior disorders have been reported in SHE, especially in the familial form related to mutations in KCNT1, and consequently are not exclusion criteria for SHE.

Response to medication has not been systematically investigated. Carbamazepine is effective at low doses in some patients with SHE, but this therapy seems to be ineffective in at least one-third of patients, making the response to antiepileptic drugs not discriminant for SHE diagnosis. Surgery has been found to be effective in some patients with severe, drug-resistant SHE related to focal cortical dysplasia. Suspicion of a genetic cause does not contraindicate presurgical evaluation, although data are still lacking on surgical outcomes in patients with mutations in known genes.

Ezogabine (EZG) — In 3 Class I studies, EZG at 600, 900, or 1,200 mg/d was superior to placebo for median percent seizure reduction and responder rates; treatment-related AEs were dose dependent with dizziness and somnolence most common for discontinuation, and a Class III study found a significantly higher AE rate with titration rates of < 7 days.

Diagnosis

Classic Features

IGE are characterized by GSWDs and absence, myoclonic, or GTCS. The EEG signature of IGE is GSWDs with normal background rhythms. Clinical features of the major IGE syndromes are summarized in Figure 1. Seizures are often triggered by tiredness, stress, and environmental photic stimuli (e.g. driving while the sun flickers through trees).

Diagnostic Challenges

EEG cannot reliably differentiate IGE syndromes. For example, 3.5- to 6-Hz GSWDs alone or with polyspikes occur in juvenile myoclonic, epilepsy with GTCS alone, juvenile absence, and childhood absence epilepsies with similar frequencies. Normal EEGs may be more common in JME than other syndromes.

IGE seizures often have asymmetric and focal clinical and EEG features. Versive head or eye or asymmetric limb movements can occur in GTCS. Absence seizure motor phenomena that suggest focal unaware seizures with automatisms or eyeblinks and myoclonic seizures may be asymmetric or lateralized. EEG may show unilateral lead-in to GSW in generalized-onset seizures (Figure 2). If accompanied by focal slowing on EEG, brain MRI should exclude a potential lesion and IGE-mimic (Figure 2). Asymmetric GSWDs in IGE differ from secondary bilateral synchrony: (1) lead-in of ≤ 2 seconds, (2) focal spike morphology similar to bisynchronous discharges, (3) no multifocal spikes, (4) no focal slowing in focal spike area temporally independent from epileptiform discharges, and (5) no focal neurologic deficits or cognitive deterioration.

Occasionally, patients with normal intellect have focal and generalized epilepsies, such as temporal lobe epilepsy and JME. While IGE are not associated with brain lesions, subtle focal MRI structural and functional anomalies are more frequent in patients with JME and their siblings than controls (e.g. unilateral or bilateral hippocampal malrotation and anomalous cognitive activation).

IGE occur in patients with autism spectrum disorder and other intellectual or psychiatric disabilities, although IGE cohorts may exclude such patients. This artificially "pure IGE" group denies biodiversity, curtailing the mapping of the clinical spectrum, pathophysiologic mechanism, and therapies. For example, pathogenic SCN1a variants exclude a focal or IGE diagnosis. This spectrum, often unrecognized without access to genetic testing, is confidently diagnosed without genetic data but falsely narrowed by a priori assumptions.

### Electrographic monitoring for seizure detection in the neonatal unit: current status and future direction [^117JEu8F]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Identifying and classifying seizures on cEEG

cEEG with video is the gold standard tool that measures the number and duration of seizures, the area of origin and the pattern of migration. The International League Against Epilepsy Task Force defined electrographic seizures as events with a sudden, paroxysmal, and abnormal alteration of activity. Pressler et al.described seizures as an electrographic event with a pattern characterised by sudden, repetitive, evolving stereotyped waveforms with a beginning and end. For the most part the definitions have remained the same but without a specific duration or the amplitude specified.

The majority of infants display repetitive startle type or even jerky movements, tremors, jitteriness or physiological myoclonus which are normal to the newborn but may complicate a diagnosis or seizures. However, these movements will cease with passive flexion, are predominantly tremulous and are not associated with apnoea/desaturations tachycardia or elevated blood pressure. Seizures may be electroclinical or electrographic (subclinical). Seizures may be localised or focal, multifocal, unilateral, or bilateral, asymmetric or symmetric.

Electroclinical seizures have electrographic features accompanied by clinical manifestation. The classification of seizure types is based on their primary clinical characteristics, categorising them into motor, non-motor and unclassified. Pressler et al. describe one category of motor seizures to include (but not limited to): (a) Clonic-type seizures as more readily identified clinically presenting as jerky movements on one or both sides of the body which are regular and involve the same muscle groups. (b) Tonic-type generalised seizures present as an increase in muscle contraction such as extension of the infant's limbs, posturing and clenching of fists. (c) Infants diagnosed with HIE may exhibit less coordinated movements or automatisms such as lip smacking, mouthing, eye deviations or appearance of cycling activity. Other categories of motor seizures include epileptic spasms and myoclonic non-motor seizures include autonomic and behavioural arrest.

### Rolling in the deep: surface EEG seizures viewed through the lens of stereo EEG [^114eTsTu]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

These methodological considerations notwithstanding, this study highlights the value of concurrent scalp-intracranial EEG in the presurgical evaluation of patients with DRE. At the same time, it acknowledges that scalp EEG is not flawless and that careful integration of semiological and radiological information is needed to define a cogent hypothesis about the epileptogenic zone. Prior simultaneous surface-intracerebral EEG comparison have corroborated that scalp EEG detects stereo EEG seizures only 1/3 of the time when they are focal aware or subclinical, particularly if their duration is brief. Due to high skull resistivity and because of the distance between the cortical source and the sensors, scalp EEG seizure patterns are often overshadowed by background EEG activity or artifacts. The extent of the cortical area engaged in the ictal discharge, as well as the topography and geometry of the cortical generator have been each independently linked to the seizure recording with scalp electrodes. Unsurprisingly, scalp EEG is a poor spatial localizer and even lateralizer. No ictal scalp pattern corresponds to a specific intracerebral pattern. Contrary to the current study that showed a brief lag between the scalp and the stereo EEG recorded seizures, prior studies showed a mean delay of 14 seconds. As a result, ictal signs appeared on average with a lag of 14 seconds after scalp EEG onsets, while that time was nearly doubled for stereo EEG onsets. The presence of an insufficient electrographic latency or discordant location and EEG pattern between scalp and stereo EEG recordings was associated with a lower chance of successfully detecting the seizure onset zone.

### Paroxysmal eye-head movements in glut1 deficiency syndrome [^112PS59r]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

None of the patients lost consciousness during their episodes. In 3 patients there was a questionable alteration of alertness described as "relatively unresponsive", "zoned out", or "detached".

Event duration was typically brief (< 5 minutes in 9 patients and < 1 minute in 4). One patient experienced rare episodes lasting up to 1 hour. Episode frequency was variable, ranging from 1 or 2 episodes in 2 patients to 10 episodes per day in 1 patient. Among patients for whom the long-term course of eye movement episodes was documented (n = 8), the episodes disappeared between 3 and 6 years of age in 7 patients, and were still present at age 8 years in 1 patient (table 2).

Potential precipitating factors reported by parents included fatigue, hunger, excitement, and being placed on the back. Feeding was reported to be a possible ameliorating factor in 1 patient.

In 5 patients, episodes were captured during continuous EEG monitoring and had no EEG correlate. In 6 further patients, an EEG was performed around the time of the occurrence of the abnormal eye movements. Epileptiform discharges were detected in only 1 patient, with no clinical correlate.

Improvement in eye movement episodes following initiation of the KD was documented in 2 patients. Episodes had resolved spontaneously prior to initiation of the diet in 3 patients, and in other cases, the response of these episodes to the diet was not specifically documented. Six patients were treated with antiepileptic medications: in 1 patient, the episodes improved, in 3 the response was unclear, and in 2 there was no benefit.

Sixteen patients in our cohort of 18 had seizures. Of those, 10 of 16 patients experienced eye movement episodes before their first seizure. The latency from onset of eye movements to first seizure ranged from 1 to 21 months (table 1) in those 10 patients.

### Oculogyric crisis in a patient taking metoclopramide [^114ncTWE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute dystonic reactions include contractions of the muscles, especially in the facial, trapezius, and dorsal levator scapulae and rhomboid muscles; opisthotonus; torticollis; dysarthria; trismus; and oculogyric crisis. Oculogyric crisis is characterized by a temporary period of frequent spasms of eye deviation, particularly upward, each spasm lasting from seconds to hours and the entire episode lasting from days to weeks. The spasm may be preceded or accompanied by disturbing emotional symptoms, including anxiety, restlessness, compulsive thinking, sensations of increased brightness, or distortions of visual background. Although oculogyric crisis usually occurs as a side effect of drugs, it can be seen in patients with postencephalitic parkinsonism, brainstem encephalitis, Wilson's disease, and cystic glioma, for whom the onset of the crisis is positional.–Versive seizures, paroxysmal tonic upward gaze, eye movement tics, and retinal disease must also be excluded from the differential diagnosis. Epilepsy can manifest as oculogyric seizures, also called versive seizures. Wyllie et al defined versive seizures as clonic or tonic head and eye deviations, unquestionably forced and involuntary, resulting in sustained unnatural positioning of the head and eyes. Versive seizures with upgaze deviation can simulate oculogyric crises, but they are associated with an alteration of consciousness and electroencephalogram abnormalities. Paroxysmal tonic upward gaze is characterized by infantile or early childhood onset, with episodes of sustained conjugate upward deviation of the eyes. It can be distinguished from oculogyric crisis by the presence of neck flexion and concomitant episodic ataxia. Eye movement tics in children are seen between the ages of 6 and 12 years and are characterized by a stereotyped conjugate deviation of the eyes upward and outward. Oculogyric crisis is more sustained than eye movement tics. In our case, neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations and vitals were normal. The results of complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, and electrolytes were within normal values. Based on the history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of metoclopramide-induced dystonia was made.

### Functional definition of seizure provides new insight into post-traumatic epileptogenesis [^115NWay6]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Brief focal seizures in humans

We present four clinical cases with brief (< 2 s) seizures observed during intracranial recordings (Fig. 8; Table 1). During evaluation for the neurosurgical treatment of their pharmacoresistant epilepsy all four patients manifested typical complex partial seizures lasting ∼1 min. However, invasive monitoring revealed the occurrence of brief seizures in the same ictal sites. The details are as follows:

Figure 8
Short recurrent spontaneous focal seizures in the human. Representative examples of short seizures lasting 1–2 s are presented from four pharmacoresistant patients evaluated for resective surgery. For aetiology and clinical history of patients see Table 1 (Patients 1–4 correspond to panels A – D, respectively). In all patients longer complex partial seizures with secondary generalization were recorded originating from the same electrodes, and with identical electrographic onset patterns, as observed in the corresponding short seizures presented. In Patients 1 and 2, who presented with ictal sites in the frontal lobe (A and B), the brief electrographic seizures were not detected clinically, while longer and spreading complex partial seizures were. In Patients 3 and 4, who presented with ictal sites in the sensori-motor and motor cortex (C and D), EMG revealed the occurrence of simultaneous ictal behaviour during the short seizures. Note the skin electrode traces present the evidence of eye blinking (C) and muscle contraction (D) during the EEEs (vertical dotted lines). Lateral X-ray images of patient's skulls after electrode placement are shown for all patients (A1, B1, C1 and D1). ECoG sites and labels are shown in the schematic diagrams (A2, B2, C2 and D2–3). ECoG is presented with referential montage in A, C and D, and bipolar montage in B. The voltage scales refer to ECoG electrodes only and not EMG. EMG electrodes were placed on the face lateral to the right eye in Patient 3 (C), and on the surface of the skin overlying the left pectoralis muscle in Patient 4 (D). Asterisk marks one of the cardiac signals detected by the skin electrode. In the schematic diagrams, grey circles show electrodes not involved with seizure onset. Crossed-out circles show inactive electrodes not displayed. Red circles show electrodes proximal to seizure onset. Yellow circles show areas of direct electrographic seizure spread. The labels on schematics match the labels on the corticographic tracings: g: grid; sA: strip A; sB: strip B; sC: strip C; sD: strip D. Numbers within the grids and next to the strips define their orientation. The recording montage covered most of the left (Patients 1, 2 and 3; panels A, B and C) or right (Patient 4; panel D) lateral perisylvian neocortex.

### POLG1 mutations cause a syndromic epilepsy with occipital lobe predilection [^1111MRBv]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

The epileptic semiology of 19 patients (from 15 families) with mitochondrial disease due to mutations in the POLG1 gene is presented. The patients were either homozygous for the 1399G > A (p. A467T) or 2243G > C (p.W748S) mutations or compound heterozygotes for these two mutations. While the clinical features have been reviewed, detailed analysis of their epilepsy is presented for the first time. Irrespective of genotype, patients developed an epileptic syndrome with initial features of occipital lobe epilepsy. Occipital seizure phenomena included flickering coloured light, sometimes persisting for weeks, months or even years, ictal visual loss, horizontal/vertical nystagmus or oculoclonus, dysmorphopsia, micro-/macropsia and palinopsia. Most patients developed simple partial seizure phenomena with motor symptoms suggesting frontal lobe seizure initiation or spread. Simple and complex partial seizures, clonic- and/or myoclonic seizures with epilepsia partialis continua and frequent convulsive status epilepticus were observed in this syndrome that appears to be a symptomatic and secondary generalized or multifocal epilepsy with focal occipital predilection. The mean age of seizure presentation was 18.4 years (6–58 years). All patients developed status epilepticus and 11 patient deaths were, all related to prolonged convulsive status epilepticus, including two with liver failure apparently precipitated by treatment with sodium valproate.

### Peripheral and central eye movement disorders [^1118yE6k]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Continuing advances have rendered the neural control of eye movements one of the best understood motor systems, from molecules to complex behaviors. Nevertheless, new discoveries have required re-evaluation of established concepts, from the genetics of disorders that affect extraocular muscles to the way in which the cerebral cortex governs behaviors that encompass several functional classes of eye movements.

### Unusual side effects of lamotrigine therapy [^113nmiin]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

An 8-year-old boy developed tremor, unsteadiness, chorea, and eye movement abnormalities on starting lamotrigine for myoclonic jerks. Investigations for a neurodegenerative disorder were negative. Symptoms and signs resolved on stopping lamotrigine. He was well and asymptomatic on follow-up after 4 years. Another 7-year-old boy who started on lamotrigine for suspected absence seizures developed abnormalities of eye movement with associated cognitive decline, which also resolved on discontinuing the medication. Eye movement abnormalities, involuntary movements, and behavioral changes appear to be unusual side effects of lamotrigine therapy.

### Pearls&Oy-sters:-related paroxysmal tonic upgaze with ataxia responsive to acetazolamide [^112PNerW]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

A 9-month-old male infant was evaluated for sudden onset of paroxysmal episodes of forced, conjugate upward eye deviation. Extensive in-hospital evaluation including electrophysiology and neuroimaging studies were reassuring against seizures or a structural abnormality. Given the clinical presentation of sudden onset intermittent upward eye deviations, downbeating saccades, associated ataxia, and typical development, a clinical diagnosis of paroxysmal tonic upgaze (PTU) with ataxia was made. Targeted genetic testing of CACNA1A was performed, which revealed a variant of undetermined significance, which was later classified as a de novo pathogenic variant after protein modeling and parental testing performed. Off-label use of oral acetazolamide was prescribed, which led to dose-responsive decrease in the frequency and intensity of eye movement episodes. After 6 months of episode freedom at 2 years of age, acetazolamide was discontinued without return of episodes. Neurodevelopmental assessments revealed continued typical development. This case is presented to describe the diagnostic formulation, etiologic evaluation, and symptomatic treatment of CACNA1A -related PTU with ataxia.

### Magnetoencephalographic analysis in a case of early-onset benign childhood occipital seizures [^116EBZA2]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

We report a 12-year-old boy who had one seizure comprising deviation of the eyes followed by impairment of consciousness for 30 minutes at the age of 6 years. No visual hallucination or ictal vomiting was observed. Interictal electroencephalography showed repetitive spikes and spike-wave discharges over the left occipital lobe. Magnetoencephalography revealed that the estimated dipoles were clustered in the left cuneus on magnetic resonance imaging, which corresponded to the area of peripheral vision and the associated visual cortex but not to the central visual cortex. Magnetoencephalography is advantageous for determining the electrophysiologic mechanism of early-onset benign childhood occipital seizures.

### Paroxysmal eye-head movements in glut1 deficiency syndrome [^112tYHAW]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

Video analysis.

Home videos from 10 patients were independently reviewed by 2 pediatric neurologists (T.S.P. R.P.) and a pediatric neuro-ophthalmologist (S. A.K.) who generated a consensus description of eye movement findings. We then performed quantitative video analysis on a subset of videos to characterize the time course of eye movements. For this purpose, we selected 30- to 60-second excerpts from 4 episodes from 4 patients, in which the eyes and head were clearly visible in close-up, and used frame-by-frame analysis to manually mark the time of onset of each eye movement (video frame rate: 30 frames per second for 3 videos, 13 frames per second for 1 video).

Retrospective medical record review.

Medical records of 101 patients with confirmed Glut1 DS who were evaluated at Columbia University Medical Center between 1989 and 2014 were screened for paroxysmal abnormal eye movements. For all patients who had experienced one or more paroxysmal eye movement events, the following data related to events were analyzed: (1) age at onset, (2) direction and alignment of eye movements, (3) velocity, (4) duration, (5) level of alertness, (6) associated head movements, (7) EEG correlation, (8) frequency, (9) time course, (10) age at resolution, (11) precipitating factors, and (12) relieving factors. Response to the KD or to antiepileptic medication was assessed when applicable.

Abnormal eye movements associated with loss of consciousness, apnea, head drop, or abnormal focal or generalized myoclonic, tonic, or clonic movements were excluded. Episodes described as eye flutter without further characterization were also excluded.

### A splicing variation in NPRL2 causing familial focal epilepsy with variable foci: additional cases and literature review [^113qWJG4]. Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 7-month-old male infant was born after an uneventful full-term pregnancy. He had multiple unprovoked seizures 4 days after birth, predominantly focal seizures or focal to generalized tonic–clonic seizures in semiology. The seizures occurred six times a day, most of which lasted 10 s and exhibited no diurnal differences. He developed spastic seizures when he was 1 month old. He was unable to roll over upon admission at 4 months of age with generalized hypotonia evident on the right side. There were no neurocutaneous markers, specific facial features, or any other systemic abnormalities. His occipitofrontal head circumference was 42.5 cm. A diagnosis of developmental epileptic encephalopathy was considered. Interictal EEG demonstrated frequent sharp and slow waves in the left frontal and central regions (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Ictal EEG demonstrated the typical findings of epileptic spasms (Supplementary Fig. 2b–d). Brain CT, blood glucose, and electrolyte levels were normal. There were no abnormalities in the initial screening for infection or in the blood and urine metabolic screening. In addition, the auditory brainstem response and visual evoked potential tests were negative. His seizures were effectively controlled by a large dose of vitamin B6 (50 mg/kg/d*2 weeks) and topiramate (8 mg/kg/d). Since the seizures free were acquired, the parents refused the treatment of adrenocorticotropic hormone. However, he still exhibited a failure to thrive, and his development was delayed and stagnant. At his latest follow-up at 7 months of age, he was seizure-free and sustained on a combination of topiramate (8 mg/kg/d) and vitamin B6 (10 mg bid) therapy. He had moderate developmental delay, with a Gesell Developmental Scale score of 45. He could lift his neck at 3 months of age and roll over at 5 months of age. However, he will not sit alone or take the initiative to grasp at 7 months old. Repeated EEG monitoring showed improvement in epileptiform discharge with intermittent sharp and slow waves in the left frontal and central regions. Head MRI showed no obvious signal abnormalities (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). Interictal arterial spin labeling (ASL)-MRI showed relative hypoperfusion in the cortex of the left frontal and parietal regions (Supplementary Fig. 1g–j). His mother had an intellectual disability (WISC Scale score of 53). Her head MRI was normal (Supplementary Fig. 1d–f), while her ASL-MRI showed relative hypoperfusion in the left frontal and temporal lobes (Supplementary Fig. 1k–n). Her EEG showed occasional sharp and slow waves in the left frontal regions (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). Both the patient's mother and grandfather had a history of febrile seizures in childhood.
