## Question

Patella normal position

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the normal position of the patella, including how it is defined, measured, and interpreted across imaging modalities and clinical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomical and biomechanical context of patellar position. Then, I should verify the standard radiographic indices and their normal ranges. Next, I will examine femur-based indices and dynamic engagement concepts. After that, I need to check how modality and limb position affect measurements. Then, I will correlate patellar height with patellofemoral mechanics and pathology. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically usable definition and note exceptions and special populations, anchoring on consensus and high-quality reviews where possible.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical frame of reference. The patella is a sesamoid within the quadriceps tendon that articulates with the femoral trochlea; its vertical position is typically described relative to the femur (patella alta/baja) or to the tibia (Insall-Salvati, Caton-Deschamps), and its axial position is described by medial-lateral translation and tilt within the trochlear groove, with the medial patellofemoral ligament providing primary static restraint to lateral displacement in early flexion [^3ff22484] [^ce8b42c3].

> I need to verify the classic tibia-based indices and their accepted normal ranges. The Insall-Salvati ratio (patellar tendon length divided by patellar diagonal length) is commonly used on lateral radiographs or sagittal MRI; a ratio around 1.0 is typical, with patella alta often defined as greater than 1.2 and patella baja as less than 0.8, though thresholds vary by source and modality, and the ratio is sensitive to patellar shape and tendon integrity [^c2c1b6d8] [^aa183135]. The Caton-Deschamps index (distance from inferior patellar articular margin to tibial plateau divided by patellar articular length) uses a threshold of about 1.2 to define alta, with normal values commonly cited between 0.6 and 1.3; it is less affected by tendon length changes and is often preferred when assessing patellar height before or after tibial tubercle procedures [^c2c1b6d8] [^c15ac755]. The Blackburne-Peel index uses the tibial plateau as a reference and similarly employs a threshold near 1.0–1.2 for alta, though it can be influenced by joint line position and is less robust across varying flexion angles [^c2c1b6d8] [^cb4b1c76].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which index is "best". I should confirm the limitations. Insall-Salvati can misclassify patellar height when the patella is dysplastic or the tendon is abnormal, and it does not reflect engagement with the trochlea; Caton-Deschamps avoids tendon-length confounding but still references the tibia rather than the femur, which matters when the joint line is altered or when we want to assess functional patellofemoral engagement [^c2c1b6d8] [^c15ac755]. Let me reconsider the clinical implication: femur-based indices may better capture the functional relationship of the patella to the trochlea, especially in instability or postoperative contexts [^c15ac755].

> Next, I should review femur-based indices that reflect trochlear engagement. The patellotrochlear index (PTI) on midsagittal MRI is the ratio of trochlear cartilage engaged by the patella to patellar cartilage length; values below about 12.5% suggest patella alta and impaired early engagement, which is mechanistically linked to instability and cartilage overload in early flexion [^c2c1b6d8]. The SP-ET index (distance from the superior patellar pole to the entrance of the femoral trochlea divided by patellar articular length) correlates with patella alta and has shown better discrimination than Insall-Salvati for patellar cartilage lesions in some cohorts, though it requires standardized MRI protocols and careful slice selection [^d053bcfb] [^ab5daf66]. Let me verify the engagement concept: the patella should engage the trochlea by about 30° of flexion; delayed engagement in patella alta increases lateral translation and tilt and reduces contact area, predisposing to instability and cartilage injury [^c250dcfe] [^cfeb4419].

> I will now examine dynamic and positional factors that modify "normal". Wait, let me verify the effect of weight-bearing and quadriceps activation. Under load, the patella tends to sit more laterally and tilt more in early flexion, and measurements of patellar height and alignment can differ between weight-bearing and non–weight-bearing states; thus, standardized limb position and awareness of load state are critical when comparing values or planning surgery [^2a8f1a06] [^376071dd]. Dynamic MRI and CT studies show that normal knees can exhibit mild lateral tilt or subluxation near full extension, with the patella centering as flexion increases, reinforcing the need to interpret static measurements in the context of the flexion angle and load [^c3abdc15] [^2b69e490].

> Let me think about the clinical consequences of abnormal height. Patella alta is associated with increased lateral patellar displacement and tilt, reduced patellofemoral contact area, and higher cartilage stress, particularly in early flexion; these mechanical changes correlate with instability and cartilage lesions, although symptoms are multifactorial and not solely determined by height [^cfeb4419] [^6c4d5c8a]. Conversely, patella baja can increase patellofemoral contact pressures and limit flexion, contributing to pain and crepitus, especially after TKA or extensor mechanism scarring; distinguishing true patella baja from pseudo–patella baja due to a raised joint line is essential for management [^cb4b1c76].

> I should double-check special populations and exceptions. In children and adolescents, patellar height varies with age and ossification; the Caton-Deschamps index decreases as the patella ossifies proximally, so age-specific norms are necessary to avoid overcalling alta in skeletally immature patients [^ed108697]. In prosthetic knees, tibia-based indices can be misleading if the joint line is elevated; femur-based engagement metrics or careful clinical correlation are preferred to avoid mislabeling pseudo–patella baja as true patella baja [^cb4b1c76].

> Let me synthesize a clinically usable definition of "normal patellar position". Normal patellar height, on a standardized lateral radiograph or sagittal MRI, corresponds to an Insall-Salvati ratio around 1.0 (commonly 0.8–1.2), a Caton-Deschamps index around 0.6–1.3, and a patellotrochlear index above roughly 12.5%, with the caveat that these ranges depend on modality, flexion angle, and population; critically, the patella should engage the trochlea by about 30° of flexion, and under physiologic load the patella may sit slightly lateral and tilted in extension but should center with flexion [^c2c1b6d8] [^c250dcfe] [^c3abdc15]. I need to ensure I emphasize that no single index is universally superior; the choice should match the clinical question, surgical context, and imaging protocol, and discordant results warrant reassessment of technique or alternative indices [^c15ac755].

> Finally, I should confirm practical implications for imaging and decision-making. For suspected instability or preoperative planning, obtain standardized lateral radiographs and consider MRI to assess engagement and cartilage; if axial alignment is questioned, weight-bearing CT can improve assessment of TT-TG and dynamic malalignment, and 3D modeling can aid in complex trochlear dysplasia or revision scenarios [^c250dcfe] [^376071dd] [^aa9eea54]. Hold on, I should verify one more thing: always interpret patellar height alongside trochlear morphology, limb alignment, and soft-tissue restraints, because isolated height abnormalities may be insufficient to explain symptoms or guide treatment, and overtreatment based on a single index can lead to complications [^ce8b42c3] [^c15ac755].

---

The normal patellar position is defined by **midline alignment** with the femoral trochlea, **equal medial-lateral facets**, and **engagement by 30° of flexion**. On lateral radiographs, the Insall-Salvati ratio is 0.8–1.2, and the Caton-Deschamps ratio is 0.6–1.3. On MRI, the patellotrochlear index is ≥ 12.5%, indicating adequate trochlear engagement. The patella should track centrally without lateral tilt or subluxation, and the Q-angle is typically 10–15° in men and 15–20° in women. Deviations such as patella alta, patella baja, lateral tilt, or subluxation indicate malalignment and increase the risk of instability and cartilage damage [^c2c1b6d8] [^c250dcfe] [^c081dddb].

---

## Anatomical and biomechanical basis of normal patellar position

The patella is a **sesamoid bone** embedded in the quadriceps tendon, articulating with the femoral trochlea to form the patellofemoral joint. Normal patellar position and tracking are maintained by a balance of static and dynamic stabilizers:

- **Static stabilizers**: Medial and lateral retinacula, medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), patellotibial ligament, and trochlear groove geometry.
- **Dynamic stabilizers**: Quadriceps muscles, particularly the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO), and hip abductors/external rotators.

Normal patellar tracking involves **medial translation in early flexion** and lateral translation in deeper flexion, with the patella engaging the trochlea by approximately 30° of knee flexion [^c250dcfe] [^c3abdc15].

---

## Radiographic indices for normal patellar position

Several radiographic indices are used to assess patellar height and position:

| **Index** | **Normal range** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Insall-Salvati ratio | 0.8–1.2 | Ratio of patellar tendon length to patellar length on lateral radiograph [^c2c1b6d8] |
| Caton-Deschamps ratio | 0.6–1.3 | Ratio of distance from inferior patellar pole to tibial plateau to patellar articular length [^c2c1b6d8] |
| Blackburne-Peel ratio | 0.5–1.0 | Ratio of distance from inferior patellar pole to tibial plateau to patellar length [^notfound] |

---

These indices help identify **patella alta** (high-riding patella) and **patella baja** (low-riding patella), which are associated with patellofemoral instability and osteoarthritis, respectively [^c2c1b6d8] [^cfeb4419].

---

## MRI-based assessment of normal patellar position

MRI provides **detailed evaluation** of patellar position, cartilage, and soft tissues. Key MRI parameters include:

- **Patellotrochlear index (PTI)**: Ratio of trochlear cartilage engaged by the patella to patellar cartilage length. Normal PTI is ≥ 12.5%, indicating adequate trochlear engagement [^c2c1b6d8].
- **Patellar tilt angle**: Angle between the patellar axis and posterior condylar line. Normal tilt is < 5°.
- **Bisect offset**: Percentage of patella lateral to the trochlear groove. Normal bisect offset is < 62.5% [^notfound].

MRI is particularly useful for assessing **cartilage integrity**, **soft tissue injuries**, and **dynamic patellar tracking** during knee motion [^c250dcfe].

---

## Clinical assessment of normal patellar position

Clinical evaluation of patellar position includes:

- **Observation**: Midline alignment of the patella with the femoral trochlea.
- **Palpation**: Equal prominence of medial and lateral facets.
- **Dynamic assessment**: No lateral deviation or tilt during flexion-extension movements.
- **Q-angle measurement**: Normal Q-angle is 10–15° in males and 15–20° in females [^c081dddb].

---

## Factors influencing normal patellar position

Several factors influence **normal patellar position and tracking**:

- **Trochlear morphology**: Depth and symmetry of the trochlear groove significantly affect patellar stability [^77c07536].
- **Lower limb alignment**: Valgus alignment, femoral anteversion, and tibial torsion can predispose to lateral patellar maltracking [^48ef3104].
- **Muscle strength and balance**: Quadriceps strength, particularly the VMO, and hip abductor strength are critical for maintaining patellar stability [^c081dddb].
- **Age and sex**: Patellar instability is more common in adolescents and females, likely due to hormonal and anatomical factors [^88363c5c].

---

## Consequences of abnormal patellar position

Abnormal patellar position, such as patella alta, patella baja, lateral tilt, or subluxation, can lead to:

- **Patellofemoral instability**: Increased risk of dislocation and recurrent instability [^48ef3104].
- **Cartilage damage**: Abnormal contact stresses can cause chondromalacia and osteoarthritis [^317813b0].
- **Anterior knee pain**: Commonly associated with maltracking and instability [^c081dddb].

---

## Summary of normal patellar position

In summary, the normal patellar position is characterized by:

- **Midline alignment** with the femoral trochlea.
- **Equal medial-lateral facets**.
- **Engagement by 30° of knee flexion**.
- **Insall-Salvati ratio 0.8–1.2** and **Caton-Deschamps ratio 0.6–1.3** on radiographs.
- **Patellotrochlear index ≥ 12.5%** on MRI.
- **Q-angle 10–15° in males and 15–20° in females**.

Understanding and accurately assessing normal patellar position is essential for diagnosing and managing patellofemoral disorders, preventing instability, and preserving joint function.

### Patella baja after total knee arthroplasty: is it really patella baja? [^cb4b1c76]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2002). Low credibility.

In the prosthetic knee, narrowing of the space between the patella and the tibial polyethylene can be due to distal positioning of the patella or to a proximal transfer of the joint line. In the former case, one is dealing with patella baja. In the latter case, the patella is in its normal position relative to the femur, a situation we call pseudo-patella baja. The therapeutic options for patella baja and pseudo-patella baja are different because the former is due to a short patellar tendon, and the latter is due to a raised joint line. Eversion of the extensor mechanism during revision surgery may be more challenging with true patella baja compared with pseudo-patella baja. It is important not to attempt to detect true patella baja with either the Blackburne-Peel or the Caton-Deschamps ratio in the setting of a prosthetic knee because these ratios are affected adversely by the position of the joint line.

### Measurement of patellar tracking: assessment and analysis of the literature [^c99f19bc]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

Patellar tracking is defined as the motion of the patella relative to the femur or femoral groove on knee flexion and extension. Abnormalities of tracking (maltracking) are thought to relate to many disorders of the patellofemoral joint and may be defined easily or may be extremely difficult to observe. Accurate measurement of patellar tracking, and definition of normal tracking, have not been achieved yet in experimental conditions or in clinical conditions. Such information would be valuable in the diagnosis and treatment of patellofemoral disorders. In the current report, the literature is reviewed critically with an emphasis on methodology and results. The reporting of patellar tracking is affected significantly by basic definitions of coordinate systems and reference points. The method of muscle loading, range, and direction of knee motion, use of static or dynamic measurement techniques, and tibial rotation also will affect the results obtained. The accuracy of the equipment used is important as differences in tracking may be small. Comparison between existing studies is difficult because of differences in methodology. There is general agreement that the patella translates medially in early knee flexion and then translates laterally. Regarding patellar tilt, results are less consistent, especially in vivo and the results for patellar rotation are highly variable.

### Is the clinician's eye a valid and reproducible tool for diagnosing patella alta on a lateral knee radiography? [^1acf68ef]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Patella alta (PA) or high-riding patella refers to a condition where the position of the patella is high in relation to the femur, femoral trochlea, or tibia, determined on a lateral radiography (radiograph). It may be present in the acute setting after patellar tendon ruptures, as a normal condition in asymptomatic patients or result in anterior knee pain after recurrent patellar dislocations, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and chondromalacia patellae.

More than 10 radiographic ratios have been described to estimate patellar height on a lateral knee radiograph. Direct measures are those ratios that estimate patellar height in relation to the femur, whereas indirect measures assess patellar height in relation to the tibia. The indirect more frequently used ratios are the Insall-Salvati (IS), modified Insall-Salvati (mIS), and Caton-Deschamps (C-D), but the literature is not clear to determine which method is considered the benchmark for diagnosis of PA. A wide range of definitions, measurements and cutoff values, anatomic variants, and nonstandardized radiographic protocols makes it difficult to define which ratio is more precise. This in addition to the fact that most of these measurements are time consuming. Knee surgeons and radiologists frequently use their clinician's eye (CE) as a subjective visual appreciation to rule out PA before objectively measuring the patellar height. This method has not been reported nor compared with other conventional radiographic ratios (CRRs), and therefore, its validity and reproducibility are unknown in the literature.

### Axial knee radiographs: consistency across clinic sites [^15037542]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

(1) Do radiographic protocols for knee axial images vary across different clinic locations? (2) Does variability between radiographic positioning protocols (knee flexion angle, beam positioning) yield different radiographic measurements that could influence clinical assumptions?

Methods

Radiographic positioning, including beam angle and knee flexion, was measured using a photograph taken of a phantom leg and (human) model set-up. An axial radiograph of a phantom leg was taken at seven different outpatients musculoskeletal clinics to assess patella position (lateral tilt/translation). The phantom leg patella was placed in an abnormal position for the radiographic image across all sites.

Results

Knee flexion < 30° was less accurate in obtaining requested knee flexion than higher knee flexion angles (phantom limb error averaged 6°, range 4°-7° human model error averaged 15°, range 11°-25°). Of the five sites utilizing a 'Merchants' axial radiographs, the congruence angle varied from +12° to +29°, being normal at one site (+12°) and abnormal (> +16°) at three sites, and negative at one site (-15°).

Conclusions

Radiographic protocols for knee axial imaging are inconsistent in radiographic positioning and imaging. This variability can lead to disparity in radiographic image results used for clinical decision-making. Standardization of radiographic positioning would yield more consistent imaging of patella position in early flexion, increasing clinical utility and accuracy.

### Applied biomechanics of the patella [^745018f3]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Although numerous prominent orthopaedists of the twentieth century considered the patella to be useless, even detrimental, it now is clear that the patella serves an important biomechanical function. It is a complex lever that magnifies the moment arm of the extensor mechanism. The patellofemoral contact area (the fulcrum of the lever) shifts along a proximodistal axis through the knee's arc of motion. As the knee flexes, the force within the patellar tendon diminishes relative to that of the quadriceps tendon. One's interpretation of patellar tracking is dependent on the choice of coordinates. When assessing tracking by way of anatomic coordinates, patellas are seen to be slightly lateralized at 0 degrees flexion and to follow similar paths down the trochlea. The tracking pattern is the result of an elaborate interplay between the quadriceps muscles, patellofemoral ligaments, the geometry of the trochlea, and the quadriceps angle. The articular cartilage of the patella is the thickest in the human body and does not follow the contour of the subchondral bone. Patellar cartilage is softer and more permeable than that of the trochlea. It is insensate. In size, nature, and number, the facets of the patellar articulation vary from person to person.

### Editorial commentary: radiographic quantification of patellar alta may reference patellar position relative to the tibia or to the femur [^0c17f96f]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of etiologic factors for the knee with patellar instability is important to construct an effective treatment strategy for each patient. Among the multiple risk factors for patellar instability, patella alta has been regarded as one of the principal morphologic abnormalities affecting bony constraint on excessive patellar motion. Although a number of radiographic measurement methods for patellar height have been proposed and tested for the reliability and diagnostic accuracy in the literature, consensus has not been reached on the optimal method of image assessment. The patella-posterior turning point of the distal femur (P-PTP) distance is an innovative indicator for quantifying patella alta. Conventional methods for quantifying patella alta measure the distance between the patella and the tibia. In contrast, P-PTP references the patellar height measurement to the femur. A challenge is that P-PTP requires imaging a supine patient in full knee extension.

### The influence of tibial and femoral rotation on patellofemoral contact area and pressure [^32e599e6]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Fixed rotation of either the femur or tibia has a significant influence on the patellofemoral joint contact areas and pressures. This is due to the anatomic asymmetry in the knee with respect to all planes, as well as the laterally directed force vector that naturally exists in bipedal lower-limb biomechanics. Specifically, femoral rotation results in an increase in patellofemoral contact pressures on the contralateral facets of the patella, and tibial rotation results in an increase in patellofemoral contact pressures on the ipsilateral facets of the patella. This difference can be elucidated when one considers that rotation of the femur is biomechanically different than rotation of the tibia. For both tibial and femoral rotations, the patella's distal attachment to the tibial tubercle influences the direction of patellar movement. The biomechanical evidence reviewed in this manuscript suggests that the determining factor in patellofemoral pathology is the derangement of normal joint mechanics. However, despite considerable experimental data supporting this position, there also are theories that suggest otherwise. This illustrates a very important point in patellofemoral joint pathology, where no one factor may be the sole defining etiology. Instead, the patellofemoral joint is one of the most complex diarthrodial joints in the body and there are a number of etiologic factors that can lead to pathology. This should be considered for developing repair and rehabilitation strategies.

### Management of first-time patellar dislocation: the ESSKA 2024 formal consensus-part 1 [^26842f60]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

(6) What is the minimum imaging protocol after FTPD to be performed in every case?

In the acute phase after FTPD, plain radiographs (AP, lateral and axial) and MRI, or MRI alone (if accessible immediately), are the required minimum imaging protocol, to be performed as soon as available. In the chronic phase, precise plain X‐rays (AP, true lateral in 30° flexion and axial) and MRI, or MRI alone, should be performed. However, a clinician might identify an exception in an asymptomatic patient presenting relatively late after the incident with a normal clinical knee examination. Grade: D and rating: median 9 (range: 5–9). Relative agreement.

(7) Which radiologic parameters have to be assessed?

Depending on clinical presentation, the radiological parameters to be measured include patellar height, patellotrochlear overlap, trochlear geometry, and axial alignment (tibial tubercle position and knee rotation). Depending on clinical findings on coronal and rotational alignment, additional imaging evaluations may be necessary. There is currently no consensus on clear cut‐off values for these parameters. Grade: D and rating: median 9 (range: 7–9). Strong agreement.

### Patellofemoral imaging [^c55fc282]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Imaging of the patella and patellofemoral joint cannot be isolated from imaging of the knee anymore than the function of the patellofemoral joint can be separated from the function of the entire knee. Therefore, the current author will focus on imaging of the patellofemoral joint yet integrate this with the entire knee. Because radiographs and other imaging techniques are adjuncts to the history and physical examination, and specifically an extension of the physical examination, each view or technique must be selected thoughtfully to yield the most useful and accurate information possible. Imaging techniques range from relatively inexpensive to very costly, yet the amount of useful information may not show a positive correlation with the cost. Only by integrating the history, physical examination, and the best imaging techniques can the clinician locate the abnormality, determine its cause, and plan a proper course of treatment. Radiographic imaging of the patellofemoral joint requires attention to detail on the part of the technician and knowledge of these techniques on the part of the clinician who orders and interprets the results. Understanding these concepts will help achieve everyone's goal: high-quality and cost-effective orthopaedic care.

### The SP-ET index is a new index for assessing the vertical position of patella [^ec73c5ae]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Mehl et al. suggested that there was no significant difference in the patellophyseal index between the patellar cartilage defect group and control group. But different from the study of Mehl et al. the study of Ali et al. have found that there was a statistically significant difference in the patellophyseal index between normal group and severe patellar cartilage defect group. In the present study, we found that the SP-ET index in patellar cartilage lesions group was significantly higher than that in control group, and the AUC of the SP-ET index was significantly higher than that of the Insall–Salvati ratio. The difference in the results might be related to the different severity of the included participants in these studies, and the strict control of the flexion angle of the knee in our study. Because in our practical measurement process, it was found that the flexion angle of the knee had a great impact on the value of the SP-ET index. According to the results of these studies, we thought that the correlation of the SP-ET index and patellophyseal index with the occurrence and severity of patellar cartilage lesions/patellar cartilage defect required prospective and biomechanical studies to explore further.

Our study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study, and the selection of participants in the patellar cartilage lesions group was based on MR images without histologic or pathologic evidence. Second, the measurement errors might be caused by the formation of patella spurs, only patients with grade 1–2B patellar cartilage lesions were included in the patient group, therefore, patients with severe patellar cartilage lesions were excluded in this study. Third, the flexion angle of the knee has a great influence on the SP-ET index, so the measurement of the SP-ET index needs to control the flexion angle of the knee strictly. Fourth, our results showed that the specificity of SP-ET index was lower, which will increase the false negative rate, and may lead to an incorrect assessment of the sagittal position of the patella. Moreover, the comprehensive assessment of the influence of patellar and trochlear morphology on patellar cartilage lesions is also our next step. In addition, there were no strict age and gender matching between the two groups of participants. Future research efforts should focus on the relationship between the SP-ET index and patellofemoral osteoarthritis using a prospective longitudinal study, and the role of the SP-ET index in different grades of patellar cartilage lesions.

### Patellar maltracking: an update on the diagnosis and treatment strategies [^c250dcfe]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

CT role on evaluating patellar maltracking

For CT evaluation of the patellofemoral joint, patients are positioned supine, with mild external rotation of up to 15° with padding as needed to facilitate a relaxed state of the quadriceps musculature. Both knees are scanned simultaneously. The contralateral side may serve as an internal control or may also have anatomic factors predisposing to maltracking. This protocol can help in evaluating for osseous integrity, morphology, and patellofemoral alignment (Fig. 8). However, patellofemoral tracking is a dynamic process with the spatial relationship between the articular surfaces varying depending on the position of the knee joint. In fact, most patellar maltracking occurs between extension and the first 30° of flexion. Thus, to assess for maltracking specifically, a multi-stage CT with a variable number of repeated acquisitions at variable degrees of flexion can also be performed. At 0° extension, the patellar may lie completely above the level of the trochlea, without direct apposition between the two articular surfaces. However, the patella starts to engage with the trochlea by 30° and is typically completely engaged by 45°. At less than 30° of flexion, asymptomatic knees may demonstrate physiologic patellar tilt or subluxation. In addition, symptomatic knees may demonstrate normal engagement between the patella and trochlea beyond 30° of flexion. Thus, imaging at positions both less than and greater than 30° can be used to avoid missing maltracking that might be captured at only certain degrees of flexion.

Fig. 8
CT of both knees in 20° flexion demonstrating bilateral shallow trochlear groove (arrows) compatible with dysplasia and bilateral lateral patellar subluxation and lateral tilt. The two features are associated with patellar maltracking

Advantages of CT over plain radiography include its cross-sectional capability and ability to generate multiplanar reformations. This allows for greater detailed evaluation of the patellar and trochlear morphology, patellofemoral relationship, and status of the joint. Advantages of CT over MRI include the reduced cost, larger gantry diameter allowing to fit larger patients, faster acquisition with less potential for claustrophobia, fewer absolute and relative contraindications related to implanted devices, and better cortical bone definition. It is therefore helpful in surgical planning. Disadvantages of CT compared to MRI include the use of ionizing radiation, which reduced soft tissue contrast resulting in limited evaluation of the cartilage, tendons, ligaments, muscles, and internal structures of the knee.

### Are patellofemoral joint alignment and shape associated with structural magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities and symptoms among people with patellofemoral pain? [^697e9a00]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

We also found that a more lateral patellar position (tilt, displacement) was associated with greater odds of morphological abnormalities defined on MRI in the patellofemoral joint. Abnormal patellar alignment is proposed to reduce the contact area between the patella and trochlea, resulting in increased patellofemoral joint stress, particularly in the lateral patellofemoral joint. Elevated loading of the patellofemoral joint was hypothesized to result in reduced patellar cartilage thickness and reduced deformational behavior of patellar articular cartilage. Salsich and Permanfound that only 17% of the variance in contact area was explained by patellar width and that patellar tilt angle did not contribute to patellofemoral joint contact area. These results are contrary to literature linking patellar alignment to patellofemoral contact area. Irrespective of the mechanism, our findings do suggest that patellofemoral joint alignment or bony shape may contribute to increased patellofemoral joint stress, as a greater lateral patellar tilt angle and bisect offset were associated with cartilage defects of the patella. However, these measures were not associated with PFP intensity or symptoms.

### Sagittal patellar flexion angle: a novel clinically validated patellar height measurement reflecting patellofemoral kinematics useful throughout knee flexion [^7c63ceb1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Patellar height measurements on lateral radiographs are dependent on knee flexion which makes standardisation of measurements difficult. This study described a plain radiographic measurement of patellar sagittal height which reflects patellofemoral joint kinematics and can be used at all degrees of flexion.

Methods

The study had two parts. Part one involved 44 normal subjects to define equations for expected patellar position based on the knee flexion angles for three new patellar height measurements. A mixed model regression with random effect for individual was used to define linear and polynomial equations for expected patellar position relating to three novel measurements of patella height: (1) patellar progression angle (trochlea), (2) patellar progression angle (condyle) and (3) sagittal patellar flexion. Part two was retrospective and involved applying these measurements to a surgical cohort to identify differences between expected and measured patellar position pre- and post-operatively.

Results

All three measurements provided insight into patellofemoral kinematics. Sagittal patellar flexion was the most useful with the least residual error, was the most reliable, and demonstrated the greatest detection clinically.

Conclusions

Clinically applied radiographic measurements have been described for patellar height which reflect the sagittal motion of the patella and can be used regardless of the degree of flexion in which the radiograph was taken. The expected sagittal patellar flexion linear equation should be used to calculate expected patellar height.

### The SP-ET index is a new index for assessing the vertical position of patella [^aa183135]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

The Insall–Salvati ratio was defined as the length of the patellar tendon divided by the length of the patella, which was a validated and widely used index for evaluating the position of patella. The Insall–Salvati ratio can be measured on both lateral radiograph and sagittal MR image of the knee. A higher position of patella might result in failure of the patella to engage the trochlear groove early during knee flexion, and decrease the contact area between the patellar articular surface and trochlea. Previous studies have shown that patella alta was associated with patellofemoral joint pain, instability, chondromalacia, and osteoarthritis. In this study, though the Insall–Salvati ratio was significantly higher in the patellar cartilage lesions group than that in the control group, there were just 24.2% (24/99) of patients in the patellar cartilage lesions group showed a pathologic Insall–Salvati ratio of > 1.2, which coincided with the results of Ambra et al. Moreover, Ali et al. found that the Insall–Salvati ratio did not correlate with the severity of patellotrochlear articular cartilage defected. In our opinion, the Insall–Salvati ratio in most patients with patellar cartilage lesions was in the normal range, which might reduce the instruction of this parameter in practical clinical work. Therefore, it was of great clinical impact to find more effective and direct evaluation indicators.

In the present study, the SP-ET index was used to define the position of the patella relative to the femoral trochlear, and SP-ET index showed a moderate correlation with the Insall–Salvati ratio. Ali et al. and Mehl et al. have used the patellophyseal index to assess patellar height in their studies, which was calculated as the distance from the most superior point of the patellar cartilage to the most superior point of the femoral cartilage divided by the length of patellar articular cartilage, and there were some similarities between the SP-ET index and patellophyseal index. However, the measurement of the SP-ET index only needed to be done at one plane (the sagittal plane with the greatest longitudinal diameter of the patella), and without the effect of axial displacement of patella. Therefore, we thought that the SP-ET index had a good practicability, and the intra- and inter-reader reliabilities of this parameter were also good in our study.

### Editorial commentary: which came first, the patella or the trochlea? Morphological relationships in patients with patellar instability [^69bc6004]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Trochlear dysplasia and patella alta are known risk factors for patellar instability, yet the relation between the two has not been well understood. Morphologic abnormalities such as trochlear dysplasia and patella alta are known to alter patellofemoral kinematics, whereas altered contact pressures, in turn, have been associated with the development of trochlear dysplasia. As our current treatments aim to correct these deformities through increasingly complex procedures such as trochleoplasty and tuberosity distalization, we should consider this relation and the potential for changing the course of developing such morphologic abnormalities earlier in life. Further studies on the developmental cause of this disorder may help guide future treatments in the management of patellar instability.

### The trochlear sulcus of the native knee is consistently orientated close to the sagittal plane despite variation in distal condylar anatomy [^170f4190]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Femoral component design in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has evolved to better reflect normal anatomy and encourage optimal biomechanics. The biomimicry evident in femoral condylar design is, however, generally not reflected in the trochlea. The native trochlear sulcus is orientated almost parallel to the sagittal plane of the femur but lateral to the midline, whereas in conventional TKA design the sulcus has a valgus orientation that tracks distally to the midpoint between the condyles. The sagittal plane orientation of the native trochlea positions the extensor mechanism for maximum mechanical advantage, whereas the typical prosthetic trochlea is oriented to facilitate a soft capture of the patella with a widened sulcus angle and lowered lateral trochlea to reduce lateral retinacular tension, lateral shear, and compressive loads on the patella.

Image analyses

All MRI images were independently reviewed by two musculoskeletal radiologists (Qiu and Sheng, with 3 and 13 years of clinical experience, respectively). The routine MR imaging protocol was used to grade the articular cartilage on the patellofemoral joint according to the modified Noyes classification system: grade 0 = normal cartilage, grade 1 = increased T2 signal intensity of morphologically normal cartilage, grade 2A = superficial partial-thickness cartilage defect less than 50% of the total articular surface thickness, grade 2B = deep partial-thickness cartilage defect greater than 50% of the total articular surface thickness, and grade 3 = full thickness cartilage defect (Fig. 2). The MRI measurements were performed by two other fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists (Li and Yu, with 7 and 18 years of clinical experience, respectively) after all the data of the two groups were mixed and distributed blindly and randomly. All measurements were repeated by one of the radiologists (Li), and the interval between the first and second reading was at the last 4 weeks.

Fig. 2
The modified Noyes classification system of patellar cartilage lesions. a Grade 1 — increased T2 signal intensity of morphologically normal cartilage; b grade 2A — superficial partial-thickness cartilage defect less than 50% of total articular surface thickness; c grade 2B — deep partial-thickness cartilage defect greater than 50% of the total articular surface thickness; d grade 3 — full-thickness cartilage defect

Two quantitative parameters for evaluating patellar position were assessed on the images of each MRI examination. The Insall–Salvati ratio was calculated as the patellar tendon length divided by the maximum patellar diagonal length on sagittal MRI image (Fig. 4 a). The Insall–Salvati ratio was used to reflect the height of the patella, and the threshold was defined as > 1.2. The most superior point of patella-entrance of femoral trochlea distance ratio (SP-ET index) was used to reflect the vertical position of the patella relative to the trochlea. The entrance of femoral trochlea was the first craniocaudal plane where the complete cartilaginous trochlea can be seen (Fig. 3 a–c). The sagittal plane with the greatest longitudinal diameter of the patella was used to obtain the SP-ET index which was calculated as the distance between the most superior point of patella and the entrance of femoral trochlea divided by the patellar articular surface length (Fig. 4 b, c).

### The trochlear isometric point is different in patients with recurrent patellar instability compared to controls: a radiographical study [^00f5ab2d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) has become a popular operative strategy for managing recurrent patellar dislocation, for which a number of techniques have been described. The importance of the MPFL in providing stability to the patella and restraining lateral displacement of the patella from the femoral sulcus is well recognised. The origin and insertion of the medial patellofemoral ligament are well described, and the concept of isometricity for achieving proper clinical function has also been proposed. In fact current dogma states that unless the femoral tunnel is in the correct position in a medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction then a poor result is more likely. Up to 15% of MPFL revisions have been reported as due to poor femoral tunnel position, and 21% due to excessive graft tensioning. The precise point for the origin of the femoral tunnel is debated but tends to correlate with the origin of the normal MPFL with the consensus being that this is 10 mm distal to the adductor tubercle. Since, in the sagittal plane, the normal trochlea is an arc of a circle, the centre of the circle identifies an isometric point where the length remains constant through the first 90° of knee flexion. If this point was used for the femoral tunnel position of an MPFL reconstruction then the ligament would behave isometrically. Even so, the conventional radiographic points used to define the femoral anatomical placement only approximately correspond to the anatomical position and should not be used as the sole basis for the femoral attachment location, although this work was done on normal cadaveric knees.

### Patella alta: association with patellofemoral alignment and changes in contact area during weight-bearing [^cfeb4419]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patella alta is a condition which may predispose individuals to patellofemoral joint dysfunction. We compared patellofemoral joint alignment and contact area in subjects who had patella alta with subjects who had normal patellar position, to determine the effect of high vertical patellar positions on knee extensor mechanics.

Methods

Twelve subjects with patella alta and thirteen control subjects participated in the study. Lateral patellar displacement (subluxation), lateral tilt, and patellofemoral joint contact area were quantified from axial magnetic resonance images of the patellofemoral joint acquired at 0 degrees, 20 degrees, 40 degrees, and 60 degrees of knee flexion with the quadriceps contracted.

Results

With the knee at 0 degrees of flexion, the subjects with patella alta demonstrated significant differences compared with the control group, with greater lateral displacement (mean [and standard error], 85.4% ± 3.6% and 71.3% ± 3.0%, respectively, of patellar width lateral to the deepest point in the trochlear groove; p = 0.007), greater lateral tilt (mean, 21.6 degrees ± 1.9 degrees and 15.5 degrees ± 1.8 degrees; p = 0.028), and less contact area (157.6 ± 13.7 mm² and 198.8 ± 14.3 mm²; p = 0.040). Differences in displacement and tilt were not observed at greater knee flexion angles; however, contact area differences were observed at all angles evaluated. When data from both groups were combined, the vertical position of the patella was positively associated with lateral displacement and lateral tilt at 0 degrees of flexion and was negatively associated with contact area at all knee flexion angles.

Conclusions

These data indicate that the vertical position of the patella is an important structural variable that is associated with patellofemoral malalignment and reduced contact area in patients with patella alta.

### Optimizing patellar imaging: what every radiologist should know [^03edc79b]. Clinical Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The patella, biggest of all sesamoid bones, is an integral part of knee biomechanical function. It is a pivot for the quadriceps, enabling them to stabilize and contract during motion. With its complex shape, comprising many stabilizing structures and significant parts of articulation, its evaluation and analysis become a challenging issue in radiology departments worldwide. In this article, its evaluation with conventional radiography and Multidetector Computed Tomography, and its role in patellar pathology, have been discussed. In an extended discussion, key measurements, such as the trochlear groove angle, Merchant's congruence angle, and TT-TG distance, in diagnosing trochlear dysplasia, lateral patellar dislocation, and patellofemoral instability, have been discussed in detail. Certain radiological report-enhancing techniques and standardization have been discussed, providing a pragmatic view for maximizing such a pathology's diagnosis and management. The intention of this article is not to prescribe definite methodologies but to introduce tools for a correct patellar pathology and its implications in a reliable manner.

(2b) What are the relevant factors in patient history after FTPD?

In addition to the clinical investigation, patient age, family history, bilateral symptoms of instability, and injury mechanism should be evaluated. Grade: B and rating: median 9 (range: 7–9). Strong agreement.

(3) What is the patellofemoral clinical testing protocol after FTPD that is performed in every case?

Examination of the knee after FTPD might be limited in the inflammatory acute phase due to swelling, pain, and patient anxiety. If so, it should be repeated as soon as the acute phase has resolved (from days to weeks) to confirm the initial diagnosis and to assess predisposing factors, including the contralateral knee. The examination should include standing, supine and prone position assessments of coronal and axial deformities; knee joint range of motion; J‐sign; patella gliding; and apprehension/reversed dynamic patella apprehension. This does not exclude the need for systematic examination of other knee structures. Grade: D and rating: median 9 (range 7–9). Strong agreement.

### The SP-ET index is a new index for assessing the vertical position of patella [^0dafe433]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition, there were some researches focusing on the role of trochlear dysplasia in chondromalacia patella or patellofemoral cartilage lesions, and the study of Ambra et al. suggested that trochlear dysplasia might be more important than the patellar malposition in the pathogenesis of patellofemoral cartilage lesions. But the measurement parameters defining the vertical position of the patella in some studies did not better reflect the vertical position of the patella relative to the femoral trochlear as patellotrochlear index and patellar articular overlap do. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the ratio of the most superior point of patella-entrance of femoral trochlea distance to the length of the patella articular surface on sagittal MRI as a newer index which can define the vertical position of patella relative to the trochlea and investigate the effect of this parameter on patellar cartilage lesions. We hypothesized that the new parameter was a good indicator to define the vertical position of the patella, and moreover, this increased parameter might be a potential risk factor for the development of patellar cartilage lesions.

### The SP-ET index is a new index for assessing the vertical position of patella [^7fe030b4]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of the present study were twofold. Firstly, our data showed that increased SP-ET index was associated with the risk of developing patellar cartilage lesions. Secondly, the SP-ET index might be a better indicator to define the vertical position of the patella relative to femoral trochlear than the Insall–Salvati ratio in patellar cartilage lesions patients. These findings supported our hypothesis and indicated that the SP-ET index may be a useful complement parameter to define the vertical position of the patella relative to the femoral trochlear, and a higher position of patella might play a role in the pathogenesis of patellar cartilage lesions.

The previous researches have analyzed the influence of patellofemoral malalignment on patellar cartilage lesions or patellar cartilage defects. Overall, patellofemoral malalignment and structural abnormalities of the patellofemoral joint led to pathologic pressure on the patellofemoral joint might be an important pathogenesis of patellar cartilage lesions. Some studies found that a higher position of patella was an important influencing factor of patellar cartilage lesions, and in addition to the standard measurements of patellar height, some other measurements were analyzed, such as modified Insall–Salvati index, patellotrochlear index, and patellophyseal index. The assessment of the sagittal position of the patella is still worth discussing due to the diversity of examination techniques, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. Take the Insall–Salvati index, for example, which is an indicator of the height of the patellar and has traditionally been measured by conventional radiography. But MRI is currently being used more clinically to assess the relationship between the patellofemoral joint. The advantages of MRI over conventional radiography lie in its capability of multiplanar, high-resolution imaging of chondral, and soft tissue lesions. There have been some studies based on MRI measurements, but they are still controversial. Therefore, how to use MRI to accurately assess the sagittal position of the patella still needs to be discussed.

### The SP-ET index is a new index for assessing the vertical position of patella [^13bce5e9]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The SP-ET index can be easily measured to define the vertical position of the patella relative to the femoral trochlear, and it showed a moderate correlation with the Insall–Salvati ratio which was a conventional measurement of patellar height. ROC analysis showed that the diagnostic efficiency of the SP-ET index was better than the Insall–Salvati ratio in patients with patellar cartilage lesions. Therefore, the SP-ET index showed promise as a useful complement parameter to define the vertical position of the patella, and a higher position of patella might be one of the factors in developing patellar cartilage lesions.

### Relationship between the patellar height and the disorder of the knee extensor mechanism in immature athletes [^dc379234]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2001). Low credibility.

Summary

The purposes of this study were to evaluate the outcome of longitudinal research on the patellar height of immature athletes, and to clarify the relationship with disorders of the knee extensor mechanism. The patellar height of 40 young male soccer players (80 knees) was observed with radiographs of the bilateral knee joint for 2 years. The patellar height was measured using the epiphyseal line method. No subject showed patella alta before the occurrence of the disorder. Of the 12 knees in which the disorder occurred during the observation period, 10 knees (83%) had higher patella after the onset of symptoms than before. The patellar height in the painful stage was considered significant compared with the normal group. Although the patellar position in the predisorder stage was relatively high, this state was considered within the normal scope of physiologic variation, such as the growth spurt.

### Active patellar tracking measurement: a novel device using ultrasound [^0a84fe4a]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients suffer patellar instability that may relate to transient patellar tracking abnormalities.

Objective

To develop and test a technique to measure dynamic patellar tracking.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory and in vivo study.

Method

A functional knee brace was modified to allow an ultrasound transducer to be mounted laterally to the femur, following the path of the patella during knee movement. An ultrasound system was used to measure patellar mediolateral position parallel to the femoral transepicondylar axis. Ten subjects with no patellar instability were studied to obtain patellar tracking and accuracy data.

Results

The interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility ranged from 0.2 ± 0.1 mm to 1.0 ± 0.5 mm. The accuracy of the ultrasound measurement was checked against magnetic resonance imaging and was 0.6 ± 1.9 mm. The patella moved medially then laterally from extension to flexion when sitting. Squatting and stepping produced a more lateral path, without the initial medial translation. The patella was more lateral during knee extension than during flexion.

Conclusions

This novel method for measurement of dynamic patellar mediolateral tracking was found to have good intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility, and the measurements matched closely with those obtained from magnetic resonance imaging reconstructions of static patellar positions. Some preliminary data for tracking in 3 activities were obtained from 10 normal knees.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^49051060]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Physical examination

The basic anatomy of the knee is shown in Figure 2. The knee is the largest joint in the body and is comprised of the patellofemoral joint, medial tibiofemoral joint, lateral tibiofemoral joint and superior tibiofibular joint. It is a modified hinge joint with primary motion in the sagittal plane (flexion – extension). During the clinical assessment the physician should try and reproduce the patient's knee pain through palpation as well as biomechanical evaluation. Biomechanical examination is important in determining any potential predisposing or contributing factors. This should include an assessment for genetic predisposing factors such as excessive stiffness, loose-jointedness, and/or poor muscle tone. Functional biomechanics should be assessed by evaluation of gait, and maneuvers such as jumping, hopping (single and double-leg) and squatting. Knee swelling is unusual in anterior knee pain and generally implies intra-articular pathology, synovitis or loose body. The contralateral knee and ipsilateral hip should always be examined.

### Arthroscopic patellofemoral measurements can reliably assess patellar instability [^7cf9e4dc]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To arthroscopically describe patellar position based on lateralization, tilt, and engagement, and compare measurements in normal, medial patellofemoral complex-(MPFC) deficient, and MPFC-reconstructed knees.

Methods

In 10 cadaveric knees, arthroscopic patellar position was assessed by performing digital measurements on arthroscopic images obtained through a standard anterolateral portal. Lateralization was measured as millimeters overhang of the patella past the lateral edge of the lateral femoral condyle, viewing from the lateral gutter. Patellar tilt was calculated as the difference in medial and lateral distances from the patella to the trochlea, viewing from the sunrise view. Patellotrochlear distance was measured as the anteroposterior distance between the central trochlear groove and patella on the sunrise view. Measurements were obtained at 10° intervals of knee flexion from 0° to 90°, in intact knees (group 1), after arthroscopically transecting the MPFC fibers (group 2), and after MPFC reconstruction (group 3). Optimal cutoff values were identified to distinguish between intact versus MPFC-deficient states.

Results

When compared to group 1, group 2 demonstrated increased patellar lateralization by 22.5% at 0°-40° knee flexion (P = 0.006), which corrected to baseline in group 3 (P = 0.006). Patellar tilt measurements demonstrated no differences between groups. Patellotrochlear distance increased by 21.0% after MPFC transection (P = 0.031) at 0°-40° knee flexion, with correction to baseline after MPFC reconstruction (P = 0.031). More than 7 mm of lateral overhang at 20°-30° flexion and > 6 mm of patellotrochlear distance at 10°-20° flexion were found to indicate MPFC deficiency.

Conclusions

Utilizing standardized arthroscopic views, we identified significant increases in patellar lateralization and patellotrochlear distance in early knee flexion angles after MPFC transection, and these changes normalized after MPFC reconstruction.

Clinical Relevance

Arthroscopic assessments of patellar position may be useful in evaluating patellofemoral stability during patellar stabilization surgery.

### Patellar maltracking: an update on the diagnosis and treatment strategies [^fe3c5929]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgical management

Surgical management of patellar instability should be guided on an individual patient basis depending on history, physical examination, and radiologic findings as outlined above. Over 100 different procedures have been described for the treatment of patellar instability, and this reflects the various causes for instability and lack of current gold standard. The most accepted indication for surgical management of patellar instability is the presence of a large displaced osteochondral fracture or loose body.

Surgical management procedures can broadly be categorized as soft tissue procedures (lateral release, medial imbrication, and MPFL repair or reconstruction) and bony procedures (tibial tubercle transfer procedures and trochleoplasty).

Soft tissue procedures are designed to repair or tighten stretched and injured soft tissues contributing to patellar stability. They are best indicated in isolation in the setting of recurrent instability with minimal underlying osseous malalignment (normal TT-TG, minimal trochlear dysplasia). Lateral release and medial imbrication on their own are generally insufficient, but can be used to augment an MPFL repair or reconstruction or, if there is osseous misalignment, used in conjunction with a bony procedure particularly if there is recurrent instability or demonstrable lateral patellar tilt. Reconstruction of the MPFL has recently become an increasingly popular procedure for recurrent lateral patellar instability. The technique has been refined, and a better understanding of the anatomical features of both the origin and insertion of the ligament onto the patella has made the operation more reproducible (Fig. 9). Despite this, there remains considerable variation in surgical technique including graft choice, position, and tension making the literature difficult to compare.

### Usefulness of three-dimensional computed tomography for patellofemoral measurement [^53aeae8f]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to establish the normal values for knee patellofemoral alignment as measured using 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT), to standardize the technique, and to show the inter- and intra-observer reliability of this measurement.

Methods

The present study included 62 asymptomatic volunteers (124 knees). 3D CT scanning was performed with each volunteer in the supine position with 15° of knee flexion, and consistent 3D axial images of the patellofemoral joint were obtained with alignment in the desired stereographic baseline direction in anterior-posterior, lateral, and axial rotations. Two independent observers measured patellofemoral alignment parameters, including the sulcus angle, congruence angle, lateral patellofemoral angle, condyle-patellar angle, and lateral trochlear inclination angle.

Results

Based on 3D CT measurement, the mean values of the parameters were 145.9° ± 9.2° for the sulcus angle, 12.6° ± 22.6° for the congruence angle, 9.2° ± 4.6° for the lateral patellofemoral angle, 14.1° ± 6.4° for the condyle-patellar (lateral facets) angle, - 8.5° ± 8.4° for condyle-patellar (patellar axis) angle, and 16.5° ± 6.3° for the lateral trochlear inclination angle. A statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in the sulcus and condyle-patellar (patellar axis) angles (p = 0.045, 0.011, respectively). All parameters showed excellent inter- and intra-observer reliability.

Conclusion

The normal values and ranges for patellofemoral alignment parameters were evaluated using 3D CT. The results of this study provide reference information that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment planning of patellofemoral disorders in skeletally mature non-pathologic patients.

### Adolescent patellar instability: current concepts review [^23fcc3d0]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Patellar instability most frequently presents during adolescence. Congenital and infantile dislocation of the patella is a distinct entity from adolescent instability and measurable abnormalities may be present at birth. In the normal patellofemoral joint an increase in quadriceps angle and patellar height are matched by an increase in trochlear depth as the joint matures. Adolescent instability may herald a lifelong condition leading to chronic disability and arthritis. Restoring normal anatomy by trochleoplasty, tibial tubercle transfer or medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction in the young adult prevents further instability. Although these techniques are proven in the young adult, they may cause growth arrest and deformity where the physis is open. A vigorous non-operative strategy may permit delay of surgery until growth is complete. Where non-operative treatment has failed a modified MPFL reconstruction may be performed to maintain stability until physeal closure permits anatomical reconstruction. If significant growth remains an extraosseous reconstruction of the MPFL may impart the lowest risk to the physis. If minor growth remains image intensifier guided placement of femoral intraosseous fixation may impart a small, but acceptable, risk to the physis. This paper presents and discusses the literature relating to adolescent instability and provides a framework for management of these patients. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2017;99-B:159–70.

### A laterally positioned concave trochlear groove prevents patellar dislocation [^77c07536]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral instability is a disabling condition that occurs in adolescence. Recurrence after patellar dislocation has been reported in 2–50% of patients. We compared the distal femur in patients with patellofemoral instability with distal femura of a healthy cohort using mathematical quantification of two-dimensional shape variation at the same position in different knees. One hundred eight computed tomography scans from 54 patients with patellofemoral instability were compared with 197 computed tomography scans from 102 subjects with normal knees. We used principal components analysis to quantify variation in shape of the trochlear groove as it allows comparison of knees with patellofemoral instability to healthy knees. We found that subjects who had dislocated their patella had a flattened trochlear groove, whereas normal knees had a more concave groove. The position of the trochlear groove was more medial in patients with patellofemoral instability compared with normal knees. Groove position was more important than shape when predicting which patellae were likely to dislocate.

### Patellar maltracking: an update on the diagnosis and treatment strategies [^7b0e5126]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

The patella has 4 different planes of motion: flexion–extension, medial–lateral rotation, medial–lateral patellar tilt, and medial–lateral patellar shift. The stability of the patella is dependent on both osseous anatomy and the integrity of longitudinal and transverse soft tissue stabilizers. The transverse stabilizers include the medial and lateral retinaculum, the vastus medialis and lateralis muscles, the ilio-tibial band, and the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL). The longitudinal stabilizer is the extensor mechanism itself, which is comprised of the quadriceps tendon proximally and the patellar tendon distally. The anatomic relationship between the resultant force from the quadriceps and the line of pull of the patellar tendon is termed the Q angle and is normally 10–15° of valgus. This results in a slightly superolateral direction of pull on the patella by the quadriceps. Correspondingly, the patella must shift slightly medially during early flexion to engage the trochlear groove.

Clinical presentation and initial evaluation

The most obvious presentation of patellar maltracking is that of the first time lateral patellar instability or recurrent instability thereafter. Less commonly, patients can also present after chronic patellar instability secondary to generalized ligamentous laxity with or without anterior knee pain. Although varied in presentation, successful management of all patients relies on thorough history taking, physical examination of the entire lower extremity, and appropriate imaging. The clinical evaluation can be more challenging in the absence of a dislocation history, and in this scenario, imaging can have a critical role.

Acute traumatic instability most commonly occurs in young athletes in their second and third decade at an incidence rate of 29 per 100,000. Some controversy exists regarding whether female gender is a definite risk factor for patellar instability with certain studies identifying a 33% increased likelihood of first-time dislocation as well as three times high re-dislocation rates than males, whereas others have found roughly equal rates. The mechanism is commonly a non-contact twisting injury of the lower extremity with the knee extended and external rotation of the foot and is perceived as the knee "giving way". The patella will often self-reduce by reflexic contraction of the quadriceps muscles. Less commonly, a direct laterally or medially orientated blow to the patella can precipitate dislocation. Traumatic dislocations are commonly associated with other injuries including that of the MPFL, meniscal pathology, and osteochondral fractures of the femur or patella.

### The trochlear isometric point is different in patients with recurrent patellar instability compared to controls: a radiographical study [^db7890c8]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

The problem with relying on anatomical landmarks for the origin of the MPFL is that all the work has, as stated above, been based on normal knees. However, the path of the patella during knee flexion changes completely in the presence of trochlear dysplasia (TD) as the proximal part of the groove is anterior to the path of the normal groove. It is logical to expect that the more severe the dysplasia the further from the norm the patellar movement will be and the more anisometric an MPFL reconstruction will be if the standard femoral tunnel position is chosen. This has been confirmed clinically in that MPFL reconstruction alone does not work well in patients with significant TD.

The purpose of this study was to identify the radiographical "isometric point" of the trochlea from a cohort of patients presenting with patellar instability and compare this in a control population with tibiofemoral disorders and also with a recognised femoral tunnel position, the Schöttle's point. The hypothesis was that the radiographical "isometric point" in patients presenting with patellar instability is different to that of a control population and that this would be anterior and proportional to the degree of trochlear dysplasia as measured by the boss height.

### The trochlear isometric point is different in patients with recurrent patellar instability compared to controls: a radiographical study [^87c6370a]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

The assumption in this study is that, in the sagittal plane, the path of the patella is defined by the shape of the trochlea, and that the patella is at a normal height. Given that the trochlea is highly variable in patients with patellar dislocation since the majority have TD, then this explains why significant TD is a risk factor for failure of isolated MPFL reconstruction. Having said that it also needs to be recognised that, clinically, if a graft is fixed with a 6 mm interference screw in a 6 mm tunnel, then the final graft position will be 3 mm away from the guidewire position, and could finally rest anywhere around the circle of the tunnel. Looking at Fig. 2 and considering a circle of radius 3 mm around the zero point, then most of the circle centres were outside. However, MPFL is a successful operation. This implies that precise positioning (within 3 mm at least) is not the essential factor. A recent study by Hiemstra et al. of a cohort of 155 patients who had undergone an MPFL reconstruction showed that the post-operative outcomes did not correlate with the femoral tunnel position with respect to Schöttle's point. Of note, the femoral tunnel position was decided intra-operatively with a technique that aimed to have the graft tight in extension and lax in flexion. The distance between the femoral tunnel and Schöttle's point had a mean of 6 mm ± 4 mm, although they did not report the direction of the difference. Logic dictates that the graft should be inserted and fixed without tension when the patella sits at the point of maximum distance from the femoral tunnel. As a result, if the Schöttle's point is used and there is a TD with a boss height > 5 mm, then the graft should be fixed at around 20° flexion. If the boss height is, say, 10 mm, then one should expect that as the knee comes into full extension, then the patella would move laterally by 10 mm since it moves off the boss and onto the anterior cortex of the femur. This would be seen clinically as a J-sign. In this case it would seem to be preferable to perform a deepening trochleoplasty before the MPFL reconstruction, since it would then be easier to define the femoral tunnel position relative to the MPFL origin. Of note is Thanaut and Erasmus' work describing "favourable anisometry" which emphasised that the primary purpose of the MPFL reconstruction is to stop excessive lateral displacement of the patella and allow the quadriceps muscle to act over the anterior part of the distal femur. The MPFL guides the patella into the trochlea in the first 20° of knee flexion. This can work well if the trochlea is not so dysplastic that there is lateral hypoplasia in its distal portion.

### Anatomic risk factors for lateral patellar instability [^48ef3104]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

With an incidence of approximately 42 per 100,000 persons annually, patellar instability is a debilitating condition that can result in dysfunction of the normal patellar tracking and potential cartilage damage. The stability of the patellofemoral (PF) joint involves an intricate relationship between muscular forces, soft tissues, trochlear and patellar geometry, and limb alignment. Several anatomic patellar risk factors (APRFs) have been identified including patella alta (Caton Deschamps > 1.2; Insall-Salvati > 1.2), rotational malalignment (femoral anteversion > 30°, knee rotation > 10°, and tibial rotation > 35°), genu valgum (Valgus: zone 2 or greater), a lateralized tibial tubercle (tibial tubercle-trochlear grove distance > 17 mm; tibial tubercle-posterior cruciate ligament distance > 21 mm), and trochlear dysplasia. The importance of APRFs is highlighted by their overwhelming association with patellar instability; > 80% of patients with patellar instability have at least 1 risk factor. Biomechanically, these risk factors increase lateralizing forces on the patella, increase maltracking (patellar tilt and subluxation), decrease contact area, and increase pressure in the PF joint. In addition, there is greater anisometry of the medial PF ligament reconstruction. Clinically, the presence of APRFs increases the chances of recurrence after a first episode as well as failure rates of medial PF ligament reconstruction. Initially described by Dejour on lateral radiographs, current APRF evaluation includes standard radiographs along with axial slice imaging, with magnetic resonance imaging being more commonly used currently. In some instances, mechanical axis radiographic views and axial computed tomography rotational alignment studies may be indicated. Each risk factor can be assessed independently, as there are good-quality studies defining abnormal thresholds for individual APRF. However, there is a lack of robust clinical data defining use of these thresholds for guiding decisions regarding nonsurgical/surgical treatment, specifically, which factors need to be surgically managed and at what threshold for optimal outcomes. It is important to understand that there is an intricate and complex interaction between risk factors that need to be considered during PF evaluation. Overall, evaluation of APRF is one of the core elements of PF instability management.

### The SP-ET index is a new index for assessing the vertical position of patella [^f6c7a739]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The primary anatomical factors which were associated with patellofemoral malalignment included patella alta, trochlear dysplasia, and abnormal lateral patellar tilt. Patella maltracking is often connected with rotational deformities of the lower extremity, including increased femoral anteversion, external tibial rotation, or genu valgum. In addition, imbalances in the strength of the muscles around the knee joint can also lead to patella maltracking. Patellofemoral malalignment resulted in abnormal joint contact and chondral stresses within the patellofemoral compartment and was often associated with chondral damage and chronic anterior knee pain. Patellar cartilage lesion caused by various diseases, including osteoarthritis, as chondromalacia patella, is one of the common causes of chronic anterior knee pain and leads to a decrease in quality of life. A progressive loss of articular cartilage can lead to the development of patellofemoral osteoarthritis. The most commonly cited hypothesis is patellofemoral malalignment and/or maltracking that leads to pathological loading on the patellofemoral joint and increases subsequent articular cartilage wear, and we found that there have been several studies focusing on the relationship between patellofemoral malalignment and patellar cartilage lesions.

Duran et al. and Tuna et al. reported that there was an association between abnormal trochlear morphology and chondromalacia patella in women. In addition, the study of Lu et al. showed that the patellar height might be an important factor in the severity of patellar cartilage lesions. Both patella alta and patella baja were found to be related to chondromalacia patella, and the modified Insall–Salvati index ratio was the best indicator to define patella alta. Patella alta may lead to excessive lateral motion of the patella during knee flexion and cause the patella may not to be able to engage the trochlear groove early during knee flexion; all of these could lead to the development of patellar cartilage lesions. Multiple methods of assessing the vertical position of the patella on imaging have been described in the previous literature. Most noteworthy, some studies suggested that the ratio between the articular cartilage of the patella and the trochlear cartilage parameters (patellotrochlear index and patellar articular overlap) could be better used to assess the vertical position of the patella in patients with patellofemoral instability.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for patellofemoral pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, APTA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider assessing body structure and function, including measures of patellar provocation, patellar mobility, foot position, hip and thigh muscle strength, and muscle length, when evaluating patients with PFPS over an episode of care.

### Patello-femoral tracking in the weight-bearing knee: a study of asymptomatic volunteers utilising dynamic magnetic resonance imaging: a preliminary report [^2b69e490]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Normal patello-femoral tracking is not well defined, and conventional radiological techniques do not allow imaging in the physiological, weight-bearing stance. A vertical-access open configuration magnetic resonance scanner allows imaging of patello-femoral tracking during weight-bearing and through a wide range of knee flexion. We imaged 40 asymptomatic knees in this way, producing axial scans which were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using sulcus angle, congruence angle, lateral patello-femoral angle and patellar centralisation, to assess patellar tilt and displacement. Mild lateral tilting in hyperextension with the quadriceps relaxed was seen, but quantitative assessment of this was impeded by internal rotation of the femur in extension. One-half of the knees were slightly laterally displaced in hyper-extension, becoming central during the first 30 degrees of knee flexion. During passive flexion of the knee in a seated position, fewer knees were laterally tilted or displaced, and no consistent change was seen during flexion. These results indicate that mild lateral tilting and displacement can be normal phenomena in the weight-bearing knee in early flexion and should not necessarily be taken as evidence of abnormal tracking in symptomatic patients. Lateral to medial movement of the patella occurs during normal knee flexion. In addition, imaging in the weight-bearing knee can provide valuable information not gained by imaging during passive knee flexion.

(8) When do we need more imaging than standard radiographs (AP, lateral and axial) and MRI, which measurements should then be performed?

When clinical examination gives rise to suspicion of valgus deformity, well‐executed, long‐standing x‐rays are recommended. The signs of squinting patella and/or if examination in the prone position shows a difference of more than 30° between internal and external rotation of the hip or clinical suspicion of increased tibial external torsion, further radiological assessment by torsional computed tomography (CT) or MRI investigation is recommended to measure femoral antetorsion, knee rotation and tibial external torsion. Grade: C and rating: median 9 (range: 5‐9). Relative agreement.

(9) When and how should a chondral or osteochondral fracture be diagnosed?

The incidence of chondral or osteochondral fractures is high, especially in paediatric patients. Hemarthrosis/lipohemarthrosis should serve as a warning sign. As chondral lesions in the patellofemoral articular area are important prognostic factors, imaging should start immediately with plain radiographs (ap, lateral, axial) and an MRI or an MRI alone as soon as possible to detect all these chondral and osteochondral lesions and to assess repairability. Grade: C and rating: median 9 (range: 8–9). Strong agreement.

(27) Is non‐operated FTPD a risk factor for ongoing symptoms?

In addition to recurrent instability, a variety of symptoms, such as pain, swelling and giving way, functional and psychological limitations, and a reduction in sports participation, affect 50% of patients, reducing their quality of life. Cartilage lesions start in the first episode, and the severity of the damage correlates with the degree of persistent instability. Grade: C and rating: median 9 (range: 5–9). Relative agreement.

(28) What is the complication rate of surgical treatment in addition to persistent instability?

There are no publications on specific complication rates after surgical treatment of FTPD; however, superposable complication rates of medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstructions from cohorts of heterogeneous patients with patellar instability can be expected, and the complication rate is variable. The most common complications are patellofemoral pain, reduced range of motion and patellar fracture. Grade: B and rating: median 9 (range: 8–9). Strong agreement.

### Isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty reproduces natural patellofemoral joint kinematics when the patella is resurfaced [^57297a13]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objectives of this in vitro project were to compare the dynamic three-dimensional patellofemoral kinematics, contact forces, contact areas and contact pressures of a contemporary patellofemoral prosthetic implant with those of the native knee and to measure the influence of patellar resurfacing and patellar thickness. The hypothesis was that these designs are capable to reproduce the natural kinematics but result in higher contact pressures.

Methods

Six fresh-frozen specimens were tested on a custom-made mechanical knee rig before and after prosthetic trochlear resurfacing, without and with patellar resurfacing in three different patellar thicknesses. Full three-dimensional kinematics were analysed during three different motor tasks, using infrared motion capture cameras and retroflective markers. Patellar contact characteristics were registered using a pressure measuring device.

Results

The patellofemoral kinematic behaviour of the patellofemoral arthroplasty was similar to that of the normal knee when the patella was resurfaced, showing only significant (p < 0.0001) changes in patellar flexion. Without patellar resurfacing, significant more patellar flexion, lateral tilt and lateral rotation was noticed. Compared to the normal knee, contact pressures were significantly elevated after isolated trochlear resurfacing. However, the values were more than doubled after patellar resurfacing. Changes in patellar thickness only influenced the antero-posterior patellar position. There was no other influence on the kinematics, and only a limited influence on the contact pressures in the low flexion angles.

Conclusion

The investigated design reproduced the normal patellofemoral kinematics acceptable well when the patella was resurfaced. From a kinematic point of view, patellar resurfacing may be advisable. However, the substantially elevated patellar contact pressures remain a point of concern in the decision whether or not to resurface the patella. This study therefore not only adds a new point in the discussion whether or not to resurface the patella, but also supports the claimed advantage that a patellofemoral arthroplasty is capable to reproduce the natural knee kinematics.

### Decreased association between patellar axial malalignment and patellar height and increased association between patellar axial malalignment and tibial tubercle-trochlear groove during weightbearing [^376071dd]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonweightbearing preoperative assessments avoid quadriceps contraction that tends to affect patellar motion and appear to be inaccurate in quantifying anatomic factors, which can lead to incorrect corrections and postoperative complications.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does the relationship of patellar axial malalignment and other anatomic factors change during weightbearing? (2) What anatomic factor was most strongly correlated with recurrent patellar dislocation during weightbearing?

Methods

This prospective, comparative, observational study recruited participants at our institution between January 2023 and September 2023. During this time, all patients with recurrent patellar dislocations received both weightbearing and nonweightbearing CT scans; control patients who received unilateral CT scans because of injuries or benign tumors received both weightbearing and nonweightbearing CT scans. Between January 2023 and September 2023, 52 patients were treated at our institution for patellar dislocation. We included those who had experienced at least two dislocations. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) traumatic dislocation, (2) prior knee surgery, (3) osteoarthritis (≥ Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 3), and (4) abnormal walking and standing postures confirmed by the orthopaedic surgeon and an inability to complete weightbearing CT with their body in a neutral position (meaning their body weight was evenly placed on both knees) because of severe pain. After applying prespecified exclusions, 63% (33 patients) of the original number were included, and data for 33 patients (65 knees) with weightbearing CT data and 28 patients (52 knees) with nonweightbearing CT data were obtained. Because of ethical requirements, the control group included patients who underwent unilateral CT scanning (for an injury or a benign tumor), and weightbearing CT and nonweightbearing CT covered both knees. Control knees were confirmed to have normal patellofemoral function by physical examination by an orthopaedic surgeon involved with the study. The control group consisted of the normal knees (52 knees underwent both weightbearing CT and nonweightbearing CT) and the affected but uninvolved knees (47 knees underwent weightbearing CT and 6 knees underwent nonweightbearing CT), and a total of 52 patients (99 knees) with weightbearing CT data and 31 patients (58 knees) with nonweightbearing CT data were included. There were no differences between the recurrent patellar dislocation and control groups in terms of gender, side, and BMI. Although the patients in the control group were older than those in the study group, most patients in both groups were at or at least near skeletal maturity. Patellofemoral measurements were evaluated with the Insall-Salvati ratio extension, Blackburne-Peel ratio extension, Caton-Deschamps ratio extension, bisect offset index, lateral patellar tilt angle, tibial tubercle-trochlear groove, lateral trochlear inclination, sulcus depth, and sulcus angle. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for all these measurements were greater than or equal to 0.70 and so were considered adequate for reliability. The correlations between patellar axial malalignment and other anatomic factors during weightbearing and nonweightbearing were compared, and anatomic factors between weightbearing and nonweightbearing were compared to investigate the relationship of patellar axial malalignment and anatomic factors during weightbearing. The correlation between anatomic factors and recurrent patellar dislocation and the diagnostic performance of each factor for recurrent patellar dislocation were reported to find the anatomic factor that most strongly correlated with recurrent patellar dislocation during weightbearing.

Results

We observed several changes in axial malalignment measurements that occurred with weightbearing. The correlation between bisect offset index and Blackburne-Peel ratio extension decreased with weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.12 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to 0.35] with weightbearing versus r = 0.58 [95% CI 0.36 to 0.75]; p = 0.003). The correlation between bisect offset index and Caton-Deschamps ratio extension decreased with weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.25 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.47] versus r = 0.68 [95% CI 0.49 to 0.82]; p = 0.002). The correlation between bisect offset index and tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance increased with weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.63 [95% CI 0.43 to 0.78] versus r = 0.38 [95% CI 0.05 to 0.62]; p = 0.04). The correlation between lateral patellar tilt angle and Blackburne-Peel ratio extension decreased with weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.05 [95% CI -0.17 to 0.28] versus r = 0.44 [95% CI 0.21 to 0.63]; p = 0.02). The correlation between the lateral patellar tilt angle and Caton-Deschamps ratio extension decreased with the weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.16 [95% CI -0.09 to 0.40] versus r = 0.46 [95% CI 0.19 to 0.66]; p = 0.04). The correlation between lateral patellar tilt angle and tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance increased with weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.64 [95% CI 0.48 to 0.76] versus r = 0.41 [95% CI 0.13 to 0.64]; p = 0.048). Several parameters changed with weightbearing. In both recurrent patellar dislocation and control groups, the Insall-Salvati ratio extension and the tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance were lower with weightbearing compared with nonweightbearing (recurrent patellar dislocation/control: p = 0.001/p < 0.001 versus p = 0.006/p < 0.001); bisect offset index was higher with weightbearing compared with nonweightbearing (recurrent patellar dislocation/control: p < 0.001/p < 0.001). In the control group, the Blackburne-Peel ratio extension and the Caton-Deschamps ratio extension were lower with weightbearing compared with nonweightbearing (p = 0.01, p = 0.007). The anatomic factor most strongly correlated with recurrent patellar dislocation during weightbearing was the bisect offset index (r = 0.73 [95% CI 0.65 to 0.79]; p < 0.001). The anatomic factor most strongly correlated with recurrent patellar dislocation during nonweightbearing was the sulcus depth (r = -0.70 [95% CI -0.78 to -0.59]; p < 0.001). The ROC analysis showed that during weightbearing, the bisect offset index had the best diagnostic ability for recurrent patellar dislocation (area under the curve [AUC] 0.93 [95% CI 0.89 to 0.97]), whereas when the patient was nonweightbearing, sulcus depth was the best predictor (AUC 0.91 [95% CI 0.85 to 0.96]).

Conclusion

Evaluations based on nonweightbearing examinations underestimated the interaction between the tibial tubercle-trochlear groove and patellar axial alignment, thus surgeons could consider weightbearing preoperative assessments for tibial tuberosity osteotomy to avoid failing to restore normal patellar axial alignment. Bisect offset index was an important indicator to improve detecting possible recurrent patellar dislocation in the state of functional activation of soft tissues and can estimate patellar tilt to simplify the preoperative evaluation procedure. For patients who are at high risk but who have not yet developed a patellar dislocation, assessing the risk of recurrent patellar dislocation with the bisect offset index during weightbearing can inform them about the intensity and manner of their daily exercise.

Line γ was the reference line of the entrance plane of femoral trochlea; c the entrance plane of femoral trochlea, and it was the first craniocaudal plane where the complete cartilaginous trochlea can be seen

Statistical tests

In this study, descriptive data were calculated for demographic data. The subjects were categorized, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, into the patellar cartilage lesions group and the control group. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the intra- and inter-reader reliability of MRI quantitative measures. Continuous variables with a normal distribution were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and Student's t test was used to detect the difference. The Spearman correlation was used to analyze the relationship between the two parameters. The above statistical analyses were performed using Windows software SPSS (version 17.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), and the significance level was set at 0.05. In addition, the diagnostic efficacy of two measurements of the patellar position was determined with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, which was performed using MedCalc statistical software (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). Optimum cutoff point, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of each parameter were calculated, and then ROC curves between the two groups were compared, and the significance level was set at 0.05.

### Comparison of in vivo patellofemoral kinematics for subjects having high-flexion total knee arthroplasty implant with patients having normal knees [^6e8984e2]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2010). Low credibility.

This study compares the in vivo patellar kinematics of high-flexion posterior cruciate ligament-retaining and posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implants with that of the healthy knee. Twenty-seven subjects performing weight-bearing deep knee bends were analyzed under fluoroscopic surveillance from full extension to maximum flexion. The patellofemoral contact positions and patellar flexion were similar for both TKAs. At low flexion, the patellofemoral contact was significantly more distal on the healthy patella than on the TKA patella, but in deeper flexion, there was no difference among the 3 groups. The tibiopatellar angle was similar for all 3 groups, except at deep flexion where the healthy patella rotated significantly more than the implanted ones. Patellofemoral separation was observed in some TKA knees, whereas it was absent in the healthy knees.

### Are patellofemoral joint alignment and shape associated with structural magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities and symptoms among people with patellofemoral pain? [^a37d7c7d]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a common knee condition accounting for 11% to 17% of all knee pain presentations in general practice. PFP is characterized by pain around the patella that particularly arises during patellofemoral joint loading activities, such as squatting and walking up or down stairs, as well as during prolonged sitting with the knees flexed. While PFP typically affects relatively young, physically active people (aged < 40 years), there is increasing evidence that PFP occurs at all stages of the life span, as well as among less physically active individuals.

There is consensus that the etiology of PFP is multifactorial. Elevated patellofemoral joint stress has frequently been postulated as a cause of pain and progression of symptoms. One proposed cause of elevated joint stress is abnormal alignment of the patellofemoral joint. Several patellofemoral alignment and bone shape measures are associated with the presence of PFP, including a larger quadriceps angle, larger sulcus angle, larger patellar tilt angle, and greater lateral displacement. However, there is very limited evidence from prospective studies to support a causal relationship. Nevertheless, the proposed subgroup of patients with malaligned knees has been the subject of many studies because patellofemoral alignment features are potentially modifiable (eg, with tapingor bracing) and can therefore have implications for the management and treatment of PFP.

### Editorial commentary: diverse factors affect measurement of patella alta: trochlear morphology and sagittal knee balance represent defining factors of patellofemoral stability [^c15ac755]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Patella alta is a known risk factor for patellar instability, contributing to increased length changes of the medial patellofemoral complex, and associated with high rates of failure after medial patellofemoral complex reconstruction. Distalization through tibial tuberosity osteotomy (TTO) is a surgical option to address patella alta during patellar stabilization surgery. However, distalization has been shown to have greater complication rates than other types of TTO, and therefore precise indications through proper assessments of patellar height are needed. The Caton-Deschamps index is a commonly used measurement and is independent of patellar tendon length, allowing for assessment of patellar height before and after distalizing TTO. Additional options that may offer this ability are femoral-based measurements such as the patellotrochlear index and sagittal patellar engagement, which also do not rely on the position of the tubercle and may better represent the functional engagement of the patellofemoral joint. However, femoral-based measurements depend on trochlear morphology; theoretically, an advantage of femoral-based measurements is that they may reflect the functional engagement of the patella within the trochlea. However, in knowing the common relation between patella alta and trochlear dysplasia, the question becomes whether an overlap between the patella and a dysplastic proximal trochlea on a sagittal measurement truly represents functional engagement and stability of the patellofemoral joint. Measurement of patella alta and determining indications for distalization can be influenced by measurement techniques including magnetic resonance imaging versus radiography, tibial- versus femoral-based measurements, and positional and morphologic considerations. Increased understanding of trochlear morphology and sagittal knee balance as they relate to patella alta will be important for defining the factors that affect patellofemoral stability.

### The trochlear isometric point is different in patients with recurrent patellar instability compared to controls: a radiographical study [^8eea611d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Since the origin of the MPFL does not match the isometric point in normal trochleae, then the MPFL cannot behave isometrically through the range of knee motion in the normal knee. This is well recognised; the ligament slackens in flexion where the patella is "captured" by the depth of the groove and the MPFL is not required to act as a check rein and stop lateral displacement. The difference is greater in a PFI population and reflects the presence of TD. It should be emphasised that the isometric point of the trochlea is highly variable in any patient group.

It was noticeable that when applying a circle to the groove line in the PFI cohort, the circle could be placed to touch two points on the groove, e.g. B and D (Fig. 3) or the circle could match much of the groove (Fig. 4). In the control cohort the groove matched a circle. In Fig. 3, for a patient with TD, it can be seen that the isometric point is anterior to Schöttle's point, and the radius of the circle from Schöttle's point to the apex of the boss is longer than that for the best-fit circle. This would result in a significantly anisometric graft if the Schöttle's point was used as the femoral tunnel position. In Fig. 4, in TD, isometric point moves anteriorly as the circle is made smaller. This implies that there is potential for significant error in the isometric point position in TD. A much more complex methodology is needed requiring 3D reconstruction and analysis of the tracking of the patella to define the femoral tunnel position in the presence of TD. This is not appropriate for the surgeon in a clinic. Interestingly, using 3D CT scans in different degrees of knee flexion, Blatter et al. only found one isometric point in 10 normal knees when measuring the MPFL length with a maximal length difference during knee flexion of 10 mm. They also noted that for most, the optimal tunnel position was slightly anterior to Schöttle's point. It would be interesting to know how this correlated with the lateral plain radiograph.

### Patellar maltracking: an update on the diagnosis and treatment strategies [^246237d7]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellar tracking refers to the dynamic relationship between the patella and trochlea during knee motion. Patellar maltracking occurs as a result of imbalance of this relationship often secondary to anatomic morphologic abnormality. Usually, young individuals, particularly women, suffer the consequences of this disorder. It is a recognized cause of anterior pain and in extreme cases presents as acute and often recurrent patellar dislocation, which is usually transient. Early diagnosis is essential, as chronic maltracking will lead to patellofemoral cartilage damage and osteoarthritis. Imaging, particularly MRI, plays a vital role in the assessment of patellar maltracking. It can not only detect any underlying morphological risk factors but also look for structural damage associated with maltracking including patellofemoral articular cartilage loss, osteochondral defects, or damage to the medial patellar stabilizers. The purpose of this article is to discuss the evaluation of patellar maltracking providing an update on the imaging assessment and also a synopsis on the management options.

Findings of this study highlight an apparent association between 5 measures of patellofemoral joint alignment and bony shape and the presence of cartilage, bone, and soft tissue morphological abnormalities of the patellofemoral joint among people with PFP. Those with a higher IS ratio (indicating patella alta), greater patellar tilt angle (indicating greater lateral tilt), greater bisect offset (indicating a more lateral patellar position), and greater sulcus angle (indicating a shallower trochlea) had higher odds of having features of patellofemoral OA on MRI, including patellar osteophytes, minor cartilage defects, and high fat pad signal. A lower percentage of patellar articular cartilage overlap was associated with having osteophytes and fat pad synovitis. Age, sex, duration of PFP, and bilateral PFP were associated with several alignment and bony shape measures of the patellofemoral joint. However, only a few associations were found between patellofemoral joint alignment and bony shape and patient-reported symptoms and function.

### The pathophysiology of patellofemoral pain: a tissue homeostasis perspective [^700cf5ce]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Fundamental to rational, safe, and effective treatment for any orthopaedic condition is an accurate understanding of the etiology of the symptoms. The decades-old paradigm of a pure structural and biomechanical explanation for the genesis of patellofemoral pain is giving way to one in which biologic factors are being given more consideration. It is increasingly evident that a variable mosaic of possible pathophysiologic processes, often caused by simple overload, best accounts for the etiology of patellofemoral pain in most patients. Inflamed synovial lining and fat pad tissues, retinacular neuromas, increased intraosseous pressure, and increased osseous metabolic activity of the patella all have been documented as contributing to the perception of anterior knee pain. Considered together, these processes can be characterized as loss of tissue homeostasis and can be seen as providing a new and alternative explanation for the conundrum of anterior knee pain. Certain high loading conditions of the patellofemoral joint can be of sufficient magnitude to induce the symptomatic loss of tissue homeostasis so that, once initiated, they may persist indefinitely. From this new biologic perspective, it clinically matters little what structural factors may be present in a given joint (such as chondromalacia, patellar tilt or a Q angle above a certain value) if the pain free condition of tissue homeostasis is safely achieved and maintained.

### Evidence of abnormal anteroposterior patellar tilt in patients with patellar tendinitis with use of a new radiographic measurement [^1b16e3d3]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

A number of clinical conditions of the patellofemoral joint have been correlated with abnormal patellofemoral radiographic measurements.

Hypothesis

An abnormal anteroposterior patellar-tilt angle may be a contributing factor to pathologic conditions of the knee.

Study Design

Prospective nonrandomized clinical trial.

Methods

The anteroposterior patellar-tilt angle was measured in cadaveric knees to determine the best knee position. The radiographs of normal subjects and patients with patellar tendinitis or patellofemoral pain syndrome were examined for differences in patellar-tilt angle.

Results

Cadaveric measurements demonstrated highest intertester and intratester reliability at 30 degrees of knee flexion and neutral femoral rotation. Intratester measurements on normal subjects exhibited high reliability, with a mean anteroposterior tilt angle of 30.8 degrees ± 6.7 degrees. In the patellofemoral pain group the mean anteroposterior tilt angle was 29.1 degrees ± 8.5 degrees; however, for patients with patellar tendinitis, it was 25.6 degrees ± 7.0 degrees, significantly lower than in the normal population. Furthermore, there was no difference between the angles of involved and uninvolved knees of patients with unilateral patellar tendinitis.

Conclusion

The anteroposterior patellar-tilt angle is a clinically reliable measurement of patellar tilt in the sagittal plane that can be used to study patellofemoral tilt in a variety of clinical situations. The results of this study demonstrate that patients with patellar tendinitis have abnormal patellar tilt in the sagittal plane.

### The SP-ET index is a new index for assessing the vertical position of patella [^d053bcfb]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Some parameters in previous studies did not better reflect the vertical position of the patella relative to the femoral trochlear. This study aimed to assess the value of the most superior point of patella-entrance of femoral trochlea distance ratio (SP-ET index) as a newer index in defining the vertical position of patella relative to the trochlea, correlate it with the Insall–Salvati ratio, and investigate the effect of the new index on patellar cartilage lesions.

Methods

A total of 99 knees of 77 patients with patellar cartilage lesions were retrospectively analyzed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The Insall–Salvati ratio and SP-ET index were measured on MR images. Ninety-nine knees just with meniscus rupture were enrolled as the control group. The two parameters of the patellar cartilage lesions were compared with those of the control group.

Results

The Insall–Salvati ratio and SP-ET index in the patellar cartilage lesions group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.001). The SP-ET index showed a moderate positive correlation with the Insall–Salvati ratio (r = 0.307, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the diagnostic efficiency of the SP-ET index was better than that of the Insall–Salvati ratio in patients with patellar cartilage lesions.

Conclusion

The SP-ET index may be a useful complement parameter to define the vertical position of the patella relative to the femoral trochlear. Increased SP-ET index may be an important risk factor for patellar cartilage lesions.

### Is the caton-deschamps index a valuable ratio to investigate patellar height in children? [^ed108697]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patellar height variations can be responsible for many functional disorders in children. The Caton-Deschamps index to measure patellar height has been described for adults. Our goal was to determine Caton-Deschamps index values in a pediatric population.

Methods

Lateral radiographs of the knee were analyzed in a cohort of 300 healthy patients. All radiographs were done to evaluate the patients after minor trauma and all were reported to be normal by a senior radiologist. The cohort was divided into ten groups on the basis of the age of the child. Radiographic measurements were done by a computer-assisted technique. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability studies were performed prior to the descriptive analysis of the data.

Results

Mean patellar length (and standard deviation) was 33.39 ± 7.4 mm. Mean patellar tendon length was 34.57 ± 6.7 mm. The mean Caton-Deschamps index was 1.06 ± 0.21. Patellar and patellar tendon length significantly increased with age, whereas the Caton-Deschamps index significantly decreased. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability studies showed excellent reliabilities with an intraclass correlation coefficient that was between 0.930 and 0.944 (95% confidence interval).

Conclusions

The Caton-Deschamps index is a simple and reliable index for evaluating patellar height in children as well as adults. It is an alternative to the Insall-Salvati index measurement, in which reproducibility is poor due to difficulties in determining the distal point of the patellar tendon, and to the Koshino index, which is complex to use. In our study, there was a correlation between the Caton-Deschamps index and age, due to the progressive patellar ossification that begins at the proximal part of the patella. The Caton-Deschamps index is a pertinent and reliable ratio to evaluate patellar height in children and adolescents. To make an accurate diagnosis of patellar disorders in children, the normal, age-based Caton-Deschamps values need to be considered.

### Patellofemoral kinematics in mobile-bearing and fixed-bearing posterior stabilised total knee replacements: a cadaveric study [^dfc38ac1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim was to compare the patellar kinematics in the normal knee, fixed-bearing (FB) and mobile-bearing total knee replacement (MB-TKR). The hypothesis that a mobile-bearing TKR has a more natural patellar movement was tested.

Methods

Computer navigation was used to track the patella in nine whole lower extremities in the natural knee and in the same knee with a posterior stabilised FB-TKR and a posterior stabilised MB-TKR from 0° to 90° flexion. The form and position of the trochlea in the natural knee and the patellar groove of the TKR femoral component was also analysed.

Results

There were no differences between the FB and MB-TKRs. But the patella in the TKRs at flexion angles of more than 50° had a more medial tilt compared to the natural knee. The patella of the natural knee tended to rotate externally with flexion, this was not seen in both TKR types. There were no significant differences in absolute mediolateral translation nor in translation relative to the patellar groove. During flexion, the patella lost contact with its groove earlier in the TKRs. The radius of the patellar groove of the femoral component was larger. The groove extended more superiorly and less far posteriorly, it was also positioned further laterally compared to the natural knee.

Conclusions

There are subtle kinematic differences in patellar tracking between the natural knee and a TKR presumably due to differences in the shape and position of the patellar groove. There are no kinematic differences in patellar movement between the FB- and MB-TKR.

### Radiographic measures in subjects who are asymptomatic and subjects with patellofemoral pain syndrome [^f60f7fc4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

Lateral tilt and displacement of the patella are considered characteristic features of patellofemoral pain syndrome. It has been suggested that abnormal patellar tilt and displacement are detected best with the knee near full extension, which requires computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The objective of the current study was to determine whether alignment abnormalities could be detected in subjects with patellofemoral pain syndrome from axial radiographs obtained at 35 degrees knee flexion using a new, standardized radiographic technique. Thirty-three subjects with patellofemoral pain syndrome and 33 matched control subjects were recruited from a military population. Lateral and axial (unloaded and with quadriceps contraction) radiographs were taken using the Patellofemoral QUESTOR Precision Radiograph system. Measures of patellar tilt and displacement, and anatomic measures (sulcus angle, patellar facet angle, patella alta) were obtained from the radiographs. No significant differences in patellar tilt or displacement were detected between the groups (paired t tests) in either the unloaded or loaded (quadriceps contracted) condition, suggesting that these measures, obtained at this knee angle are not useful diagnostic or outcome measures in patellofemoral pain syndrome. Patellar angle, sulcus angle, and patellar height also did not differ between groups suggesting that these are not etiologic factors in patellofemoral pain syndrome.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of patellofemoral kinematics with weight-bearing [^c3abdc15]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies of the patellofemoral joint have been limited by the use of invasive techniques, measurements under non-weight-bearing conditions, cadaveric specimens, or computerized models. It has been shown that soft tissue and bone can be accurately quantified with magnetic resonance imaging. The present study was designed to define the relationship between the patellofemoral contact area and patellofemoral kinematics in vivo.

Methods

Ten subjects with clinically normal knee joints were scanned with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging while they pushed a constant weight (133 N) on the foot-plate of a custom-designed load-bearing apparatus. Images were obtained at five positions of flexion between -10 degrees and 60 degrees. Three-dimensional reconstructions were used to measure the patellofemoral cartilage contact area, patellar centroid, patellar medial and inferior translation, patellar medial and inferior tilt, and patellar varus-valgus rotation. All translation and area measurements were normalized on the basis of the interepicondylar distance. Random-effects models of quadratic regressions were used to evaluate the data.

Results

The mean contact area ranged from 126 mm² in extension to 560 mm² at 60 degrees of flexion. The patella translated inferiorly to a maximum distance of 34 mm at 60 degrees of flexion and translated medially to a maximum distance of 3.2 mm at 30 degrees of flexion before returning to nearly 0 mm at 60 degrees of flexion. The patella tilted inferiorly to a mean of nearly 35 degrees at 60 degrees of flexion and medially to a maximum of 4.2 degrees at 30 degrees of flexion. By 60 degrees of flexion, the centroid of the contact area had shifted to an inferior and posterior maximum of 20 and 10 mm, respectively.

Conclusions

We found that lateral patellar subluxation and tilt occurred in these normal knees at full extension and the patella was reduced into the trochlear groove at 30 degrees of flexion. Therefore, we believe that lateral patellar tilt and subluxation observed during arthroscopy of the extended knee may not represent a pathological condition.

### Is the clinician's eye a valid and reproducible tool for diagnosing patella alta on a lateral knee radiography? [^0c9b8f53]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Validity and reproducibility of the clinician's eye (CE) to diagnose patella alta (PA) on a lateral knee radiography (radiograph) is unknown.

Methods:

Cross-sectional study of 46 lateral knee x-rays. Three blind observers used CE, Insall-Salvati (IS), modified Insall-Salvati (mIS), and Caton-Deschamps (C-D) to determine patellar height. Sensitivity and specificity of each observer was compared with the musculoskeletal radiologist's C-D measurements. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement were assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient and Fleiss κ, respectively. Time needed to estimate patellar height for every method was recorded in seconds. Statistical differences between observers were calculated with a generalized estimating equation. Analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni test compared duration of each method (P < 0.05). Data were analyzed using Stata 15 (StataCorp).

Results:

CE, IS, mIS, and C-D's sensitivity and specificity values are as follows: 77%, 92%; 94%, 52%; 67%, 58%; and 53%, 89%, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficient and Fleiss κ of CE, IS, mIS, and C-D values are as follows: 0.66 and 0.43, 0.88 and 0.68, 0.54 and 0.09, and 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. CE was the second most sensitive and most specific method for diagnosis of PA, with moderate intraobserver and interobserver agreement. IS was the most sensitive method with good intraobserver and interobserver agreement. CE was significantly faster (P < 0.05) than all other conventional radiographic ratios.

Conclusion:

CE's sensitivity increases with observer's experience and is highly specific. If normal patellar height is diagnosed, no other ratios are necessary, even in the less experienced clinician. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibilities were moderate and only inferior to the IS ratio. In case patellar height is uncertain with the CE, the IS ratio is the most sensitive and reproducible method to confirm the diagnosis of PA.

### Patellar maltracking: an update on the diagnosis and treatment strategies [^784c9c69]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Lateral patellar tilt

Lateral patellar tilt is a sensitive marker for patellar instability. It may occur without patellar lateralization. In a series of 474 patients with anterior knee pain, patellar tilt or subluxation was present in 40% of the cases on axial MRI. The degree of patellar tilt can be evaluated by measuring the patella tilt angle, which is the angle between the posterior condylar line and the maximal patella width line (Fig. 6). Patellar tilt can also be assessed using the patellofemoral angle (PFA). PFA is the angle between a line drawn along the bony lateral patellar facet and another line along the anterior aspect of the femoral condyles. It is measured at the mid-point of the patella on the axial slices. PFA of 0° or if it opens medially (negative value) is considered abnormal indicating lateral patellar tilt.

Patellar tilt assessment. a The posterior condylar line is drawn on the slice where the posterior femoral condyles are largest (dashed line). b The patella tilt angle is measured between the posterior condylar line (dashed line) and the maximal patella width (solid line).

### Anterior closing wedge osteotomy for failed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: state of the art [^29196178]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Planning of Anterior Closing Wedge Osteotomy

Reducing the PTS to approximately 6° to 8° has been recommended by some authors. This would bring it within the range of normal mean values in most populations. The hinge point for the closing wedge osteotomy is chosen near the posterior tibial cortex and not too close to the articular surface to prevent an intra-articular hinge fracture. When positioned within the lower half of the PCL insertion, this broad and strong tendinous structure reinforces the hinge when deformed during closing. A "rule of thumb" system to convert degrees of correction to millimeters of closing wedge has been proposed by several authors. However, a more accurate method is to plan the osteotomy on calibrated radiographs (Figure 5, B). The steps in this exercise are as follows:
(1) Measure the lateral slope (x°) as previously described in Figure 2.
(2) Measure the degree of correction required to reduce the slope to 6° to 8° (x° − y° = 6°)
(3) Plot y° on the radiograph centering at the hinge point and extending the lines to the anterior cortex.
(4) Measure the horizontal distance (z, millimeters) on the anterior cortex, which is equal to the height of the wedge to be removed.

Measuring patellar height relative to the proximal tibia, that is, with the Caton-Deschamps (CD) index enables to predict to what extent the patella is heightened when conducting a supratuberosity ACWO. In this respect, a preexistent low patella can be altered toward normal (CD index ranges from 0.6 to 1.3). However, a preexistent patella alta should not be increased by the ACWO, and it is advised that after planning the correction, the patellar height, as calculated with the CD index, should not exceed the limits of patella alta (1.3) too much. In such cases, a transtuberosity or infratuberosity ACWO technique is advised.

An ACWO can also correct some coronal malalignment by resecting an asymmetric wedge, if the deformity lies in the tibial metaphysis. However, it is important to remember that correction of a coronal plane malalignment, especially tibial varus, must be prioritized if that deformity is greater than 5°. A medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy does allow reduction of the PTS, especially if a patient-specific custom cutting guide is used to control this variable.

### No difference in patellar tracking between symmetrical and asymmetrical femoral component designs in TKA [^e0d6a228]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Poor knee extension function after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with factors including articular geometry and alignment. Femoral trochlear geometry has evolved from symmetrical to become more prominent proximal-laterally, with the groove aligned proximal-lateral to distal-medial. This study in vitro tested the hypothesis that a modern asymmetrical prosthesis would restore patellar tracking and stability to more natural behaviour than an older symmetrical prosthesis.

Methods

Six knees had their patellar tracking measured optically during active knee extension. Medial-lateral force versus displacement stability was measured at fixed angles of knee flexion. The measurements were repeated after inserting each of the symmetrical and asymmetrical TKAs.

Results

Significant differences of patellar lateral displacement stability, compared to normal, were not found at any angle of knee flexion. The patella tracked medial-laterally within 2.5 mm of the natural path with both TKAs. However, for both TKAs near knee extension, the patella was tilted laterally by approximately 6° and was also flexed approximately 8° more than in the natural knee.

Conclusion

The hypothesis was not supported: The more anatomical component design did not provide more anatomical patellar kinematics and stability.

Patellofemoral joint (PFJ) pathoanatomy — articulation and patellar roles — comprises the articulation between the patella and the trochlear groove of the femur, and the roles of the patella are to increase the lever arm function of the quadriceps muscles, provide resistance to lateral dislocation due to the depth of the trochlear groove and a dynamic contribution from the distal joint surfaces of the femoral condyles when the knee is flexed, and prevent damaging compressive forces on the quadriceps tendon with resisted knee extension.

### Which patellofemoral joint imaging features are associated with patellofemoral pain? Systematic review and meta-analysis [^7a856a4e]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the association between patellofemoral joint (PFJ) imaging features and patellofemoral pain (PFP).

Design

A systematic review of the literature from AMED, CiNAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PEDro, EMBASE and SPORTDiscus was undertaken from their inception to September 2014. Studies were eligible if they used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US) or X-ray (XR) to compare PFJ features between a PFP group and an asymptomatic control group in people < 45 years of age. A pooled meta-analysis was conducted and data was interpreted using a best evidence synthesis.

Results

Forty studies (all moderate to high quality) describing 1043 people with PFP and 839 controls were included. Two features were deemed to have a large standardised mean difference (SMD) based on meta-analysis: an increased MRI bisect offset at 0° knee flexion under load (0.99; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.49) and an increased CT congruence angle at 15° knee flexion, both under load (1.40 95% CI: 0.04, 2.76) and without load (1.24; 95% CI: 0.37, 2.12). A medium SMD was identified for MRI patella tilt and patellofemoral contact area. Limited evidence was found to support the association of other imaging features with PFP. A sensitivity analysis showed an increase in the SMD for patella bisect offset at 0° knee flexion (1.91; 95% CI: 1.31, 2.52) and patella tilt at 0° knee flexion (0.99; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.52) under full weight bearing.

Conclusion

Certain PFJ imaging features were associated with PFP. Future interventional strategies may be targeted at these features.

### Editorial commentary: trochlear dysplasia is difficult to measure, No matter how you slice It [^02392a8c]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Trochlear dysplasia is one of the primary morphologic abnormalities associated with patellar instability. Although qualitative classifications based on trochlear shape such as the Dejour classification exist, radiographic measurements to quantify the severity of trochlear dysplasia are numerous and varied. Each measurement addresses a different element of the complex and wide-ranging presentations that exist along a spectrum of abnormalities in trochlear morphology, and the reported reliability of such measurements are mixed. Overall, our understanding of trochlear dysplasia continues to evolve, and the ability to quantify the morphology of the trochlea, as well as its influence on patellar stability, remains a work in progress. Future directions include developing improved 3-dimensional descriptions of trochlear anatomy, as well as standardizing measurement methods and image slice selection, to better evaluate trochlear morphology in the assessment of patellar instability.

### The evaluation of patellar height: a simple method [^c9762a07]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patellar height is evaluated with ratios that have been derived from measurements made on lateral radiographs of the knee. The importance of using a ratio is that magnification, physical size, and flexion angle are eliminated as factors that affect the values. The Insall-Salvati index was the first ratio to be described. It remains the most popular, possibly because normal values are easy to remember. As all of the currently accepted methods are cumbersome to use because they require two measurements as well as a calculation, a single angular measurement was devised (the plateau-patella angle) to offer a simpler alternative. The purpose of this study was to introduce the new method and to assess its validity by comparing it with three classic, commonly used ratios.

Methods

In two groups of patients, after exclusions, 269 lateral radiographs of the knee were evaluated. All measurements required for the Insall-Salvati, the Blackburne-Peel, and the Caton-Deschamps indices plus the plateau-patella angle were recorded, along with basic demographics. For validation, the new method was compared with the established methods, and interobserver and intraobserver reliability were computed.

Results

There was excellent correlation between the proposed angle and the three selected indices, especially with the Blackburne-Peel index. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability was high and compared favorably with that reported in the literature for the three classic ratios. The calculated ratios were in line with those described in the literature. The mean plateau-patella angle was 25°. Ninety percent of the measurements fell between 20° and 30°, and one standard deviation above and below was 21° to 29°.

Conclusions

The plateau-patella angle, a new method of evaluating patellar height, can be measured rapidly with use of either a goniometer or digital software. Its range is easy to remember, it is reliably reproduced, and it correlates well with traditional methods. It is thus a valid and easy alternative method for the evaluation of patellar height.

### Are patellofemoral joint alignment and shape associated with structural magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities and symptoms among people with patellofemoral pain? [^660a800e]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

For people with PFP, particular alignment and bony shape measures — including higher IS ratio (indicating patella alta), smaller percentage of patellar articular overlap, larger patellar tilt angle (indicating greater lateral tilt), and larger bisect offset (indicating greater lateral displacement) — are associated with the presence of patellar osteophytes, minor cartilage defects, or Hoffa and prefemoral fat pad synovitis. Patellofemoral alignment and bony shape measures do not appear to be related to symptoms and function. Prospective studies are required to investigate the longitudinal relationship between alignment or bony shape and cartilage, bone, and soft tissue morphological abnormalities defined on MRI in this patient population.

### Knee pain in adults and adolescents: the initial evaluation | AAFP… [^70689302]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

PAIN LOCATION Anterior. Isolated anterior knee pain suggests involvement of the patella, patellar tendon, or its attachments. Anterior knee pain that is dull or aching and exacerbated by prolonged sitting or climbing stairs is common in patellofemoral pain syndrome. 3, 18 Athletes or other adults with overuse from running or jumping sports can develop quadriceps or patellar tendinopathy. Insidious onset of anterior knee pain in adolescents during rapid growth periods with concomitant overuse suggests Osgood-Schlatter disease or Sinding-Larsen-Johansson syndrome. Prepatellar bursitis causes patella-localized pain and swelling and can occur with isolated blunt trauma, repetitive injury, or infection of the overlying skin.
18.

MECHANICAL SYMPTOMS Mechanical symptoms, such as locking, buckling, or catching, suggest internal derangement and possible instability but can also occur in medial plica syndrome
18. A popping sensation at the time of injury may occur in meniscal or ligamentous tears. A knee that is "locked" in flexion and that cannot be extended should be examined for a meniscal tear. 4, 14, 15. MECHANISM OF INJURY When determining the mechanism of injury, gather information about pain onset, positioning of the knee during and after the injury, and subsequent weight-bearing status. 11, 29, 31, 37–40 A prospective validation trial comparing the Ottawa Knee Rule and the Pittsburgh Knee Rule showed that each rule is useful, but the Pittsburgh rule appears to be more sensitive. The three recommended radiographic views are anteroposterior view, lateral view, and Merchant's view.

30, 40 Oblique views can assess for tibial plateau fractures, and the notch or tunnel view can visualize osteochondral lesions. 4 If osteoarthritis is suspected, weight-bearing radiographs should be obtained to assess for joint-space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes, and bony cysts. 4, 22. 3, 27, 34, 44 The authors thank Ms. Rhonda Allard, who was invaluable during the literature search.

Adjusted analyses (Table 4) showed that a larger IS ratio (indicating patella alta) was associated with the presence of bone marrow lesions of the patella (OR, 24.40; 95% CI, 2.63–226.79), patellar osteophytes (OR, 51.82; 95% CI, 4.20–640.01), Hoffa synovitis (OR, 60.37; 95% CI, 4.66–782.61), and prefemoral fat pad synovitis (OR, 43.31; 95% CI, 4.28–438.72). A larger patellar tilt angle (indicating greater lateral tilt) was associated with the presence of minor patellar cartilage defects (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00–1.20), patellar osteophytes (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02–1.22), and prefemoral fat pad synovitis (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03–1.20). Additionally, a larger bisect offset (indicating a more lateral patellar position) was associated with minor patellar cartilage defects (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00–1.11) and patellar osteophytes (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01–1.14). There was a significant association between a larger sulcus angle (indicating a shallower trochlea) and the presence of patellar osteophytes (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01–1.14). Finally, a larger patellar articular cartilage overlap was associated with fewer patellar osteophytes (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.001–0.78) and less prefemoral fat pad synovitis (OR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.001–0.52).

### Anatomy of the knee… [^eca1b74f]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Anatomy of the Knee The anatomy and function of the knee are quite complex, and only the basics are described in this article. The osseous structures of the knee include the distal femoral condyles, proximal tibial plateau and patella. The tibial plateau articulates with the femoral condyles, and the patellofemoral groove accepts the patella. The tibia and patella do not articulate. The gliding motion of the patella across the femur allows smooth extension at the knee and increases the mechanical advantage of the quadriceps. Knee Fractures Fractures may occur in the patella, femoral condyles or tibial plateau. 16 Patellar fractures are divided into transverse, vertical, upper pole, lower pole, comminuted and osteochondral fractures. Each type can be undisplaced or displaced.

The two main mechanisms of patellar fracture are direct trauma to the anterior aspect of the knee or a powerful contraction of the quadriceps muscle. Radiographs are essential to assess traumatic patellar injury. In addition to antero-posterior, notch and lateral views, Merchant and infrapatellar views with the knee in 45 degrees of flexion may be necessary to identify an osteochondral fragment. Fractures of the femoral condyles involve the distal 9 to 15 cm of the femur. In one study, 22 the gravity sign near extension correctly diagnosed PCL injury in 20 of 24 patients, and active reduction of posterior tibial subluxation correctly identified PCL injury in 18 of 24 patients. The gravity test is performed at 20 degrees of knee flexion. Neither maneuver requires anesthesia. Nonetheless, clinical diagnosis may be difficult, and radiographic signs are important.

18 The most common radiographic sign of PCL injury is avulsion at the site of the ligament's origin on the posterior tibia. Less commonly, avulsion can be seen at the site of PCL insertion at the medial femoral condyle. When the PCL fails, posterior sagging of the tibia relative to the femur may be seen on the lateral radiograph.

### Is the clinician's eye a valid and reproducible tool for diagnosing patella alta on a lateral knee radiography? [^4ddbfc0d]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Validity and reproducibility of the clinician's eye (CE) to diagnose patella alta (PA) on a lateral knee radiography (radiograph) is unknown.

Methods

Cross-sectional study of 46 lateral knee x-rays. Three blind observers used CE, Insall-Salvati (IS), modified Insall-Salvati (mIS), and Caton-Deschamps (C-D) to determine patellar height. Sensitivity and specificity of each observer was compared with the musculoskeletal radiologist's C-D measurements. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement were assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient and Fleiss κ, respectively. Time needed to estimate patellar height for every method was recorded in seconds. Statistical differences between observers were calculated with a generalized estimating equation. Analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni test compared duration of each method (P < 0.05). Data were analyzed using Stata 15 (StataCorp).

Results

CE, IS, mIS, and C-D's sensitivity and specificity values are as follows: 77%, 92%; 94%, 52%; 67%, 58%; and 53%, 89%, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficient and Fleiss κ of CE, IS, mIS, and C-D values are as follows: 0.66 and 0.43, 0.88 and 0.68, 0.54 and 0.09, and 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. CE was the second most sensitive and most specific method for diagnosis of PA, with moderate intraobserver and interobserver agreement. IS was the most sensitive method with good intraobserver and interobserver agreement. CE was significantly faster (P < 0.05) than all other conventional radiographic ratios.

Conclusion

CE's sensitivity increases with observer's experience and is highly specific. If normal patellar height is diagnosed, no other ratios are necessary, even in the less experienced clinician. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibilities were moderate and only inferior to the IS ratio. In case patellar height is uncertain with the CE, the IS ratio is the most sensitive and reproducible method to confirm the diagnosis of PA.

### Patellofemoral pain syndrome… [^c081dddb]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Anatomy and Pathophysiology The patellofemoral joint consists of the patella and the trochlea of the femur and is important in knee extension and deceleration.
7. The patella acts as a lever within the leg, decreasing the amount of force required by the quadriceps to extend the leg at the knee. The patellofemoral joint is stabilized by the quadriceps, patellar tendon, vastus medialis obliquus, medial patellofemoral ligament, medial patellotibial ligament, medial retinaculum, oblique lateral retinaculum, patellotibial band, epicondylopatellar bands, and lateral retinaculum.
9. The force of the quadriceps is measured by the angle formed from the anterior superior iliac spine to the center of the patella to the tibial tubercle, which is known as the Q angle.
10. The Q angle is approximately 14 degrees in men and 17 degrees in women.

12 Because lateral forces on the patella are increased with higher Q angles, it has long been thought that a high Q angle increases the risk of PFPS; however, a higher Q angle has not been shown to be a clear contributing cause of PFPS in more recent research. 12–14. Patellar maltracking is believed to play a role in PFPS. Patellar maltracking, or lateral translation, increases with load-bearing positions, such as squatting, in patients with PFPS. Stimulation of nerve endings within the retinacula, Hoffa fat pad, and peripatellar synovium may also contribute to the development of PFPS.
15. |Quadriceps weakness| Dynamic valgus is another mechanism associated with PFPS. Dynamic valgus is a body position in which the knee collapses medially from excessive valgus, internal-external rotation, or both. 18 This increases the lateral force on the patella, contributing to maltracking.

Dynamic valgus is more common in female athletes, which may account for the higher incidence of PFPS in females. 19 Foot abnormalities, such as rearfoot eversion and pes pronatus, lead to internal rotation of the tibia, which can also contribute to dynamic valgus.
20. OTHER THERAPIES Beyond rest and exercise, other early therapies for PFPS include taping and foot orthotics.

### Patellar tracking: an old problem with new insights [^ce8b42c3]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Patellofemoral pain and instability are common indications for imaging that are encountered in everyday practice. The authors comprehensively review key aspects of patellofemoral instability pertinent to radiologists that can be seen before the onset of osteoarthritis, highlighting the anatomy, clinical evaluation, diagnostic imaging, and treatment. Regarding the anatomy, the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is the primary static soft-tissue restraint to lateral patellar displacement and is commonly reconstructed surgically in patients with MPFL dysfunction and patellar instability. Osteoarticular abnormalities that predispose individuals to patellar instability include patellar malalignment, trochlear dysplasia, and tibial tubercle lateralization. Clinically, patients with patellar instability may be divided into two broad groups with imaging findings that sometimes overlap: patients with a history of overt patellar instability after a traumatic event (eg, dislocation, subluxation) and patients without such a history. In terms of imaging, radiography is generally the initial examination of choice, and MRI is the most common cross-sectional examination performed preoperatively. For all imaging techniques, there has been a proliferation of published radiologic measurement methods. The authors summarize the most common validated measurements for patellar malalignment, trochlear dysplasia, and tibial tubercle lateralization. Given that static imaging is inherently limited in the evaluation of patellar motion, dynamic imaging with US, CT, or MRI may be requested by some surgeons. The primary treatment strategy for patellofemoral pain is conservative. Surgical treatment options include MPFL reconstruction with or without osseous corrections such as trochleoplasty and tibial tubercle osteotomy. Postoperative complications evaluated at imaging include patellar fracture, graft failure, graft malposition, and medial patellar subluxation. © RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

The IS ratio was calculated by dividing the length of the patellar tendon with the longest diagonal distance between the lower and the upper end of the patella. A value higher than 1.20 indicated PA. The mIS ratio was calculated by dividing the distance between the patellar tendon insertion and the lower end of the articular surface of the patella with the length of the articular surface of the patella. Values higher than 2.00 indicated a PA. The C-D ratio was calculated by dividing the distance between the peak of the visualized anterosuperior angle of the tibial plateau and the lower end of the articular surface of the patella with the length of the articular surface of the patella. Values higher than 1.30 indicated PA. C-D = Caton-Deschamps, CE = clinician's eye, IS = Insall-Salvati, mIS = modified Insall-Salvati, PA = patella alta.

Patellofemoral pain — diagnostic recommendations are explicitly stated as follows. A Clinicians should use reproduction of retropatellar or peripatellar pain during squatting as a diagnostic test for PFP. Clinicians should also use performance of other functional activities that load the PFJ in a flexed position, such as stair climbing or descent, as diagnostic tests for PFP. B Clinicians should make the diagnosis of PFP using the following criteria: The presence of retropatellar or peripatellar pain; Reproduction of retropatellar or peripatellar pain with squatting, stair climbing, prolonged sitting, or other functional activities loading the PFJ in a flexed position; AND Exclusion of all other conditions that may cause AKP, including tibiofemoral pathologies. C Clinicians may use the patellar tilt test with the presence of hypomobility to support the diagnosis of PFP.

Risk factors/factors associated with patellofemoral OA

Statement 7. A variety of factors may alter the mechanics of the patellofemoral joint and increase joint stress, potentially leading to OA.

Abnormal patellofemoral joint alignment and trochlear morphology are associated with patellofemoral OA (both radiographic and MRI features). A recent systematic reviewconcluded that there is strong evidence that patellofemoral OA is associated with both abnormal trochlear morphology and frontal plane knee alignment. There is also limited evidence (due to the lack of longitudinal studies) that malalignment in the sagittal (patella alta) and axial (lateral patellar displacement and tilt) planes are associated with patellofemoral OA. However, there remains a knowledge gap regarding optimal measures and thresholds to best predict patellofemoral OA.
Muscle weakness: Quadriceps weakness is an important factor in patellofemoral OA. Quadriceps function, such as muscle size, strengthand muscle force, is impaired in people with patellofemoral OA. Importantly, quadriceps weakness is a risk factor for patellofemoral OA. Weakness of muscle groups above the knee (involving the gluteii, often referred to as the 'proximal muscles') is well documented in young individuals with non-arthritic PFP. Emerging evidence suggests that those with patellofemoral OA may also demonstrate proximal muscle dysfunction compared to controls, including lower gluteus minimus and medius peak muscle force, and lower hip abductor strength. These studies found no differences in gluteus maximus peak muscle forceor hip external rotator strength. In the absence of longitudinal studies, the potential for hip muscle weakness to increase the risk of patellofemoral OA remains unknown.
Abnormal biomechanics: There is recent evidence that individuals with patellofemoral OA demonstrate abnormal biomechanics during gait. Fok et al reported that those with patellofemoral OA had lower knee extension moments, quadriceps forces and patellofemoral joint reaction forces during stair ascent and descent. In contrast to these findings, Pohl et al reported that pelvis, hip and knee kinematics were not different between people with patellofemoral OA and controls. In the only longitudinal study to date, Teng et al found that peak knee flexion moment and flexion moment impulse at baseline lead to progression of patellofemoral cartilage damage over 2 years.

### Limb positioning is critical for defining patellofemoral alignment and femoral shape [^2a8f1a06]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

The source of patellofemoral pain is a common orthopaedic complaint that often is difficult to determine because of the lack of correlation between symptoms and specific clinical measurements. Excessive joint contact stresses resulting from patellofemoral malalignment and pathologic femoral shape often are associated with this pain. These measures are likely sensitive to the limb position (orientation and position relative to the imaging system with which they are quantified). Because of this sensitivity, the measures have large variations and do not show correlations with subjective symptoms. The purpose of this study was to determine if varying limb position resulted in significant changes in standard clinical measures of patellofemoral alignment and femoral shape. This dependence was investigated by simulating alterations in limb position through resectioning of three-dimensional magnetic resonance image sets (20 healthy knees) to create axial images with altered orientation (eight images) or location (four images) relative to a fixed reference. By quantifying the variability of the clinical measures across all images, it was determined that simulated alterations in limb position produced greater variability in femoral shape and patellofemoral alignment measures than the variability seen across control subjects. This indicated that a standardized method for establishing limb position relative to the imager is warranted.

### Correlation of 3D shift and 3D tilt of the patella in patients with recurrent dislocation of the patella and healthy volunteers: an in vivo analysis based on 3-dimensional computer models [^efc855cd]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The concepts of lateral deviation and lateral inclination of the patella, characterized as shift and tilt, have been applied in combination to evaluate patellar malalignment in patients with patellar dislocation. It is not reasonable, however, to describe the 3-dimensional (3D) positional relation between the patella and the femur according to measurements made on 2-dimensional (2D) images.

Purpose

The current study sought to clarify the relation between lateral deviation and inclination of the patella in patients with recurrent dislocation of the patella (RDP) by redefining them via 3D computer models as 3D shift and 3D tilt.

Study Design

Descriptive laboratory study.

Methods

Altogether, 60 knees from 56 patients with RDP and 15 knees from 10 healthy volunteers were evaluated. 3D shift and tilt of the patella were analyzed with 3D computer models created by magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained at 10° intervals of knee flexion (0°-50°). 3D shift was defined as the spatial distance between the patellar reference point and the midsagittal plane of the femur; it is expressed as a percentage of the interepicondylar width. 3D tilt was defined as the spatial angle between the patellar reference plane and the transepicondylar axis. Correlations between the 2 parameters were assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Results

The patients' mean Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.895 ± 0.186 (range, -0.073 to 0.997; median, 0.965). In all, 56 knees (93%) had coefficients > 0.7 (strong correlation); 1 knee (2%), > 0.4 (moderate correlation); 2 knees (3%), > 0.2 (weak correlation); and 1 knee (2%), < 0.2 (no correlation). The mean correlation coefficient of the healthy volunteers was 0.645 ± 0.448 (range, -0.445 to 0.982; median, 0.834). A statistically significant difference was found in the distribution of the correlation coefficients between the patients and the healthy volunteers (P = 0.0034). When distribution of the correlation coefficients obtained by the 3D analyses was compared with that by the 2D (conventional) analyses, based on the bisect offset index and patellar tilt angle, the 3D analyses showed statistically higher correlations between the lateral deviation and inclination of the patella (P < .01).

Conclusion

3D shift and 3D tilt of the patella were moderately or strongly correlated in 95% of patients with RDP at 0° to 50° of knee flexion.

Clinical Relevance

It is not always necessary to use both parameters when evaluating patellar alignment, at least for knees with RDP at 0° to 50° of flexion. Such a description may enable surgeons to describe patellar alignment more simply, leading to a better, easier understanding of the characteristics of each patient with RDP.

### Three-dimensional in vivo patellofemoral kinematics and contact area of anterior cruciate ligament-deficient and-reconstructed subjects using magnetic resonance imaging [^4fc3ab30]. Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to test whether (1) the 3-dimensional in vivo patellofemoral kinematics and patellofemoral contact area of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient knees are different from those of normal, contralateral knees and (2) ACL reconstruction restores in vivo patellofemoral kinematics and contact area.

Methods

Ten ACL-deficient knees and twelve ACL-reconstructed knees, as well as the contralateral uninjured knees, were tested. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at full extension and 40 degrees of flexion under simulated partial weight-bearing conditions. Six-degrees of freedom patellofemoral kinematics, patellofemoral contact area, and contact location were analyzed by use of magnetic resonance image-based 3-dimensional patellofemoral knee models.

Results

The patella in the ACL-deficient knees underwent significantly more lateral tilt during flexion (P < .05) and tended to translate more laterally (P = 0.083) than the patella in contralateral knees. After ACL reconstruction, no kinematic parameters were significantly different from those in contralateral knees. The patellofemoral contact areas of ACL-deficient knees at both the extended and flexed positions (37 ± 22 mm² and 357 ± 53 mm², respectively) were significantly smaller than those of contralateral knees (78 ± 45 mm² and 437 ± 119 mm², respectively) (P < .05). After reconstruction, the patellofemoral contact area of ACL-reconstructed knees in the extended position (86 ± 41 mm²) was significantly larger (P < .05) than that of contralateral knees (50 ± 34 mm²), but no difference was detected in the flexed position. Reproducibility of all patellofemoral kinematic parameters, contact centroid translation, and contact area showed coefficients of variation of less than 6.8%.

Conclusions

ACL injuries alter patellofemoral kinematics including patellar tilt and patellar lateral translation, but ACL reconstruction with hamstring or allograft restores altered patellar tilt. ACL injuries reduce the patellofemoral contact area at both the extended and flexed positions, but ACL reconstruction enlarges the patellofemoral contact area at extension and restores the normal contact area at low angles of flexion.

### Patellofemoral relationships and cartilage breakdown [^75aaea75]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2005). Low credibility.

We evaluated the association between patellofemoral relationships and cartilage lesions in patients (age range 15–49) with anterior knee pain without patellar dislocation (n = 24) and in patients with isolated meniscal rupture without a high energy trauma (n = 21). The position of the patella was assessed from knee radiographs, and cartilage lesion was graded and mapped at arthroscopy. In subjects with lateral patellar cartilage lesion the patella tilted laterally (p < 0.01) and was clearly laterally displaced (p < 0.001), compared to those without patellar cartilage lesion. In subjects with central patellar cartilage lesion the patella located high according to the Insall-Salvati index (p < 0.01) and was somewhat laterally displaced (p < 0.05). Compared to subjects without cartilage lesion in the femoral trochlea, the patella was laterally displaced in subjects with lesion in the lateral trochlea (p < 0.001). In conclusion, our results suggest that specific malalignments predispose to patellofemoral cartilage lesion, but prospective studies are needed to confirm the finding.

### Patellar maltracking: an update on the diagnosis and treatment strategies [^c2c1b6d8]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Patella alta

Patella alta is related to a long patellar tendon and is considered a major factor associated with reduced contact area at the patellofemoral joint and a major contributor to patellar instability. In order for the patella to engage with the femoral trochlea, a higher degree of flexion than normal is needed. Several methods have been used to assess patella alta. A commonly used one is the Insall–Salvati ratio of patellar tendon length: patellar length. This is measured on the sagittal MRI images at the point where the patella is at its greatest length. It is a ratio between the patellar tendon length (along the inner surface of the tendon) and the diagonal patellar height. A ratio of > 1.3 is considered indicative of patella alta (Fig. 4). Another method is the Caton–Deschamps index. This is the ratio between a line measured between the inferior margin of the patellar articular surface and the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau and the greatest length of the patellar articular surface. A ratio equal or more than 1.2 indicates patella alta (Fig. 4). A newer method to assess for patella alta is the patellotrochlear index (PTI), which is measured in the midsagital MRI as the ratio of the length of trochlear cartilage engaged with the patella to the patellar cartilage length. PTI of less than 12.5% suggests the presence of patella alta. Each of the mentioned assessment methods of patella alta has its own advantages and limitations. As an example, although the Insall–Salvati ratio is one of the most commonly used methods and does not depend on the degree of knee flexion, it is affected by the patellar shape particularly its inferior point and measurement does not change after tibial tubercle distalization procedure. On the other hand, the PTI is significantly altered with knee flexion.

### Linear correlation between patellar positioning and rotation of the lower limb in radiographic imaging: a 3D simulation study [^2116060d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

3D simulation of rotation

For each model the alignment parameters in the neutral position with 0° of rotation were determined as the initial values for all subsequent measurements. The leg was then rotated along the longitudinal axis in 1° increments up to 15° internally (-) and 15° externally (+) and after every rotational step, the HKA, MAD, MPTA and the deviation of the patella from the zero position were measured (Fig. 3). Accordingly, for every model 31 positions of rotation and 1860 positions were obtained in total.

Fig. 3
Deviation of the patellar midpoint (PM) in relation to the tibial centre of the knee (TKC) with 15° internal rotation; model aligned in 15° internal rotation; patella centralized between the femoral condyles and condyles unparallel to the imaging detector; PM almost congruent with projected (green arrow) TKC' point; changes in alignment of the patella due to rotation was measured by the length of the projected connection between PM and TKC' (red arrow like in Fig. 2);

Comparison of patella centralisation with neutral position

The aim was to quantify alignment changes within image pairs of one image in true AP position with a centralized patella and one knee forward image with femoral condyles parallel to the imaging detector. For every model, the rotational position with the patella centralized between the femoral condyles was compared with the zero position in knee forward orientation showing the femoral condyles parallel to the imaging detector (Fig. 4).

Projection into the two-dimensional coronary plane

In addition to the common surveys of 3D angles, all measurements were projected into the coronal plane to mimic 2D radiographic imaging to assess the shortcomings of 2D imaging compared to 3D reality. To generate valid angular and distance measurements, all points, angles, and distances, were calculated using a Python script to ensure an automated and standardised method.

### Dynamic mediolateral patellar translation is a sex-and size-independent parameter of adult proximal patellar tracking using dynamic 3 tesla magnetic resonance imaging [^8c118115]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide normal values for physiological patellofemoral tracking in a representative group of healthy individuals, as well as sex differences, using real-time 3T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to test for the reliability of the presented technique.

Methods

One hundred knees of healthy individuals with no history of patellofemoral symptoms were scanned with dynamic MRI sequences, during repetitive cycles of flexion (40°) and full extension. Within a 30-seconds time-frame, three simultaneous, transverse slices were acquired. Dynamic mediolateral patellar translation (dMPT) and dynamic patellar tilt (dPT) were measured on two occasions by two independent examiners. Common radiological parameters were measured using static MRI, and correlations were calculated.

Results

100 knees (53 right, 47 left; age: 26.7 ± 4.4 years; BMI: 22.5 ± 3.1) of 57 individuals (27 females, 30 males) were included. Mean height was 170.1 ± 7.7 cm in women and 181.8 ± 6.4 cm in men. Average patella diameter was 37.9 ± 2.7 (95% CI 37.1–38.7) mm in women and 42.4 ± 3.2 (95% CI 41.5–43.3) mm in men. In females, the patellar diameters and intercondylar distances were significantly smaller than in males (P < .001). Radiological parameters for patellar maltracking were within the normal range. During the range of motion, mean dMPT was 1.7 ± 2.4 (95% CI .9–2.5) mm in females and 1.8 ± 2.7 (95% CI 1.1–2.6) mm in males (P = 0.766). Mean dPT was 1.3 ± 2.9° (95% CI .4–2.1°) in females and -0.2 ± 3.8° (95% CI -1.2-.9°) in males (P = 0.036). Neither dMPT nor dPT was correlated with height, BMI, or patellar diameter. Intercondylar distance correlated weakly with dPT (r = -.241; P = 0.041). Intra- and interrater reliability were excellent for dMPT and dPT.

Conclusion

Dynamic mediolateral patellar translation is a size- and sex-independent parameter for proximal patellar tracking. In healthy individuals without patellofemoral abnormalities normal dMPT proximal to the trochlea groove was 1.7 ± 2.5 (1.2–2.2) mm, independent of size or sex. Normal dPT showed a dependency on sex and was 1.3 ± 2.9 (.4–2.1)° in women and -0.2 ± 3.8 (-1.2–0.9)° in men.

Investigations

The postreduction X-rays (figure 3) showed adequate positioning of the patella in the trochlear groove. The patellar height was measured at 1.2, using the Caton-Deschamps index. An MRI (figure 4) postreduction was performed and revealed no intra-articular pathology, with an intact quadriceps tendon and no intra-articular fragments. The MRI did however identify the presence of osteophytes at the superior pole of the patella and in the intercondylar notch, confirming the hypothesis of an intra-articular entrapment of the patella due to the trapped osteophytes of the superior pole of the patella into the intercondylar notch.

### A radiological index that influences the outcome following patellofemoral joint arthroplasty: the anterior trochlea offset ratio [^3560b866]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although patellofemoral joint arthroplasty (PFA) is largely successful, there remains a group of patients who experience poor functional outcome following surgery. This is likely related to either progression of tibiofemoral arthritis, or alteration of PFJ biomechanics resulting in persistent PFJ pain and dysfunction.

Implant positioning during PFA can affect PFJ biomechanics however the relationship between measurements of the former and clinical symptoms or functional outcome is yet to be established. 'Overstuffing' of the PFJ has not been clearly defined in the literature, although it has been proposed to increase patella-related complications following TKA. A number of papers have attempted to describe PFJ 'overstuffing' and have reported measures of anterior offset or patella thickness on radiographs and tried to relate these to outcome, without success. These measures could be criticized, however, for lacking any method of normalizing the measurements to the patient's size or scaling of the radiographs, resulting in an underestimation of the true effects of component mal-position. Furthermore, the effect of other radiological parameters on outcome following PFA, such as varus/valgus, flexion/extension, and the implant width, have not been confirmed. Identifying such factors would be invaluable as they would direct the surgeon as to what the optimal implant positioning should be intra-operatively. Post-operatively there is also the potential for retrospective application of any proven index in the assessment of painful PFAs.

The aims of this study were to develop one or more methods of quantifying the radiographic positioning of a PFA referenced against individual patient anatomy, and to determine if abnormalities in these measures are related to functional outcome. It was hypothesized that higher radiological anterior offset of the trochlea component correlates with poor outcome post-operatively given that it indicates an increase in the overall height of the patellofemoral construct and therefore "overstuffing".

### Management of first-time patellar dislocation: the ESSKA 2024 formal consensus-part 1 [^88363c5c]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

First‐time patellar dislocation (FTPD) as defined below is a common orthopaedic problem and this consensus handles the treatment covering all ages. In patients under 15 years of age, it is the most common cause of knee hemarthrosis. Patients with dislocated patellae are typically transferred acutely to the emergency room by ambulance, or they are seen in the office weeks after the injury for the first time, or at any point in between. This demonstrates the wide variety of this type of injury, ranging from dramatic and acute to less severe. The reason for this is the numerous different factors and circumstances that lead to one final condition — patellar dislocation. Therefore, the symptoms of patellar instability can have completely different histories and pathogeneses, which sometimes make this field complex.

In recent years, increasing knowledge has been gained in understanding the patellofemoral joint. Risk factors are continuously clarified and are relatively clearly defined. Similarly, the biomechanics leading to patellar instability are delineated step by step, and new therapeutic strategies have been established. Our treatment, especially surgical treatment, has therefore changed substantially in recent years, and we are making good progress with respect to clinical data.

This consensus encompasses FTPD, and when we searched the literature, we identified some inconsistencies in the definition. This can potentially lead to incomparable data and scientific fraud; therefore, the consensus group suggests a simple definition to be used in future scientific projects.

"FTPD is the first‐time event when the patella completely leaves the trochlear groove. The event has to be confirmed clinically and/or radiologically".

This unification will help to obtain comparable data and eventually clarify some data variations in the literature. The real incidence of FTPD, for example, is somewhat unclear, and the available data are heterogeneous due to differences in the inclusion criteria. The incidence of FTPD is age‐related and is highest during growth spurt. It usually occurs in patients younger than 18 years of age, with a tendency toward female patients. FTPDs in adults older than 25 years are uncommon. The reported overall incidence varies between 10 and 150/100,000 patient years and may be region‐specific, as the reported numbers have high deviations.

### Patellofemoral pain [^c701b999]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain — diagnostic test accuracy indicates that most clinical tests have limited performance and highlights two tests with reported likelihood ratios. Systematic reviews state that the majority of clinical tests have poor diagnostic accuracy and that clusters of tests are no more accurate than individual tests. A high-quality review found reproduction of retropatellar pain during squatting (positive likelihood ratio [+LR] = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.3; negative likelihood ratio [–LR] = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.4) and hypomobility with the patellar tilt test (+LR = 5.4; 95% CI: 1.4, 20.8; –LR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.5, 0.8) to be the most accurate tests. Diagnosis is described as challenging due to differing reference standards, and the best diagnostic tests at this time are those that provoke anterior knee pain during functional activities when the patellofemoral joint is loaded in a flexed-knee position. A large majority of individuals with patellofemoral pain reported at least some difficulty with squatting (93.7%), stair negotiation (91.2%), and running (90.8%).

### Is tibiofemoral or patellofemoral alignment or trochlear morphology associated with patellofemoral osteoarthritis? A systematic review [^4583f9d5]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the associations of knee alignment or trochlear morphology (measured on imaging) with presence, severity, onset, and/or progression of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA).

Methods

We prospectively registered our protocol with PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews) and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to report this review. We searched 10 electronic databases, screened citing articles, and reviewed reference lists. We extracted data and evaluated methodologic quality. Due to study design heterogeneity, we used a best-evidence synthesis to summarize the evidence.

Results

We included 16 publications (2,892 participants, 66% women) after removing 4 papers that did not meet our threshold for methodologic quality. There were 11 cross-sectional and 5 longitudinal papers. The target population was knee OA in 11 studies, PFOA in 2 studies, and other knee conditions in 3 studies. Alignment or morphology was measured using radiographs in 8 studies, magnetic resonance imaging in 7 studies, and computed tomography in 2 papers. Limitations include substantial heterogeneity in samples and methods, short followup times in longitudinal studies, and a small number of studies that specifically recruited participants with PFOA.

Conclusion

There is strong evidence that PFOA is associated with both trochlear morphology and frontal plane knee alignment, while evidence is limited but consistent in the sagittal and axial planes. These findings suggest that alignment should be evaluated clinically in individuals with PFOA. Clinical interventions targeting knee alignment warrant further investigation.

### Patellar maltracking: an update on the diagnosis and treatment strategies [^317813b0]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Chondral and osteochondral injuries

An imbalance of forces acting on the patellofemoral joint due to abnormal bony geometry or altered function of the active and passive soft tissue restraints may result in abnormalities of alignment and tracking of the patella. Stress and shear forces that follow can result in cartilage damage and the development and evolution of osteoarthritis.

MRI, given its superior soft tissue contrast and multi-planar capability, has emerged as the modality of choice in evaluating articular cartilage abnormalities. It has proven to be both sensitive and specific in the detection of hyaline cartilage abnormalities.

An association has been demonstrated between patellofemoral cartilage damage and patellar maltracking. A study has found that the femoral groove tends to be shallower in osteoarthritis patients compared to those with normal cartilage, regardless of age. Significantly greater lateral patellar displacement and tilt was found in osteoarthritis patients compared to a control group. Another study noted an association between abnormal trochlear morphology and high-grade patellofemoral cartilage damage. It was shown that certain features of patellar maltracking (increased sulcus angle, lateral patellar tilt, and a higher patellar tendon to patellar length ratio) are associated with cartilage loss and bone marrow lesions.

On the other hand, frank patellar dislocation is a significant risk factor in the development of patellofemoral osteoarthritis with an incidence of 49% at 25 years after the patellar dislocation incident in comparison with 8% in a control group without a dislocation history. Lateral patellar dislocation results in bone contusion at the medial patella and along the lateral aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. The patellar usually relocates, and the typical bone contusions are the key MRI features to diagnose transient lateral patellar dislocation (Fig. 7). Osteochondral fractures are common in acute or recurrent transient lateral patellar dislocation, seen in up to 70% of cases. These are most often found at the inferomedial patella or the lateral femoral condyle.

### Patellofemoral evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging in 51 knees of asymptomatic subjects [^94597c64]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Is the MRI now shown to be reliable on evaluating the patellofemoral joint? We only looked at a limited number of measurements that we thought important. We did not evaluate all patellofemoral measurements using MRI previously described by other authors. Patella alta has been thoroughly researched by numerous authors which all came to the conclusion that MRI is a suitable imaging technique for measuring patella alta, showing good inter- and intra-observer reliability among the different methods of measuring patella alta, although the more recently introduced patellotrochlear index by Biedert et al. showed poor correlation in assessing patella alta when compared with the more conventional methods such as the Blackburne-Peel, Caton-Deschamps, and Insall Salvati ratios. The tibial tubercle–trochlear groove distance (TT-TG) has been studied by Schoettle et al. and the bony and cartilaginous landmarks of the trochlea have been studied by Huyssteen et al. Schoettle et al. showed that TT-TG can be reliably determined on MRI. They found an inter-observer and intra-observer variability comparable to the results in this study.

### Three-dimensional imaging of the patellofemoral joint improves understanding of trochlear anatomy and pathology and planning of realignment [^aa9eea54]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Three-dimensional (3D) modeling using digital or printed models provides a unique perspective that caters to cognitive spatial ability in a way that can add to our understanding and mental representations of human anatomy. This is particularly useful in the setting of trochlear dysplasia, where the morphology of the groove can exhibit substantial variability and complexity. Using 3D reformatted images and models, a pragmatic understanding of how morphology influences patellofemoral pathology can be gleaned. Further, this perspective facilitates cognition of what patellar tracking may look like after realignment procedures. Using 3D modeling, concepts such as patella alta, trochlear depth, lateralization of the patellar entry point, trochlear curvature, and the presence of a proximal trochlear spur can help afford a better understanding of how trochlear anatomy may influence tracking while also providing insight as to the ideal tracking path. The use of 3D has recently emerged as a useful tool in multiple surgical subspecialties, particularly in situations involving surgical planning or complex anatomy. Given the complexity and variation in trochlear morphology in patients with trochlear dysplasia who develop either patellar instability or focal overloading, 3D modeling is well-suited to provide a perspective that can add to our understanding of trochlear dysplasia, and potentially even how we diagnose and treat it. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V, expert opinion.
