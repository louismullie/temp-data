## Question

Fibromyalgia and burning mouth syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between fibromyalgia and burning mouth syndrome, including pathophysiology, comorbidity, diagnostic approach, and treatment implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and primary burning mouth syndrome. Then, I should verify the evidence for clinical overlap and comorbidity. Next, I will examine shared pathophysiological mechanisms, including central sensitization, small fiber neuropathy, and neuroimmune contributions. After that, I need to check the strength of evidence for treatment cross-applicability and mechanism-based choices. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic and management framework and highlight uncertainties and research gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the core definitions so I don't anchor on assumptions. Fibromyalgia is a chronic widespread pain syndrome with multisystem features and central sensitization, typically diagnosed clinically using ACR criteria and characterized by hyperalgesia and allodynia, fatigue, sleep and cognitive disturbances, and frequent comorbid functional disorders, with a female predominance and a global prevalence around 2% in adults [^111FmLVG] [^111ktDas]. Primary burning mouth syndrome is defined as chronic intraoral burning or dysesthetic sensation recurring daily for more than 3 months, without clinically evident causative lesions or systemic disease, and is most prevalent in postmenopausal women with a general population prevalence near 1% and higher in clinical cohorts, which already hints at demographic overlap with fibromyalgia [^116etpkc] [^112yN1Sw].

> Wait, let me verify the comorbidity signal before drawing conclusions. Multiple lines of evidence support a clinically meaningful association between fibromyalgia and burning mouth syndrome within the broader spectrum of chronic overlapping pain conditions. Expert stakeholder reviews explicitly list burning mouth syndrome among COPCs that frequently co-occur with fibromyalgia, reflecting shared pain phenotypes and possibly overlapping mechanisms [^115yxSzA]. Observational data in fibromyalgia cohorts show high rates of oral symptoms including glossodynia, xerostomia, dysgeusia, and temporomandibular dysfunction, reinforcing orofacial pain clustering with fibromyalgia [^1166iNMA]. Moreover, patients with orofacial pain in sensory and autonomic neuropathy cohorts demonstrate high rates of comorbid COPCs such as fibromyalgia and migraine, supporting a mechanistic link rather than mere diagnostic co-occurrence [^113bzFFs]. I should also note that large epidemiologic cohorts show BMS patients have substantially higher incidence of depression and anxiety, which mirrors fibromyalgia's psychiatric comorbidity burden and may reflect shared central pain–mood circuitry [^112ws2Br].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking convergent data. Central sensitization is a hallmark of fibromyalgia and appears operative in a subset of BMS, with neuroimaging and quantitative sensory testing demonstrating altered pain processing and deficient descending inhibition in both conditions, aligning with a central neuropathic pain phenotype in some BMS patients [^111FmLVG] [^116etpkc]. Small fiber neuropathy emerges as a plausible bridge: meta-analytic and clinical data suggest SFN may complicate fibromyalgia in roughly half of cases, and focal or non–length dependent SFN can involve trigeminal territories, providing a peripheral substrate for BMS in a subset of patients [^113bzFFs] [^1149CmBK]. I need to ensure I also consider neuroimmune contributions; pain-sensitizing autoantibodies and cytokine dysregulation have been proposed in fibromyalgia and BMS, respectively, though causality remains under investigation and should be interpreted cautiously [^115yxSzA] [^111WBtPE].

> Let me consider diagnostic implications carefully, because misclassification can derail management. Both BMS and fibromyalgia are diagnoses of exclusion, so I should double-check for secondary causes of oral burning and for alternative explanations of widespread pain before labeling patients. In suspected BMS, I need to exclude local disease, nutritional deficiencies, endocrine or autoimmune etiologies, medication effects, and infections, and then consider whether the phenotype fits a peripheral versus central neuropathic subtype, as this may influence treatment choice and prognosis [^111N2Smh] [^112yN1Sw]. In suspected fibromyalgia, I should confirm chronic widespread pain with multisystem features and screen for COPCs including BMS, TMD, IBS, and migraine, using validated tools and clinical judgment rather than relying on any single biomarker, which do not yet reliably distinguish subtypes or predict treatment response [^111wqjCw] [^113eYp2c]. But wait, what if the patient has both? That co-occurrence should prompt me to look for SFN with appropriate testing when indicated, because identifying a peripheral driver may broaden therapeutic options beyond purely central agents [^113bzFFs].

> Next, I should review treatment cross-applicability and make sure I'm not overextending low-quality evidence. For BMS, the best-supported interventions include topical clonazepam rinses, capsaicin rinses, and cognitive behavioral therapy, with alpha-lipoic acid showing mixed but sometimes beneficial effects in longer-term assessments; these are reasonable first-line options given tolerability and the balance of benefit–risk [^115yv5Wr] [^112eCZpB] [^111URWpB]. For fibromyalgia, SNRIs such as duloxetine and milnacipran, and α₂δ-ligands such as pregabalin, are recommended for pain, sleep, and mood symptoms, and their mechanisms plausibly address central sensitization and comorbid affective symptoms [^111FmLVG]. I should confirm whether duloxetine has any BMS-specific signal; case-level evidence and orofacial pain literature suggest potential benefit in idiopathic dentoalveolar pain and BMS, likely via dual serotonergic–noradrenergic modulation of trigeminal nociception, though randomized BMS trials are limited and confirmation is needed [^111LJTKe] [^111veJSd]. Hold on, I should verify safety and tolerability in the oral cavity; duloxetine generally has fewer anticholinergic effects than TCAs, which can be advantageous in patients with xerostomia, but nausea and early adverse effects require slow titration and counseling to maintain adherence [^111veJSd].

> I will now examine whether mechanism-based stratification can refine choices. If BMS appears peripherally mediated with evidence of trigeminal small fiber involvement or response to topical agents, topical clonazepam or capsaicin, and consideration of peripheral nerve blocks may be prioritized, whereas if the phenotype is centrally mediated with prominent sleep and mood comorbidity, CBT and centrally acting agents such as duloxetine or pregabalin may be more appropriate; this stratification mirrors evolving BMS subtyping frameworks and fibromyalgia's central pain model, though overlap is common and requires individualized reassessment over time [^112yN1Sw] [^111FmLVG]. Let me reconsider nonpharmacologic care because I initially thought massage was guideline-endorsed for fibromyalgia broadly; wait, I should double-check that. The AAFP 2020 chronic musculoskeletal pain guideline supports massage or myofascial release for fibromyalgia, whereas the 2013 Canadian fibromyalgia guideline found insufficient evidence for complementary therapies, so I should frame massage as conditionally reasonable based on patient preference and access rather than as a uniform standard [^111FmLVG] [^111hyKzt].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic workup is systematic and avoids premature closure. For a patient presenting with oral burning and widespread pain, I should simultaneously evaluate for secondary causes of BMS and apply ACR-based clinical criteria for fibromyalgia, while screening for COPCs including TMD, IBS, migraine, and mood disorders, because these comorbidities shape both prognosis and treatment response; sleep quality should be assessed given its bidirectional relationship with pain severity in chronic orofacial and body pain conditions [^111wqjCw] [^11545XmX]. If clinical suspicion for SFN is high, I should consider skin biopsy or autonomic testing, recognizing that non–length dependent and focal SFN can involve the orofacial region and may coexist with fibromyalgia, which can redirect therapy toward combined peripheral and central strategies [^113bzFFs].

> Let me synthesize a practical management approach, but I should confirm that each element aligns with the evidence base. Education and reassurance about the chronic pain nature of both conditions and the absence of tissue injury are foundational, with early integration of CBT-based coping strategies to mitigate catastrophizing and improve function, especially when mood symptoms are present [^112eCZpB]. For BMS, initiate topical clonazepam or capsaicin rinses and reassess in 4–6 weeks; if response is partial or unsatisfactory, consider adding duloxetine or pregabalin for central sensitization and comorbid pain, mood, or sleep symptoms, titrating slowly to minimize adverse effects and monitoring for oral tolerability [^115yv5Wr] [^111LJTKe]. For fibromyalgia, prioritize nonpharmacologic modalities such as exercise, sleep hygiene, and CBT, and add SNRIs or α₂δ-ligands based on the most bothersome symptoms, tailoring to comorbidities and patient goals; consider topical agents for focal orofacial pain when appropriate, acknowledging that evidence quality varies and shared decision-making is essential [^116bYrwP]. I should double-check for drug–drug interactions and anticholinergic burden, particularly in patients with xerostomia, and adjust the plan iteratively based on response and tolerability [^1165Hkuy].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and research gaps so we don't overstate conclusions. The causal relationship between fibromyalgia and BMS remains unclear, and much of the linkage is inferred from comorbidity patterns, shared central sensitization biology, and SFN overlap rather than prospective mechanistic studies; high-quality randomized trials are sparse in BMS, and head-to-head comparisons across mechanism-based subtypes are needed to validate stratified treatment approaches [^112vB4S6] [^115yxSzA]. Biomarkers, including CSF and salivary analytes, are promising but not yet clinically actionable for routine diagnosis or treatment selection in either condition, so clinical phenotyping and careful exclusion of secondary causes remain the cornerstone of care pending further validation [^111ktDas] [^117E9Pyv]. Until then, a pragmatic, mechanism-informed, and patient-centered approach that integrates education, nonpharmacologic therapies, and judicious pharmacotherapy, while screening for COPCs and SFN, offers the best alignment with current evidence and patient needs [^111wqjCw] [^113bzFFs].

Fibromyalgia and burning mouth syndrome (BMS) are **chronic pain conditions** with overlapping features, including central sensitization [^111FmLVG] [^112yN1Sw], small fiber neuropathy [^111Js51z], and autonomic dysfunction [^113bzFFs]. Both are more common in women and often co-occur, suggesting shared pathophysiology [^114rAUqk] [^112iQEVE] [^115yxSzA]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, combining pharmacologic (duloxetine, gabapentin, topical clonazepam) [^111LJTKe] [^116D4MA6] [^115yv5Wr] and nonpharmacologic (CBT, acupuncture, capsaicin) [^112eCZpB] [^1151uPNb] [^111URWpB] therapies. BMS is a diagnosis of exclusion [^1144huw6]; rule out local and systemic causes before confirming it [^111N2Smh].

---

## Pathophysiological similarities

### Central sensitization

Fibromyalgia involves **central sensitization** with amplified pain perception and hyperalgesia [^111FmLVG]. BMS similarly shows **central sensitization** with abnormal trigeminal nociceptive processing [^116etpkc].

---

### Small fiber neuropathy

Fibromyalgia commonly features **small fiber neuropathy** [^113bzFFs], with reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density [^111Js51z]. BMS also shows **small fiber involvement**, with reduced corneal nerve fibers and abnormal QST [^116etpkc].

---

### Autonomic dysfunction

Fibromyalgia involves **autonomic dysregulation**, including sympathetic hyperactivity [^116iDeJA]. BMS likewise shows **autonomic dysfunction**, with altered salivary flow and cardiovascular autonomic abnormalities [^111Js51z].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

| **Feature** | **Fibromyalgia** | **Burning mouth syndrome** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary symptoms | Chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction [^111FmLVG] | Chronic intraoral burning, dysgeusia, xerostomia [^116etpkc] |
| Diagnostic criteria | ACR 2010/2016: WPI ≥ 7 and SSS ≥ 5, or WPI 3–6 and SSS ≥ 9 [^notfound] | Diagnosis of exclusion: normal oral mucosa, no systemic/local causes [^111VMYwW] |
| Gender prevalence | Female predominance (female:male ≈ 2–3:1) [^notfound] | Female predominance (especially postmenopausal) [^112yN1Sw] |
| Comorbidities | Depression, anxiety, IBS, migraines, chronic fatigue [^112iQEVE] | Depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances [^112xN3SV] |

---

## Comorbidity and overlapping conditions

Fibromyalgia and BMS frequently co-occur with other **chronic overlapping pain conditions** (COPCs) such as IBS, TMD, and chronic fatigue syndrome [^115yxSzA] [^113bzFFs]. Both are associated with depression and anxiety, suggesting shared psychosocial and neurobiological pathways [^112ws2Br] [^1121KAcT].

---

## Treatment approaches

### Pharmacological treatments

- **Duloxetine**: SNRI effective for fibromyalgia [^notfound] and case reports suggest benefit in BMS [^111LJTKe].
- **Gabapentin**: Effective for fibromyalgia [^notfound]; limited but supportive evidence in BMS [^notfound].
- **Topical clonazepam**: Evidence-based for BMS [^115yv5Wr]; limited data in fibromyalgia.
- **Alpha-lipoic acid**: Modest benefit in BMS [^1127QWNY]; limited data in fibromyalgia.

---

### Non-pharmacological treatments

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Effective for both conditions, improving pain, mood, and quality of life [^112eCZpB] [^116bYrwP].
- **Acupuncture**: Promising adjunct in BMS [^1151uPNb]; limited but supportive evidence in fibromyalgia.
- **Capsaicin rinses**: Effective for BMS [^111URWpB]; limited data in fibromyalgia.

---

## Diagnostic challenges

Both conditions lack definitive biomarkers, relying on **clinical criteria** and exclusion of other causes [^113eYp2c] [^113SAQA2]. BMS requires exclusion of local and systemic causes, including nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, and medication side effects [^111N2Smh] [^111BGcUQ].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Both conditions are chronic with significant impacts on **quality of life**, psychological health, and daily functioning [^111FmLVG] [^112ws2Br]. Effective management improves outcomes, but symptoms often persist long term [^117FwTo5] [^1127QWNY] [^111eXHka] [^114JK1qp].

---

Fibromyalgia and BMS share **central sensitization**, small fiber neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction, and often co-occur with mood disorders. Management is **multidisciplinary**, combining pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies, with treatment tailored to symptom severity and comorbidities.

Discussion

Facets of FMS

This category includes recommendations about aspects of fibromyalgia features and associated symptoms that should be considered in all future Aab research.

There was high stakeholder agreement on the necessity to clearly outline diagnostic and phenotyping criteria in any research going forward as, for example, patient populations markedly differ between diagnostic categories such as ACR 2010, ACR 2016.
Stakeholders considered that research should attempt to classify FMS subtypes. FMS appears clinically heterogeneous. Antibody prevalence and specificity, along with familiar prevalence, genetic variants, clinical presentations, and treatment responses may support the definition of FMS sub-phenotypes, with implications for clinical management.
Antibody research should be broadened:
Research should investigate Aab contribution to polysensory hyper-responsiveness and other FMS features including fatigue and cognitive problems, including in the recent rodent 'transfer' models where IgG taken from FMS patients is injected to rodents causing abnormalities resembling FMS in these animals.
The contribution of Aab to chronic pain conditions associated with " fibromyalgianess", below the ACR 2016 score threshold for the diagnosis of FMS, and in chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) should be investigated. Fibromyalgianess is an emerging concept; it describes a symptom complex variably comprised of fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive symptoms, poly-sensory hyper-responsiveness, and psychological co-morbidities. Risk factors for this phenotype include female sex, regional or widespread pains and exposure to stressors, but it seems independent of both known peripheral triggers or individual psychopathology. COPCs include conditions such as chronic pelvic pain, painful bladder syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain, burning mouth syndrome, post-traumatic chronic pain, chronic fatigue, and others. It is more rule than exception that people with FMS have suffered or are suffering from COPCs, and how antibodies contribute to these pain phenotypes (both with and without presence of FMS) would be important to investigate.

Antidepressants

BMS has been strongly associated with depression and anxiety, and the lack of clarity between them is unsettling. This neurophysiological mechanism in BMS was shown in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and quantitative somatosensory testing (QST) study. fMRI study has reported an increase in the region's functional neural activity regulating depression and anxiety in BMS patients. It is known that chronic anxiety and depression may disturb neuroprotective steroid productions. As pain could be a somatic trait, the use of an antidepressant has suggested the role of anxiety and depression in BMS pathogenesis.

Trazodone

Trazodone is a second-generation antidepressant that has been considered a multifunctional drug and acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Trazodone has been used in treating anxiety and pain symptoms, including fibromyalgia. However, in this review, trazodone use did not significantly affect pain reduction and had a high placebo effect. The reported high adverse effects on dizziness and drowsiness limit its use.

Citalopram

Citalopram has shown to be able to reduce pain intensity. A review of SSRIs such as zimelidine, sertraline, citalopram, paroxetine, and fluoxetine has suggested it for the treatment of chronic pain conditions. The SSRI citalopram has similar antidepressant and analgesic properties to tricyclic antidepressants but with significantly fewer side effects and better tolerability. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in both central and peripheral nociception and mood regulation. SSRIs inhibit serotonin's reuptake and prolong its availability in the synaptic cleft. There was inconclusive effectiveness in treating chronic pain with SSRIs. Inconclusive results were observed from various studies on its use for chronic somatoform pain and fibromyalgia. As there is no placebo group in comparing the efficacy of citalopram in reducing burning mouth and less than 50% of patients recovered from depression and anxiety, there is limited evidence to support its use. Clinical trials with better methodology and low risk bias are needed to conclude the effect of SSRI as a treatment for chronic pain conditions.

Phytomedicine

The perspective of using herbal medicine or phytomedicine has been established and increased in primary health care. The efficacy of phytomedicines such as capsaicin, herbal catuama, umPEA and hypericum perforatum have demonstrated their analgesia ability, with capsaicin having a tremendous number of patients in responding to it. Through well-designed randomised control trials and observational studies, phytomedicine has a tremendous future to be used solely or as adjunct therapy in treatment therapeutic strategies and products.

### Burning mouth syndrome responsive to duloxetine: a case report [^111LJTKe]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic, idiopathic, intraoral mucosal pain condition in the absence of specific oral lesions and systemic disease. Among evidence-based pharmacological treatments for this disorder, topical and systemic clonazepam, levosulpiride, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been used with partial results.

Case

We report a case of a 65-year-old otherwise healthy woman with a 3-year history of oral burning. Clinical and laboratory evaluations allowed us to make a diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome. She was treated with duloxetine (60 mg p.o. qd), a selective serotonin, and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, obtaining a complete remission of symptoms, evaluated via standardized clinical rating scales, and an improvement of her quality of life and level of functioning.

Discussion

The pathogenesis of BMS still remains unclear. Recently, it has been suggested an underlying neuropathic mechanism, demonstrating a dysfunction in the trigeminal nociceptive pathways at peripheral and/or central nervous system level. The rationale behind the administration of duloxetine resides in its central mechanism of action, and analgesic effects previously demonstrated in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and fibromyalgia. Also, it has been shown to reduce painful physical symptoms associated with depression.

Conclusion

We hypothesize that duloxetine might represent a useful, effective, and additional therapeutic option in the treatment of BMS.

### Association between pharmacotherapy and sleep quality in patients with chronic orofacial and chronic body pain: a cross-sectional study [^11545XmX]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sleep plays an essential role in regulating critical mechanisms within the human body. It is well known that sleep regulates brain functions and controls systemic physiological aspects, eg, metabolism, appetite, immune, hormonal and cardiovascular systems. A recent cross-sectional study has shown that health status is an important factor affecting sleep and approximately 70.6% of individuals with very good/excellent health reported good/very good sleep quality and only 4.3% rated their sleep quality as poor or very poor. In contrast, evidence suggests a strong relationship between sleep and chronic pain, estimating that the prevalence of sleep disturbance ranges between 50% and 80% in patients with chronic pain. Moreover, a bidirectional association has also been reported, indicating that in most chronic painful conditions, a night of poor sleep may be followed by increased pain, which in turn may lead to poor sleep.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are often sources of chronic pain that can alter sleep patterns and lead to comorbid sleep impairments. It is known that painful TMDs significantly impact sleep quality. Similarly, sleep quality can be progressively worsened prior to the onset of painful TMD. It has recently been suggested that disturbed sleep might also be a risk factor for jaw functional limitation in patients with painful TMD. In addition, other chronic painful conditions affecting the orofacial region, eg, burning mouth syndrome;, trigeminal neuralgia; painful posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy, as well as adults with migraine, particularly those with chronic migraine, tension-type headacheand cervicogenic headaches, report worse subjective sleep quality (SQ) than healthy individuals.

There is a clear association between other chronic body pain conditions and sleep disorders. Recent studies have demonstrated poorer SQ in patients with chronic widespread pain; fibromyalgia;, symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis; low back pain; endometriosisand irritable bowel syndrome.

### Are adults with chronic pain more likely to develop hypertension than adults without chronic pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113WVncE]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.2.3 for Windows using the RStudio integrated development environment (version 2024.12.1–563, RStudio Team, Boston, MA, USA). To avoid duplication of participant data where studies analysed the same population sample, we selected the study with the most complete reporting of raw data for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the ORs was performed using the meta package, and the random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled risk. We conducted an overall comparison across all included papers; where there were mixed CP cohorts, the group with the largest sample population was chosen for meta-analysis. We also made comparisons according to pain subtype, including chronic widespread pain (CWP), chronic headache, burning mouth syndrome (BMS), and chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain. Studies including adults with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) were included in the CWP analysis. For the chronic MSK pain analysis, we combined results from studies that examined chronic MSK pain, chronic back pain (CBP), chronic joint pain, and chronic knee pain (CKP). We also performed a subgroup analysis by gender. Study heterogeneity was calculated using the I² statistic, the Cochran Q statistic, and the Cochran Q P -value.

### Correlation between orofacial pain and sensory and autonomic neuropathies [^111Js51z]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a disorder of thinly myelinated A-delta and non-myelinated C- fibers. The clinical presentation is heterogenous and characterized by clinical signs of neuropathy with either a positive skin biopsy or positive autonomic function testing or both. Nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, cramps, and deep aching pain can also occur due to involvement of polymodal muscle afferents. The diagnosis of SFN is based on typical complaints, combined with abnormal intraepidermal nerve fiber density in skin biopsy and/or abnormal temperature threshold testing levels, without signs of large nerve fiber involvement.SFN can be length-dependent involving a typical sock and glove pattern, non-length dependent where different parts of the body can be involved in a patchy pattern or focal involving a circumscribed area only. Focal and non-length dependent (NLD) SFNs have been shown to involve the orofacial region. For instance, reduced small fiber nerve density is an underlying cause in idiopathic burning mouth syndrome. Also, association has been shown between SFN and several chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia, chronic regional pain syndromes, and unexplained widespread chronic pain conditions. Therefore, it is possible that certain patients presenting with chronic OFP conditions can also have an underlying SFN.

Our study aims to assess the prevalence of OFP in a large cohort of patients with sensory and autonomic neuropathies and assess the correlation between OFP and results of skin biopsy testing, autonomic dysfunction, primary headaches, chronic nociceptive and neuropathic pain, psychological conditions, and individual patient factors, such as BMI and mean age.

### Correlation between orofacial pain and sensory and autonomic neuropathies [^113bzFFs]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of OFP in a large cohort of patients with sensory and/or autonomic neuropathies and found that more than 20% (n = 102) of these patients had OFP. We speculate these numbers to be higher because this study has several limitations, which are mentioned below. Also, in this study, patients who had OFP symptoms presented with a high number of other chronic overlapping pain conditions, like migraines, which were present in 39.2% (n = 40) patients, and other primary headaches and chronic nociceptive and neuropathic pain, in more than half the patients with OFP. This aligns with the concept of coexisting pain conditions, or chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs), a concept that has been recognized by the National Institutes of Health and the US Congress as a set of disorders that can occur simultaneously in patients and include, but should not be limited to, temporomandibular disorder (TMD), fibromyalgia (FM), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), vulvodynia, chronic tension-type headache, migraine headaches to name a few. Collectively, these conditions are increasingly referred to. Most of these conditions are defined as idiopathic, 'as not being able to be explained by injury or pathology in the tissues from which the pain originates'.

The clinical presentation of SFN is heterogeneous, with no single clinical pattern fitting all presentations.SFN was thought to be rare, but an epidemiological study in the Netherlands reported an incidence of 12 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per year and a prevalence of 53 cases per 100,000. In the past few decades, an increasing number of studies widened the spectrum of diseases associated with small nerve fiber degeneration, such as fibromyalgia, chronic regional pain syndrome, painful erythromelalgia, burning mouth syndrome, etc. — conditions that are increasingly recognized to fall under COPC spectrum. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed fibromyalgia to be complicated by SFN in 49% of cases. Is it possible that the other conditions that overlap with fibromyalgia but are idiopathic, for example, TMDs and BMS, are also complicated by SFN?

### How well Do current laboratory biomarkers inform clinical decision-making in chronic pain management? [^117E9Pyv]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to cortisol, other notable salivary biomarkers were investigated in fibromyalgia patients. Bazzichi et al conducted a proteomic analysis of saliva in 22 fibromyalgia patients and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy control patients. This study reported significant over-expression of salivary transaldolase, calgranulin A and C, and phosphoglycerate mutase I. To further assess changes in salivary biomarkers with treatment in fibromyalgia patients, another pre- and post-treatment study by Bazzichi et al measured phosphoglycerate mutase I levels in fibromyalgia patients who received mud-bath therapy (n = 21) and balneotherapy (n = 20). This study reported significant reductions in phosphoglycerate mutase I levels after both mud-bath and balneotherapy.

Similar to fibromyalgia, another manifestation of spontaneous pain with hyperalgesia, referred pain, and association with psychological comorbidities like depression and anxiety is temporomandibular disorder (TMD) myalgia. This leads to chronic masticatory pain and is three times more frequent in females compared to males. Jasim et al compared salivary samples from 39 patients with TMD and 39 pain-free healthy control patients. This study reported that TMD patients had both higher salivary and plasma levels of glutamate compared to healthy control patients. In addition, salivary nerve growth factor (NGF) and salivary brain-derived neurotrophic factor were decreased in TMD patients compared to healthy control patients.

Burning mouth syndrome is also a spontaneous pain manifestation characterized by intraoral burning and dysesthesias without any evidence of clinical lesions. The symptoms are predominantly localized to the tongue and lips, and affected patients commonly have comorbid personality changes and mood disorders. Lopez-Jornet et al analyzed inflammatory biomarkers in saliva samples from 51 patients with burning mouth syndrome and compared them to saliva samples from 31 healthy control patients. In addition to increased salivary flow, salivary analysis in patients with burning mouth syndrome revealed increased levels of alpha-amylase, immunoglobulin A (IgA), macrophage inflammatory protein-4 (MIP4) compared to controls. Furthermore, there were decreased levels of uric acid and ferric reducing activity of plasma (FRAP) in patients with burning mouth syndrome versus controls. The authors conclude that burning mouth syndrome may affect inflammatory markers within the saliva and the resulting oxidative stress may correlate with the severity of pain.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^111eXHka]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is an enigmatic, misunderstood, and under-recognized painful condition. Symptoms associated with BMS can be varied, thereby providing a challenge for practitioners and having a negative impact on oral health-related quality of life for patients. Management also remains a challenge for practitioners because it is currently only targeted for symptom relief without a definitive cure. There is an urgent need for further investigations to determine the efficacy of different therapies because this is the only way viable therapeutic options can be established for patients with this chronic and painful syndrome.

### Neural correlates of co-occurring pain and depression: an activation-likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis and systematic review [^1121KAcT]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Types and severity of pain

The main sample (68 studies) consisted of participants presenting with a range of pain types: chronic back pain 10%, chronic pelvic pain 1%, fibromyalgia 22%, Crohn's disease 3%, irritable bowel syndrome 8%, primary dysmenorrhea 1%, burning mouth syndrome 4%, complex regional pain syndrome 3%, neuropathic pain 7%, headache/migraine 10%, functional dyspepsia 4%, somatic pain disorder 4%, rheumatoid arthritis 1%, cervical dystonia 1%, unspecified chronic pain 3% and experimentally induced pain 11%. Out of the 54 pain analyses, five reported minimal pain on a group-level average (9%), 12 reported mild pain (22%), 31 reported moderate pain (57%), three reported severe pain (6%) and three did not reported classifiable pain severity (6%). Out of the five primary-depression analyses, two reported moderate pain on a group-level average (60%) and three did not report classifiable pain severity (60%). Out of the 12 pain and depression comorbidity analyses, four (33%) reported minimal to mild pain, five (42%) reported moderate to severe pain, and three did not report classifiable pain severity. The 2 studies identified in the 2020–2021 search reported mild and moderate pain severity for the chronic musculoskeletal and fibromyalgia patients and induced pain in healthy controls respectively.

### Association between pharmacotherapy and sleep quality in patients with chronic orofacial and chronic body pain: a cross-sectional study [^116GKRyr]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Among 200 subjects, 141 (70.5%) were females. The mean age of study subjects was 51.01 ± 15.52 years. The demographic characteristics of both groups are summarized in Table 1. The etiology of the patients' orofacial pain was as follows: temporomandibular disorders (84%); painful posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy (13%); trigeminal neuralgia (3%); burning mouth syndrome (4%); and chronic migraine (3%). The etiology of the patients' chronic body pain was as follows: low back pain (60%); upper back/shoulder pain (17%); chest/abdominal/pelvic pain (10%); complex regional pain syndrome (3%); neuropathic foot pain (3%); fibromyalgia (2%); cancer-related pain (1%); and post-herpetic neuralgia (1%).

Table 1
Summary of Demographic Characteristics of Patients with Chronic Orofacial and Body Pain Conditions

The pain score was 5.07 in patients with chronic orofacial pain and 6.55 among those with chronic body pain (p < 0.0001) (Table 2). PSQI global score of 5 or greater was reported by 86% and 96% participants with chronic orofacial and body pain, respectively. The mean PSQI score was 9.10 ± 4.55 and 11.44 ± 4.50 for participants with chronic orofacial and body pain, respectively (p = 0.0002) (Figure 1). There was a positive correlation between PSQI and pain intensity (chronic orofacial pain r = 0.3535, p = 0.0004; chronic body pain: r = 0.2247, p < 0.026).

### Burning mouth syndrome: current clinical, physiopathologic, and therapeutic data [^111BGcUQ]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is defined as an "intraoral burning for which no medical or dental cause was found". Lifetime prevalence ranges from 3.7% to 18% - 40% in the elderly. There is no consensus among experts on the diagnostic criteria of BMS, the etiology is poorly understood, and there are no existing clinical guidelines. Therefore, BMS is often underdiagnosed and its management complex. For patients with BMS, this lack of clinical expertise may result in decreased quality of life and increased psychological distress. We conducted a systematic review to identify clinical features, pathophysiology, and therapeutic strategies for BMS. We discuss the multifactorial origin, involving peripheral nerve dysfunction and hormonal dysfunction, as well as psychological traits. We also describe the results of randomized clinical trials for each treatment through a pathophysiologic approach. This review should help clinicians recognize BMS, understand its pathophysiology, and gain an enhanced scientific understanding of therapeutic alternatives.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome and small fiber, early or mild sensory polyneuropathy [^1149CmBK]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The paradigm in our understanding of FMS pain has shifted over the past decade from one of only central sensitization to one of peripheral nervous system injury. Recent evidence points to somatic small fiber dysfunction. Spontaneous activity and peripheral sensitization of silent (type 1B) C fiber nociceptors was found in a substantial proportion of patients with FMS. 20 Phenotypically, the problem is compounded by the notable overlap in clinical complaints between patients with such varying diagnostic labels as FM, SFPN, postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), and systemic exercise intolerance disorder, formerly referred to as chronic fatigue syndrome. Further adding to this diagnostic uncertainty is the lack of a typical "stocking‐glove" phenotype in nonlength dependent or focal (burning mouth syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, etc.) SFPN. Whether SFPN is an initiating event leading to FMS, a finding in a subset of FMS patients, or a coincident but separate disorder remains unclear. 21, 22

Our study provided several key insights: (i) lower extremity sensory nerve action potential amplitudes correlated well with ENFD; (ii) pain intensity did not correlate well with ENFD; (iii) the quality and quantity of pain did not distinguish FM‐SFSPN from FM; (iv) patients with FM‐SFSPN are more likely to have abnormal glucose metabolism and possibly metabolic syndrome than those with FM; (v) differences in QSART at the distal foot were not identified between groups.

Lower Extremity Sensory Nerve Action Potential Amplitudes Correlated Well with ENFD

Significant correlations were seen for sural and MP response amplitudes with ENFD at the calf, but not the thigh. This is consistent with previous reports in which MP amplitudes correlated with skin biopsy findings. 16, 23, 24 Unlike previous studies, we specifically did not stratify for neuropathy because patients did not have exam evidence for distal large fiber dysfunction (although they all fulfilled 2010 ACR criteria for FMS). The implication of this correlation in FM‐SFSPN is that early or mild subclinical loss of distal sensory axons occurs in a subset of patients with FMS. Even in the absence of objective examination evidence of distal large sensory fiber loss, skin biopsy and MP studies can improve diagnostic yield for distal sensory neuropathy in FMS patients.

### Oral symptoms associated with fibromyalgia syndrome [^1166iNMA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Studies have described oral problems associated with fibromyalgia syndrome (FM), including sicca, oral ulcerations, and orofacial pain. We evaluated the prevalence and profile of various oral symptoms in a population of patients diagnosed with FM.

Methods

Subjects diagnosed with FM by American College of Rheumatology criteria (n = 67; all women, mean age ± SEM 47.6 ± 2.3 yrs) were enrolled in the study after meeting strict exclusion criteria (i.e., oral mucosal conditions, Sjögren's syndrome, anemia, inflammatory bowel syndrome or other gastrointestinal disturbances, and other disorders that may manifest oral symptoms). Subjective oral evaluations were carried out for each subject, including oral pain (Melzack scale) for glossodynia, throbbing, aching, etc.; temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD); xerostomia (including intake of fluids, functional problems, etc.); dysphagia; dysgeusia; and information about frequent oral ulcerations or lesions. Psychological tests included Beck Depression Scale (BDS) and Spielberger Anxiety Scale (SAS) were administered.

Results

The results indicated a significant prevalence in some subjects' oral symptoms, compared to age and sex matched control data (mean ± SEM) for xerostomia 70.9% vs 5.7% (p < 0.001); glossodynia 32.8% vs 1.1% (p < 0.001); TMD 67.6% vs 20% (p < 0.01); dysphagia 37.3% vs 0.4% (p < 0.001); dysgeusia 34.2% vs 1.0% (p < 0.001). Other findings were not significantly different from controls: oral ulcerations/lesions 5.1% vs 4.4% (NS); BDS 34% vs 30% (NS); SAS 21% vs 19% (NS). The average visual analog scale (100 mm) for burning pain was 53.0 ± 5.6 (p < 0.001). Anxiety and depression scores were no different in the FM subjects compared to controls with chronic pain conditions.

Conclusion

These data indicate that patients with FM have significantly increased prevalence of xerostomia, glossodynia, dysphagia, dysgeusia, and TMD compared to controls, with no significant difference in clinical oral lesions or psychological status.

Characteristics of studies

Demographic, clinical, and methodological details extracted from the studies are reported in Table 1. Depression severity was determined based on the severity levels established for each depression scale (see 'Depression scales references' in Supplementary Materials). In cases where scoring was not known, clinical severity for both pain and depression were approximately categorised based on the reported raw score as proportionate to the maximum score possible, such that minimal (0–25%), mild (25–50%), moderate (50–75%), and severe (75–100%) levels were set. The included studies comprised of 1706 participants considered as having a primary condition of pain (70.9% females), 126 with a primary condition of depression (68.3% females), 402 with both pain and depression (33.4% females), and 1682 healthy controls (68.1% females).

### Burning mouth syndrome: recognition, understanding, and management [^11767Uc9]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) can be a frustrating condition to the patient and the practitioner because the patient often experiences a continuous burning pain in the mouth without any apparent clinical signs, but the practitioner is unable to definitively diagnose symptoms even with the use of diagnostic testing or imaging. To overcome this dilemma, it is important for the practitioner to recognize and understand the complexities of BMS. The practitioner can then develop a sound approach to management of this condition and patients can be educated and reassured regarding BMS.

Reasons for studies' exclusion.

Figure 1.
Flow chart on the study selection process (adapted from PRIMA, 2009).

Characteristics of studies

All 22 included studies were randomised controlled clinical trials with one triple-blinded study (participant, caretaker, and assessor), 14 double-blinded studies, four single-blinded studies (participants), and three non-blinded studies. Three of the four single-blinded studies have a common concern with assessor blinding as they involved patient-reported outcomes. Fourteen (64%) studies described the method employed in generating the randomised sequence; online website or computer software, and randomisation tables, balls, or blocks Eight studies reported on examiners' allocation concealment (,–). Five studies (22%) have a high risk of attrition bias, and eight studies (36%) have a high risk of reporting bias. In the reviewers' opinion, none of the studies was graded high, with two very low, 12 low (,–) and eight moderate.

Twenty studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT) with placebo parallel-group comparison (.), and two studies were a comparison between different parallel cohort treatment groups. The 20 placebo-controlled randomised trials consisted of 16 trials with two-arm (.) (14 intervention vs. placebo and two non-intervention vs. intervention), one trial with three-arm, and three trials with four arms comparison between intervention and placebo. The remaining two non-placebo RCT were two-arm and three-arm trials investigating several different treatment interventions. Thirteen studies with a follow-up period between 2 and 3 months were categorised as short-term assessment Seven studies were reporting long term assessments (> 3 months), ranging between 4 and 12 months.

Adverse events

Data on adverse events were available from 18 of 90 studies (20%) that assessed pharmacologic interventions and 2 of 90 studies (2.2%) that assessed nonpharmacologic interventions. Due to the heterogeneity across included studies, we have summarized adverse events narratively.

In general, nonpharmacologic treatments under investigation were generally well tolerated, with most reported adverse events being mild or moderate in severity such as stiffness and fatigue. In contrast, pharmacologic treatments were commonly associated with adverse events like dizziness, somnolence, headache, and dry mouth.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^114q4GRB]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Pain in the tongue or oral tissues described as "burning" has been referred to by many terms including burning mouth syndrome. When a burning sensation in the mouth is caused by local or systemic factors, it is called secondary burning mouth syndrome and when these factors are treated the pain will resolve. When burning mouth syndrome occurs in the absence of identified risk indicators, the term primary burning mouth syndrome is utilized. This article focuses on descriptions, etiologic theories, and management of primary burning mouth syndrome, a condition for which underlying causative agents have been ruled out.

### Burning mouth syndrome and secondary oral burning [^114FymUZ]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome is a complex disorder of unclear etiology that is most prevalent in perimenopausal women. It is often accompanied by dysguesia and subjective xerostomia. Recent evidence implicates both central and peripheral neuropathies, possibly representing a phantom pain syndrome in some patients. Ensuring that the patient's oral burning is not secondary to some other local or systemic factor is central to appropriate management. Current standard therapies include clonazepam, paroxetine, and cognitive behavioral therapy, and several promising new alternatives are described.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^112yN1Sw]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Objective To review the clinical entity of primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS), its pathophysiological mechanisms, accurate new diagnostic methods and evidence-based treatment options, and to describe novel lines for future research regarding aetiology, pathophysiology, and new therapeutic strategies. Description Primary BMS is a chronic neuropathic intraoral pain condition that despite typical symptoms lacks clear clinical signs of neuropathic involvement. With advanced diagnostic methods, such as quantitative sensory testing of small somatosensory and taste afferents, neurophysiological recordings of the trigeminal system, and peripheral nerve blocks, most BMS patients can be classified into the peripheral or central type of neuropathic pain. These two types differ regarding pathophysiological mechanisms, efficacy of available treatments, and psychiatric comorbidity. The two types may overlap in individual patients. BMS is most frequent in postmenopausal women, with general population prevalence of around 1%. Treatment of BMS is difficult; best evidence exists for efficacy of topical and systemic clonazepam. Hormonal substitution, dopaminergic medications, and therapeutic non-invasive neuromodulation may provide efficient mechanism-based treatments for BMS in the future. Conclusion We present a novel comprehensive hypothesis of primary BMS, gathering the hormonal, neuropathic, and genetic factors presumably required in the genesis of the condition. This will aid in future research on pathophysiology and risk factors of BMS, and boost treatment trials taking into account individual mechanism profiles and subgroup-clusters.

### A diagnostic and therapeutic approach to primary burning mouth syndrome [^112bLPQs]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is an oral mucosal disorder that is characterized by a chronic and often debilitating intraoral burning sensation for which no localized or systemic cause can be found. BMS most commonly affects postmenopausal women. The pathophysiology of primary BMS is not well understood. Diagnosing BMS can prove to be challenging. BMS patients can also pose a therapeutic challenge to clinicians who are consulted to evaluate these patients. Most commonly used therapies include tricyclic antidepressants, α-lipoic acid, clonazepam, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Clinical judgment, patient counseling, and monitoring of pain are important. Further research is required to assess the effectiveness of serotonin and newer serotonin-noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors.

### Evaluating large language models for burning mouth syndrome diagnosis [^115TzCPa]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

From a clinical standpoint, those familiar with BMS recognize that it does not necessarily manifest as bilateral pain in all cases. In addition, it is well known that many patients report that their pain diminishes during meals. Based on other similar clinical vignettes, it appears that LLMs sometimes offer limited analysis concerning topics with multiple conflicting opinions — especially those that are clinically recognized but mentioned in only a few published studies.

When considering the clinical application of LLMs, this limitation should be addressed. For content or diagnoses that remain open to debate, a clinician's judgment is indispensable. Furthermore, whenever providing a diagnosis, it is prudent to make the LLM's reasoning explicit. If errors are identified, they should be corrected to facilitate ongoing learning and improvement of these models.

Methodology

Search strategy

The study was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines. An electronic search on PubMed Medline (1946 to 1 July 2020), Embase Ovid (1980 to 1 July 2020), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1 July 2020) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (1 July 2020) was conducted based on the combination of the following keywords: "burning mouth syndrome or glossalgia or stomatodynia AND treatment or therapy or therapeutic or management". This review includes all randomised and controlled clinical trials with a placebo published in the English language. The included studies should state that the diagnosis of BMS is based on the absence of local and systemic pathological contributing factors and have a minimum follow up of treatment of 2 months. This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (Protocol ID: CRD42020160892). We also performed a manual search on all included clinical trials in published systematic review articles for any potentially relevant studies.

Study selection

The search results were screened based on the relevant title and abstract by two independent authors. Where information from the abstract was inadequate to allow a decision, a full report was obtained. The full text was obtained for articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion between the authors, and the review authors were not blinded to articles' authorship. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria underwent data extraction and were evaluated for study risk of bias. The following data were obtained and recorded in a standardised proforma sheet on author and year of publication; study design or methodology; sample size and participant inclusion and/or exclusion criteria; types of intervention and follow-up time; the outcome and/or adverse effect from the intervention; statistical methods employed (Table 1).

Summary of included studies and quality of evidence.

Assessment of risk of bias

We used the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool, which is based on seven main domains (Table 2). Each study was categorised based on the overall risk category and classified as low, unclear, or high risk. The quality of all included articles was assessed using the GRADE.

Outcome analysis

We analysed outcome data based on short term (≥ 2 month to ≤ 3 months) and long term (> 3 months) changes in symptoms. The assessment method used in the included studies should be of equal measure. The standardised mean difference (SMD) in pain score (VAS) of treatment groups and placebo and their relative risk ratio (RR) for BMS pain improvement was recorded from the relevant studies with the 95% confidence interval (CI) where possible. Estimates of effect (and associated CI) were combined and pooled for studies reporting the same treatment.

Statistical analysis

Mean difference (MD) of the pre- to post-treatment VAS change scores were extracted from studies. For each study with comparisons between treatment and placebo at short term (≤ 3 months) and/or long term (> 3 months), standardised mean differences (SMDs) of the VAS scores were calculated using pre-to-post-intervention change score (means) and post-intervention SDs (rather than change score SDs which were not provided in several studies). Means and/or standard deviations for baseline and post-treatment pain intensity were calculated for two studies based on the length of error bars in graphs and a ruler and two other studies using raw data (provided in papers). Continuous data were pooled using the Hedges g statistic as a formulation for the SMD under the fixed effects model. For categorical (dichotomous) outcomes (e.g. n ≥ vs. n < 50% decrease in VAS pain intensity, or number of patients demonstrating improvement from baseline versus the number showing no change/worsened score), relative risks (RRs) and associated 95% CI were calculated to express the estimate of treatment effect. Where zeros caused problems with the computation of the RR or its CIs, 0.5 was added to frequency cells. Where appropriate, RR data were pooled (under a fixed effect model). Formal meta-analyses were not performed in this review due to the heterogeneity of the included studies' methods and outcome data such as varying assessment times within short- and long-term testing periods, differences in treatment regime (e.g. timing or dosage of medication administration), different outcome assessments of burning or general pain improvement, and incomplete data (e.g. variance not reported).

### Burning mouth syndrome [^113SAQA2]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic condition characterized by burning of the oral mucosa, with or without dysgeusia and xerostomia, in the setting of no underlying systemic disease or identifiable abnormalities on physical examination or laboratory testing. BMS disproportionately affects postmenopausal women. The pathophysiology of the disease is unknown; no single treatment has proven universally successful. In light of these shortcomings, having a practical approach to the evaluation and management of patients with BMS can improve both patient quality of life and physician satisfaction.

### Is burning mouth syndrome a neuropathic pain condition? [^116etpkc]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is defined as an "intraoral burning or dysaesthetic sensation, recurring daily… more than 3 months, without clinically evident causative lesions" (IHS 2013). In addition to pain, taste alterations are frequent (dysgeusia, xerostomia). Although lacking clinical signs of neuropathy, more accurate diagnostic methods have shown neuropathic involvement at various levels of the neuraxis in BMS: peripheral small fiber damage (thermal quantitative sensory testing, electrogustatometry, epithelial nerve fiber density), trigeminal system lesions in the periphery or the brainstem (brainstem reflex recordings, trigeminal neurography, evoked potentials), or signs of decreased inhibition within the central nervous system (deficient brainstem reflex habituation, positive signs in quantitative sensory testing, neurotransmitter-positron emission tomography findings indicative of deficient striatal dopamine function). Abnormalities in electrogustatometry indicate the involvement of the small Aδ taste afferents, in addition to somatosensory small fibers. According to these findings, the clinical entity of BMS can be divided into 2 main subtypes compatible with either peripheral or central neuropathic pain, which may overlap in individual patients. The central type does not respond to local treatments and associates often with psychiatric comorbidity (depression or anxiety), whereas the peripheral type responds to peripheral lidocaine blocks and topical clonazepam. Burning mouth syndrome is most prevalent in postmenopausal women, having led to a hypothesis that BMS is triggered as a consequence of nervous system damage caused by neurotoxic factors affecting especially vulnerable small fibers and basal ganglia in a setting of decrease in neuroprotective gonadal hormones and increase in stress hormone levels, typical for menopause.

After the protocol adaptation from participant eight onward (see above), subjects were additionally asked (after completion of these NRS descriptions; ∼30 seconds) about the presence of any brushstroke test sensations that occurred immediately after the cessation of the final stimulus, via a combination of yes/no, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions. First, the subjects were asked, "After the brushstroke tests, have you felt any lingering sensation?" ("yes" or "no"). If the subjects confirmed the presence of such lingering sensations, they were asked to describe their quality: "Did this lingering sensation feel like"… "pins and needles", "burning", or "other"? Subjects were encouraged to report in free text all they felt and were permitted to select or record multiple types of sensations, as relevant. Subjects were then asked whether their sensations after brushstroke were uncomfortable ("yes" or "no"). We have termed sensations extending beyond the brushstroke tests aftersensations. For testing protocols, please see Supplementary Data Figure S2.

### Fibromyalgia: an overview [^116rVGif]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is the diagnosis given to individuals with chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain for which no alternative cause, such as tissue inflammation or damage, can be identified. Fibromyalgia is now believed to be, at least in part, a disorder of central pain processing that produces heightened responses to painful stimuli (hyperalgesia) and painful responses to nonpainful stimuli (allodynia). Aberrations in central pain processing may also be partly responsible for symptoms experienced in several chronic pain disorders that coaggregate with fibromyalgia, which is itself a product of genetic and environmental factors. Thus, aberrational central pain processing is implicated in irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular disorder, chronic low back pain, and certain other chronic pain disorders. Fibromyalgia and related disorders appear to reflect deficiencies in serotonergic and noradrenergic, but not opioidergic, transmission in the central nervous system. The heightened state of pain transmission may also be owing to increases in pronociceptive neurotransmitters such as glutamate and substance P. In some cases, psychological and behavioral factors are also in play. Although the overlapping symptomatology between fibromyalgia and related disorders may present diagnostic challenges, proper examination and observation can help clinicians make an accurate diagnosis. In recent years, the vastly improved understanding of the mechanism underlying fibromyalgia and the related spectrum of diseases has fostered rapid advances in the therapy of these chronic pain disorders by both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.

Background

Both functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and fibromyalgia are poorly understood syndromes significantly impacting quality of life and contributing to high levels of work absenteeism. The two conditions are associated with increased visits to physicians and impose a substantial financial burden, – with healthcare-associated costs reaching up to quadruple that of a reference population.

The FGID were defined in 1989 as 'a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. This may include syndromes attributed to the oesophagus, stomach, biliary tree, small or large intestines, or anus'. Both fibromyalgia and FGID are more commonly identified in women, with fibromyalgia estimated to affect 3.98% (95% CI: 2.8–5.2) of women and 0.01 (95% CI: 0.04–0.06) of men. With few exceptions, the broad range of FGID are more prevalent in women, with medically diagnosed IBS affecting approximately four times as many women as men.

It is thought that both fibromyalgia and FGID are attributable to sympathetic dysfunction with resultant central sensitisation. Both conditions were recently categorised as 'Central Sensitivity Syndromes'. While a common etiology has been proposed, there is currently no compelling evidence to support a targeted intervention.

Fibromyalgia accounts for about 15% of all referrals to rheumatology clinics and has a global prevalence of around 2% with wide variation (0.2–6.6%) depending on the country and assessment tool used.– Reports consistently concur a higher prevalence for females – up to 10-fold that of males. The higher prevalence rates in women have been contested as being driven primarily by selection bias and that rates in men and women are possibly quite similar.

The major feature of fibromyalgia is chronic widespread pain (CWP) and is typically accompanied by a range of symptoms including fatigue, headache, sleep and cognitive disturbances, as well as digestive disorders, including IBS.

### The practical evaluation and management of patients with symptoms of a sore burning mouth [^111VMYwW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

There are many etiologic factors to consider in a patient who presents with symptoms or sensations of a sore burning mouth. These range from local causes within the oral cavity to underlying systemic disease, including psychologic factors. This paper aims to describe the different clinical presentations and to outline a systematic approach to the evaluation and management of such patients. The clinician will be directed to the relevant diagnosis by following the traditional medical model of taking a focused history, performing a thorough clinical examination, considering the potential differential diagnoses, and requesting pertinent and appropriate investigations. The various differential diagnoses and broad treatment options will also be discussed and outlined. This paper will not, however, discuss burning mouth syndrome (oral dysesthesia), which is a diagnosis of exclusion, whereby the oral mucosa is clinically normal and there are no identifiable medical or dental causes to account for the patient's symptoms.

Fibromyalgia is a common syndrome characterised by widespread pain and a constellation of other symptoms and overlapping conditions that contribute to complicate the diagnosis, the assessment and the treatment. Furthermore, the etiological causes for the moment only consist of assumptions, and the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms still remain to be clarified. For the above-mentioned reasons, with the present review we sought to provide an overview of the literature on fibromyalgia from both the pre-clinical and clinical studies indexed in PubMed during the last year, classifying original articles and reviews into etiopathogenesis, assessment and therapy.

### Interventions for the treatment of burning mouth syndrome [^112LN9vr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The complaint of a burning sensation in the mouth can be said to be a symptom of other disease or a syndrome in its own right of unknown aetiology. In patients where no underlying dental or medical causes are identified and no oral signs are found, the term burning mouth syndrome (BMS) should be used. The prominent feature is the symptom of burning pain which can be localised just to the tongue and/or lips but can be more widespread and involve the whole of the oral cavity. Reported prevalence rates in general populations vary from 0.7% to 15%. Many of these patients show evidence of anxiety, depression and personality disorders.

Objectives

The objectives of this review are to determine the effectiveness and safety of any intervention versus placebo for relief of symptoms and improvement in quality of life and to assess the quality of the studies.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (20 October 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2004), EMBASE (January 1980 to October). Clinical Evidence Issue No. 10 2004, conference proceedings and bibliographies of identified publications were searched to identify the relevant literature, irrespective of language of publication.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected if they met the following criteria: study design - randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) which compared a placebo against one or more treatments; participants - patients with burning mouth syndrome, that is, oral mucosal pain with no dental or medical cause for such symptoms; interventions - all treatments that were evaluated in placebo-controlled trials; primary outcome - relief of burning/discomfort.

Data Collection and Analysis

Articles were screened independently by two reviewers to confirm eligibility and extract data. The reviewers were not blinded to the identity of the studies. The quality of the included trials was assessed independently by two reviewers, with particular attention given to allocation concealment, blinding and the handling of withdrawals and drop outs. Due to both clinical and statistical heterogeneity statistical pooling of the data was inappropriate.

Main Results

Nine trials were included in the review. The interventions examined were antidepressants (two trials), cognitive behavioural therapy (one trial), analgesics (one trial), hormone replacement therapy (one trial), alpha-lipoic acid (three trials) and anticonvulsants (one trial). Diagnostic criteria were not always clearly reported. Out of the nine trials included in the review, only three interventions demonstrated a reduction in BMS symptoms: alpha-lipoic acid (three trials), the anticonvulsant clonazepam (one trial) and cognitive behavioural therapy (one trial). Only two of these studies reported using blind outcome assessment. Although none of the other treatments examined in the included studies demonstrated a significant reduction in BMS symptoms, this may be due to methodological flaws in the trial design, or small sample size, rather than a true lack of effect.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the chronic nature of BMS, the need to identify an effective mode of treatment for sufferers is vital. However, there is little research evidence that provides clear guidance for those treating patients with BMS. Further trials, of high methodological quality, need to be undertaken in order to establish effective forms of treatment for patients suffering from BMS.

### Fibromyalgia position paper [^113eYp2c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome is one of the most common causes of chronic widespread pain, but pain accompanies a wide range of ancillary symptoms. To date, its aetiopathogenesis remains elusive, and diagnosis is exquisitely clinical, due to the lack of biomarkers or specific laboratory alterations in fibromyalgia patients. This position paper has the purpose to summarise the current scientific knowledge and expert opinions about the main controversies regarding fibromyalgia syndrome, namely: (i) fibromyalgia definition and why it is still not recognised in many countries as a distinct clinical entity; (ii) fibromyalgia severity and how to evaluate treatment outcome; (iii) how to treat fibromyalgia and which is a correct approach to fibromyalgia patients.

### High prevalence of small-fiber neuropathy in patients with tarlov cysts: toward a more comprehensive clinical understanding [^1118bHvA]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, 26% of PTCs were previously diagnosed with fibromyalgia. This association may be expected, as, similar to fibromyalgia, PTCs report unexplained widespread pain. Moreover, up to two-thirds of fibromyalgia patients have been diagnosed with SFN, and it has been documented that 39% of patients previously diagnosed with fibromyalgia also exhibit TCs.

Growing pains, defined as recurrent lower limb pain during childhood, was reported in 51% of PTCs. Despite numerous cases of growing pains documented in the international literature, their exact nature and etiology remain unclear. In a retrospective study of 532 Mediterranean children aged 4–12 years, the incidence of growing pains was 25%. Given the high percentage of childhood leg pain in PTCs, this symptom may be neuropathic pain associated with early-stage small fiber involvement.

Autonomic Dysfunction

Autonomic dysfunction of the lacrimal glands, causing dry eyes, and salivary glands, causing dry mouth, have been reported in patients with SFN. In our cohort of PTCs, 49% reported one or both of these symptoms. Compared with the older age group, dry eyes were significantly more prevalent in the younger age group. Therefore, these symptoms cannot be attributed to aging alone.

There was also a high incidence of symptoms suggesting autonomic dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract. One or more symptoms indicating gastric dysfunction were reported in 79% of PTCs. Slow gastric emptying has primarily been studied in diabetic patients with SFN. Symptoms indicating bowel dysfunction were reported by 88% of PTCs, including bloating (57%), constipation (44%), constipation alternated with diarrhea (44%), fecal urgency (44%), and false bowel movements (42%). Murphy et alreported bowel dysfunction in 29% of 213 patients with symptomatic TCs. As a consequence of these bowel symptoms, patients with SFN are often (mis)diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. In our cohort, 35% were diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome.

Symptom Severity Scale (SSS)

SSS is divided into two parts: level of severity and somatic symptoms associated with the disease. Regarding the first section, a scale ranging from 0 to 3 is used to grade the three categories of symptoms: fatigue, waking unrefreshed and cognitive symptoms. No problem is represented by a score of 0; a slight or mild problem that is typically mild or intermittent is represented by a score of 1; a moderately significant problem that is frequently present and/or at a moderate level is represented by a score of 2; and a severe, pervasive, continuous, and life-disturbing condition is represented by a score of 3. Depending on how severe their symptoms have been throughout the previous week, patients can select one level of severity for each of the three categories. The sum of the three categories yields a total that ranges from 0 to 9. The second section assesses how much the patient's life is impacted by somatic symptoms. A long exhaustive list was provided for clinicians by the ACR to check. Based on the quantity of symptoms experienced in the past week, patients scored 0 (for no symptoms), 1 (for few symptoms), 2 (for a moderate number of symptoms) and 3 (for a great deal of symptoms). It is worth noting that 0 symptoms correlate with a score of 0, a total of 1 to 10 symptoms is given a score of 1, a total of 11 to 24 symptoms correlate with a score of 2 and a number of symptoms that is greater or equal to 25 correlates with a score of 3. The list of symptoms covers digestive, respiratory, dermatological, neurological and general symptoms. The symptoms include: Muscle pain, Irritable bowel syndrome, Fatigue/tiredness, Thinking or remembering problem, Muscle Weakness, Headache, Pain/cramps in abdomen, Numbness/tingling, Dizziness, Insomnia, Depression, Constipation, Pain in upper abdomen, Nausea, Nervousness, Chest pain, Blurred vision, Fever, Diarrhea, Dry mouth, Itching, Wheezing, Raynaud's, Hives/welts, Ringing in ears, Vomiting, Heartburn, Oral ulcers, Loss/change in taste, Seizures, Dry eyes, Shortness of breath, Loss of appetite, Rash, Sun sensitivity, Hearing difficulties, Easy bruising, Hair loss, Frequent urination, Painful urination and Bladder spasms. The next step would then be to add the score of the two parts (levels of severity and other somatic symptoms) and the final score can range from 0 to 12.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^114rAUqk]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning sensation in the tongue or other oral sites, usually in the absence of clinical and laboratory findings. Affected patients often present with multiple oral complaints, including burning, dryness and taste alterations. Burning mouth complaints are reported more often in women, especially after menopause. Typically, patients awaken without pain but note increasing symptoms through the day and into the evening. Conditions that have been reported in association with burning mouth syndrome include chronic anxiety or depression, various nutritional deficiencies, type 2 diabetes (formerly known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) and changes in salivary function. However, these conditions have not been consistently linked with the syndrome, and their treatment has had little impact on burning mouth symptoms. Recent studies have pointed to dysfunction of several cranial nerves associated with taste sensation as a possible cause of burning mouth syndrome. Given in low dosages, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be effective in patients with burning mouth syndrome. Topical capsaicin has been used in some patients.

### Cytokine levels and their role in the etiopathogenesis of burning mouth syndrome: a systematic review [^111WBtPE]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Burning Mouth Syndrome is characterized by variable symptoms that include pain, burning and paraguesia in an otherwise healthy-appearing oral mucosa. Although the etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome is unknown, some studies provide evidence of subclinical inflammation leading to disrupted cytokine levels.

Aim

To investigate the expression of cytokines and role in the etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome.

Methods

Online databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched from November 1986 to November 2018 for case control/cross-sectional studies comparing the levels of cytokines in patients with Burning Mouth Syndrome and healthy controls.

Results

A total of eight studies were included in the current review. Four studies were of high and four studies were of moderate quality. Seven studies evaluated IL-6, out of which four showed comparable results, two showed higher levels and one study reported lower levels in Burning Mouth Syndrome patients compared to controls. Four studies assessed IL-2, out of which two reported comparable results whereas one study reported higher levels and one study reported lower levels in Burning Mouth Syndrome patients compared to controls. IL-10 levels were measured in three studies that reported no significant differences in the levels between Burning Mouth Syndrome and healthy controls.

Discussion and Conclusion

The etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome is multifactorial. Studies have provided scientific evidence that inflammation plays a key role in Burning Mouth Syndrome pathogenesis. However, whether up-regulation or down-regulation of specific cytokines contribute to the etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome remains debatable. Further high-quality studies with larger sample size and assessing a wider array of cytokines are warranted in order to obtain strong conclusions.

### Association between burning mouth syndrome and the development of depression, anxiety, dementia, and parkinson disease [^112ws2Br]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Burning mouth syndrome is a chronic oral pain disorder that is characterized by a generalized or localized burning sensation without the presence of any specific mucosal lesions. It remains unclear, however, whether burning mouth syndrome is associated with the development of psychoneurological conditions among patients with the syndrome.

Objective

To evaluate the risk of developing psychoneurological conditions, including depression, anxiety, dementia, and Parkinson disease, in patients with burning mouth syndrome.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using a nationwide representative cohort sample from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort, which consists of data from approximately 1 million patients in South Korea. The study included 586 patients with burning mouth syndrome (patient group) and 1172 individuals without burning mouth syndrome (comparison group). The patient group included all patients who received inpatient and outpatient care for an initial diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2012. The comparison group was selected (2 individuals without burning mouth syndrome for each patient with burning mouth syndrome) using propensity score matching for sex, age, location of residence, household income level, and comorbidities. Data were collected and analyzed from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2013.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Death and the incidence of psychopathological diseases. Affective disorder events that occurred among participants during the follow-up period were investigated using survival analysis, a log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the incidence rates, survival rates, and hazard ratios, respectively, of participants who developed psychoneurological conditions.

Results

Of 1758 total participants, 1086 (61.8%) were female; 701 participants (39.9%) were younger than 45 years, 667 (37.9%) were aged 45 to 64 years, and 390 (22.2%) were older than 64 years. The overall incidence of depression and anxiety was higher in patients with burning mouth syndrome (n = 586; 30.8 incidents and 44.2 incidents per 1000 person-years, respectively) than in individuals without burning mouth syndrome (n = 1172; 11.7 incidents and 19.0 incidents per 1000 person-years, respectively). The results also indicated a similar incidence of dementia and Parkinson disease between the patient group (6.5 incidents and 2.5 incidents per 1000 person-years, respectively) and the comparison group (4.9 incidents and 1.7 incidents per 1000 person-years, respectively). After adjusting for sociodemographic factors (age, location of residence, household income level, and comorbidities), the adjusted hazard ratios for the development of depression and anxiety among patients with burning mouth syndrome were 2.77 (95% CI, 2.22–3.45) and 2.42 (95% CI, 2.02–2.90), respectively. However, no association was found between burning mouth syndrome and the risk of developing dementia and Parkinson disease.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this observational study suggest that burning mouth syndrome is associated with increases in the incidence of depression and anxiety but not in the incidence of dementia and Parkinson disease among patients with the syndrome. Clinicians should be aware of this association and be prepared to make referrals to appropriate mental health care professionals.

### Pathophysiology of fibromyalgia [^116iDeJA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This article reviews the biologic, genetic, and environmental factors that may contribute to the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia. As an affective spectrum disorder, fibromyalgia may share these causal factors with a number of related and co-occurring pain conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome or temporomandibular disorder. There is strong evidence that cardinal pain symptoms of fibromyalgia may be due to alterations in central processing of sensory input, along with aberrations in the endogenous inhibition of pain. Genetic research has shown familial aggregation of fibromyalgia and other related disorders such as major depressive disorder. Exposure to physical or psychosocial stressors, as well as abnormal biologic responses in the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine responses, may also contribute to dysfunctional pain processing. As fibromyalgia research continues to progress, it is expected that the pathophysiology of this disorder will be further elucidated, leading to more rational and targeted strategies for the treatment of patients with this condition.

### Thermal temporal summation and decay of after-sensations in temporomandibular myofascial pain patients with and without comorbid fibromyalgia [^113e6qK8]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The cause(s) of pain complaints in myofascial pain syndrome, the most common type of temporomandibular disorders (TMD), are not known. One theory holds that pain results from a dysregulation of endogenous pain mechanisms, and this theory is partially supported by quantitative sensory testing studies showing that myofascial TMD patients have lower thresholds to noxious thermal and pressure stimuli than controls (hyperalgesia), as well as more painful responses to innocuous stimuli (allodynia),–higher levels of temporal summation (TS, participant reports increased painfulness of repeated stimuli, despite constant stimulus intensity),–and greater persistence of after-sensations (AS, sensations that remain after active stimulation ceases). Prospective datahave shown that elevated thresholds and heightened levels of thermal TS of the hand precede the diagnosis of myofascial TMD, suggesting that TS responses are a marker of vulnerability, if not part of a causal chain. However, increased sensitivity is not present in all myofascial TMD patients, suggesting that there may be hypersensitive subgroups.

Fibromyalgia (FM), a widespread pain syndrome, is comorbid in ~20% of myofascial TMD cases.(Myofascial TMD has also been reported to be comorbid with other chronic pain states, including migraine and chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and multiple comorbid pain conditions.) Hypersensitivity to somatic stimulation is a widely accepted sign in FM. Psychophysical studies in FM patients generally show increased sensitivity to a multitude of laboratory pain stimuli, suggesting a higher "gain" when processing afferent nociceptive signals and a delayed resolution of AS.–A parsimonious inference is that facial pain in comorbid patients is a sign of undiagnosed FM. Indeed, the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD do not assess pain in areas other than the head, and so a diagnosis of FM could be missed in someone whose primary complaint was facial pain. Similarly, the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for FM do not assess pain in the head. Whether pain dysregulation in myofascial TMD cases without FM is also attributable to central factors has not been widely studied. Pfau et al.compared TS between myofascial TMD cases with localized (facial) or widespread pain, but did not specifically diagnose FM, and did not study AS. Thus, one innovative goal of this report is to test the hypothesis that central sensitization, measured as both TS and AS, is limited to the subset of myofascial TMD cases with comorbid FM.

### CSF levels of apolipoprotein C1 and autotaxin found to associate with neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia [^111ktDas]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain conditions such as fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain cause substantial suffering, disability, and great societal costs. In addition, they are difficult to treat, and sometimes difficult to diagnose.–Progress has been made in clinical classification and diagnostic criteria for neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia, but there is a need for better understanding of the pathophysiology and for more effective treatments.–Currently, there are no biological tests on which to base pain diagnoses, treatment choices or to understand the pathophysiology of the individual pain patient. Such markers that reflect the pathophysiology of individual pain patients would be important tools for pain clinicians, scientists, and pharmaceutical companies to aid in diagnosis, treatment selection, and to guide and monitor the development of new treatments. Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection is an invasive procedure, CSF is in direct contact with the brain and spinal cord and changes in CSF protein levels may reflect pathological processes in the central nervous system.

Neuropathic pain is often described as a particularly unpleasant form of painwith shooting, shock-like, aching, cramping, crushing, smarting, and burning features. Neuropathic pain is caused by lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous systemand affects 1–10% of the general population. – Previous investigations of CSF from neuropathic pain patients have typically analyzed one or a few interesting markers (mainly proteins) in small sample cohorts. Several studies have found differences in the levels of one or more proteins including inflammatory markers between neuropathic pain patients and controls – while other studies showed no significant differences.

Fibromyalgia affects around 2% of the population and is characterized by widespread pain and generalized hyperalgesia for mechanical pressure. Fibromyalgia patients often suffer from psychological distress, sleep and memory disturbances, and fatigue. There are many theories behind pathophysiology of FM, but the etiology is still uncertain. The current view is that the clinical presentation of fibromyalgia depends on central phenomena rather than peripheral dysfunction and substantial evidence exists for abnormalities in sensory signaling, including reduction of descending control and changes in key neurotransmitters associated with central sensitization. However, altered levels of cytokines, anti-inflammatory lipids, and prominent alterations both in muscle tissue and circulating proteins have been reported – as well as small nerve fiber impairment in FM. A wide range of proteins including inflammatory markers were found altered in the CSF of fibromyalgia patients. –

The recommendation is based largely on indirect evidence from fibromyalgia, antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, pediatric data were insufficient to support a recommendation, and TCAs have increased adverse effects including prolonged QT, orthostasis, cognitive impairment, dry mouth, and anticholinergic effects that should be discussed with patients.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^111N2Smh]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome is the occurrence of oral pain in a patient with a normal oral mucosal examination. It can be caused by both organic and psychologic or psychiatric factors, which can be broken down into local, systemic. psychologic or psychiatric, and idiopathic causes. The most frequently associated conditions are psychiatric (depression, anxiety, or cancerphobia); xerostomia; nutritional deficiency; allergic contact dermatitis; candidiasis; denture-related pain: and parafunctional behavior. Multiple different factors contributing to the oral pain are common, and a systematic approach to the evaluation is important. Identification of correctable causes of BMS should be emphasized and psychiatric causes should not be invoked without thorough evaluation of the patient. A directed history and careful oral examination must be completed to exclude local diseases and identify clues to potential causes. Assessment of medications, psychiatric history and background, and selected laboratory and patch tests may help identify the etiologies of these symptoms. Treatment should be tailored to each patient and may best be managed in a multidisciplinary approach with input from dermatologists, dentists, psychiatrists. otorhinolaryngologists, and primary care providers. A thoughtful and structured evaluation of the patient with BMS has been associated with improvement in about 70% of patients. The remaining patients may benefit from empiric therapy with a chronic pain protocol and continued supportive interactions.

Acupuncture

There is emerging interest in acupuncture as an adjunct therapy to pharmacological treatment for BMS patients due to its encouraging analgesic results on significant VAS score reduction within the first 2 months of therapy. Long-term follow-up, between 18 and 24 months after the initial acupuncture treatment, suggests a decreased level of burning sensation and improved quality of life are maintained. Scardina et al. proposed that acupuncture increases BMS patients' lip microcirculation, which in turn reduces the localised collection of inflammatory mediators, hence providing respite from the burning pain. Acupuncture was not included in this review as, disappointingly, studies of this treatment to date have either been non-randomised clinical trials recruiting cohorts of consecutive BMS patients, lacked a control group, and/or administered follow up less than 2 months post-treatment. A further detailed study on the potential of acupuncture as a complementary therapy to reduce medication loading and increase patient compliance with medications is warranted.

Limitations

There was a substantial amount of heterogeneity in the therapeutic intervention types and method of delivery. None of the included studies has a high-grade quality of evidence in both short- and long-term outcome assessment. Short-term changes in pain score, quality of life, and adverse therapy effects may not reflect the clinical practice's real implication. Long-term outcomes data availability was minimal, with reports only on cognitive therapy, ALA, capsaicin, umPEA, topical clonazepam, and low-level laser therapy. There were other trials with similar or other treatments reported in this review but these were not included mainly due to short-term assessment of as little as 2 weeks. Publication limitation and error in the statistical study data led to limited statistical analysis comparing treatment and placebo groups. The significant efficacy of psychology and LLLT studies should be interpreted with caution due to unreported adverse effects. Varoni et al. is a cross-over trial assuming a sufficient wash-over period of melatonin 4 weeks before the next intervention. The small study samples for each group (range 10 to 33) do not provide a robust statistical power in their results. The definition of improvement or reduction in pain for categorical data analyses (RRs) were varied across the studies as some studies may have meant almost or complete recovery while other may have meant a range of numerical decrease in VAS scores.

### Primary burning mouth syndrome: a questionnaire study of neuropathic and psychological components [^114rFdYZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The pathophysiology of primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is extensively debated but poorly understood.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate neuropathic and psychological components of BMS in patients with primary BMS.

Methods

Subjects were recruited through a consultation dedicated to mouth diseases, during which a diagnosis of primary BMS was assessed. Patients answered the abbreviated Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire (DN4i), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the questionnaire de la douleur de Saint-Antoine (QDSA), the French version of the McGill pain questionnaire.

Results

Thirty-five patients with primary BMS were included in the study: 31% of them had a DN4i score in favour of neuropathic pain and 34.3% had a HADS overall score in favour of anxiety and depressive disorder.

Conclusion

Both physiological and psychological aspects of BMS need to be actively investigated by clinicians to successfully manage these patients. The physiological and psychological aspects are not mutually exclusive. The DN4i and the HADS are easy-to-use tools and could be used in an initial assessment of BMS patients.

The Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group aimed to update treatment recommendations, published in 2015, on the basis of new evidence from randomised controlled trials, emerging neuromodulation techniques, and advances in evidence synthesis.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, PubMed, the International Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov from data inception for neuromodulation trials and from Jan 1, 2013, for pharmacological interventions until Feb 12, 2024. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated pharmacological and neuromodulation treatments administered for at least 3 weeks, or if there was at least 3 weeks of follow-up, and which included at least ten participants per group. Trials included participants of any age with neuropathic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain. We excluded trials with enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal designs and those with participants with mixed aetiologies (ie, neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain) and conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, low back pain without radicular pain, fibromyalgia, and idiopathic orofacial pain. We extracted summary data in duplicate from published reports, with discrepancies reconciled by a third independent reviewer on the platform Covidence. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of responders (50% or 30% reduction in baseline pain intensity or moderate pain relief). The primary safety outcome was the number of participants who withdrew from the treatment owing to adverse events. We calculated a risk difference for each comparison and did a random-effects meta-analysis. Risk differences were used to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) for each treatment. Risk of bias was assessed by use of the Cochrane risk of bias tool 2 and certainty of evidence assessed by use of GRADE. Recommendations were based on evidence of efficacy, adverse events, accessibility, and cost, and feedback from engaged lived experience partners. This study is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42023389375.

Findings

We identified 313 trials (284 pharmacological and 29 neuromodulation studies) for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Across all studies, 48 789 adult participants were randomly assigned to trial groups (20611 female and 25078 male participants, where sex was reported). Estimates for the primary efficacy and safety outcomes were tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) NNT = 4.6 (95% CI 3.2–7.7), NNH = 17.1 (11.4–33.6; moderate certainty of evidence), α₂δ-ligands NNT = 8.9 (7.4–11.10), NNH = 26.2 (20.4–36.5; moderate certainty of evidence), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) NNT = 7.4 (5.6–10.9), NNH = 13.9 (10.9–19.0; moderate certainty of evidence), botulinum toxin (BTX-A) NNT = 2.7 (1.8–9.61), NNH = 216.3 (23.5-∞; moderate certainty of evidence), capsaicin 8% patches NNT = 13.2 (7.6–50.8), NNH = 1129.3 (135.7-∞; moderate certainty of evidence), opioids NNT = 5.9 (4.1–10.7), NNH = 15.4 (10.8–24.0; low certainty of evidence), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) NNT = 4.2 (2.3–28.3), NNH = 651.6 (34.7-∞; low certainty of evidence), capsaicin cream NNT = 6.1 (3.1-∞), NNH = 18.6 (10.6–77.1; very low certainty of evidence), lidocaine 5% plasters NNT = 14.5 (7.8–108.2), NNH = 178.0 (23.9-∞; very low certainty of evidence). The findings provided the basis for a strong recommendation for use of TCAs, α₂δ-ligands, and SNRIs as first-line treatments; a weak recommendation for capsaicin 8% patches, capsaicin cream, and lidocaine 5% plasters as second-line recommendation; and a weak recommendation for BTX-A, rTMS, and opioids as third-line treatments for neuropathic pain.

Interpretation

Our results support a revision of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group recommendations for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Treatment outcomes are modest and for some treatments uncertainty remains. Further large placebo-controlled or sham-controlled trials done over clinically relevant timeframes are needed.

### Neuropathic pain in patients with burning mouth syndrome evaluated using painDETECT [^114eREsT]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

This study set out to identify the neuropathic component of pain experienced by burning mouth syndrome (BMS) patients evaluated using painDETECT, a diagnostic tool that could easily be introduced into clinical practice.

Materials and Methods

This study included 64 patients (33 BMS and 31 suffering nociceptive pain). Each completed the painDETECT neuropathic pain questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and pain intensity was also measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS).

Results

Pain among BMS patients (evaluated by VAS) was 6.1 ± 1.9, and 4.3 ± 1.7 among nociceptive patients (P < 0.001). PainDETECT obtained total scores ≥ 19 in 21% of BMS patients, indicating the presence of neuropathic pain. When painDETECT pain descriptors were analyzed comparing the BMS group with nociceptive pain subjects, statistically significant differences were found for burning sensation (P < 0.010), prickling (P < 0.001), electric shock-like sensation (P = 0.046), thermal sensation (P < 0.001), and numbness (P = 0.002). Logistic regression analysis found that VAS scoring was the strongest determinant predicting neuropathic pain.

Conclusion

The present study suggests that almost a third of BMS patients present neuropathic pain, which is strongly associated with the intensity of pain measured using VAS. These data could provide the basis for further research.

### Risk factors for onset of chronic oro-facial pain – results of the north cheshire oro-facial pain prospective population study [^116fFVLG]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

2.3 Measurement of chronic oro-facial pain and associated factors

The definition and measurement of COFP and associated factors and the validity of the same have been described in detail in the baseline survey. Briefly, COFP was defined as pain in the face, mouth or jaws that had been present for one day or longer in the past month and that such pain had been present for three months or longer. This definition is likely to have included not only temporomandibular pain disorders but also other conditions such as burning mouth, atypical facial pain and atypical odontalgia that have been shown to cluster together into a single group. Subjects were defined as having new onset COFP if they were free of COFP at baseline and reported chronic oro-facial pain in the follow-up study (Fig. 1). Exposures measured at baseline in those who were free of COFP allowed us to test the study hypotheses regarding the importance of these exposures/risk factors in the onset of COFP (Fig. 1). The following putative risk factors were included in the analysis:
1 Demographic: these included age and gender. For the purpose of analysis age was divided into five categories with 18–35 being the youngest group and 64–75 the oldest (Table 1).
2 Mechanical factors: teeth grinding, missing teeth, facial trauma and the feeling that teeth did not fit together properly. These were recorded as YES/NO questions which were dichotomised for the purpose of analysis.
3 Psychosocial: these included anxiety, depression, health anxiety, reporting of somatic symptoms excluding pain, sleep disturbance and the reporting of adverse life events. These were analysed in tertiles as per the baseline study. Validated scales were used to measure each of these factors: a. Anxiety/depression – Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. b. Health anxiety – Health Anxiety Questionnaire. c. Sleep disturbance – Sleep Scale. d. Somatisation – Somatic symptoms checklist. e. Adverse life events – Life Events Inventory.
4 Reporting of other unexplained symptoms: these included musculoskeletal pain (chronic widespread pain classified using the American College of Rheumatology criteria), visceral pain (irritable bowel syndrome classified according to the Rome II criteria) and chronic fatigue (classified using the Chalder fatigue scale). For the purpose of analysis, head/face pain was excluded from the definition of chronic widespread pain to avoid overlap with chronic oro-facial pain.

### Fibromyalgia: an overview [^111zqZx5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

In this article, the authors review current concepts in fibromyalgia. Findings regarding diagnosis, prevalence, comorbidities, and potential pathophysiologic links are discussed. Although fibromyalgia continues to be a complex disorder, there are specific criteria one must meet. Fibromyalgia questionnaires, along with commonalities of age, gender, menopause status, sleep disturbances, and mood symptoms, may aid in the diagnosis. Additionally, the close relationship between fibromyalgia and other chronic disorders should alert the physician to explore for comorbid illness. The relationship between fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, migraine headaches, and obesity are addressed. The roles of the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis, potential effects of neurotransmitters, and gender-specific hormones all substantiate this diagnosis and provide clues to causality, as well as venues for future treatment.

### Thermal temporal summation and decay of after-sensations in temporomandibular myofascial pain patients with and without comorbid fibromyalgia [^113izhx9]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Participants

Participants, all women, all fluent in English, were enrolled solely on the basis of the presence (cases) or absence (controls) of a myofascial TMD. Each gave written informed consent and all examinations were conducted at the Bluestone Center for Clinical Research at the NYU College of Dentistry (NYUCD). The study was approved by the New York University (NYU) School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Data were collected between January and November 2011.

Myofascial TMD patients

Cases were recruited primarily from those seeking care at the Facial Pain Clinic at the NYUCD, but also from public postings at the NYU College of Dentistry. Participating myofascial TMD patients met RDC/TMD for TMD Group Ithat is, pain of muscle origin, including a complaint of pain and pain associated with localized areas of tenderness to palpation in muscle. They may have also met criteria for Groups 2 and 3, but this was not exclusionary. All patients reported facial pain of at least 1 year duration, and a minimum intensity of four of ten. The study coordinator (an MD) participated in biannual calibration training sessions to ensure consistency in this tender point examination as well as that for FM.

Controls

Controls were recruited from other NYUCD dental clinics and acquaintances of participating cases, constituting a sample that was a demographic match to cases on age, socioeconomic status, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. Controls could not have reported 1+ weeks of facial pain in the last 2 years or more than one painful site upon masticatory muscle palpation.

Exclusion criteria

Potential cases or controls indicating that they had a motor vehicle accident or another major and identifiable physical trauma involving the face were excluded, as were those with dental treatment within 48 hours of the RDC/TMD eligibility examination.

Measures

Pain history and intensity

The clinical research coordinator gathered RDC/TMD standardized pain history data, including questions about pain onset, pain severity, and pain-related disability. Characteristic pain intensity was computed as the average of present/current, worst, and average pain in the past 6 months, each rated on a 0–10 scale (0, no pain. 10, pain as bad as could be).

FM examination

All participants were evaluated according to the 1990 ACR criteria for the diagnosis of FM syndrome. Participants were enrolled on the basis of their TMD status, and their FM status was determined later.

### A systematic review of treatment for patients with burning mouth syndrome [^114nRrAP]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Ultramicronised palmitoylethanolamide (umPEA)

There is a small reduction of pain score with umPEA but its effect did not sustain. Systemic administration of PEA elicits anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and neuroprotective effects, both in vivo and in vitro, as well as in human subjects. Neurodegeneration could occur due to inflammatory reactions and activation of immune cells. Microglia facilitates the CNS's inflammatory response, and white mast cells coordinate PNS inflammation. umPEA is an endogenous fatty acid that suppresses the discharge of proinflammatory mediators from mast cells and microglia during inflammation, thus preventing neuronal injury and chronic pain. A meta-analysis study has reported umPEA as a novel treatment in managing chronic neuropathic pain caused by neuroinflammation. A study of 40 days umPEA has reported positive benefit in diabetic or traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain. The novelty of umPEA efficacy as a primary or adjunct treatment in BMS should be further studied with a larger cohort and follow-up period for its sustainability.

Herbal catuama

Three months used of catuama has shown a significant reduction in BMS pain score. Catuama is a herb commonly used for mental and physical exhaustion. It has been shown to have antidepressant, antinociceptive and vasorelaxant actions in animal models by acting on the dopaminergic, serotoninergic, and opioid pathways and reducing the inflammatory nociception in animal models. It is thought that catuama may alleviate the burning pain based on the possible BMS aetiologies of psychologic and neuropathic disorders. A more extended observation on the use of catuama is suggested to ensure its long-term adverse effects and suitability as a pain relief.

### ABM clinical protocol # 26: persistent pain with breastfeeding [^116SwZFJ]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Allodynia/functional pain — definition, associations, and potential management. Allodynia is defined as pain from a stimulus such as light touch that would not normally elicit pain, and breast allodynia can occur alone or with other disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, interstitial cystitis, migraines, temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ), and dyspareunia. Taking a careful history to assess for other pain disorders is important for informing treatment. In chronic pain literature, catastrophization, reduced psychological acceptance, depression, and anxiety are associated with diminished treatment response, and this literature suggests that mothers with breast allodynia, particularly with other chronic pain syndromes, may benefit from psychological therapy designed to treat chronic pain.

### Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (Tonmya) [^1169Ax8B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Five patients (0.7% of TONMYA-treated patients) experienced severe oral mucosal adverse reactions, including paresthesia, glossitis, hypoesthesia, oral pain, and dry mouth. Most reactions resolved within days after TONMYA was discontinued. Oral mucosal adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred more frequently in TONMYA-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients (4.5% vs. 0.5%).

Adverse Reactions from Other Trials

In an open-label, long-term 40 to 52-week safety trial (Trial 4) in an unapproved population of patients previously exposed to 5.6 mg TONMYA once daily (maximum recommended dosage) or placebo, 56 patients were treated with 5.6 mg of TONMYA for at least 1 year. The most common adverse reactions in the TONMYA-treated patients (> 5%) were oral hypoesthesia (45%), somnolence (18%), abnormal product taste (7%), and paresthesia oral (7%).

In an open-label, long-term 52 week safety trial of adult patients with fibromyalgia previously been exposed to 2.8 mg TONMYA once daily (one half the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]) or placebo (Trial 5), 97 patients were treated for at least 1 year with 2.8 mg of TONMYA once daily. The most common adverse reactions (> 5%) in the TONMYA-treated patients were hypoesthesia oral (15%), fatigue (7%), sinusitis (7%), and abnormal product taste (6%).

### Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults [^116D4MA6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a review published in 2011, itself a major update of previous reviews published in 2005 and 2000, investigating the effects of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). Antiepileptic drugs are used to manage chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.

Search Methods

We identified randomised trials of gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia by searching the databases MEDLINE (1966 to March 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 10), and CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (Issue 3 of 12, 2014). We obtained clinical trial reports and synopses of published and unpublished studies from Internet sources, and searched Clinicaltrials.gov. Searches were run originally in 2011 and the date of the most recent search was 17 March 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind studies reporting the analgesic and adverse effects of gabapentin in neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia with assessment of pain intensity, pain relief, or both, using validated scales. Participants were adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, examined issues of study quality, and assessed risk of bias. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks duration, parallel design), second tier from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison, and third tier from data involving small numbers of participants that were considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both. For efficacy, we calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNT), concentrating on at least 50% pain intensity reduction, and Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) definitions of at least moderate and substantial benefit. For harm we calculated number needed to treat for harm (NNH) for adverse effects and withdrawal. Meta-analysis was undertaken using a fixed-effect model. We emphasised differences between conditions now defined as neuropathic pain, and other conditions like masticatory pain, complex regional painsyndrome type 1 (CRPS-1), and fibromyalgia.

Main Results

Seven new studies with 1919 participants were added. Another report (147 participants) provided results for a study already included, but which previously had no usable data. A further report (170 participants) used an experimental formulation of intrathecal gabapentin. Thirty-seven studies (5633 participants) studied oral gabapentin at daily doses of 1200 mg or more in 12 chronic pain conditions; 84% of participants were in studies of postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy or mixed neuropathic pain. There was no first tier evidence. Second tier evidence for the outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction, considered valuable by patients with chronic pain, showed that gabapentin was significantly better than placebo in postherpetic neuralgia (34% gabapentin versus 21% placebo; NNT 8.0, 95% CI 6.0 to 12) and painful diabetic neuropathy (38% versus 21%, NNT 5.9, 95% CI 4.6 to 8.3). There was insufficient information in other pain conditions to reach any reliable conclusion. There was no obvious difference between standard gabapentin formulations and recently-introduced extended-release or gastro-retentive formulations, or between different doses of gabapentin. Adverse events occurred significantly more often with gabapentin. Persons taking gabapentin could expect to have at least one adverse event (62%), withdraw because of an adverse event (11%), suffer dizziness (19%), somnolence (14%), peripheral oedema (7%), and gait disturbance (9%). Serious adverse events (3%) were no more common than with placebo. There were insufficient data for direct comparisons with other active treatments, and only third tier evidence for other painful conditions.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no top tier evidence that was unequivocally unbiased. Second tier evidence, with potentially important residual biases, showed that gabapentin at doses of 1200 mg or more was effective for some people with some painful neuropathic pain conditions. The outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction is regarded as a useful outcome of treatment by patients, and the achievement of this degree of pain relief is associated with important beneficial effects on sleep interference, fatigue, and depression, as well as quality of life, function, and work. About 35% achieved this degree of pain relief with gabapentin, compared with 21% for placebo. Over half of those treated with gabapentin will not have worthwhile pain relief. Results might vary between different neuropathic pain conditions, and the amount of evidence for gabapentin in neuropathic pain conditions except postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy, and in fibromyalgia, is very limited. The levels of efficacy found for gabapentin are consistent with those found for other drug therapies in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy.

### Evidence for abnormal pain processing in fibromyalgia syndrome [^114DfZ2k]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia syndrome.

Design

Review of the literature available on Medline (1965–2001).

Results

Fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic pain syndrome that predominantly afflicts women. It is characterized by widespread pain, insomnia, fatigue, and the presence of multiple tender points. Despite intensifying research, the etiology of fibromyalgia has remained unclear. Importantly, neither infections, trauma, nor psychiatric abnormalities consistently precede the onset of pain in patients with this syndrome. There is, however, mounting evidence for central pain processing abnormalities in almost all fibromyalgia patients. These anomalies include hyperalgesia, allodynia, abnormal temporal summation of second pain, neuroendocrine abnormalities, and abnormal activation of pain-related brain regions.

Conclusions

Multiple abnormal findings in fibromyalgia patients strongly indicate a neuropathic pain syndrome, reminiscent of complex regional pain syndrome or postherpetic neuralgia. In addition, fibromyalgia syndrome seems to share similar characteristics with these neuropathic pain syndromes, including ineffective response to many analgesics.

### Systematic review of the comorbidity of irritable bowel syndrome with other disorders: what are the causes and implications? [^112TGDev]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Comorbid or extraintestinal symptoms occur frequently with irritable bowel syndrome and account for up to three fourths of excess health care visits. This challenges the assumption that irritable bowel is a distinct disorder. The aims of this study were to (1) assess comorbidity in 3 areas: gastrointestinal disorders, psychiatric disorders, and nongastrointestinal somatic disorders; and (2) evaluate explanatory hypotheses.

Methods

The scientific literature since 1966 in all languages cited in Medline was systematically reviewed.

Results

Comorbidity with other functional gastrointestinal disorders is high and may be caused by shared pathophysiological mechanisms such as visceral hypersensitivity. Psychiatric disorders, especially major depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders, occur in up to 94%. The nongastrointestinal nonpsychiatric disorders with the best-documented association are fibromyalgia (median of 49% have IBS), chronic fatigue syndrome (51%), temporomandibular joint disorder (64%), and chronic pelvic pain (50%).

Conclusions

Multivariate statistical analyses suggest that these are distinct disorders and not manifestations of a common somatization disorder, but their strong comorbidity suggests a common feature important to their expression, which is most likely psychological. Some models explain the comorbidity of irritable bowel with other disorders by suggesting that each disorder is the manifestation of varying combinations of interacting physiological and psychological factors. An alternative hypothesis is that the irritable bowel diagnosis is applied to a heterogeneous group of patients, some of whom have a predominantly psychological etiology, whereas others have a predominantly biological etiology, and that the presence of multiple comorbid disorders is a marker for psychological influences on etiology.

### Salivary metabolome indicates a shift in tyrosine metabolism in patients with burning mouth syndrome: a prospective case-control study [^116V7tjF]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The pathophysiology of primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) remains controversial. Targeted analyses or "omics" approach of saliva provide diagnostic or pathophysiological biomarkers. This pilot study's primary objective was to explore the pathophysiology of BMS through a comparative analysis of the salivary metabolome among 26 BMS female cases and 25 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Secondary objectives included comparative analyses of inflammatory cytokines, neuroinflammatory markers, and steroid hormones among cases and control subjects, and among BMS patients according to their clinical characteristics. Salivary metabolome, neuroinflammatory markers, cytokines, and steroids were, respectively, analysed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, ELISA and protease activity assay, and multiparametric Luminex method. Among the 166 detected metabolites, univariate analysis did not find any discriminant metabolite between groups. Supervised multivariate analysis divided patients into 2 groups with an accuracy of 60% but did not allow significant discrimination (permutation test, P = 0.35). Among the metabolites contributing to the model, 3 belonging to the tyrosine pathway (l -dopa, l -tyrosine, and tyramine) were involved in the discrimination between cases and control subjects, and among BMS patients according to their levels of pain. Among the detectable molecules, levels of cytokines, steroid hormones, and neuroinflammatory markers did not differ between cases and control subjects and were not associated with characteristics of BMS patients. These results do not support the involvement of steroid hormones, inflammatory cytokines, or inflammatory neurogenic mediators in the pathophysiology of pain in BMS, whereas the observed shift in tyrosine metabolism may indicate an adaptative response to chronic pain or an impaired dopaminergic transmission.

### The complexities of fibromyalgia and its comorbidities [^112XrZd8]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is defined as chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness with concomitant mood and cognitive dysfunction. Several comorbidities have been reported to be associated with FMS. We reviewed the literature concerning the most noteworthy chronic conditions associated with FMS.

Recent Findings

There is mounting evidence displaying the concurrence of fibromyalgia and coexisting medical and psychiatric conditions. Such comorbidities may blur the classical clinical presentations and erroneously lead to misinterpretation of disease activity. The recognition of this fact should be underlined, as misrecognition may lead to excessive therapy and avoidable side-effects of medications on the one hand and to a better handling of FMS on the other hand, leading to improved clinical outcomes.

Summary

A greater proportion of psychiatric and rheumatologic disorders are associated with FMS patients than the population. Consequently, physicians treating patients with either condition should keep in mind that these patients may have such comorbidities and should be treated accordingly.

### A systematic review of treatment for patients with burning mouth syndrome [^1127QWNY]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Burning mouth syndrome is a chronic idiopathic intractable intraoral dysaesthesia that remains a challenge to clinicians due to its poorly understood pathogenesis and inconsistent response to various treatments.

Aim

This review aimed to study the short- (≤ 3 months) and long-term (> 3 months) effectiveness and sustainable benefit of different burning mouth syndrome treatment strategies and the associated side effects.

Materials and Methods

Randomised controlled trials of burning mouth syndrome treatment compared with placebo or other interventions with a minimum follow up of 2 months were searched from the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane database (published to July 2020).

Results

Twenty-two studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and analysed. Nine categories of burning mouth syndrome treatment were identified: Anticonvulsant and antidepressant agents, phytomedicine and alpha lipoic acid supplements, low-level laser therapy, saliva substitute, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and cognitive behaviour therapy. Cognitive behaviour therapy, topical capsaicin and clonazepam, and laser therapy demonstrated favourable outcome in both short- and long-term assessment. Phytomedicines reported a short-term benefit in pain score reduction. The pooled effect of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) pain score improvement was low, but its positive effects increased in long term assessment.

Conclusion

A more significant volume in terms of sample size, multi-centres, and multi-arm comparison of therapeutic agents with placebo and longitudinal follow-up studies is recommended to establish a standardised burning mouth syndrome treatment protocol. Further studies are required to assess the analgesic benefits of topical clonazepam and capsaicin, alternative medicines with neurodegenerative prevention capability and psychology support in treating burning mouth syndrome and reducing systemic adverse drug reactions.

### A systematic review of treatment for patients with burning mouth syndrome [^112eCZpB]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Cognitive therapy

Bergdahl et al. reported an impressive reduction of three units of pain scores for both short and long-term assessment. The study has clearly defined its BMS patients as similar to the current ICOP recommendation, despite being an early years study and proven CBT benefits. BMS has frequently been associated with psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, hypochondriasis and cancerphobia. It remains unclear whether anxiety and depression precede BMS or if they are a consequence of chronic pain. Treatment-resistant patients may have a contributing psychological factor. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a common psychotherapeutic intervention for patients with chronic pain, and its effectiveness is influenced by the level of empathy received by the patient. Interestingly, females have commonly better outcomes than males. CBT improves the patient's quality of life by allowing them to perform their daily activities without limitation and diverts their concentration on the pain, changing the thought and coping adaptive behaviours. A combination of psychopharmacological treatment may help the patient avoid the possibility of drug abuse and adverse effects. However, a larger sample size should be obtained to establish the benefit of CBT and to rule out the attention placebo effect, as the patient was reviewed more frequently.

In summary, the statistical analysis on the RCTs comparing intervention with placebo suggests a strong favourable outcome (SMD > 1.000) for cognitive behavioural therapy, capsaicin, topical clonazepam, and laser therapy (highest to lowest) in both short- and long-term assessment. There was some evidence on the use of phytomedicines such as umPEA, herbal catuama and hypericum perforatum in short-term pain score reduction. There were negligible changes in short term pain improvement in both trazodone and ALA (pooled effects) studies. However, the positive effects of ALA increase in long-term assessment. Although the pooled effect of ALA pain score improvement is low, the number of patients responding to ALA and its combination with gabapentin or a vitamin were high in both short- and long-term assessments. Capsaicin, topical clonazepam and saliva substitute lysozyme lactoperoxidase showed consistent treatment effectiveness or improvement in pain comparing with placebo in both short- and long-term analysis.

Burning mouth syndrome is characterised by chronic orofacial burning pain. No dental or medical cause has been found. We present a case of burning mouth syndrome of 6 months duration in a healthy 65-year-old woman, which was associated with high copy numbers of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA in the saliva. Her pain resolved completely after antiviral treatment with a corresponding absence of salivary HSV-1 DNA 4 weeks and 6 months later.

### Phantosmia and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in a patient with burning mouth syndrome suffering from severe depression [^117FybqS]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a rare but serious medical condition with important psychiatric comorbidity and specific psychological correlates. Psychopathology related with BMS represents a real challenge for clinical decision-making. In this case, depression is the leading psychiatric diagnosis associated with patient's BMS somatic pain and is driven by anxiety and a dissociative functioning. Facing a complex psychosomatic symptomatology, we offer new clinical perspectives for the screening of psychological traits of BMS. Moreover, we highlight the need to foster interdisciplinarity to improve differential diagnosis and defining an optimal care path. This case report stimulates a reflection on management challenges for the consultation-liaison psychiatry and shows the importance of a person-centred approach when communicating the diagnosis.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant reactions are described in greater detail, in other sections of this labeling:

Embryofetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Tricyclic Antidepressant-like Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Atropine-like Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
CNS Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Oral Mucosal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of sublingual TONMYA (14 days of 2.8 mg once daily and then 5.6 mg once daily thereafter) is supported by three double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3) in adult patients with fibromyalgia [see Clinical Studies (14)]. A total of 1,182 patients completed at least 14 weeks of daily treatment, including 580 TONMYA-treated patients (14 days of 2.8 mg once daily and then 5.6 mg once daily thereafter) and 602 placebo-treated patients.

Table 1 summarizes the most common adverse reactions in Trials 1, 2, and 3 (≥ 2% of TONMYA-treated patients and at a higher incidence in TONMYA-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients).

Oral Mucosal Adverse Reactions in Trials 1, 2, and 3

In Trials 1, 2, and 3, 43% of TONMYA-treated patients compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent oral mucosal adverse reaction. The most common oral mucosal adverse reactions included oral hypoesthesia, abnormal product taste, oral paresthesia, tongue discomfort, oral discomfort, glossodynia, oral pain, and aphthous ulcer. The majority (82%) of oral mucosal adverse reactions began within minutes of dosing, and of those, 88% occurred after nearly every dose. Almost two-thirds lasted less than 60 minutes. Of the approximately one-third that lasted longer than 60 minutes, 63% were present the next morning.

### A systematic review of treatment for patients with burning mouth syndrome [^111URWpB]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Topical capsaicin

Short term (2 months)

Rinsing with 250 mg of chilli powder emulsified in 50 mL water with a dose concentration of 3.54 µg⁄ml capsaicin has been reported to induce a significant reduction in VAS score (MD −3.2, p < 0.01) with 76% of participants reporting an improvement in symptoms, but one patient-reporting a worsening. Capsaicin provides an immediate short term pain relief (SMD −1.49, 95% CI −2.35 to −0.63) and is statistically significant with 21 times better than placebo (RR 21.00, 95% CI 1.35 to 326.97). Topical capsaicin has shown a better clinical pain management outcome than oral ALA and lysozyme lactoperoxidase, despite no statistically significant VAS difference in intergroup comparison.

Long term (4 months)

Capsaicin showed superiority in maintaining VAS score reduction in long term (MD −2.9, p = 0.03) compared to lysozyme-lactoperoxidase, boric acid rinse and ALA. It also demonstrates sustainable benefit in long term administration (SMD −1.09, 95% CI −2.11 to −0.06). It is 13 times better than placebo but not statistically significant (RR 13.00, 95% CI 0.84–201.27). An improvement in pain intensity was reported by 67% of participants, while one patient remained the same, reported worsening of pain. No adverse effect was noted during the trial.

Ultramicronised palmitoylethanolamide (umPEA)

Short term (2 months) and long term (4 months)

Ottaviani et al. revealed a short-term (60 days) benefit with 1200 mg/day umPEA in BMS patients (SMD −0.70, 95% CI −1.39 to −0.01) but declining pain relief at 4 months (SMD −0.26, 95% CI −0.94 to 0.41) compared to placebo group. There were no side effects observed in patients treated with umPEA.

### A systematic review of treatment for patients with burning mouth syndrome [^116J19Np]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

The total pool of treated participants was 623, with a wide age range from 43 to 89 years. All BMS participants were appropriately defined as having chronic pain for more than 3 months, with normal oral mucosa and absence of contributing local or systemic factors, except De Rivera Campillo et al. (duration of BMS was less than 6 months), Cinar et al. (average duration of BMS was 17 days), Ottaviani et al. (duration of pain was 1 month), and Bergdahl et al. (no description of BMS duration).

The visual analogue scale (VAS) or visual numerical scale (VNS) of either 0–10 or 0–100 scores were the primary assessment tools in measuring post-therapy pain improvement (.) except Bergdahl et al. with a VAS scale of 1–7. Six studies used categorical changes in pain improvement as their assessment tool. Supplementary assessment tools such as the McGill Pain Questionnaire, faces scales, Orofacial Pain Clinic Questionnaire (EDOF-HC) and Brief pain Inventory (BPI) were used to evaluate pain intensity and associated characteristics further. Face scales classified patients' expression of happiness based on a pictured face scale of 0–5 (lower is better). Secondary outcome assessment of participants' quality of health, anxiety and depression, and quality of sleep were evaluated using patient-reported questionnaires, such as 36-Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Oral Health on Quality of Life (OHIP 14), Patient Health Questionnaires-9 (PHQ-9), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Clinical Global Impression for global Improvement Scale (CGC-Z), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Zerssen Mood Scale (ZMS), Hamilton Rating Scale (HRS), Psychometric Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R), Medical Outcomes Survey (MOS) of Sleep Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).

The substantial heterogeneity in the treatment methodology and regime, the follow-up time and inadequately reported statistical data precluded formal meta-analysis on the efficacy of a treatment in this review. However, combined SMD VAS scores or RR of studies with similar interventions were pooled with 95% CI. Two studies without comparison with placebo and another, which described outcomes using median values, were qualitatively analysed.

### Thermal temporal summation and decay of after-sensations in temporomandibular myofascial pain patients with and without comorbid fibromyalgia [^114UVcki]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Testing phase: quantitative rating of late sensations and/or peak pain

These tests quantify the intensity of late thermal sensations during stimulation and any AS that may linger. Stimulation parameters were identical to those described for training. All ratings employed a 100 point numerical rating scale (NRS), with several categorical reference points (see Participant instructions below).
Procedure. The starting temperature for this procedure was 1°C less than that shown to produce late sensations, C-nociceptive qualities, or AS during training. If the training procedure failed to locate an appropriate temperature, 45°C was used. Figure 1 summarizes the decision points that were used to tailor the stimulation temperature to each participant's needs. Participants were cued to rate intensity after presentation of the 1st, 5th, 10th, and 15th stimulus in the train, and were also cued to rate the intensity of residual AS at 15 seconds intervals for 2 minutes afterward. When AS were reported at the "0" level for two successive periods, the trial was terminated before 2 minutes and "0" was imputed to each remaining time point. After each attempt to achieve TS, there was a break of several minutes before retesting.
Participant instructions. This test uses a series of temperatures like those you just experienced, except now I want you to use a number to rate the intensity of the late sensations, or peak pain/maximum pain, if there are no late sensations. Please make your ratings using numbers from this scale (present chart), with these anchors: 10, warm; 20, a barely painful sensation; 30, very weak pain; 40, weak pain; 50, moderate pain; 60, slightly strong pain; 70, strong pain; 80, very strong pain; 90, nearly intolerable pain; and 100, intolerable pain. Do you understand how to use the scale?

As before, hold the surface against your thumb. The machine will present you with a series of 15 temperatures, each lastinĝ1 second and followed within 2 seconds by another temperature. Now and then you'll hear a beep. When you hear the beep, make your intensity ratings for the temperature which immediately follows. Your first judgment is usually best, so answer as quickly as possible. Unless you absolutely cannot stand it, please hold the surface in place until the last temperature is delivered (~30 seconds), and then remove it from your skin. For up to 2 minutes after that, I'll again ask you to rate the intensity. Any questions?

### Contribution of neuroinflammation in burning mouth syndrome: indications from benzodiazepine use [^112PNwZ3]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Characterized by burning and painful oral sensations in absence of clinically significant mucosal abnormalities, the burning mouth syndrome is, despite numerous researches made, basically idiopathic and, consequently, difficult to treat effectively. Therapy with tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines has been proposed, although the exact pathomechanism is not clear. The objective of this study is to define the possible reasons for the efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of the burning mouth syndrome. Starting from the report of eight cases successfully treated with prazepam, the present authors examined the clinical features and the evidence from literature that support the possibility of a role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of the burning mouth syndrome. Available data suggest that the nervous system could be crucial in the pathogenesis of the syndrome (altered perception of pain, disturbance of neural transmission, increased excitability, negative involvement of trigeminal-vascular system), and the present authors' experience lets them suppose a role for neuroinflammation. This hypothesis could also explain the positive response to benzodiazepines in some patients. The important role of neuroinflammation in dermatologic and oral diseases has been only recently investigated and acknowledged. Further studies on the connection between neuroinflammation and burning mouth syndrome could open interesting perspectives in the understanding and management of this difficult clinical condition.

### Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome [^112vB4S6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a term used for oral mucosal pain (burning pain or discomfort in the tongue, lips or entire oral cavity) without identifiable cause. General population prevalence varies from 0.1% to 3.9%. Many BMS patients indicate anxiety, depression, personality disorders and impaired quality of life (QoL). This review updates the previous versions published in 2000 and 2005.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of any intervention versus placebo for symptom relief and changes in QoL, taste, and feeling of dryness in people with BMS.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 31 December 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library (searched 31 December 2015), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 31 December 2015), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 31 December 2015). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any treatment against placebo in people with BMS. The primary outcomes were symptom relief (pain/burning) and change in QoL. Secondary outcomes included change in taste, feeling of dryness, and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Outcome data were analysed as short-term (up to three months) or long-term (three to six months).

Main Results

We included 23 RCTs (1121 analysed participants; 83% female). Interventions were categorised as: antidepressants and antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, cholinergics, dietary supplements, electromagnetic radiation, physical barriers, psychological therapies, and topical treatments. Only one RCT was assessed at low risk of bias overall, four RCTs' risk of bias was unclear, and 18 studies were at high risk of bias. Overall quality of the evidence for effectiveness was very low for all interventions and all outcomes. Twenty-one RCTs assessed short-term symptom relief. There is very low-quality evidence of benefit from electromagnetic radiation (one RCT, 58 participants), topical benzodiazepines (two RCTs, 111 participants), physical barriers (one RCT, 50 participants), and anticonvulsants (one RCT, 100 participants). We found insufficient/contradictory evidence regarding the effectiveness of antidepressants, cholinergics, systemic benzodiazepines, dietary supplements or topical treatments. No RCT assessing psychological therapies evaluated short-term symptom relief. Four studies assessed long-term symptom relief. There is very low-quality evidence of a benefit from psychological therapies (one RCT, 30 participants), capsaicin oral rinse (topical treatment) (one RCT, 18 participants), and topical benzodiazepines (one RCT, 66 participants). We found no evidence of a difference for dietary supplements or lactoperoxidase oral rinse. No studies assessing antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cholinergics, electromagnetic radiation or physical barriers evaluated long-term symptom relief. Short-term change in QoL was assessed by seven studies (none long-term). The quality of evidence was very low. A benefit was found for electromagnetic radiation (one RCT, 58 participants), however findings were inconclusive for antidepressants, benzodiazepines, dietary supplements and physical barriers. Secondary outcomes (change in taste and feeling of dryness) were only assessed short-term, and the findings for both were also inconclusive. With regard to adverse effects, there is very low-quality evidence that antidepressants increase dizziness and drowsiness (one RCT, 37 participants), and that alpha lipoic acid increased headache (two RCTs, 118 participants) and gastrointestinal complaints (3 RCTs, 138 participants). We found insufficient/contradictory evidence regarding adverse events for anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines. Adverse events were poorly reported or unreported for cholinergics, electromagnetic radiation, and psychological therapies. No adverse events occurred from physical barriers or topical therapy use.

Authors' Conclusions

Given BMS' potentially disabling nature, the need to identify effective modes of treatment for sufferers is vital. Due to the limited number of clinical trials at low risk of bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any interventions in managing BMS. Further clinical trials, with improved methodology and standardised outcome sets are required in order to establish which treatments are effective. Future studies are encouraged to assess the role of treatments used in other neuropathic pain conditions and psychological therapies in the treatment of BMS.

### Efficacy and safety of photobiomodulation combined with oral cryotherapy on oral mucosa pain in patients with burning mouth syndrome: a multi-institutional, randomized, controlled trial [^112xN3SV]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a complex chronic neuropathic pain disorder that is characterized by generalized or localized intraoral pain or a burning sensation in an otherwise healthy-appearing oral mucosa without any evidence of specific mucosal lesions and/or laboratory findings. The absence of objective clinical and pathological manifestations associated with pain symptoms makes it challenging for BMS patients to comprehend these symptoms, thus potentially leading to delays in diagnosis and even worsening of symptoms. The global prevalence of BMS is 1.73% in the general population and almost 8% in clinical patients, and this disorder mainly affects women who are middle-aged and older and women who are peri- and postmenopausal. Previous studies have suggested that chronic pain may have a detrimental effect on patients' physical and mental health via disruptions in the neuroendocrine system and abnormalities in the brain's endogenous pain modulation and mood-regulating systems. Chronic pain in BMS patients is often associated with psychological distress, such as anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality, all of which can result in poor oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). Therefore, the chronicization of pain due to BMS often poses a major therapeutic challenge.

### Outcomes and predictors of response of duloxetine for the treatment of persistent idiopathic dentoalveolar pain: a retrospective multicenter observational study [^111veJSd]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The expected adverse reactions to duloxetine have been reported to mainly be nausea. It appeared immediately after taking the drug. In this study, the incidence of nausea was 17.2% (21 out of 122 cases) which was consistent with that reported by Nagashima et al (17%), but their result was well below the 34.29% reported by Bidari et al. This may be because the population in our study was PIDP patients and in Nagashima's study was BMS and AO patients, while the population observed by Bidari et alwere women with Fibromyalgia. Bitter et al indicate that the antiemetics are resistant to continuous use, and it is clinically recommended to slowly titrate duloxetine while closely monitoring its adverse reactions. In this study, none of the patients receive prophylactic antiemetic agents. In accordance with Nagashima et al, to treat the early adverse event of anxiety and insomnia after taken duloxetine, 2 patients (1.5%) took alprazolam with the dosage no more than 1.2 mg/day. Pain physicians who prescribed duloxetine asked patients to take duloxetine with meals and slowly increased the dose of duloxetine to reduce the incidence nausea. In this study, the incidence of dry mouth was 3.2%, which was consistent with the report by Kobayashi et al. The incidence of dry mouth in duloxetine group (5.2%) was far lower than that of TCA amitriptyline when prescribed to patients with chronic orofacial pain (26.7%)as the affinity of duloxetine for muscarinic receptors was lower. So, for PIDP, duloxetine has fewer oral cavity side effects and patient compliance is higher. Hence, duloxetine may be more useful than TCAs for the treatment of diseases with oral symptoms, such as PIDP. Consistent with Bidari et al's findings, most of the adverse events in patients taking duloxetine occurred in the first and second weeks after taking the drug in women with fibromyalgia. Doctors should inform the patient before taking the medicine to improve compliance.
