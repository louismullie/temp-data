## Question

Does obesity cause low albumin level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether obesity causes low albumin levels and, if so, by what mechanisms and how strong the evidence is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how albumin behaves as a negative acute-phase reactant and what drives its concentration. Then, I should verify the strength of association between obesity and hypoalbuminemia across populations and studies. Next, I will examine proposed causal mechanisms, including inflammation, altered hepatic synthesis, and increased distribution volume. After that, I need to distinguish albuminuria from serum hypoalbuminemia and check for potential confounders and modifiers. Finally, I will integrate these threads into a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline implications for practice and interpretation of albumin as a biomarker.

> Let me first confirm the biological frame. Albumin is a negative acute-phase reactant; its serum level falls when systemic inflammation is present, independent of nutritional intake, which means that low albumin primarily signals an inflammatory milieu rather than starvation per se in most clinical contexts, including obesity-related chronic low-grade inflammation [^11788bEW] [^112pWRHm] [^113jyvpw].

> Now, I should review whether obesity consistently associates with lower albumin. Wait, let me verify across diverse cohorts. Large clinical databases and population studies repeatedly show inverse associations between BMI and albumin and increased hypoalbuminemia prevalence in obesity, including in surgical cohorts where hypoalbuminemia is common in patients with obesity and independently predicts complications and mortality, reinforcing that the relationship is clinically meaningful beyond mere statistical noise [^116hsBnc] [^111wb8oy] [^117FqQMm].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check the inflammation pathway. Obesity drives chronic low-grade inflammation with elevated IL-6 and TNF-α, which suppress hepatic albumin synthesis, increase capillary permeability with redistribution into the interstitium, and accelerate catabolism, collectively lowering measured serum albumin despite increased fractional synthesis in some states; these cytokine-driven effects align with albumin's role as a negative acute-phase reactant and with the observed clinical associations [^113jyvpw] [^11788bEW] [^114N8mjs].

> But wait, what if glycated albumin confounds interpretation? Hmm, wait a minute — let me verify. In obesity, glycated albumin tends to be lower at a given glycemia due to increased albumin turnover and inflammation, so lower GA does not equal higher true albumin; this underscores that GA and total albumin move in different directions in obesity and should not be conflated when inferring total serum albumin status [^113PWz6r] [^112Jwk6N] [^111KaivE].

> Next, I should review indirect evidence for causality. I need to ensure that interventions targeting obesity or inflammation change albumin in the expected direction. Bariatric surgery and weight loss consistently reduce albuminuria and are associated with improved albumin kinetics, and anti-inflammatory or weight-loss interventions can normalize low albumin in select contexts, supporting a causal contribution of obesity-related inflammation to altered albumin handling even if the magnitude of serum albumin change varies by population and comorbidity burden [^112cqQYS] [^112hS9gk] [^113Fn3ed].

> Hold on, I should verify confounders and special cases. Albuminuria is a distinct but related signal; obesity promotes albuminuria via glomerular hyperfiltration and podocyte injury, which can coexist with lower serum albumin in some patients, but urinary albumin loss is not necessary to explain lower serum albumin in obesity because inflammation alone suffices; conversely, malnutrition can also lower albumin, but in obesity hypoalbuminemia often reflects inflammation more than protein deficiency unless there is concurrent wasting or advanced organ failure [^1172NNyP] [^116uqVRp] [^112pWRHm].

> Let me consider population specificity. The strength of association and the exact albumin range vary by cohort, with particularly strong signals in surgical populations and in those with high inflammatory burdens; importantly, in many such settings, hypoalbuminemia independently predicts complications, readmissions, and mortality, which reinforces the clinical salience of low albumin in obesity even if not every obese individual is hypoalbuminemic [^116hsBnc] [^111wb8oy] [^117FqQMm].

> I should double-check my conclusion. Given convergent epidemiologic associations, robust mechanistic plausibility via proinflammatory cytokines altering synthesis, distribution, and catabolism, and interventional data showing albumin-related improvements with weight loss and inflammation reduction, obesity appears to cause lower serum albumin levels through an inflammation-driven mechanism rather than protein deficiency alone, though the magnitude is variable and influenced by comorbidities and acute stressors [^113jyvpw] [^11788bEW] [^113oHMtT].

> Clinically, I need to ensure I interpret albumin correctly. Low albumin in a person with obesity is best viewed as a marker of nutrition risk and systemic inflammation rather than a direct nutrition intake measure; I should pair albumin with inflammatory markers like CRP and clinical context, and prioritize treating the inflammatory driver while optimizing protein intake, rather than assuming malnutrition alone or reflexively ordering albumin infusions, which do not correct the underlying pathophysiology in most cases [^112pWRHm] [^11788bEW] [^113jyvpw].

---

Obesity is linked to **lower serum albumin** through chronic low-grade inflammation [^113jyvpw] [^114N8mjs], increased capillary permeability [^11788bEW], and altered hepatic synthesis, rather than dietary protein deficiency alone [^112VzfTb]. Low albumin in obesity reflects **inflammation and vascular leakiness** [^113jyvpw] [^11788bEW] and is associated with higher risks of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and adverse clinical outcomes [^113sLEiv] [^116hsBnc]. Weight loss and inflammation reduction can improve albumin levels, underscoring the role of adiposity-driven inflammation in this relationship [^1156jwmR] [^112hS9gk].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking obesity to low albumin

Several **interconnected mechanisms** explain why obesity is associated with lower serum albumin levels:

---

### Chronic low-grade inflammation

- **Cytokine-mediated effects**: Obesity triggers chronic inflammation with elevated IL-6 and TNF-α [^114N8mjs], which suppress hepatic albumin synthesis and increase albumin catabolism [^115jr7Mh].
- **Negative acute-phase reactant**: Albumin falls during inflammation due to increased capillary permeability and redistribution into the interstitium [^11788bEW] [^1161Vyws].

---

### Increased capillary permeability and albumin loss

Obesity increases capillary permeability, promoting **albumin escape into the interstitium** [^113jyvpw] and contributing to **relative hypoalbuminemia** despite normal or increased synthesis [^11788bEW].

---

### Altered hepatic albumin synthesis

Obesity-related NAFLD can impair hepatic protein synthesis, including albumin, leading to **reduced circulating levels**.

---

### Nutritional factors

While obesity often coexists with excess caloric intake, **dietary quality may be poor**, leading to **suboptimal protein intake** and contributing to lower albumin levels.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies have documented the **link between obesity and low albumin**:

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Lower albumin is associated with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes [^113oHMtT] [^112QAZ4F].
- **Adipose tissue inflammation**: Reduced albumin correlates with greater adipose tissue macrophage content and activation [^112QAZ4F] [^115TXoVH].
- **Bariatric surgery**: Weight loss after bariatric surgery improves albumin levels, likely via reduced inflammation and improved metabolic health [^112cqQYS] [^112hS9gk].

---

## Clinical implications and health risks

Low albumin in obesity is **not merely a laboratory abnormality**; it carries significant clinical implications:

- **Increased surgical risk**: Hypoalbuminemia in obese patients is associated with higher perioperative complications and mortality [^116hsBnc] [^111wb8oy].
- **Metabolic complications**: Low albumin is linked to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease [^113jyvpw] [^112BKXCP].
- **Inflammatory burden**: Low albumin reflects systemic inflammation, a key driver of obesity-related comorbidities [^11788bEW] [^113jyvpw].

---

## Interventions to improve albumin levels in obesity

Effective strategies to improve albumin levels in obesity **focus on reducing inflammation and improving metabolic health**:

- **Weight loss**: Caloric restriction, exercise, and bariatric surgery reduce inflammation and improve albumin levels [^112cqQYS] [^112hS9gk].
- **Anti-inflammatory therapies**: Medications targeting inflammation may theoretically improve albumin, though evidence is limited.
- **Nutritional support**: Ensuring adequate protein intake and correcting micronutrient deficiencies can support albumin synthesis [^notfound].

---

Obesity is associated with **lower serum albumin** primarily through chronic inflammation, increased capillary permeability, and altered hepatic synthesis. Low albumin in obesity reflects systemic inflammation and is linked to increased metabolic and surgical risks. Weight loss and inflammation reduction can improve albumin levels, highlighting the importance of addressing adiposity-driven inflammation in clinical management.

Conclusion

In summary, low albumin was associated with an adverse metabolic profile characterized by increased adiposity, plasma glucose concentrations, and adipose tissue inflammation. Moreover, reduced albumin increased risk for T2D. These findings place albumin within the existing paradigm linking obesity-related inflammation and T2D.

### Low albumin levels, more than morbid obesity, are associated with complications after TKA [^116ZHVd9]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Morbid obesity and malnutrition are thought to be associated with more frequent perioperative complications after TKA. However, morbid obesity and malnutrition often are co-occurring conditions. Therefore it is important to understand whether morbid obesity, malnutrition, or both are independently associated with more frequent perioperative complications. In addition, assessing the magnitude of an increase in complications and whether these complications are major or minor is important for both conditions.

Questions/Purposes

We asked: (1) Is morbid obesity independently associated with more frequent major perioperative complications after TKA? (2) Are major perioperative complications after TKA more prevalent among patients with a low serum albumin?

Methods

The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was analyzed from 2006 to 2013. Patients were grouped as morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) or nonmorbidly obese (BMI ≥ 18.5 kg/m(2) to < 40 kg/m(2)), or by low serum albumin (serum albumin level < 3.5 mg/dL) or normal serum albumin (serum albumin level ≥ 3.5 mg/dL). The study cohort included 77,785 patients, including 35,573 patients with a serum albumin level of 3.5 g/dL or greater and 1570 patients with a serum albumin level less than 3.5 g/dL. Therefore, serum albumin levels were available for only 37,173 of the 77,785 of the patients (48%). There were 66,382 patients with a BMI between 18.5 kg/m(2) and 40 kg/m(2) and 11,403 patients with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m(2). Data were recorded on patient mortality along with 21 complications reported in the NSQIP. We also developed three composite complication variables to represent risk of any infections, cardiac or pulmonary complications, and any major complications. For each complication, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Independent variables included patient age, sex, race, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, year of surgery, and Charlson comorbidity index score.

Results

Mortality was not increased in the morbidly obese group (0.14% vs 0.14%; p = 0.942). Patients who were morbidly obese were more likely to have progressive renal insufficiency (0.30% vs 0.10%; odds ratio [OR], 2.47; 95% CI, 1.27–4.29; p < 0.001), superficial infection (1.07% vs 0.55%; OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.39–2.51; p < 0.001), and sepsis (0.36% vs 0.23%; OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.04–2.53; p = 0.034) compared with patients who were not morbidly obese. Patients who were morbidly obese were less likely to require blood transfusion (8.68% vs 12.06%; OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.63–0.77; p < 0.001) compared with patients who were not morbidly obese. Morbid obesity was not associated with any of the other 21 perioperative complications recorded in the NSQIP database. With respect to the composite complication variables, patients who were morbidly obese had an increased risk of any infection (3.31% vs 2.41%; OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.16–1.64; p < 0.001) but not for cardiopulmonary or any major complication. The group with low serum albumin had higher mortality than the group with normal serum albumin (0.64% vs 0.15%; OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.58–6.35; p = 0.001). Patients in the low serum albumin group were more likely to have a superficial surgical site infection (1.27% vs 0.64%; OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09–2.75; p = 0.020); deep surgical site infection (0.38% vs 0.12%; OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.54–8.63; p = 0.003); organ space surgical site infection (0.45% vs 0.15%; OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.23–5.97; p = 0.013); pneumonia (1.21 vs 0.29%; OR, 3.55; 95% CI, 2.14–5.89; p < 0.001); require unplanned intubation (0.51% vs 0.17%, OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.07–4.69; p = 0.033); and remain on a ventilator more than 48 hours (0.38% vs 0.07%; OR, 4.03; 95% CI, 1.64–9.90; p = 0.002). They are more likely to have progressive renal insufficiency (0.45% vs 0.12%; OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.21–6.07; p = 0.015); acute renal failure (0.32% vs 0.06%; OR, 5.19; 95% CI, 1.96–13.73; p = 0.001); cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (0.19% vs 0.12%; OR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.50–9.28; p = 0.005); and septic shock (0.38% vs 0.08%; OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.74–11.09; p = 0.002). Patients in the low serum albumin group also were more likely to require blood transfusion (17.8% vs 12.4%; OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.35–1.81; p < 0.001). In addition, among the three composite complication variables, any infection (5.0% vs 2.4%; OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.53–2.61; p < 0.001) and any major complication (2.4% vs 1.3%; OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.00–1.97; p = 0.050) were more prevalent among the patients with low serum albumin. There was no difference for cardiopulmonary complications.

Conclusions

Morbid obesity is not independently associated with the majority of perioperative complications measured by the NSQIP and was associated only with increases in progressive renal insufficiency, superficial surgical site infection, and sepsis among the 21 perioperative variables measured. However, low serum albumin was associated with increased mortality and multiple additional major perioperative complications after TKA. Low serum albumin, more so than morbid obesity, is associated with major perioperative complications. This is an important finding, as low serum albumin may be more modifiable than morbid obesity in patients who are immobile or have advanced knee osteoarthritis.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^116vB5V9]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemic States (see Figure 1)

The different inflammatory states described in the previous section are all associated with low serum albumin levels. 91 Although uncomplicated undernutrition (not combined with inflammation) does not lead to or only very modestly leads to low serum albumin, in areas with endemic malnutrition, undernutrition is usually associated with infectious or noninfectious inflammation. Hypoalbuminemia is more severe in children with kwashiorkor (edema, fatty liver, skin lesions, discolored hair) than with marasmus (less edema, child more active and attentive). 95 The difference in phenotype has been attributed to differences in the microbiome. 96 Chronic parasitic disease or other chronic infections cause hypoalbuminemia and lead to growth failure. Adult malnutrition in areas with endemic malnutrition has similar characteristics. 97 In clinical practice, all acutely ill or (surgically) traumatized patients have low serum albumin levels. 66, 67, 68, 69, 98, 99, 100 In the Western world, the severity of the inflammatory effects of comorbidity, obesity, lifestyle, organ failure, and aging lead to a proportional decrease in serum albumin levels. 23, 76, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106

The combined presence of undernutrition and inflammation in malnutrition has led some authors to consider the condition as being a nutrition state caused by a combination of undernutrition and inflammatory activity. Consensus is, however, lacking between countries and nutrition societies about whether inflammation should be part of the definition of malnutrition and part of nutrition assessment. 2, 3, 107 The frequent and simultaneous presence of undernutrition and inflammation also explains why in some studies a modest correlation has been found between undernutrition and hypoalbuminemia, despite the presence of subgroups, in which undernutrition is associated with normal plasma albumin levels or where low serum albumin levels exist in chronic disease states despite adequate nutrition intake. These observations confound the value of serum albumin as an indicator of adequate nutrition intake or uptake in a sizeable subgroup of individuals despite a significant correlation in the population as a whole. 108 Regardless of how malnutrition is defined, if the objective of the clinician is to identify patients who will benefit from nutrition support, it is essential to consider both undernutrition and inflammation. Only then can the indication for nutrition support be determined and its likely effect be predicted. 109

### Effect of elevated body mass index on glycated albumin levels in healthy individuals [^116sPWRF]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity represents a growing global health issue, primarily driven by disrupted energy homeostasis. In comparison to individuals with normal weight, those affected by obesity face substantially increased risks of various negative health outcomes. This elevated risk is especially pronounced among diabetic patients, who tend to experience deteriorating glycemic control and worse prognosis as body mass index (BMI) increases. Given these risks, a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical and laboratory implications of obesity remains essential.

Glycated albumin (GA) serves as a reliable indicator of short-term glucose regulation and may provide superior sensitivity compared to glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), particularly in identifying postprandial hyperglycemia. Although GA offers advantages in clinical scenarios where the accuracy of HbA1c may be limited, GA levels can be influenced by inflammatory processes, which may restrict its clinical utility. Since chronic low-grade inflammation is commonly associated with obesity, this mechanism has been proposed as a potential explanation for why GA levels may be affected by changes in BMI. These findings raise concerns about the reliability of GA in individuals with diabetes and excess adiposity. Therefore, investigating the impact of BMI on GA levels in metabolically healthy individuals with similar characteristics may help clarify the factors that limit the broader clinical applicability of GA in diabetic populations.

In this study, we aimed to compare GA levels among healthy, non-diabetic individuals and to evaluate their association with BMI. To further explore the possible influence of inflammation on this relationship, we also included acute-phase reactants in the analysis.

### Reduced plasma albumin predicts type 2 diabetes and is associated with greater adipose tissue macrophage content and activation [^112QAZ4F]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Albumin is the most abundant soluble protein in plasma or serum, accounting for about 50% to 60% of total protein. It is synthesized nearly exclusively by the liver and about half is degraded by muscle, liver, and kidneys. Albumin is a versatile protein with a variety of biological roles such as maintaining plasma oncotic pressure, providing > 50% of total antioxidant in normal plasma, and serving as the primary carrier protein for non-esterified fatty acids. In addition, albumin binds and transports various other endogenous molecules (e.g. metal ions, heme, thyroxine, bilirubin). Although historically linked to malnutrition and protein intake, there is now considerable evidence that low circulating albumin is an indicator of an inflammatory process.

Although type 2 diabetes (T2D) was traditionally regarded as a metabolic disease with a defect in insulin action preceding or occurring concurrently with pancreatic beta-cell failure. it is now well-recognized that chronic inflammation is a pathogenic component of T2D and obesity, a strong risk factor for T2D. Diminished insulin action is characterized by chronic inflammation involving infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue. There is evidence for inflammation as a risk factor for development of T2D specifically in American Indians from a community in the southwestern United States, a group which has a high incidence of T2D and obesity. In this population, adipose tissue markers of macrophage activation were associated with insulin action, and elevated peripheral leukocyte count predicted worsening insulin action and the development of T2D. It is unclear whether circulating albumin is associated with either macrophage content or activation within adipose tissue.

### Reduced plasma albumin predicts type 2 diabetes and is associated with greater adipose tissue macrophage content and activation [^115TXoVH]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, complementary analyses delineated the role of plasma albumin in obesity and T2D. Among healthy adult participants, reduced albumin, independent of %fat, was found to be associated with several expression markers of adipose tissue inflammation, indicating that albumin may be reflecting an immunological milieu which may be contributing to risk of T2D. Furthermore, reduced albumin was associated with higher %fat and higher plasma glucose concentration. Moreover, the current study, involving a large sample in a well-defined population with detailed reference measurements of important risk factors for T2D (e.g. %fat, insulin action, and insulin secretion), also demonstrated that lower albumin predicts the development of T2D even when accounting for these confounders.

In cross-sectional studies, those with T2D have lower circulating albumin compared to those without T2D. The current study, demonstrating that lower albumin is associated with higher glucose concentrations and elevates risk of incident T2D, indicates a potential mechanism that is both influencing albumin abundance and contributing to the pathogenesis of T2D. Several possibilities exist for such a mechanism. First, diabetes may result in decreased hepatic albumin synthesis. Second, albumin could be reduced via mechanisms related to formation of glycated albumin. Glycated albumin has aberrant ability to bind various ligands and acts as a precursor to advanced glycation end-products, leading to oxidative stress and inflammation. Given the deleterious consequences of glycated albumin, it is not surprising that mechanisms to clear glycated albumin have evolved. In diabetic rats, renal clearance of albumin is enhanced by glycation. Moreover, there is evidence that glycated albumin (and other glycated proteins) elicits an immunological response that may further reduce albumin. Glycated proteins such as albumin may present new immunological epitopes and hence act as neo-antigens for autoantibody production. Autoantibodies against reactive-oxygen species-modified glycated albumin has been shown to be present in persons with type 1 and T2D. These autoantibodies with their antigen form circulating immune complexes which are predominantly cleared. Albumin has been recently shown to be elevated in these complexes isolated from humans with impaired glucose tolerance and T2D, and clearance of these complexes would further lower albumin levels. Glycated albumin was not measured in this study, so its role could not be evaluated. However, there is reason to suspect that relatively increased glycation is occurring among those with low albumin in our study. Higher plasma glucose concentrations and lower albumin were associated, and glycated albumin is an increasingly recognized marker of glycaemia. Another explanation for why higher albumin was protective for T2D may be due to the competition between albumin and other plasma protein for glycation. Due to albumin's abundance, higher albumin concentration has been shown to protect other proteins such as insulin from being glycated, which has been shown to have diminished biological activity as demonstrated by the HIEC procedure. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism behind the association between reduced albumin and increased risk for T2D.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^113jyvpw]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia and Outcome

Hypoalbuminemia caused by inflammatory activity related to chronic disease or lifestyle (smoking, alcoholism, obesity) is associated with reduced quality of life due to diminished muscle mass and function and cognitive and immune function and, consequently, to diminished life expectancy. 113, 114, 115, 116 A decrease in serum albumin levels may result from the inflammatory effects of comorbidity, but very likely also occurs as a result of the aging process itself, which can be considered to be a slow but inevitable inflammatory process caused by the wear and tear of daily life. Different types of chronic comorbidities have a final common pathway of metabolic syndrome, including fatty liver, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis. 117 The same pathway has also been shown to occur in paraodontitis, 118 psoriasis, 119 celiac disease, 120 obesity, 121, 122 COPD, 123, 124 and rheumatoid arthritis. 125 In all these conditions, hypoalbuminemia develops, and the severity parallels the severity of the inflammatory insult and mortality risk. 25

### Morbid obesity in a young woman affected by advanced chronic kidney disease: an exceptional case report. does a high dose of essential amino acids play a key role in therapeutic success? [^111xQtfv]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old woman, obese (219 kg), diabetic, hypertensive, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, with low plasma albumin level (2.9 g dL −1) and marked proteinuria (22 g per day) was studied. Given the advanced-stage CKD with nephrotic proteinuria, we supplemented low-protein diet with high doses of a tailored essential amino acid mixture (AAs: 44 g per day) to improve weight reduction in the patient. After 20 months of conservative therapy, the patient lost 43 kg; despite two episodes of infection, albumin plasma levels increased up to 3.7 g per day. After a further 20 months of dialysis, the patient maintained a diet of 1800 kcal supplemented with 32 g of AAs and lost 47 kg, whereas both albumin (3.89 ± 0.12 g dL −1) and C reactive protein returned to normal. During the follow-up period, anemia improved, erythropoietin was thus discontinued and insulin requirement decreased to 105 IU. This therapeutic option may be beneficial in advanced CKD patients with obesity and diabetes resulting from malnutrition.

### Reduced plasma albumin predicts type 2 diabetes and is associated with greater adipose tissue macrophage content and activation [^115RyPzP]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

A strength of this study is that the relationships between albumin and adipose tissue markers of inflammation were examined. This finding points to a potential inflammatory source within the body for lower albumin concentrations. Although inflammation within other tissues/organs was not evaluated in this study, other known co-morbidities associated with lower albumin such as infectious or rheumatologic conditions are unlikely given that only healthy individuals were studied. The findings, that reduced albumin is associated with adipose tissue inflammation and predicts T2D, is consistent with chronic low-grade inflammation due to obesity in the development of T2D.

The current study found that reduced albumin predicts incident T2D and was consistent with other prospective studies in other populations. However, these results differ from other studies that show no association, or association between lower albumin and lower risk of T2D. Differences with prior studies could explain the different results. First, unlike these prior studies, the current study measured adiposity, and insulin action and secretion using reference measures and adjusted for these confounders in the models. Second, the current study was performed in an American Indian population with high rates of obesity and T2D. Though the pathophysiology of the development of diabetes in this American Indian population mirrors those of other populations, it is possible that population differences explain the conflicting results.

Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, since only baseline albumin and risk factors were evaluated, it is possible that accounting for repeated measurements over time could alter the association with risk of T2D. Second, expression of adipose tissue inflammatory genes was available only on a limited number of individuals so the ability of these markers to predict T2D could not be evaluated and compared with albumin. Third, this was an association study, so it cannot be determined whether efforts to maintain the abundance of albumin would be effective in preventing T2D.

### Effect of elevated body mass index on glycated albumin levels in healthy individuals [^1149sosR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our findings indicate a significant decrease in GA levels with increasing BMI in healthy individuals. Additionally, higher BMI was associated with elevated levels of CRP and ESR, suggesting the presence of a low-grade inflammatory response even in the absence of overt clinical symptoms. This chronic inflammatory state may contribute to the observed reduction in GA levels, as albumin is a negative acute-phase reactant. Regression analysis further confirmed that BMI was independently associated with GA levels. These results underscore the importance of considering BMI as a confounding factor when interpreting GA levels, particularly in individuals with type 2 diabetes, where obesity is highly prevalent. Therefore, the utility of GA as a glycemic marker may be limited in patients with increased adiposity and should be interpreted with caution in this context.

GA has been proposed as a more effective marker of short-term glycemic control than HbA1c, and is also recognized as a valuable tool for both the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes. Prior research involving individuals with type 2 diabetes has shown that GA concentrations tend to be reduced in obese patients relative to those without obesity. In our study, an inverse association between GA levels and BMI was identified, independent of diabetes presence or sex. Similarly, He et al. reported results consistent with our findings. On the other hand, Nishimura et al. observed lower GA levels in obese children. However, a retrospective analysis of clinical trial data by Powers Carson et al. did not detect a significant negative correlation between GA and BMI across a wide BMI range, although weak negative correlations were observed between BMI and glycated serum proteins, albumin, and the GA/HbA1c ratio. The authors suggested that inflammation, insulin-mediated alterations in protein synthesis, or BMI-related changes in renal clearance could partly account for these findings. To further clarify the independent contribution of BMI to GA levels in our cohort, we performed multivariate regression analysis including age, sex, CRP, ESR, and HbA1c as covariates. This analysis confirmed that BMI was independently associated with GA, whereas the other variables were not significant predictors, reinforcing the robustness of our findings. Observations from diverse populations generally support our findings and highlight the importance of interpreting GA levels with caution in individuals with elevated BMI. Moreover, another study proposed that differences in the rate of GA synthesis may also contribute to the lower GA levels observed in individuals with elevated BMI. Taken together, these data suggest that increased adiposity may influence GA concentrations, which should be taken into account when using GA as a glycemic marker in clinical practice.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that higher BMI is associated with lower GA levels. This association should be taken into account when interpreting GA as a glycemic marker, particularly in individuals with diabetes and elevated BMI.

### Effect of bariatric surgery on albuminuria in non-diabetic non-hypertensive patients with severe obesity: a short-term outcome [^112cqQYS]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding the primary outcome of the current study, the 24-h urinary albumin levels were significantly reduced 6 months postoperatively compared to the preoperative levels, with observed albuminuria remission in 83% of the patients.

The previous studies assessing the bariatric surgery effect on patients with albuminuria included patients with DM, hypertension, or even both. Most of these studies reported a reduction in urinary albumin levels (6–24 months postoperatively) compared to the baseline levels.

According to the previous studies, the albuminuria reduction was explained by improving glucose metabolism, blood pressure, and systemic inflammation. Improving systemic inflammation was specified to be the underlying cause in other studies. This was mirrored by decreased levels of renal cytokines and increased levels of the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin. Given our exclusion of cases having abnormal blood pressure and blood glucose levels, systemic inflammation improving or relieving the pressure induced by the excess abdominal adipose tissue may be the cause of albuminuria reduction in our study. However, it is still uncertain whether albuminuria reduction is attributed to a reduction in weight or the improvement in systemic inflammation elicited by a reduction in weight.

Regarding the secondary outcome in this study, the study groups differed significantly only in the weight loss amount at T2. This was further affirmed by the regression analysis, which revealed that the postoperative BMI and weight loss were predictors for albuminuria remission.

Within the same context, Amor et al. found that the reduction in weight appeared to be an independent contributing factor to the normalization of albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. They reported that the BMI changes from baseline values were an independent predicting factor for normal ACR at 12 months. However, in contrast to our findings, Park et al. found that hs-CRP was the independent risk factor predicting ACR, while body weight and BMI were not.

Another aspect of the inverse association between albumin and obesity has been recently explored. Despite being historically considered a protein malnutrition marker, a recent focus on albumin as an inflammatory marker has been adopted. The association between low albumin levels and a subclinical inflammatory state was argued to be explaining the link between albumin and obesity. Moreover, it was found that albumin binds ghrelin, impacting its orexigenic effects and contributing to appetite regulation. It seems like a vicious circle in which weight reduction improves the albuminuria state, hence, improves the serum albumin levels, which, in turn, enhances the weight reduction.

The data above emphasize the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on the overall health status, rather than just a weight-decreasing procedure.

### Is serum albumin a pivotal biomarker in anticipating acute pancreatitis outcomes? [^115ySBWt]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammation of the pancreas with a worldwide incidence ranging from 30 to 40 cases per 100,000 population per year. It's usually caused by bile stones or excessive alcohol consumption. Most patients experience mild symptoms, which can be managed with moderate fluid resuscitation, pain and nausea management, and early oral feeding. However, some cases may require hospitalization and intensive care due to the development of local or systemic complications, including organ failure. Severe AP is redefined as AP with persistent organ failure lasting more than 48 h, with a mortality rate ranging from 20 to 50%, as per the 2012 revised Atlanta classification for AP. Several factors have been associated with severity in AP, notably smoking, dyslipidemia, obesity, pancreatic necrosis, and pancreatic collections.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the body and serves a variety of essential functions. These include the regulation of oncotic pressure, as well as the binding and transportation of both endogenous and exogenous substances. Additionally, albumin plays a crucial role in antioxidant functions.

Hypoalbuminemia is frequently observed in various clinical conditions, such as sepsis, kidney failure, nephrotic syndrome, cancer, decompensated liver cirrhosis, surgical procedures. This phenomenon can also manifest in acute pancreatitis, particularly in cases of severe AP.

Some studies have shown that low serum albumin levels in AP are significantly related to poor prognosis, and could be an important tool for predicting adverse outcomes, especially in anticipating persistent organ failure and mortality.

Our study aimed to assess the significance of serum albumin levels within 24 h of patient admission in correlation with the incidence of outcomes and mortality in AP.

### Obesity as a potential predictor of disease severity in young COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study [^1166wqy4]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Although all patients in the current study had comparable albumin levels on admission, we observed a rapid decline in albumin concentration in severely and critically ill patients after admission. Because the albumin level was not tested a second time in moderate cases during hospitalization, we cannot be sure that the moderate patients did not also experience a decline in albumin concentration. A study evaluating patients with COVID‐19 after 2 weeks of hospitalization found that patients with aggravated conditions had significantly reduced albumin levels, whereas those with stable or improved conditions had an average albumin level of 41.27 g/L, suggesting that moderate cases are less likely to experience a significant decrease in albumin. Additional studies have suggested that hypoalbuminemia on admission can help predict the progression of COVID‐19 cases to severe or critical condtiion. Chronic liver disease due to synthesis disorders and chronic kidney disease due to glomerular leakage are common causes of hypoalbuminemia. Even without liver and kidney dysfunction, obesity itself will be accompanied by hypoalbuminemia. However, abnormal albumin function is more commonly reported in fatty liver disease. This study suggests that young patients with proteinuria at admission are more than 20 times more likely to develop severe and critical illness. A renal histopathological analysis of deceased patients with COVID‐19 showed that SARS‐CoV‐2 can directly infect and damage proximal tubular epithelial cells and podocytes. Podocyte damage is usually associated with the formation of proteinuria. Hypoproteinemia may be very obvious in some critically ill patients. We observed that in one critically ill patient who continued to be treated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation at the time of this reporting, normal albumin levels could only be maintained by continuous large infusions of albumin. Our understanding of the functions of albumin continues to increase. Albumin can not only effectively maintain plasma osmotic pressure but also has functions in transport, antithrombosis, immune regulation, and endothelial stability. In patients with severe and critical COVID‐19 illness, low albumin levels may also be accompanied by impaired organ function. In this study, it was considered that the rapid onset of hypoalbuminemia may be related to the attack of the virus on the organs because almost all young patients with COVID‐19 had normal serum albumin levels at admission. Preexisting damage to liver and kidney function may cause further damage to organ functions under the attack of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

### Associations of cardiovascular biomarkers and plasma albumin with exceptional survival to the highest ages [^113sLEiv]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Inflammation is one of the prominent hallmarks of agingand also of cardiovascular pathology; however, its root causes and pathophysiological roles are diverse in older adults. Our previous study demonstrated that inflammation correlated with physical capability and cognitive function in centenarians and semi-supercentenarians, supporting multiple health effects of inflammation at an advanced age. Given a dominance of cardiovascular mortality, proinflammatory cytokines may be less prognostic than circulating NT-proBNP at the highest ages. Angptl2 is an inflammatory mediator specifically associated with an unfavorable metabolic milieu, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia, hence promoting insulin resistance and endothelial inflammation, which are associated with atherosclerosis and heart failure. In contrast to its predictability for a range of cardiometabolic outcomes among the general population, circulating Angptl2 was associated neither with advancing age nor increased mortality in our oldest old population. As an association between centenarian age and insulin sensitivity has been reported, and centenarian have a very low prevalence of diabetes and obesity, centenarians may exhibit resistance against Angptl2-mediated proinflammatory processes.

Notably, plasma albumin levels were most consistently associated with all-cause mortality in our oldest old cohort. In contrast to age-related increase in prognostic relevance of NT-proBNP, the strength of associations between low albumin and high mortality is markedly stable across age groups. Albumin is an established biomarker of nutritional status, but it also related to inflammation, hepatic synthesis capacity, and increased mortality from cancers, respiratory diseases, and heart failure, suggesting a multifaceted nature of this biomarker. In this study, plasma albumin levels were significantly correlated with cholinesterase levels, inflammation, and even NT-proBNP levels (age- and sex-adjusted partial correlation coefficients: r = 0.409, P < 0.001; r = −0.402, P < 0.001; r = −0.361, P < 0.001; and r = −0.145, P < 0.001 for cholinesterase, CRP, interleukin-6, and NT-proBNP, respectively, Supplementary Table 3). Collectively, low albumin levels in the oldest old may represent common debilitating processes across a spectrum of ages and pathophysiologies. Despite overall prognostic utility, plasma albumin is less informative with regard to the etiology of mortality.

### Serum albumin and prealbumin in calorically restricted, nondiseased individuals: a systematic review [^112VzfTb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Undernutrition is often suspected in patients when serum albumin or prealbumin levels are low. We asked whether these measures are indeed low in undernourished people if no inflammatory illness is present.

Methods

We did a systematic review to identify otherwise healthy subjects who were severely nutrient-deprived due to poor access to food or unwillingness to eat. We excluded children and pregnant women. We tabulated available measures of nutrient intake, anthropometry, serum albumin and prealbumin, and, when available, changes in these measures during nutritional intervention.

Results

In otherwise healthy subjects, serum albumin and prealbumin levels remained normal despite marked nutrient deprivation until the extremes of starvation, that is, body mass index < 12 or more than 6 weeks of starvation.

Conclusions

In these otherwise healthy subjects, serum albumin and prealbumin levels are not "markers of nutritional status". The "markers" failed to identify subjects with severe protein-calorie malnutrition until extreme starvation. That is, they failed to identify healthy individuals who would benefit from nutrition support, becoming abnormal only when starvation was already obvious. In contrast, serum albumin and prealbumin levels are known to fall promptly with injury or illness regardless of nutrient intake. They are negative acute-phase reactants. When these measures are low in sick patients, this cannot be assumed to reflect nutritional deprivation. Decisions about nutrition support should be based on evidence of meaningful benefit from this treatment rather than on assessment of "nutritional markers".

### Association between the C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte index and metabolic syndrome: evidence from the 2003–2010 national health and nutrition examination survey [^112BKXCP]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

The serum albumin concentration is linked to the severity of malnutrition and plays a crucial role as an antioxidant by scavenging hydroxyl radicals and reducing reactive oxygen species production. Albumin also regulates inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and activating the nuclear factor-κB pathway, which can impact cellular signaling pathways and MetS development. Low albumin is associated with heightened inflammation. The interaction of inflammatory markers, such as the CRP/albumin ratio, has been shown to play a significant role in disease progression and outcomes, as demonstrated in studies on cardiovascular conditions. Furthermore, there are negative correlations between the albumin concentration and obesity, lipid metabolism abnormalities, and insulin sensitivity. A previous study suggested that increasing the serum albumin concentration over time may prevent MetS development. However, excessive dietary protein intake may exacerbate hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and lipid abnormalities, potentially contributing to MetS. Other studies have suggested that there is a positive correlation between the increase in baseline serum albumin and the prevalence of MetS. In the present study, we observed a lower albumin concentration in patients with MetS than in those without MetS. This finding supports the results of a previous study on blood changes in patients with MetS. For example, lower serum albumin is linked to coronary heart disease risk. Xu et al. showed that microalbuminuria and high 24-hour urinary albumin excretion are risk factors for MetS, indicating lower albumin levels in these patients.

This study takes full advantage of the independent predictive value of these three indicators, as well as their interactions. The findings suggest that the combination of these three common indices within the CALLY index may have greater potential to investigate the association between the baseline CALLY index and MetS risk. The CALLY index may influence the occurrence and progression of MetS through various pathways. First, serving as a comprehensive indicator of metabolic health, the CALLY index likely reflects an individual's nutritional status and lifestyle habits. These factors are closely associated with the pathophysiological mechanisms of MetS. For instance, a diet high in fat, sugar, and salt may lead to weight gain, insulin resistance, and elevated BP, thereby promoting MetS development. Second, the CALLY index may be linked to metabolic activity, influencing energy and lipid metabolism within the body. Inappropriate energy metabolism and lipid storage patterns can result in fat accumulation, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysregulation, consequently increasing MetS risk. Additionally, the CALLY index may reflect the level of inflammation and immune function within the body. Inflammation and immune dysfunction are crucial components in the pathogenesis of MetS, leading to metabolic disturbances and tissue damage, thereby facilitating MetS progression.

### Association between obesity measures and albuminuria: a population-based study [^116uqVRp]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

The effects of obesity on the micro vascular diseases have drawn much attention. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between obesity measures and albuminuria in Chinese population.

Methods

We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study in 8600 subjects aged 40 years or older from a community in Guangzhou. Urinary albumin excretion and creatinine were measured and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) was calculated as urinary albumin divided by creatinine. Low-grade albuminuria was classified as the highest quartile of ACR in participants without increased urinary albumin excretion. Increased urinary albumin excretion was defined according to the ACR ranges greater or equal than 30 mg/g.

Results

Pearson's correlation analysis and multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and body fat content were significantly correlated with ACR (all P < 0.01). Prevalence of low-grade albuminuria and increased urinary albumin excretion gradually increased across the BMI, waist circumference and body fat content quartiles (all P for trend < 0.0001). Compared with participants in quartile 1 of BMI, waist circumference and body fat content, participants in quartile 4 had increased prevalence of low-grade albuminuria and increased urinary albumin excretion in logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, sex, physical activity, fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and HbA1c (all P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Obesity measures are associated with urinary albumin excretion in middle-aged and elderly Chinese.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^116qY5AU]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypoalbuminemia is common in clinical practice, and serum albumin levels are often routinely measured in severely ill or malnourished patients. Although hypoalbuminemia may develop within hours in acute disease or after trauma and resuscitation in previously well‐nourished individuals and is also present in chronic inflammatory diseases despite adequate nutrition intake, it is often wrongly considered to be an indicator of inadequate nutrition intake that can be relieved by nutrition support alone. There is actually a poor correlation between the level of nutrition intake and the serum albumin level. For example, anorexia nervosa patients have normal or only slightly decreased serum albumin levels despite very low nutrition intake, unless infected or traumatized. Many anorexia nervosa patients have a body mass index < 18 kg/m 2 and have low muscle mass and strength, but they are otherwise functioning relatively well. 1 Further, patients with chronic diseases and hypoalbuminemia lose fat‐free mass, considered to be an essential indicator of the undernourished state, despite adequate food intake. 2, 3 Rather than reflecting undernutrition per se, hypoalbuminemia is more a reflection of the extent of physiologic stress resulting from disease or trauma‐related inflammation. These considerations do not exclude the likelihood that hypoalbuminemia often coincides with a negative nutrient balance for which nutrition support is indicated.

The objectives of this semicomprehensive review are to define the pathophysiology of hypoalbuminemia associated with increases in capillary permeability and altered kinetics of serum albumin in inflammatory states, including states of physiologic or pathologic growth. In addition, the potentially beneficial role of these changes will be highlighted as well as the significance of increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels as indicators of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. Finally, the significance of hypoalbuminemia as a risk indicator of negative outcome after medical treatment or of diminished longevity will be discussed.

In view of the many areas of pathophysiology addressed, we will limit the number of references to subjects that are not commonly accepted knowledge. In this area, very few randomized trials and meta‐analyses have been performed. Much of the material in this paper regards the pathophysiology of inflammation at the whole‐body level and recent, more in‐depth papers on cell biology and the beneficial intracellular and extracellular role of albumin.

### A novel obesity-prevention dietary score is associated with favorable metabolic status and lower blood pressure in obesity [^113btjqe]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major worldwide health problem and is associated with numerous diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and some types of cancers. In the current cross-sectional study, we aimed to evaluate the association between a novel dietary obesity prevention score (DOPS) with metabolic parameters including serum lipid profile, glycemic markers, electrolyte status and blood pressure in individuals with obesity.

Methods

Three hundred and four individuals with obesity aged 18–65 years old were recruited through convenient sampling; anthropometric and dietary assessments were performed and blood pressure was measured. Biochemical parameters including serum lipids, glycemic markers, some of liver function tests and electrolyte status were measured by standard laboratory methods.

Results

Lower adiposity including lower body mass index (BMI) and fat mass and low systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed at higher tertiles of versus lower tertiles of DOPS (P < 0.05). Also, lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and higher serum albumin concentrations were observed at higher tertiles of DOPS. There was no significant difference between other parameters across DOPS tertiles.

Conclusion

In our study, higher adherence to dietary obesity preventive score reduced obesity risk, blood pressure and serum LDL in individuals with obesity. Future longitudinal and interventional studies are needed to establish causal relationships.

Clinical trial number

Not applicable.

### Association between preoperative serum albumin levels with risk of death and postoperative complications after bariatric surgery: a retrospective cohort study [^116hsBnc]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoalbuminemia is common among individuals with obesity who qualify for bariatric surgery, but its relevance to clinical outcomes after bariatric surgery remains to be established.

Objectives

To examine the association of preoperative serum albumin with 30-day postoperative outcomes.

Setting

Data from the 2015–2019 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Files were used.

Methods

Preoperative serum albumin level was categorized as hypoalbuminemia (< 3.5 g/dL), and normoalbuminemia (3.5–5.5 g/dL) among patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the association of preoperative hypoalbuminemia with 30-day postoperative mortality and other co-morbid outcomes.

Results

Among 633,011 adult patients, 85.1% were women and the mean (standard deviation) age was 44.8 (12.0) years. The prevalence of hypoalbuminemia was 6.13% (n = 38,792). After adjustment for procedure type and demographic, lifestyle, and co-morbidity covariates, the odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for mortality was 1.42 (1.10, 1.82) for hypoalbuminemia. For all other outcomes, the ORs (95% CIs) for hypoalbuminemia ranged from 1.03 (.67–1.60) for cardiac arrest requiring CPR to 2.32 (1.66–3.25) for failure to be discharged by day 30. The ORs for several associations were higher for severe hypoalbuminemia than marginal hypoalbuminemia.

Conclusion

Preoperative hypoalbuminemia was associated with several negative 30-day postoperative bariatric surgery outcomes and tended to be worse for severe hypoalbuminemia compared with marginal hypoalbuminemia. These findings suggest that serum albumin may be a useful biomarker to screen for negative bariatric surgery outcomes.

### Fetal glycated albumin levels in offspring of obese women [^115xaLUm]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the association between maternal obesity and fetal glycated albumin (GA) levels among pregnant women.

Methods

A comparative, cross-sectional study of 59 consenting, normoglycemic, pregnant women, who met the criteria for maternal obesity, attending the antenatal clinic of the University College Hospital, Nigeria, from June 2019 to December 2019. They were recruited at 36weeks of gestation, followed up until delivery, and compared with 58 nonobese, normoglycemic pregnant controls. At delivery, blood samples were taken from the mothers and from the umbilical cords of their newborns for serum GA assay. Maternal and newborn variables were recorded, and comparisons were made using χ 2 tests, independent t tests, odds ratios, analysis of variance, and Pearson correlates. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results

The odds of elevated newborn GA were 3.21 times higher in obese women compared with nonobese women (P = 0.005) and 5-min APGAR scores were higher in the newborns of nonobese women (P = 0.039). There was a significant correlation between maternal and neonatal GA for all participants (r = 0.346, P = 0.000).

Conclusion

These findings suggest that maternal obesity is associated with elevated fetal GA and low APGAR scores at 5 min in normoglycemic women.

### Serum albumin, inflammation, and nutrition in end-stage renal disease: C-reactive protein is needed for optimal assessment [^111Brkgv]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Low serum albumin (S-Alb) is a frequent feature of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that independently predicts mortality. Serum albumin has mainly been considered a biomarker of visceral protein and immunocompetence status, fundamental to nutritional assessment. However, low S-albumin level is associated with persistent systemic inflammation and many bodies of evidence show that S-Alb has a limited role as a marker of nutritional status. We reported that a low S-Alb concentration was an independent risk factor for poor outcome in ESRD only in the presence of systemic inflammation. Moreover, the relationships between inflammatory biomarkers and outcome are confounded also by alterations in body composition (such as obese sarcopenia) and oxidative stress. Taken together, S-Alb alone should not be used as a proxy of the nutritional status in a dialysis patient. Its association with dietary intake is poor and low S-Alb values are most often non-nutritional in origin. When analyzing S-Alb to predict mortality risk in ESRD, it should always be combined with measurement of hsCRP.

### Surgical risk assessment and prevention in elderly spinal deformity patients [^115SvQp4]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

The assessment of protein status via laboratory data is used as a surrogate method to evaluate nutrition. Serum albumin of 3.5 g/dL or less (ie, hypoalbuminemia) is an independent risk factor for mortality, complications, wound infection, and thromboembolic disease in adults who had spinal fusion. Low preoperative albumin level is also a risk factor for patients after elective spine surgery for degeneration and deformity. Prealbumin can also be used with a threshold value of 11 mg/dL. Patients with low (< 11 mg/dL) perioperative prealbumin levels who underwent long fusion constructs (≥ 7 segments) were more likely to develop an infectious complication.

Malnutrition is often the focus of surgical risk assessment, but obesity is a consideration as well. In one study, morbidly obese patients who undergo elective spine surgery have increased odds of complications, readmission, and reoperation. However, in patients with degenerative scoliosis who required multiple levels of fusion, obesity did not increase postoperative complications. A more recent evaluation of data from the National Neurosurgery Quality and Outcomes Database also did not find significant outcome differences between obese and nonobese patient undergoing lumbar surgery. These contrasting results may be secondary to body mass distribution. Increased subcutaneous fat thickness was a better indicator of surgical site infection risk than BMI. When thoracolumbar scoliosis surgery was done with a combined anterior/posterior approach, outcomes were worse in obese patients likely related to the technical difficulty in this cohort. This indicates that body habitus should be considered when choosing surgical approach. How obesity affects outcomes in elderly patients who require spinal deformity surgery is unknown at this time.

### The malnourished patient with obesity: a unique paradox in bariatric surgery [^115EUZE4]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoalbuminemia is a known risk factor for poor outcomes following surgery. Obesity can be associated with modest to severe malnutrition. We evaluated the impact of hypoalbuminemia on surgical outcomes in patients with obesity undergoing elective bariatric surgical procedures.

Materials and Methods

The 2015 metabolic and bariatric surgery accreditation and quality improvement program database was queried. Patients ≥ 18 y with body mass index ≥ 35 undergoing bariatric surgery were included. Revision procedures were excluded. Patients were classified by albumin level (albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL [normal], 3.49–3.0 g/dL [mild], 2.99–2.5 g/dL [moderate], and < 2.5 g/dL [severe]). Independent logistic regression models were developed to estimate the adjusted odds of (1) death or serious morbidity (DSM); (2) mild to moderate complications; (3) severe complications; and (4) 30-d readmissions by albumin level. In addition, effect modification by > 10% weight loss was examined.

Results

A total of 106,577 patients were included in the study. Over 6% of patients had hypoalbuminemia. Fifty-five percent of complications were severe as categorized by the Clavien-Dindo classification. Patients with mild hypoalbuminemia had 20% increased odds of DSM (95% confidence interval: 1.1–1.4). There was increasing likelihood of DSM with severe hypoalbuminemia. Patients with mild hypoalbuminemia had 20% increased odds of 30-d readmission (confidence interval: 1.1–1.3). A > 10% weight loss modified the effect of moderate to severe hypoalbuminemia on DSM.

Conclusions

More than 6% of patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery are malnourished. Hypoalbuminemia is an important and modifiable risk factor for postoperative adverse outcomes following bariatric surgery. Preoperative weight loss > 10% combined with moderate to severe hypoalbuminemia is synergistic for high rates of DSM and should be addressed before proceeding with bariatric surgery.

### The systemic inflammation response index as risks factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among individuals with respiratory sarcopenia [^115jr7Mh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

SIRI, as an integrated marker of inflammation and immune dysregulation, reflects the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways by combining neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts. Elevated SIRI levels indicate heightened systemic inflammation and immune imbalance, which may contribute to muscle atrophy and functional decline central to respiratory sarcopenia. The low-grade systemic inflammation observed in patients with respiratory sarcopenia is likely multifactorial, with aging, comorbidities, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity as key contributors. Chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension, are prevalent in this population and are known to drive inflammatory processes. Additionally, obesity, particularly visceral adiposity, promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Smoking, a significant risk factor for both systemic inflammation and respiratory dysfunction, exacerbates inflammatory pathways through oxidative stress and immune activation. Furthermore, physical inactivity, which is common in individuals with sarcopenia, impairs muscle metabolism and contributes to the accumulation of inflammatory mediators. Together, these factors may create a pro-inflammatory milieu, compounding the risk of adverse outcomes in respiratory sarcopenia.

Our mediation analysis further suggested that serum albumin, a marker of nutritional status, partly mediated the relationship between SIRI and all-cause mortality, underscoring an interplay between systemic inflammation, nutritional depletion, and mortality risk in respiratory sarcopenia. While aging alone does not fully account for hypoalbuminemia, elevated IL-6 and TNF-α reduce albumin synthesis and accelerate its degradation, leading to lower serum albumin levels often observed in frail or sarcopenic patients. Low albumin levels, which are independently associated with increased frailty and sarcopenia risk, may thus compound the adverse effects of chronic inflammation on muscle integrity. These findings suggest that, for patients with respiratory sarcopenia and elevated SIRI, nutritional interventions targeting inflammation and supporting protein balance could be critical for preserving muscle mass and function, potentially mitigating the progression to disability.

### Hypoalbuminemia is disproportionately associated with adverse outcomes in obese elective surgical patients [^111wb8oy]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Protein deficiency (PD) is a known risk factor for surgical complications; however, the risks of PD by weight class have not been well described. It was hypothesized that the combination of obesity and PD is associated with increased surgical complications compared with normal weight and normoalbuminemic patients.

Methods

A total of 85,833 general surgery patients undergoing elective operations within the 2011 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were analyzed. Patients with conditions that could potentially confound serum albumin (SA) were excluded. Patients were stratified by normal (> 3.0 g/dL) versus low (< 3.0 g/dL) SA. The relative impact of SA and body mass index (BMI) (as individual and as combined variables) on surgical morbidity and mortality were assessed. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for morbidity and mortality.

Results

Overall, 2,088 (2.43%) patients had low preoperative SA. 587 (28.1%) patients with low preoperative SA were obese (BMI > 30), versus 39,299 (46.9%) with normal preoperative SA. Importantly, the interaction of hypoalbuminemia and BMI was independently associated with all complications among hypoalbuminemic patients with BMI > 40, and mortality for patients with BMI > 30 after controlling for appropriate demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, surgical wound classification, operation type, and complexity (c-statistic: .803 and .874 respectively).

Conclusion

PD and obesity appear to synergistically increase the risk of surgical complications. Paradoxically, malnutrition may be less easily recognized in obese individuals and surgeons may need to more carefully evaluate this population before surgery. Future studies should investigate therapy to correct PD specifically among obese patients before surgery.

### Effect of elevated body mass index on glycated albumin levels in healthy individuals [^111wcDBh]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Another notable finding of our study was the negative correlation between GA levels and acute-phase reactants, including CRP and ESR. Both CRP and ESR were positively associated with higher BMI, supporting the presence of a low-grade inflammatory state in individuals with increased adiposity. This inflammation may contribute to reduced GA levels through catabolic effects on albumin metabolism and decreased hepatic albumin synthesis, potentially mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, as previously suggested in the literature. Consistent with our observations, Koga et al. reported that obesity and obesity-related chronic inflammation were associated with decreased GA levels in non-diabetic individuals. Moreover, recent data indicate that inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, may play a role in modulating the relationship between GA and BMI, further supporting the contribution of inflammation to GA variations in individuals with elevated BMI. Another hypothesis proposes that increased BMI may lead to glomerular hypertrophy over time by elevating glomerular filtration rate, which could contribute to obesity-related glomerulopathy. However, in the present study, no significant differences in UACR were observed across BMI categories. This finding may be explained by the relatively small sample size and the possibly insufficient duration of exposure to elevated BMI required for the development of obesity-related glomerulopathy.

### Obesity as a potential predictor of disease severity in young COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study [^113WERRr]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present study investigated predictive factors for severe COVID‐19 among young patients, which resulted in several major findings: (1) Obesity is an important predictor of severe COVID‐19 among young patients. The main mechanism is related to the ectopic deposition of fat in organs and damage to organ function. The main participating organs are the liver and kidneys. (2) Young patients with severe/critical COVID‐19 illness often have no underlying disease before admission, and vital signs are often stable at the time of admission. However, they can experience rapid changes after admission. An important feature is the rapid decline in albumin level. During the course of the disease, the decrease in albumin is accompanied by an increase in D‐dimer, which is an indicator of hypercoagulation. DIC is possible in critically ill patients. (3) In the management of young adult patients with COVID‐19, particularly those who obviously have obesity and especially those with fatty liver hepatitis and urine protein positive, albumin and D‐dimer should be routinely monitored after admission. Changes in D‐dimer provide an early warning for rapid decline in condition, and relevant interventions can help to improve patient outcomes.

### Obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease: a joint expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the National Lipid Association 2024 [^114Rgj74]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Plasma transport of fatty acids and triglycerides — most circulating non-esterified fatty acids are transported in the bloodstream bound to albumin, while triglycerides circulate in amphiphilic lipoproteins. After a fat-load meal, about 80% of the rise in triglyceride levels is due to intestinally derived apoB-48-containing chylomicrons, whereas about 80% of the rise in lipoprotein particle concentration is due to apoB-100-containing VLDL particles.

### Machine learning approach on plasma proteomics identifies signatures associated with obesity in the KORA FF4 cohort [^1177pTmw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

MR analyses supported that BMI could lead to AFM, CRP and CFH alterations in relative protein levels. In the opposite direction, no protein can lead to BMI changes. Afamin (AFM) is the fourth member of the human albumin gene family, encompassing metabolic syndrome and associated diseases such as obesity, T2D, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Transgenic mice with AFM overexpression exhibited gained body weight, lipid and glucose levels, and meta‐analysis of the population‐based Bruneck (n = 826), Salzburg Atherosclerosis Prevention Program in Subjects at High Individual Risk (n = 1499) and KORA F4 studies (n = 3060) indicated high serum AFM levels were positively related with metabolic syndrome components, including obesity and BMI. Obesity is marked by persistent low‐grade inflammation. CRP, a key indicator of systemic inflammation, has consistently emerged as the primary factor linked to overweight and obesity in human epidemiological studies. Statistical analyses suggest that elevated CRP levels are a result of obesity rather than a cause. Our study results further corroborate this perspective. Human complement factor H (CFH) protects cells from unintended complement system damage and is linked to metabolic disruptions in obesity. Higher CFH levels are associated with increased BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides and inflammation, indicating its potential role in insulin resistance and metabolic issues in obesity.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^113HqmsY]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia represents a risk factor for medical treatment. It has long been known that patients in intensive care suffering from shock, infection, or trauma react inadequately to a renewed challenge like surgery. This has also been called the phenomenon of the second hit. 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131 Despite not always appreciating the precise cause of the connection with inflammation, many surgeons know that a low serum albumin level is a bad omen for outcome after surgery. 100, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138 The problem is apparently due to the preexistent inflammatory state, compromising a further adequate inflammatory response after surgery. To improve outcome, treatment should be directed primarily to decrease inflammation by eliminating the inflammatory cause. This is especially relevant when dealing with infection before embarking on a surgical approach. If this is impossible, eg, in the presence of generalized peritonitis or abscesses, acute surgical intervention is required. However, the surgical approach should be adapted, avoiding extensive oncologic surgery or the construction of hazardous intestinal anastomoses, but instead only trying to achieve "damage control". 100, 128, 139 This may include drainage of abscesses or removal of infected, damaged, or ischemic tissues. When this approach is successful, nutrition support becomes effective, promoting fat‐free mass (muscle) and adequate healing after eventual reoperation, for instance, to restore gastrointestinal continuity and to close the abdominal wall. 100, 139 It should be noted that with successful treatment of the cause of the inflammatory response, patients will lose weight due to reduction of edema and to fluid loss, but will regain function. In addition, full recovery and normo‐albuminemia will only be reached after months. A restorative reoperation should be postponed at least 6–12 weeks.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^1161Vyws]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Inflammatory states invariably induce hypoalbuminemia as a consequence of increased capillary escape of serum albumin and other plasma solutes into the interstitium and into cells. This is associated with an increased volume of fat‐free mass due to increased total water content of serum, interstitium, and, possibly, cells. In longstanding conditions, blood volume may be normal, but plasma volume increases due to diminished red cell mass. Together, fat‐free mass constitutes by far the largest part of the distribution volume of albumin leading to hypoalbuminemia. Whereas the FSR of albumin in plasma is increased in hypoalbuminemia, absolute synthesis rates may not increase due to a shorter turnover time and/or fecal/urinary losses of albumin, which have a lowering influence on whole body albumin mass. As a result, the drop in serum albumin concentration may not be compensated by the increase in the FSR of serum albumin.

An increase in serum albumin FSR appears to be a beneficial response in inflammatory conditions in which an immune response, cell proliferation, tissue healing, and growth are required. Here, albumin plays a scavenging and antioxidative role in the interstitial space. In cells, albumin can also be degraded at an accelerated rate, providing amino acids as building blocks for cell proliferation and matrix deposition.

Low serum albumin levels are, therefore, an indicator of the severity of inflammation. Preexisting inflammation is an important factor interfering with the success of medical and surgical treatment, diminishing the adequacy of the response to trauma and disease and reducing quality of life and longevity. In critical illness, spontaneous rises or decreases in serum albumin levels and the accompanying shrinking (weight loss) or increasing (weight gain) total body water, are valuable indicators, respectively, of recovery or deterioration of health. It is unlikely that low serum albumin levels represent a true deficit and, therefore, albumin infusion is unlikely to be beneficial. Moreover, hypoalbuminemia is not a primary indication for nutrition therapy. The focus of treatment should primarily be directed toward treating the inflammatory cause, although a substantial proportion of hypoalbuminemic individuals are also undernourished and require nutrition support. In the proinflammatory phase of trauma or critical illness, nutrition may not be beneficial, but more research is required.

### Comparative associations of diabetes risk factors with five measures of hyperglycemia [^113emkED]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Results

The characteristics of our study population are summarized by elevated levels of fasting glucose, HbA1c, glycated albumin, and fructosamine, and low levels of 1,5-AG, and stratified by diagnosis of diabetes in table 1. Among participants without a diagnosis of diabetes, mean age was slightly higher in persons with elevated values of each biomarker and lower concentrations of 1,5-AG. Black participants were more likely than white participants to have elevated fasting glucose, HbA1c, glycated albumin, or fructosamine. The prevalence of a family history of diabetes was higher among persons with elevated values of fasting glucose, HbA1c, glycated albumin, and fructosamine, and low 1,5-AG. Obesity prevalence was substantially higher in those persons with elevated fasting glucose, HbA1c, and glycated albumin compared with persons without elevated levels of these biomarkers. Obesity prevalence was only slightly higher at elevated levels of fructosamine compared with nonelevated values (35.5% vs 33.0%). For 1,5-AG, obesity prevalence was slightly lower at low levels (31.2%) compared with higher levels (33.2%). In general, similar risk factor patterns were observed among persons with diagnosed diabetes.

### Metabolic profiling of polycystic ovary syndrome reveals interactions with abdominal obesity [^113eYAaU]. International Journal of Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

Stratified analysis

Previous studies, have found that both lean and obese women show signs of insulin resistance and reduced levels of cholesterol in HDL, HDL 2 and HDL 3 subclasses. PCOS women, as opposed to controls, have shown significantly decreased insulin sensitivity with increasing BMIand low-grade chronic inflammation.

In the present study, using a stratified analysis by WC, we found decreased HDL cholesterol in PCOS women with abdominal obesity, which is consistent with results of previous studies, in which stratification by BMI was used. We also found new biochemical markers of PCOS in women with abdominal obesity, including albumin and total choline. In a recent study albumin levels have been associated with increased total mortality. Importantly, our results show that the lipid profile of HDL subclasses is significantly more influenced by the degree of abdominal obesity in PCOS women than in controls. Phospholipids, total cholesterol, free cholesterol, cholesterol esters and total lipids in the larger HDL subclasses were lower in PCOS. Consistent with these results, the concentration and the mean diameter of HDL particles were smaller in PCOS women with abdominal obesity. These changes in HDL concentration and HDL particle size are known to be associated with coronary artery diseaseand may increase susceptibility to coronary events.

Importantly, Apo A1 concentrations in PCOS women with abdominal obesity were significantly lower than in controls, which is also shown to be accompanied by lower HDL levels. Previous studiesin obese and overweight women (BMI > 27) did not find a significant difference, possibly due to smaller sample size or due to stratification by BMI instead of WC. Our association analysis results were consistent with this finding, showing that the ratio of Apo B and A1 was positively associated with PCOS. The multivariate pattern of decreased Apo A1, HDL-C and HDL-phospholipids have been previously linked to inflammation-associated dyslipidaemia in obesity. This is corroborated by previous cross-sectional studies that found elevated CRP levels and increased low-grade chronic inflammation in PCOS women. These results suggest that PCOS women may indeed be at higher risk of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. To date, we lack secure longitudinal data on cardiovascular events in women with PCOS but the data here support the view that PCOS women who carry these risk factors may require careful clinical monitoring from an early age.

### Distinct implications of body mass index in different subgroups of nonobese patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a latent class analysis of data from the TOPCAT trial [^1134UdGo]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, two distinct subgroups of nonobese patients with HFpEF were identified using LCA. One subgroup had a relatively "healthy" baseline clinical profile, while the other had more comorbidities and low levels of albumin and hemoglobin. Importantly, these two subgroups had opposite prognostic implications compared with obese patients with HFpEF, which indicates the different clinical significance of low BMI in 2 subgroups. The low BMI was likely physiological in the former subgroup, but pathological resulting from unintentional weight loss in the latter subgroup. Our study provides evidence for the heterogeneity among the nonobese patients with HFpEF and an alternative explanation for the "obesity paradox" in a data-driven manner.

### Bariatric nutrition and evaluation of the metabolic surgical patient: update to the 2022 Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal hormones, and the microbiome clinical practice statement (CPS) [^111iNLoP]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) patients — protein status assessment and intake recommendations are detailed: A nutrition-focused malnutrition diagnosis involves dietary history, anthropometric measurements, a nutrition-focused physical exam, and micronutrient laboratory values to detect subclinical nutrient deficiencies. Protein malnutrition in MBS patients without hepatic or renal failure is classified by hypoalbuminemia using serum albumin level < 35 g/L (normal range 35–50 g/L), with mild 30–35 g/L, moderate 25–30 g/L, and severe < 25 g/L, which is often associated with morbidity and mortality. For most post-MBS patients, the general protein recommendation is at least 60 g of high quality protein/day or up to 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight/day.

### Clinical application guidelines for blood glucose monitoring in China (2022 edition) [^113PWz6r]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

4.6 Factors affecting GA testing

The turnover speed of albumin affects the level of GA values. For the same glucose levels, individuals with accelerated albumin turnover have lower GA levels, and vice versa. Therefore, these factors should be taken into consideration when interpreting the GA levels of patients with diseases associated with abnormal albumin homoeostasis (such as nephrotic syndrome, abnormal thyroid function and liver cirrhosis).

Body mass index is inversely associated with GA. The effect of increased body fat on GA levels may be through some mechanisms related to fat mass and visceral adipose tissue. Possible explanations include increased turnover and catabolic rate of albumin and chronic low‐grade systemic inflammation in obese subjects. In the clinical use of GA, it should be noted that in people with increased body fat or central obesity, GA may underestimate the actual blood glucose level.

Thyroid hormones can promote the decomposition of albumin and affect the level of serum GA. Hyperthyroidism may lower the values of GA, while hypothyroidism may increase the values. Even in people with normal thyroid function, GA is negatively correlated with serum free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine.

4.7 Limitations of GA

Similar to HbA1c, GA reflects average glucose levels and does not provide actionable information on hypoglycaemia and glycaemic fluctuations. GA levels should be interpreted cautiously in disorders with abnormal albumin turnover, such as nephrotic syndrome, liver cirrhosis etc.

### Erectile dysfunction and diabetes: a melting pot of circumstances and treatments [^1121R2vv]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

3.2.4 Hypogonadism

ED is one of the first symptoms of hypogonadism because testosterone modulates nearly every step of erectile functionConsidering the moderate prevalence of hypogonadism in patients with T1DM relative to those with T2DM, hyperglycaemia in the absence of insulin resistance may not be enough to cause inhibition of the axis. Nevertheless, the association among hypogonadism, obesity, MetS, insulin resistance and T2DM is widely recognised and consists of a complicated vicious circle, in which obesity is a major confounder, as previously reported. Initially, patients with T2DM, obesity and MetS could present with hypogonadism, with low testosterone levels also being associated with insulin resistance, further aggravating glycaemic control, favouring the uptake of free fatty acids and proliferation of adipocytes and therefore promoting adiposity.

As reported in several cross‐sectional studies, up to 40% of men with T2DM exhibit low testosterone levels, with more than 90% experiencing ED. Moreover, a study reported an inverse correlation between ED severity and testosterone levels. In the majority of patients with DM, low testosterone levels have been associated with inappropriately low gonadotropin levels, suggesting functional secondary hypogonadism (or late‐onset hypogonadism). This could be related to both insulin resistanceand the negative feedback exerted by increased oestradiol due to the aromatase activity of visceral fat. Sex hormone‐binding globulin (SHBG) levels are usually low in patients with DM and are inversely correlated with HbA1c levels. Low SHBG levels have been associated with an increased risk for the development of T2DM. Current guidelines suggest hormone profile dosage in only patients with DM who have symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency, including total testosterone, LH, SHBG and free testosterone (measured directly or calculated using total testosterone, SHBG and albumin concentrations).

### Association between serum albumin to creatinine ratio and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a longitudinal cohort study in non-obese Chinese individuals [^112zBF5J]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses various stages of liver injury, from simple hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and potentially culminating in cirrhosis, liver failure, and primary liver malignancy. Globally, NAFLD constitutes the most prevalent hepatic disorder, occurring alongside the increasing frequency of metabolic comorbidities. While NAFLD is widely considered to result from overweight and obesity, its prevalence among non-obese populations is rising significantly. Recent data suggest that nearly a third of population globally is affected by NAFLD, with non-obese individuals making up 40.8% of NAFLD cases worldwide. Notably, non-obese NAFLD patients demonstrate comparable rates of metabolic syndrome and advanced liver disease a substantially faster rate compared to obese patients. Furthermore, while substantial evidence links low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) to NAFLD pathogenesis, emerging research suggests NAFLD can develop with normal LDL-c levels in the Chinese population. Given NAFLD's increasing prevalence and complexity in China, identifying new and accessible risk factors for non-obese individuals with normal LDL-c levels is vital for optimizing both prevention and clinical management.

Serum albumin (ALB) serves as a critical index in clinical liver function assessment, reflecting hepatic protein synthesis capability. A nationwide cross-sectional study from China showed that reduced ALB levels correlate with more severe NAFLD histological manifestations, including NASH and fibrosis. Serum creatinine (Scr) is the primary laboratory marker for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and is widely used to assess renal function and diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD). Emerging research demonstrates that NAFLD correlates with increased incidence and prevalence of CKD. Even among individuals with preserved renal function, declining eGFR values (coupled with elevated Scr) correlate with heightened NAFLD incidence. The serum albumin to creatinine ratio (sACR), incorporating indicators of both hepatic and renal function, has emerged as a parameter of clinical interest. Current research suggests that sACR is inversely associated with complications in type 2 diabetes and can predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. NAFLD, diabetes, CKD, and CVD all belong to the cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome spectrum and represent interconnected pathological conditions. Based on these interconnections, we hypothesized that sACR might serve as a significant predictive factor for NAFLD development. However, direct evidence linking sACR to incident NAFLD remains lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cohort study examining the relationship connecting sACR with incident NAFLD in non-obese Chinese individuals with normal LDL-c levels.

### Effect of elevated body mass index on glycated albumin levels in healthy individuals [^112Jwk6N]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glycated albumin (GA) is a useful marker for short-term glycemic control, but its levels may be influenced by body composition. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of increasing body mass index (BMI) on GA levels in healthy individuals.

Methods

This cross-sectional study included healthy individuals with normal and elevated BMI. Individuals with diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, acute infection, a history of cardiovascular events, malignancy, chronic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, thyroid dysfunction, anemia, morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²), or any other condition known to affect GA levels were excluded. Anthropometric and biochemical measurements were obtained and compared between normal and elevated BMI groups. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0.

Results

A total of 52 individuals with elevated BMI and 49 with normal BMI were included in the analysis. Individuals with elevated BMI had significantly lower levels of GA (42.8 ± 7.2 vs. 51.3 ± 6.0, p < 0.001), while levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were markedly higher (0.6 ± 0.4 vs. 0.4 ± 0.2, p < 0.001 and 13.5 ± 12.3 vs. 8.3 ± 7.5, p = 0.002; respectively). BMI showed a moderate inverse association with GA (r = -0.583, p < 0.001). Moreover, BMI was positively associated with CRP (r = 0.366, p < 0.001) and ESR (r = 0.299, p = 0.002). In addition, GA levels exhibited negative correlations with CRP (r = -0.401, p < 0.001) and ESR (r = -0.384, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that BMI was independently associated with GA levels (B = -2.727, 95% CI:-5.077 to -0.377, p = 0.024).

Conclusion

Our results suggest a potential inverse association between BMI and GA levels.

### Obesity as a potential predictor of disease severity in young COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study [^113cJ4TR]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Consistent with previous studies, this study also suggests that elevated FBG levels at admission are also risk factors for critical illness in young patients with COVID‐19, although most people have no previous history of diabetes. Considering that previous studies have suggested the role of inflammation in severe COVID‐19 cases and that fat density in people with obesity may be related to inflammation of adipose tissue, we evaluated epicardial fat and visceral fat CT density in the study population but found that the difference between moderate and severe/critical group was not significant.

This study had limitations. The sample size of this study was small and the distribution of the two groups was uneven, which has been considered as much as possible in this analysis. Two methods were used in the logistic analysis for identification of risk factors. In moderate COVID‐19 cases, the absence of multiple albumin test results during hospitalization made it impossible to accurately determine the changes in albumin levels among moderate cases. In addition, immune cell numbers were not tested for many cases, making it impossible for us to thoroughly assess the role of the immune response in young patients with COVID‐19. In addition, we need to note that the Chinese definition of overweight and obesity is different from that used in the United States and Europe. Therefore, when applying the conclusions of this study, it is necessary to consider the possible impact of this difference. Our research suggests that the liver CT value is helpful for predicting severe cases of COVID‐19 in young patients. However, we should note that liver CT value is an imaging index, which cannot reflect pathophysiological changes. Therefore, we also need further research to help clarify low liver CT values associated with severe COVID‐19 cases.

### The role of the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) in the risk of liver fibrosis and mortality among US adult MAFLD patients: a cross-sectional study of NHANES 1999–2018 [^111T1hct]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The development of liver fibrosis is the result of the gradual progression from steatosis and NASH to fibrosis. Consistent with previous studies, we also found a non-linear relationship between ALI and liver fibrosis. However, our turning point was 5.68, which is lower than that reported in earlier research. This difference may be attributed to variations in the definitions of NAFLD and MAFLD, as well as differences in the populations included. This non-linear relationship suggests that liver fibrosis is the result of the complex interplay among nutritional status, inflammation, and metabolic factors. First, in our study, 97% of the patients were overweight or obese. Obesity induces hepatic fat accumulation, adipocyte dysfunction, and chronic low-grade metabolic inflammation, which accelerate fibrosis progression. This hepatic inflammatory activity can be reflected by changes in NLR, particularly the activation of neutrophils, which play a key role in liver inflammation. In the early stages of the disease, neutrophils may promote fibrosis by forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). However, as liver fibrosis advances, excessive neutrophil activation and the resulting inflammation may further impair liver function and hinder the liver's repair mechanisms. Human serum albumin is a multifunctional protein with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and plasma oncotic pressure-regulating properties. Liver inflammation and obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance may lead to decreased albumin levels and impaired function. However, in the context of ALI, the decline in albumin levels may be masked by obesity. Moreover, we found that the positive association between ALI and liver fibrosis was more pronounced in subgroups with central obesity and prediabetes. Notably, not all obese individuals are at equal risk of developing liver disease. Visceral fat may be an independent factor influencing liver fibrosis in MAFLD. The biological mechanisms through which visceral fat promotes liver fibrosis are complex and may involve the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6) and adipokines, as well as a higher lipolytic activity that releases large amounts of free fatty acids. These substances, upon entering the liver, can trigger oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Although prediabetes represents a milder state of insulin sensitivity impairment and β-cell dysfunction, it contributes to insulin resistance, increased oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation, which are potential pathways leading to liver cancer and CVD. Early lifestyle and dietary interventions in individuals with central obesity and prediabetes are crucial for slowing the progression of MAFLD.

### Early life body mass index trajectories and albuminuria in midlife: a 30-year prospective cohort study [^1172NNyP]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, three distinct BMI trajectories from childhood to middle age were identified by GBTM over a 30-year follow-up; in this period, China began to institute reforms and open up, and people's lifestyles have undergone tremendous changes. A significant association was observed between BMI trajectory and uACR as well as the incidence of albuminuria in middle age (that is, the higher the early-life BMI is, the higher the uACR and risk of albuminuria in middle age).

Elevated uACR and albuminuria are early markers of vascular dysfunction. The Steno hypothesis states that systemic vascular inflammation is accompanied by increased vascular permeability and could result in endothelial damage, albumin escape, and glomerular and tubular damage. Additionally, this hypothesis proposes the causal pathophysiological link between CKD and CVD. Several studies have shown that albuminuria is associated with all-cause mortality and CVD in the general population. Hillege et al. reported that a 2-fold increase in urinary albumin concentration is associated with a 29% increased risk of CVD mortality. A systematic review also reported a positive relationship between uACR and mortality. Therefore, early detection of the risk factors for albuminuria or high uACR could benefit the primary prevention of vascular dysfunction, thus delaying the occurrence of CVD and CKD.

Obesity is an established risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, and is also increasingly recognized to contribute to albuminuria. Many studies have reported that obesity leads to glomerular hyperfiltration, causing a higher GFR and increased renal blood flow, thereby contributing to kidney damage. In addition, obesity increases the secretion of adipokines, which promotes kidney damage by inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, etc. Many clinical studies have confirmed that obesity is a strong risk factor for albuminuria. A systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed that obesity is also an important independent predictor of CKD in the general population. These associations persist in cross-sectional studies based on patients with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetesand hypertension. In addition, abdominal obesity was reported to be related to the development of elevated albuminuria in nondiabetic subjects over a 6-year follow-up. However, these studies were conducted based on a single or short-term weight change, which did not adequately reflect the continuous effects of obesity on albuminuria and was susceptible to lifestyle, dietary conditions, and other factors, resulting in differences in the above research results.

### Effect of elevated body mass index on glycated albumin levels in healthy individuals [^111ctqvv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results demonstrate that individuals with higher BMI exhibited elevated FPG and HbA1c levels. This result aligns with previous studies conducted in non-diabetic populations and may reflect the increased insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism associated with obesity. All these results support the notion that BMI has a differential effect on various glycemic markers and underscore the complex interplay between body composition and glucose regulation.

It is important to acknowledge several limitations of this study. First, its cross-sectional design precludes any inference of causal relationships. Second, the relatively small sample size, without a priori power analysis, may limit the generalizability of the findings and reduce the statistical power of subgroup analyses. Additionally, other potential confounding factors, such as diet, physical activity, and socioeconomic status, were not assessed, which may have influenced the observed associations. Third, the study employed WHO BMI cutoffs (25.0–39.9 kg/m²). While lower BMI thresholds are sometimes recommended for certain Asian populations due to higher metabolic risk at lower BMI, our cohort consisted of Turkish adults, whose BMI-related metabolic risk is generally comparable to European populations; therefore, the WHO cutoffs are considered appropriate. Furthermore, the lack of longitudinal follow-up limits the ability to evaluate temporal changes in GA, CRP, or ESR levels in relation to BMI variations. Finally, as the study population primarily included young Turkish adults, caution should be exercised when extrapolating these findings to older individuals, children, or non-Turkish populations.

### Metabolic profiling of polycystic ovary syndrome reveals interactions with abdominal obesity [^111xUkYW]. International Journal of Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive disorder associated with metabolic disturbances including obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. Here we investigate whether changes in the metabolic profile of PCOS women are driven by increased tendency to obesity or are specific features of PCOS related to increased testosterone levels.

Design and Methods

We conducted an NMR metabolomics association study of PCOS cases (n = 145) and controls (n = 687) nested in a population-based birth cohort (n = 3127). Subjects were 31 years old at examination. The main analyses were adjusted for waist circumference (WC) as a proxy measure of central obesity. Subsequently, metabolite concentrations were compared between cases and controls within pre-defined WC strata. In each stratum, additional metabolomics association analyses with testosterone levels were conducted separately among cases and controls.

Results

Overall, women with PCOS showed more adverse metabolite profiles than the controls. Four lipid fractions in different subclasses of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) were associated with PCOS, after adjusting for WC and correction for multiple testing (P < 0.002). In stratified analysis the PCOS women within large WC strata (⩾98cm) had significantly lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, Apo A1 and albumin values compared with the controls. Testosterone levels were significantly associated with VLDL and serum lipids in PCOS cases with large WC but not in the controls. The higher testosterone levels, adjusted for WC, associated adversely with insulin levels and HOMA IR in cases but not in the controls.

Conclusions

Our findings show that both abdominal obesity and hyperandrogenism contribute to the dyslipidaemia and other metabolic traits of PCOS which all may negatively contribute to the long-term health of women with PCOS.

### Role of salt sensitivity, blood pressure, and hyperinsulinemia in determining high upper normal levels of urinary albumin excretion in a healthy adult population [^113LwzXq]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of blood pressure (BP), salt sensitivity (SS), and the cardiovascular metabolic syndrome in determining the urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in glucose-tolerant, normoalbuminuric (< 20 mg/day) healthy adults.

Methods and Results

We evaluated 177 healthy subjects (age, 38.3 ± 0.9 years; weight, 75.2 ± 1.1 kg; body mass index, 28.8 ± 0.4 kg/m(2); systolic BP, 117 ± 1 mm Hg; diastolic BP, 77.5 ± 0.8 mm Hg; UAE, 8.2 ± 0.3 mg/24 h). Subjects with UAE levels of 15 to 20 mg/day had higher systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse pressures than those with UAE levels less than 15 mg/day (P < .0001). Hypertension (HT) and SS were more prevalent in the high normal UAE group (15 to 20 mg/day) than in groups with lower UAE (47% v 8% for HT and 67% v 24% for SS). In normotensives (n = 156), no differences in BP were observed among the different UAE strata; yet, the prevalence of SS was greater in the high (57%) compared to the low normal (17% to 21%) UAE groups. Similar levels of UAE, BP, and similar prevalence of SS were found in men with and without abdominal obesity, despite the fact that obesity was associated with hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia.

Conclusions

In healthy normoalbuminuric adults, high normal UAE is associated with SS in normotensives and with SS and higher BP in a mixed population (88% normotensive and 12% hypertensive). Abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperinsulinemia were not related to UAE. Therefore, UAE levels of 15 to 20 mg/day should be accepted as microalbuminuria, and these subjects may benefit from early intervention (ie, salt restriction and BP lowering).

### Prediction of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease via advanced machine learning among Chinese han population [^116WgLdr]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Albumin was one of the seven predictors and demonstrated high prediction power in this study. Albumin plays a role in the immune system by transporting antibodies and hormones and binding to toxins and waste products. This helps to remove those harmful substances from the body and maintain a healthy immune response. Regarding MASLD, research has shown a correlation between decreased albumin levels and inflammation aggravation, which can worsen liver disease progression. This can also indicate advanced stages of MASLD and the presence of liver fibrosis, which can increase the risk of liver failure and other complications. Hence, determining the amount of albumin can aid in diagnosing and keeping track of MASLD and evaluating the advancement and response to therapy. The relationship between albumin and TG in MASLD was not well established. However, low albumin levels have generally been associated with higher levels of TG and other markers of insulin resistance, which were known risk factors for MASLD.

It is worth noting that the accumulation of TG, common in obese and lean individuals with MASLD, can cause inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to liver damage. The TG, glucose, and BMI combination in the TG-glucose-BMI index was considered better for predicting MASLD than using any of these variables alone, as they provide a more comprehensive assessment of metabolic health and the risk of developing the liver disease. This index considers lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, and body fat distribution critical factors in MASLD's development and progression. In our study, besides including the three variables mentioned earlier, adding more indicators, i.e. albumin, ALT, HDL, and creatinine, that can reflect metabolic and inflammatory characteristics can improve the prediction of MASLD and monitor changes in metabolic health over time.

### Association between serum albumin to creatinine ratio and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a longitudinal cohort study in non-obese Chinese individuals [^115ae8dY]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates an inverse and non-linear relationship between sACR and NAFLD incidence in non-obese Chinese individuals with a normal range of LDL-c. Our findings reveal a threshold effect at sACR of 44.675, beyond which the protective association becomes particularly significant. These results enhance risk stratification for NAFLD prevention strategies based on sACR levels. From a therapeutic perspective, it likely serves as a mediating factor in the mechanism of drugs for NAFLD treatment and shows potential as a monitoring indicator for evaluating the clinical efficacy of NAFLD therapies.

### Impact of malnutrition on systemic immune and metabolic profiles in type 2 diabetes [^115VCiuk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Globally, malnutrition is a severe public health issue with a prevalence of 925 million globally. Malnutrition is a clinical disorder that comprises a range of anthropometric deficiencies from reduce (low weight for height) and impede (low height for age) in undernutrition to other disorders of nutrition including high BMI such as overweight and obesity. Undernutrition/malnutrition is typically defined by the presence of both low BMI and low serum albumin levels. It is associated with a variety of metabolic abnormalities, including steatosis, increased lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, decreased circulating amino acids, decreased peroxisome number and function and impaired mitochondrial function. Malnutrition can lead to immune dysfunction and enhanced mortality from infections.

We hypothesized that malnutrition could alter pancreatic hormone, adipocytokine and cytokines response in T2DM individuals and thereby predispose individuals to an increased risk for more severe form of T2DM. Since there is a paucity of information about the link between malnutrition and metabolic diseases of inflammatory origin, we studied the relationship between undernutrition and T2DM and assessed the influence of malnutrition on factors which are essential in glycemic control. Previous studies have shown that adipocytokines play a crucial role in T2DM. Therefore, in the present study we wanted to examine the associations of circulating levels of HbA1c (Glycosylated haemoglobin), blood glucose, pancreatic hormones (insulin and glucagon) and adipocytokines (adiponectin, adipsin, resistin, leptin and visfatin). Finally, we extend the analysis of the role of inflammation in T2DM by measuring the levels of an array of cytokines in those with T2DM with or without coexisting low BMI.

### Red cell distribution width / albumin ratio as a marker for metabolic syndrome: findings from a cross-sectional study [^115JMogn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. A previous study reported a stable prevalence of 33% in adults from 2007 to 2012. In 2016, the prevalence of MetS among adults aged 20 and older in the United States was 34.7% according to statistics. MetS contributes to the development of conditions such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and other disabilities. Also referred to as X syndrome, insulin resistance syndrome, Reaven syndrome, and "fatal quartet", metabolic syndrome comprises clinical symptoms such as central and abdominal obesity, systemic hypertension, insulin resistance (or type 2 diabetes), and dyslipidemia with atherogenic lipid profiles. It is characterized by promoting thrombosis and a pro-inflammatory state, marked by increased activity of inflammatory cytokines.

Typically, patients with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) are obese and present with insulin resistance, which can result in hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, visceral obesity, hyperuricemia, increased inflammatory markers, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombosis, all of which may contribute to MetS through various complex mechanisms. Insulin resistance induces systemic oxidative stress, which in turn activates inflammatory responses, thereby promoting chronic low-grade inflammation and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both inflammation and oxidative stress play significant roles in the development of metabolic complications.

Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is a marker routinely examined in laboratories, reflecting the heterogeneity of red blood cell volume. Impaired red blood cell production and abnormal red blood cell survival lead to an increase in RDW, which is associated with systemic inflammation and various diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, venous thromboembolism, cancer, diabetes, community-acquired pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and liver and kidney failure. Serum albumin is the most abundant circulating protein in blood, serving as a crucial marker of nutritional status and inflammatory response. The physiological characteristics of albumin include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticoagulant, antiplatelet aggregation activities, and colloid osmotic pressure. Several studies have reported a negative correlation between serum albumin concentration and the incidence of functional impairments, diseases, and mortality rates. Additionally, RDW is positively correlated with chronological age, while serum albumin is negatively correlated with chronological age.

### Gastric bypass is not associated with protein malnutrition in morbidly obese patients [^114tkED7]. Obesity Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing bariatric surgery with a gastric bypass lose about 66% of excess weight. Although this procedure induces weight loss, it is unknown whether it leads to protein malnutrition, which is studied here.

Methods

One hundred ten obese patients (body mass index, 47.9 ± 8.6 kg/m(2)) undergoing gastric bypass had a measurement of plasma albumin and transthyretin (formerly prealbumin) and a calculation of nutritional risk index (NRI) before and throughout the 2 years following the surgery.

Results

All but five patients lost more than 15% of initial weight; the mean loss of excess weight was 65.2 ± 26.4% at 2 years. Plasma concentrations of albumin and transthyretin decreased after surgery, but while albumin returned to initial values after 12 months, transthyretin remained low. Only one patient had an albumin below 30 g/l; another one had a transthyretin lower than 110 mg/l. All NRI scores were lower than 83.5 (62 ± 5, ranging 44–70), qualifying patients for severe malnutrition.

Conclusion

Malnutrition is difficult to diagnose in obese patients undergoing surgery. The large weight loss is most often not associated with protein malnutrition. Whether gastric bypass induces protein malnutrition remains to be established.

### Calcium metabolism in the morbidly obese [^113DTLMT]. Obesity Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Morbidly obese patients are known to have abnormal calcium metabolism compared with the non-obese, but the clinical significance of this is unknown. Since surgical treatment of obesity may itself cause hyperparathyroidism, it is important to understand the preoperative physiology of these patients.

Methods

213 consecutive patients (M 37: F 176, ages 21–68) presenting for surgical treatment of morbid obesity between October 2000 and June 2002 were prospectively evaluated. Preoperative levels of serum calcium corrected for albumin, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were measured. We recorded the prevalence of abnormalities in study parameters and correlated them with PTH levels.

Results

Hyperparathyroidism (PTH > 65 pg/ml) was present in 25.0% of subjects. By contrast, abnormalities of serum calcium were rare. The prevalence of hypocalcemia was 3.5%, and of hypercalcemia was 0.5%. Only 4.3% of patients had increased levels of alkaline phosphatase. 21.1% of patients had abnormally low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (median 15 ng/ml), and 23.1% had increased levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (median 49 pg/ml). PTH was positively correlated with BMI (r = .30, P = < .001) and 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (r = .27, P = 0.01), and was negatively correlated with alkaline phosphatase (r = .21, P = 0.02). There was no correlation between PTH and calcium, 1,25-dihydoxyvitamin D, age, or sex.

Conclusions

Parathyroid hormone levels are increased in the morbidly obese and are positively correlated with BMI. Recognition of preoperative hyperparathyroidism is important because of the risk of attributing postoperative hyperparathyroidism to the effects of surgery. Further studies are needed to elucidate the cause of elevated PTH in these patients.

### Defending the con side: obesity paradox does not exist [^111atUzs]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Anabolic deficiency or the malnutrition-inflammation syndrome.

Cardiac cachexia is a well-known phenomenon seen in the context of severe chronic heart disease and indicates a poor prognosis for the individual patient. Cardiac cachexia represents a state of anabolic deficiency with mitochondrial fragmentation of muscle tissue and reduced muscular strength. So, good physical fitness seems to be an important issue, and more obese subjects seem to benefit the most from physical fitness. Early signs of reduced muscular strength may already be present in a subgroup of patients with hypertension and signal a more disadvantageous outcome. Anabolic deficiency can be most marked in heart failure patients and is associated with decreased blood lymphocytes, serum total cholesterol, albumin, and prealbumin and increased signs of inflammation and reflects a rather poor prognosis. In fact, evidence has been accumulated that A-type and B-type natriuretic peptides, produced in the myocardial tissue in response to ventricular stretch and cardiac overload — increased levels being a hallmark and highly diagnostic of heart failure — promote lipolysis, enhance adiponectin production, and augment the malnutrition-inflammation syndrome. It has been a puzzling finding for some time that higher adiponectin levels, which are usually thought to be preventive against the occurrence of CV complications and type 2 diabetes and seen as a sign of good health, appear to indicate a much more adverse outcome in conjunction with CHD and heart failure. In the context of a discussion of the so-called obesity paradox, an adiponectin paradox seems to be another facet of the complex.

So, in aggregate, slim may not always be healthy (the review of Hainer and Aldhoon-Hainerová expands on that issue even further), and a selection and treatment bias may contribute to a relatively more healthy but obese phenotype. These two main notions seem to largely explain the reverse epidemiology of a better outcome of patients with existing CV complications and a higher body weight. An unqualified general linkage, however, of obesity and a better lifetime prognosis, i.e. an obesity paradox in general, does not seem to exist.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative nutrition, metabolic, and nonsurgical support of patients undergoing bariatric procedures-2019 update: cosponsored by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology, the obesity society, American society for metabolic&bariatric surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American society of anesthesiologists- [^111g3NwZ]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Bariatric surgery — lipid metabolism and dyslipidemia — shows procedure-specific improvements, with a meta-analysis finding low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol decreases of 42.5 mg/dL with biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS), 24.7 mg/dL with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 8.9 mg/dL with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), and 7.9 mg/dL with sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and RYGB superior to SG for short- (1-year) and mid-term (5-year) lipid metabolism alongside weight loss and glycemic control; in a small cohort before and after RYGB (N = 38), pre-operative n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid and vitamin A levels correlated with fasting insulinemia, high-sensitivity CRP, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, a longitudinal study linked pancreatic lipid metabolism improvements with better glycemic control and β-cell function, and albumin showed an increasing tendency in 5 of 73 (7.5%) patients awaiting bariatric surgery with lower cholesterol and higher triglycerides.

### Bariatric surgery can reduce albuminuria in patients with severe obesity and normal kidney function by reducing systemic inflammation [^112hS9gk]. Obesity Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity causes renal problems including albuminuria. Bariatric surgery (BS) improves albuminuria. We investigated whether albuminuria is reduced by weight loss per se or by improved systemic inflammation induced by weight loss after BS.

Methods

Patients older than 18 years who received BS in Soonchunhyang University Hospital from 01 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 were included. Other inclusion criteria included body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2, creatinine level ≤ 1.0 mg/dL, and no overt proteinuria (trace amount or undetectable by dipstick). The patients were followed at 1 and 6 months after BS.

Results

Forty-three patients were analyzed. Three patients were men, 10 patients had diabetes, and 12 patients had hypertension. All patients had normal renal function (creatinine ≤ 1.0 mg/dL), and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 115.7 ± 16.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2. There were significant reductions in body weight, BMI, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). There were positive correlations between delta hs-CRP and delta body weight (r = 0.349, p = 0.043) or delta body mass index (BMI, r = 0.362, p = 0.035); between hs-CRP and body weight (r = 0.374, p = 0.001), BMI (r = 0.431, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis using a linear mixed model demonstrated that hs-CRP (β = 0.5364, p = 0.026) was an independent risk factor affecting ACR.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that BS can reduce albuminuria in patients with severe obesity and normal kidney function by reducing systemic inflammation.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^1178u2H9]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Visceral proteins as markers of nutrition status — serum albumin and prealbumin continue to be incorrectly cited as nutrition markers; because of the strong associations between inflammation and malnutrition, visceral proteins correlate well with patient risk for adverse outcomes while not specifically reflecting a patient's current nutrition state, and inflammatory markers are useful for determining nutrition risk by identifying those patients likely to be at an increased risk of poor outcomes if adequate nutrition is not delivered. Malnutrition may be characterized by the type of inflammation present: acute illness/injury or chronic illness, and relatively few patients in developed countries have starvation-associated malnutrition. Another common misconception is that serum albumin and prealbumin are markers of protein and muscle mass in body composition; in healthy patients these levels do not decline until BMI is < 12 after ≥ 6 weeks of starvation, with the same reported in elderly patients, and serum albumin and prealbumin levels are known to correlate poorly with nutrition intake. Pediatric data show similar overall findings, and although the visceral proteins retain correlations with inflammation, there is poor correlation with muscle mass or overall malnutrition assessments.

### Compound effect of hypoalbuminemia and obesity on complications after autologous breast reconstruction [^117FqQMm]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is among the risk factors identified that impair postoperative wound healing. Recently, malnutrition and sarcopenia have also been found to correlate with poor surgical outcomes; however, the effect of malnutrition in the setting of obesity is understudied, particularly in reconstructive surgery. The authors examine the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program database to determine the impact of obesity plus hypoalbuminemia on complications after autologous breast reconstruction.

Methods

Autologous breast reconstruction procedures (pedicled and free flaps) were collected from the 2009 to 2019 National Surgery Quality Improvement Program databases by CPT codes (n = 23,690). Patients without height, weight, or preoperative serum albumin data (n = 12,825) were excluded. Demographics and postoperative outcomes were compared in patients with obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m 2) and malnutrition (albumin < 3.5 g/dL). Propensity score-matched cohorts with and without malnutrition were also compared.

Results

A total of 10,865 procedures were included in analysis; 4565 involved patients with obesity (42%). Obesity was associated with increased length of stay, reoperations, wound complications, and medical complications (all P < 0.001). Among patients with obesity, 198 had malnutrition (4.3%). The combination of obesity and malnutrition was associated with a higher rate of wound complications (16%) over obesity alone (9.2%) or malnutrition alone (9.2%, both P < 0.05). This difference is recapitulated in propensity score-matched analysis.

Conclusion

Hypoalbuminemia, a marker of malnutrition, is underappreciated in obese patients and is associated with worse surgical outcomes after autologous breast reconstruction compared with obesity alone.

### Association between serum albumin to creatinine ratio and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a longitudinal cohort study in non-obese Chinese individuals [^115tXhP8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent Chinese longitudinal cohort study including 2,625 participants demonstrated that elevated sACR levels were associated with better prognosis in heart failure (HF) patients (HR: 0.747, 95% CI: 0.635–0.878, P < 0.001). Our comprehensive literature search revealed that our study is the first to examine the correlation between sACR and NAFLD risk. Previous studies have established relationships between the individual components of sACR and NAFLD: a positive correlation between ALB levels and incident NAFLD, and a negative correlation between Scr and NAFLD occurrence, which collectively support our investigation of sACR as a composite marker. In addition, Takahashi et al. demonstrated that NAFLD patients with low serum albumin levels exhibited significantly higher mortality risk compared to those with high levels (HR = 22.9, 95% CI 8.21–63.9, P < 0.001). Although there is no data on the association between the sACR and the likelihood of developing NAFLD, an increase in this ratio indicates either an increase in ALB or a reduction in Scr (or both). Consequently, our results support and extend the aforementioned findings by demonstrating that higher sACR levels are substantially associated with lower NAFLD risk. Furthermore, our sensitivity analyses confirmed that this inverse association between sACR and NAFLD risk persists in subgroups with TG < 1.7 mmol/L, ALT < 40 U/L, or BMI < 24 kg/m2, suggesting the robustness of this relationship across different metabolic profiles. This discovery offers a justification for potentially reducing the likelihood of NAFLD by increasing sACR. An elevated sACR signifies a reduced risk of developing NAFLD. A lower sACR during the follow-up period indicates an elevated risk of developing NAFLD, which suggests the potential clinical utility of sACR monitoring as an early warning system, allowing individuals to modify their lifestyle choices proactively to reduce NAFLD incidence.

### Malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome in dialysis patients: causes and consequences [^115gDg7F]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and inflammation are common and usually concurrent in maintenance dialysis patients. Many factors that appear to lead to these 2 conditions overlap, as do assessment tools and such criteria for detecting them as hypoalbuminemia. Both these conditions are related to poor dialysis outcome. Low appetite and a hypercatabolic state are among common features. PEM in dialysis patients has been suggested to be secondary to inflammation; however, the evidence is not conclusive, and an equicausal status or even opposite causal direction is possible. Hence, malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS) is an appropriate term. Possible causes of MICS include comorbid illnesses, oxidative and carbonyl stress, nutrient loss through dialysis, anorexia and low nutrient intake, uremic toxins, decreased clearance of inflammatory cytokines, volume overload, and dialysis-related factors. MICS is believed to be the main cause of erythropoietin hyporesponsiveness, high rate of cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality and hospitalization in dialysis patients. Because MICS leads to a low body mass index, hypocholesterolemia, hypocreatininemia, and hypohomocysteinemia, a "reverse epidemiology" of cardiovascular risks can occur in dialysis patients. Therefore, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and increased blood levels of creatinine and homocysteine appear to be protective and paradoxically associated with a better outcome. There is no consensus about how to determine the degree of severity of MICS or how to manage it. Several diagnostic tools and treatment modalities are discussed. Successful management of MICS may ameliorate the cardiovascular epidemic and poor outcome in dialysis patients. Clinical trials focusing on MICS and its possible causes and consequences are urgently required to improve poor clinical outcome in dialysis patients.

### A synergistic impact of body mass index and gamma gap on heart failure and mortality rate among older patients with coronary artery disease: a prospective study with 10-year follow-up [^111riSFt]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective study with 10-year follow-up, both low BMI and high gamma gap contribute to heart failure and mortality rate in older patients with CAD, suggesting that low BMI and high gamma gap play a synergistic impact on heart failure and mortality rate.

In this study, we found that low BMI and high gamma gap were associated with an increased risk of mortality rate, even after adjusting for age, gender, and other potential confounding factors. The association between BMI and mortality rate is inconsistent, which is considered as obesity paradox. Some studies have suggested that overweight was an important risk factor for the development of heart failure and mortality rate, but other researches realized that high BMI had a protective impact on the actual long-term prognosis in patients with CAD. Our findings suggested that high BMI is negatively associated with the development of heart failure and mortality rate in older patients with CAD.

The association between gamma gap and mortality rate in older patients with CAD has not been widely studied, not to say the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we found that high gamma gap resulted in increased heart failure and mortality rate in older patients with CAD. Elevated gamma gap has been realized to increase mortality rate in populations of nonagenarians and centenarians. High gamma gap suggests the presence of systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction, which are important factors contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. An elevated gamma gap may result from increased globulin levels or decreased albumin levels. Decreased albumin levels have been shown to be a risk factor for all-cause mortality. Studies have indicated that decreased albumin levels are associated with higher mortality rate in octogenarians and can predict long-term mortality rate in patients with dual-chamber permanent pacemakers. Immune activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines play important roles in the progression of heart failure, and elevated circulating globulin levels are a predictor of heart failure and mortality rate.

Our finding of a synergistic impact of low BMI and high gamma gap on heart failure and mortality risk is still novel and warrants further investigation. One possible explanation is that low BMI and high gamma gap may reflect a state of chronic malnutrition and inflammation, which could lead to a higher risk of adverse prognosis. There is another potential mechanism may explain the relationship between BMI and gamma gap. The large number of activated macrophages in the adipose tissue increases the catabolism of globulin. The half-life of globulin in individuals with obesity is shorter compared with lean individuals.

### Malnutrition (subjective global assessment) scores and serum albumin levels, but not body mass index values, at initiation of dialysis are independent predictors of mortality: a 10-year clinical cohort study [^116URFVg]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the associations between demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and nutritional parameters at the start of dialysis and mortality, including the combined effects on nutritional parameters, which were seldom investigated in the literature.

Design

Ten-year retrospective clinical cohort study.

Setting

Dialysis unit of a metropolitan tertiary teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia.

Subjects

Incident dialysis patients (n = 167; hemodialysis, 57.5%; male, 61.7%; age, 65.3 ± 13.6 years; diabetic, 24.5%) who commenced on a planned dialysis program.

Methods

Associations were examined between all-cause mortality and baseline demographics, including age and gender; clinical and lifestyle characteristics, including glomerular filtration rate, smoking habits, presence of comorbidities (e.g., coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease); and nutritional parameters, including body mass index (BMI), serum albumin (s-albumin) levels, and subjective global assessment score (SGA). Associations with combination values for malnutrition, s-albumin (< 3.3 vs. ≥ 3.3 g/dL), and BMI (< 26 vs. ≥ 26 kg/m(2)) were also examined.

Results

Median survival was 54.2 months (interquartile range, 23 to 83), and 52.1% of patients were malnourished (SGA score B and C) at the start of dialysis. Advanced age (classified as > 65 years, P < .0001), presence of peripheral vascular disease (P < .0001), reduced s-albumin levels (P = 0.01), and malnutrition scores (P = 0.02) independently predicted mortality. Being overweight and obese (BMI: ≥ 26 kg/m(2)) did not show any advantage on survival (P = 0.73). Being malnourished and overweight (or obese) was associated with a 3-fold increase in mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 7.33; p = 0.02) compared with being well nourished with a BMI < 26 kg/m(2) (referent). Compared with being well nourished (SGA = A), being malnourished with normal or low s-albumin was associated with higher risk (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.06 to 4.00; p = 0.03 and HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.65 to 4.94; P < .0001, respectively). There was no statistical difference between mortality risks through any combination of s-albumin and BMI values (P = 0.54).

Conclusion

Malnutrition and reduced s-albumin levels were found to be independent predictors of mortality, whereas being overweight and obese did not show protective effects.

### Association between the C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte index and metabolic syndrome: evidence from the 2003–2010 national health and nutrition examination survey [^114WxLpS]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

MetS is associated with various risk factors and plays a crucial role in disease progression. There is mounting evidence illustrating an association between MetS and inflammation, nutritional status, and immune function. MetS causes modifications in cell signaling pathways, resulting in elevated inflammatory markers, lipid peroxides, and free radicals. The use of CRP as an inflammatory biomarker is becoming more common in the assessment of cardiovascular risk, with CRP elevation linked to key MetS risk factors, such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and abdominal adiposity. A previous study showed that CRP was significantly elevated in patients with MetS, highlighting the inflammatory state of the body and underscoring the importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of MetS, which is consistent with the findings of the present study.

T lymphocytes, which are crucial players in the adaptive immune response, intricately contribute to inflammation in patients with obesity. Individuals with obesity and those with MetS exhibit elevated T lymphocyte counts, disrupting the delicate balance between pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation. Some studies have associated heightened lymphocyte counts with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus due to insulin resistance. Although some studies have suggested compromised lymphocyte function, evidenced by increased apoptosis or decreased immune response capacity, conflicting findings have emerged. The present study confirmed that individuals with MetS had significantly higher peripheral blood lymphocyte counts than healthy controls, supporting their role in MetS pathogenesis. This finding is consistent with emerging evidence illustrating the crucial role of the immune system in MetS development and highlighting the complex relationship between immune dysregulation and metabolic disturbances.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^11788bEW]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and escape of serum albumin, leading to expansion of interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half‐life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These 2 factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma. Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy, and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and as supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis. Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit, which may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminaemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusion of albumin. After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity and associated with decreasing serum albumin levels. Nutrition support cannot fully prevent, but slows down, this chain of events, especially when combined with physical exercise.

### SGA scores have poor correlation with serum albumin in obese hemodialysis patients: a secondary analysis [^1146rwZM]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between serum albumin and the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) in a sample of obese hemodialysis (HD) patients.

Design and Method

Study subjects (N = 253) included patients who were categorized into well-nourished (68%, SGA score 6–7) and malnourished (score 1–5) groups, and, on the basis of the body mass index (BMI), into obese (BMI > 30 kg/m(2); 35%) and nonobese (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)). The mean baseline data (± standard deviation) were as follows: age, 63.5 ± 14.3 years; BMI, 29 ± 8 kg/m(2); and serum albumin, 3.8 ± 0.4 mg/dL (bromocresol green). The secondary analysis of data from the SGA Validation Project and Nutrition Algorithm Preliminary Report determined the relationship between the 7-point SGA and serum albumin concentrations in a sample of obese HD patients. Data were analyzed at Case Western Reserve University from a total of 253 HD patients.

Main Outcome Measure

The SGA scores in the BMI groups were compared with serum albumin as an objective measure of nutrition and inflammation risk.

Results

By using analysis of variance, the obese and nonobese populations showed statistically significant differences in SGA scores (obese: P < .3468, nonobese: P < .0080) and serum albumin values (obese, P < .0943; nonobese, P < .0183) between well-nourished and malnourished groups. A multivariable nominal logistic fit was used to predict SGA group with age and gender as covariates. Serum albumin values (P < .0057) and BMI values greater than 30 (P < .0090) predicted SGA group.

Conclusion

The secondary analysis showed that SGA does not correlate well with serum albumin; thus, it may not be a valid nutrition assessment tool among obese HD patients.

### The role of the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) in the risk of liver fibrosis and mortality among US adult MAFLD patients: a cross-sectional study of NHANES 1999–2018 [^114qNvKd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

However, the predictive ability of ALI for liver fibrosis risk is limited. Our study suggests that BMI alone may have a stronger predictive value, indicating that BMI could be the dominant component in the relationship between ALI and liver fibrosis. In our study, the NFS demonstrated good accuracy, but previous studies have shown that NFS has false-negative rates of 2–4% and false-positive rates of 28–29% in the general population, making it unsuitable as a primary screening tool in general or high-risk populations. Therefore, future research should focus on exploring the mechanisms underlying the interplay of nutrition and inflammation in the progression of liver fibrosis in MAFLD and finding more accurate nutritional-inflammatory markers to better assess disease progression.

We also found that increasing ALI levels are negatively correlated with all-cause mortality and CVD mortality. We believe this can be explained by several biological mechanisms. First, the "obesity paradox" may help explain the protective effect of obesity on mortality risk. The "obesity paradox" suggests that although obesity may increase disease risk, paradoxically, it is associated with lower mortality rates in certain chronic conditions. A potential mechanism is that adipose tissue in obese individuals secretes beneficial metabolic products such as adiponectin, which may, to some extent, slow the progression of chronic inflammation, cellular damage, and metabolic dysregulation. Second, similar to high BMI, high albumin levels also reflect the patient's potentially better nutritional status and immune function. As mentioned earlier, albumin is a multifunctional plasma protein, with various roles including volume expansion, antioxidant activity, and regulation of inflammation. It is also often used as a treatment for decompensated cirrhosis and critically ill patients. Finally, Higher NLR reflects increased neutrophil activity, and the inflammatory mediators they release, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), can lead to endothelial dysfunction and vascular wall damage. In contrast, lymphocytes counteract atherosclerosis by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10) and promoting inflammation resolution. Therefore, a lower NLR may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in MAFLD patients, thereby lowering all-cause and CVD mortality. Additionally, our study found that the protective effect of ALI was more pronounced in subgroups with low HDL-cholesterol levels and those who did not engage in excessive alcohol consumption. We speculate that this relationship may be due to the inclusion of individuals with excessively high HDL-cholesterol levels. Studies have shown a U-shaped non-linear relationship between HDL-cholesterol levels and both all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event risk in T2DM patients. This may be related to the increase in HDL-cholesterol particle size and harmful subtypes, which have been associated with hypertension and a higher incidence of cardiovascular events. Previous studies have indicated that excessive alcohol intake synergistically interacts with metabolic disorders, increasing the risk of all-cause, liver-related, and cancer-related mortality in MAFLD patients. Therefore, although the current definition of MAFLD no longer emphasizes alcohol consumption, assessing drinking history remains crucial.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^1158KX7a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and escape of serum albumin, leading to expansion of interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half-life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These 2 factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma. Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy, and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and as supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis. Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit, which may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminaemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusion of albumin. After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity and associated with decreasing serum albumin levels. Nutrition support cannot fully prevent, but slows down, this chain of events, especially when combined with physical exercise.

### Impact of serum albumin levels and body mass index on outcomes of open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in Korean population [^117Wn4Zw]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although obese patients seem to be susceptible to chronic diseases, obesity paradox has been observed in the field of vascular surgery, in which many previous studies have reported that overweight patients have good postoperative outcomes and underweight patients have poor postoperative outcomes. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) and serum albumin levels, which are evaluated as indicators of nutritional status, on outcomes of open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.

Methods

We reviewed the vascular surgery database of a single tertiary referral center for all patients who underwent open AAA repair due to degenerative etiology from 1996 to 2021. To analyze the effect of BMI, patients were classified into 4 groups according to the Asian-Pacific classification of BMI: underweight (UW) (< 18.5 kg/m 2), normal weight (NW) (18.5–22.9 kg/m 2), overweight (OW) (23–24.9 kg/m 2), and obese (OB) (≥ 25 kg/m 2). The χ 2, Fisher's exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare demographics, comorbidities, radiologic findings, surgical details, and 1-year mortality rates between the 4 groups. We also compared the preoperative serum albumin levels of each group to assess nutritional status indirectly. Cox's proportional hazards model was performed to determine factors associated with mortality. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed, and the differences were analyzed by a log-rank test. We did not perform an analysis for 30-day mortality because cases of 30-day mortality in UW patients were rare due to the unbalanced distribution of the number of patients in the 4 groups.

Results

Among a total of 678 patients, 22 were classified as UW (3.2%), 200 as NW (29.5%), 183 as OW (27.1%), and 273 as OB (40.1%). The median age was 70 (64–75) years and 577 of 678 (85.1%) patients were male gender. Higher serum albumin level was associated with decreased 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.63; P = 0.001). UW patients had a higher 1-year mortality rate than NW patients (HR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.02–13.18; P = 0.046). OB patients had a lower overall mortality rate than NW patients (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53–1; P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Low BMI (< 18.5 kg/m 2) and low serum albumin level were associated with poor 1-year survival after elective open AAA repair. These patients also need more careful preoperative intervention, like weight gain or nutritional support, for better outcomes. The obesity paradox existed in our study; high BMI (≥ 25 kg/m 2) was associated with better overall survival after elective open AAA repair.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^112pWRHm]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

ASPEN position on visceral proteins — executive summary states that serum albumin and prealbumin are not components of currently accepted definitions of malnutrition, and that serum albumin and prealbumin do not serve as valid proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers. It adds that the serum concentrations of albumin and prealbumin decline in the presence of inflammation, regardless of underlying nutrition status, and that serum albumin and prealbumin declines must be recognized as inflammatory markers associated with "nutrition risk" in the context of nutrition assessment rather than with malnutrition per se, with nutrition risk broadly defined as the risk of developing malnutrition and/or poor clinical outcomes if nutrition support is not provided. It further notes that the role of serum albumin and prealbumin in monitoring delivery and efficacy of nutrition support remains undefined and that their normalization may indicate the resolution of inflammation, the reduction of nutrition risk, a transition to anabolism, or potentially lower calorie and protein requirements.

### Inflammation markers and incident venous thromboembolism: the REasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke (REGARDS) cohort [^112TQCpN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammation biomarkers are associated with the venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factors obesity and age; however, the relationships of inflammation with VTE risk remain controversial.

Objectives

To examine associations of four inflammation biomarkers, i.e. C-reactive protein (CRP), serum albumin, white blood cell (WBC) count, and platelet count (PLTC), with incident VTE, and to determine whether they mediate the association of age or obesity with VTE.

Patients/Methods

Hazards models adjusted for VTE risk factors were used to calculate the prospective association of each biomarker with incident VTE in 30,239 participants of the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Mediation of the associations of obesity and age with VTE were examined by bootstrapping. Over a period of 4.6 years, there were 268 incident VTE events. After adjustment for VTE risk factors, the hazard ratios (HRs) were 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–1.43) per standard deviation (SD) higher log-CRP and 1.25 (95% CI 1.06–1.48) per SD lower albumin; there were no associations for WBC count or PLTC. The association of body mass index (BMI), but not age, with VTE was partially mediated by CRP and albumin. In risk factor-adjusted models, the percentage attenuations of the BMI HR for VTE after introduction of CRP or albumin into the models were 15.4% (95% CI 7.7–33.3%) and 41.0% (95% CI 12.8–79.5%), respectively.

Conclusion

Higher CRP levels and lower serum albumin levels were associated with increased VTE risk, and statistically mediated part of the association of BMI with VTE. These data suggest that inflammation may be a potential mechanism underlying the relationship between obesity and VTE risk.

### Associations of bariatric interventions with micronutrient and endocrine disturbances [^114SvXon]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Global Nutrition Status

We assessed serum albumin as a marker for global nutrition status, as macronutrient deficiency could potentially mediate or exacerbate micronutrient deficiencies. A total of 595 patients contributed observations to the analyses of serum albumin (eFigure 11 in the Supplement). We did not observe any clinically significant difference in albumin levels between the LSG and OAGB or LRYGB groups that could otherwise confound subsequent comparisons of micronutrient levels between surgical procedures (mean difference, 0.06 [95% CI, −0.01 to 0.13] g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]; p = 0.09). Likewise, we also compared percentage of total weight lost between LSG vs OAGB or LRYGB groups and found no difference in percentage of total weight lost during follow-up (mean difference, 0% [95% CI, −3.48% to 3.48%]; P > .99) (eFigure 12 in the Supplement).

Additional detailed results regarding the trajectories of all micronutrients and metabolic parameters, as well as sensitivity analyses using the raw (ie, nonimputed) data without propensity score weighting, are reported in the eAppendix in the Supplement.

### Hypoadiponectinemia and the presence of metabolic syndrome in patients with chronic kidney disease: results from the KNOW-CKD study [^115pWmyV]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, the present analysis indicates that adiponectin level was independently associated with the risk of metabolic syndrome in chronic kidney disease patients after adjustment for confounding factors including eGFR and UACR. Adiponectin is secreted from visceral fat. Therefore, a strong relationship between adiponectin level and metabolic components including triglycerides, HDL-C, and waist measurements might overwhelm the association with renal function. In particular, waist enlargement is the second-most common metabolic syndrome component, followed by glucose. In this analysis, the relationship between adiponectin level and the risk of metabolic syndrome would mostly be influenced by the prevalence of larger-waist subjects. In obese subjects, adiponectin levels were lower despite the fact that adipose tissue is its source. In addition, adiponectin level was demonstrated to be lower in body weight reduction subjects. Waist circumference is not only a simple indicator of obesity but is also related to non-traditional risk factors such as inflammation. The strong relationship between metabolic derangements such as waist circumference or hypertriglyceridemia and adiponectin level suggests that these metabolic factors are overwhelming the association between adiponectin level and low eGFR or albuminuria in patients with chronic kidney disease.

In the end, we found several results. First, serum albumin levels were significantly and independently associated with adiponectin levels in our analysis. In fact, this clear finding has already been reported in several previous investigations, and the mechanistic linkage have postulated through protein-energy wasting syndrome (PEWS), which is the chief contributor to adverse clinical outcomes in uremic patients. Given that serum albumin levels have been regarded as major markers of either malnutrition or PEWS, the inverse relationship between serum albumin and circulating adiponectin concentrations might be in line with our findings. Second, low hemoglobin levels were independently associated with high adiponectin levels, and these findings have also been reported in several previous investigations. It remains uncertain why low hemoglobin concentrations are independently associated with high circulating adiponectin levels. One plausible explanation is the increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), which results from anemia-induced tissue hypoxia. A recent experimental study clearly indicated that HIF-1 activation with a variety of stimuli significantly increases adiponectin expression. Another suggestion is that circulating adiponectin would be chiefly secreted from bone marrow fat, with an inverse correlation between fat mass and circulating adiponectin levels. Considering that marrow adipocyte is a negative regulator of hematopoiesis, we would assume an independent relationship between circulating adiponectin and hemoglobin levels.

### Association between serum albumin to creatinine ratio and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a longitudinal cohort study in non-obese Chinese individuals [^1137qRku]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our longitudinal cohort investigation, we examined how sACR relates to NAFLD risk among non-obese subjects with normal LDL-c levels. Our analysis revealed an inverse relationship between sACR values and subsequent NAFLD development. Each incremental unit of sACR corresponded to a 3.3% decreased likelihood of NAFLD occurrence (HR = 0.967, 95%CI: 0.963–0.972). Notably, this relationship displayed non-linearity characterized by a distinct inflection point, beyond which the association patterns differed significantly. Further stratified examination indicated that this protective correlation was particularly evident among participants with HDL-c < 1mmol/L (HR = 0.942, 95%CI: 0.932–0.969). The protective correlation demonstrated consistency across multiple sensitivity analyses, reinforcing the potential significance of sACR as a protective indicator against NAFLD development.

Laboratory Values

Laboratory values measured are displayed in Table S2. For serum albumin level, pre–serum albumin level, C‐reactive protein, and creatinine, no statistically significant differences were observed across time. However, there was a trend toward lower total circulating protein and a lower white blood cell count in the experimental group on days 6 and 7. There was an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase across time in the control group (P < .05 on days 4–7). Serum carbon dioxide concentrations were higher in the control group (P < .05 on days 2 and 4–7), and serum bicarbonate concentrations were higher in the control group on days 3–7 (P < .05 on days 5 and 7). There was no statistical difference in ketone bodies detected in blood (mean rates 0.15 ± 0.46 and 0.26 ± 0.53 in the control and the experimental groups, respectively; p = 0.36). However, a small statistically significant increase in urinary ketones was observed in the experimental group when compared with the controls (mean rates 0.41 ± 0.74 and 0.08 ± 0.27, respectively; p = 0.012).

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: nutrition screening, assessment, and intervention in adults [^114uBeWh]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Medium credibility.

Adult malnutrition definitions and inflammatory context — diagnoses and biomarker interpretation are described as follows: diagnoses include "(1) starvation-related malnutrition, which is chronic starvation without inflammation, (2) chronic disease–related malnutrition, where inflammation is chronic and of mild to moderate degree, and (3) acute disease or injury–related malnutrition, where inflammation is acute and severe", and "Inflammation and related compensatory mechanisms associated with disease or injury may cause anorexia and alterations in body composition and stress metabolism". For laboratory markers, "experts have advised that albumin and prealbumin not be used in isolation to assess nutrition status because they are fundamentally markers of inflammatory metabolism", while "Positive acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein are also potent predictors of morbidity and mortality and are elevated in the presence of inflammation".

### Inflammation and biochemical features of bariatric candidates: does gender matter? [^112vBnZx]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Accumulated fat is an accepted trigger of inflammation and metabolic syndrome but specific biochemical associations in males and females are still debated. In a prospective study, multiple variables were analyzed to search for gender-related correlations.

Methods

Bariatric candidates (n = 94) were consecutively investigated. Age was 34.9 ± 10.4 years (68.1% females) and body mass index (BMI) was 40.8 ± 4.6 kg/m(2). Methods included anthropometrics, inflammatory indices (C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), ferritin) and general biochemical profile.

Results

Ferritin, but not CRP or WBC, was substantially more elevated in males. Serum albumin, uric acid, creatinine, and liver enzymes AST and ALT were also higher in men. Even after BMI was adjusted, all differences remained significant, and several, notably ferritin, withstood waist circumference control. Ferritin and CRP correlated with anthropometrics, glucose-related measurements, and liver enzymes, whereas WBC was only associated with triglycerides in females.

Conclusions

(1) Males displayed more severe inflammation according to ferritin profile, and also more signs of liver derangement; (2) all differences continued after BMI discrepancies were adjusted for, and ferritin was significant also after control of waist girth; (3) in both genders inflammatory markers often correlated with different anthropometrics, liver enzymes, and markers of glucose homeostasis; and (4) inflammatory and biochemical gender-related dissimilarities might have prognostic implications for cardiovascular risk and other comorbidities, and deserve additional studies.

### Advanced lung cancer inflammation index: a key predictor of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis severity [^113hPQ3i]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The effect of ALI on MASLD may stem from the involvement of multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, including lipid metabolism disorders, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response. ALI, a composite index, integrates BMI, albumin levels, and NLR, effectively reflecting the patient's systemic inflammation level and nutritional metabolism. Obesity triggers excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in the body, leading to abnormal release of free fatty acids due to disordered lipid metabolism. These free fatty acids are transported to the liver through the circulatory system, resulting in fat accumulation in the liver and promoting the progression of MASLD. Excessive fat accumulation induces oxidative stress in the liver which triggers an inflammatory response and eventually leads to liver fibrosis. Albumin is a major protein synthesized in the liver that reflects hepatic cell damage and apoptosis. Its levels are closely associated with liver function and metabolic status. Higher neutrophil counts serve as markers for persistent destructive inflammation processes while lower lymphocyte counts indicate relatively deficient immune regulation and impaired immunity. Albumin, a key protein synthesized in the liver, serves as an indicator of hepatocyte damage and apoptosis. It is closely linked to liver function and nutritional status. A higher neutrophil count is a marker of a persistent, destructive, and non-specific inflammatory process, while a lower lymphocyte count indicates relative immunodeficiency and compromised immunity. The NLR combines neutrophil and lymphocyte counts to provide a comprehensive assessment of the body's immune status and inflammatory response. NLR is considered an independent predictor of major morbidity, mortality, and long-term survival in MASLD-related liver fibrosis.

### Obesity as a potential predictor of disease severity in young COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study [^116aALxF]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to explore the indicators for severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in young patients between the ages of 18 and 40 years.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 65 consecutively admitted patients with COVID-19 who were between 18 and 40 years old in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. Among them, 53 were moderate cases, and 12 were severe or critical cases. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment data were collected. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to explore risk factors.

Results

The patients with severe/critical cases had obviously higher BMI (average 29.23 vs. 22.79 kg/m 2) and lower liver computed tomography value (average 50.00 vs. 65.00 mU) than the group of moderate cases. The patients with severe/critical cases had higher fasting glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine compared with patients with moderate cases (all P < 0.01). More severe/critical cases (58.33% vs. 1.92%) had positive urine protein levels. The severe/critical cases also experienced a significant process of serum albumin decline. Logistic regression analysis showed that male sex, high BMI (especially obesity), elevated fasting blood glucose, and urinary protein positivity were all risk factors for young patients with severe COVID-19.

Conclusions

Obesity is an important predictor of COVID-19 severity in young patients. The main mechanism is related to damage of the liver and kidney.

### Small fragments of hyaluronan are increased in individuals with obesity and contribute to low-grade inflammation through TLR-mediated activation of innate immune cells [^114N8mjs]. International Journal of Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient characteristics and markers of systemic inflammation

Individuals included in the study were categorized according to their body mass index (BMI, Kg/m 2) in non-obese (CT, BMI < 29.9) and obese (OB, BMI > 29.9) groups. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters collected prior to laparoscopic surgery are shown in Table 1. Elevated plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-8, and IL-7 confirmed the existence of an inflammatory state in individuals with obesity (Fig. 1A and Table 2). Importantly, a strong positive association was found between BMI and circulating levels of most significantly differentiated pro-inflammatory cytokines namely IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8, and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ra and IL-10 (Supplementary Table 2). Systemic inflammation was associated with increased numbers of circulating monocytes (Fig. 1B) and marked signs of leukocyte activation as shown in Fig. 1C. Mostly in freshly isolated PBMC from individuals with obesity which showed significantly higher expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, MCP-1, IL-8, and IL-6) as compared to control subjects (Fig. 1C). PMN from OB exhibited up-regulated levels of IL-1β with no changes on MCP-1 and IL-8 when compared to CT.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the management of obesity in persons living with kidney diseases [^1179w9Fh]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Post–metabolic/bariatric surgery kidney monitoring and risks emphasize serial laboratory assessment and targeted surveillance. Kidney function and health can be evaluated by monitoring the serum creatinine level and urine protein-creatinine ratio/urine albumin-creatinine ratio over time, and timed urine collections may provide more reliable assessments if done correctly. Early postoperative monitoring is designed to minimize patient risk by watching for peri-operative complications, adjusting medications, and avoiding risks of acute kidney injury (AKI), and longer-term assessment for general and kidney-specific risks is recommended. Because risk of oxalate nephropathy is higher in persons undergoing intestinal bypass, nonbypass procedures may be preferred for transplant-eligible candidates to prevent kidney oxalate deposition, and close monitoring for the risk of malnutrition is recommended for all populations with kidney diseases, especially in those with advanced disease or on dialysis.

### Combining hbAand glycated albumin improves detection of dysglycaemia in mixed-ancestry South Africans [^111KaivE]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The diverging association of HbA 1c and GA with BMI, which was apparent in our population, has been described in previous studies, with the negative association of GA with BMI attributed to increased albumin catabolism from obesity-related chronic inflammation, and defective insulin secretion and subsequent post-prandial hyperglycemia. In short, if obesity-induced inflammation affects GA levels for reasons other than degree of glycemia, GA cannot be used to assess glycemia in the obese.

Our cohort was characterized by the availability of the full range of the BMI distribution from 15 to 74 kg/m 2 (Figure 1, Panel A), allowing a comprehensive assessment of the relationships of BMI with HbA 1c and GA. Variable strengths of those relationships have been reported in existing studies. One such study has for instance reported a one kg/m 2 higher BMI to be associated with a 0.13% decrease in GA, which is compatible with the significant positive correlation found in our sample.

HbA 1c has been promoted as biomarkers for glucose tolerance status classification for over a decade. However, studies on the performance of HbA 1c in African populations have been inconsistent. This has been ascribed at least in part to the high prevalence in the African setting of interfering factors/conditions that can affect the diagnostic utility of HbA 1c. These factors include among others ethnic differences in HbA 1c levels, the high burden of infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis, anemia of various etiologies, and hemoglobin variants. One recent systematic reviewhas concluded that the commonly advocated threshold for diabetes of ≥ 6.5%, HbA 1c will substantially misclassified the status of many African people for dysglycaemia, while HbA 1c > 6.0% was associated with the highest sensitivity for OGTT-diagnosed diabetes mellitus.

### Morbid obesity and inflammation: a prospective study after adjustable gastric banding surgery [^1156jwmR]. Obesity Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory status underlying obesity seems to be implicated in several aspects of metabolic syndrome.

Objective

This study aimed to investigate the association between weight loss achieved by laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) surgery, chronic inflammatory markers, and nutritional state.

Methods

Thirty-two morbid obese females were enrolled in the study and evaluated at baseline, 1 and 18 months after LAGB surgery. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, total proteins, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, ferritin, and transferrin soluble receptor were evaluated. In addition, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting glucose were also evaluated.

Results

In average, patients presented 18.7% and 63.2% excess body weight loss 1 and 18 months after LAGB, respectively (p < 0.01). CRP and total cholesterol mean levels were elevated (1.03 ± 1.11 mg dL(-1) and 2.02 ± 0.41 g L(-1)) at the presurgery study. CRP mean levels were significantly reduced when compared to reference range (p < 0.01) 18 months after the LAGB surgery. Prealbumin as well as serum total protein mean levels decreased 1 month after surgery (p < 0.01) and values returned to normal at 18 months after surgery. Albumin mean levels showed an increase during the postsurgery evaluations. Serum IgA and IgM concentrations were significantly increased at 1 month after surgery compared to baseline (p < 0.01, both cases).

Conclusions

Our results indicate that amelioration of inflammatory markers after LAGB does not seem to negatively impact nutritional status following weight reduction surgery. However, careful attention should be driven to serum IgA. Adequacy of nutritional intake and complete serial laboratory measurements should be always included in the required life-long follow-up of patients surgically treated for morbid obesity.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^111asfkm]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

The principles described above with regard to the risk of treatment of patients that are already subject to (especially infectious) inflammation, also apply in medical oncology. Hypoalbuminemia often proves to be a strong independent risk factor for failure of chemotherapy and for mortality. 138, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146

The strong connection between inflammation and plasma albumin levels will generally make the trend of these levels a suitable instrument to assess improvement or deterioration of the disease process. We closely followed up serum albumin levels in a substantial number of patients with abdominal catastrophe in which damage control was achieved, but at the expense of open wounds, fistulas, or temporary stomata. This led to the observation that a rise of serum albumin of a few g/L in the course of a week invariably was associated with a negative fluid balance, body weight loss, and clinical improvement, whereas a drop in serum albumin levels was associated with opposite findings. This led to the practice of postponing surgical reintervention at least 6–12 weeks after damage control, when inflammatory activity had significantly subsided and the clinical condition improved, as reflected by the clinical state and increasing serum albumin levels. 100, 139

Participant characteristics

The baseline characteristics and laboratory measurements of the participants are presented in table 1. Patients with obesity with, and without T2DM, had metabolically unfavorable laboratory findings compared with the HV. Patients with obesity and T2DM were older on average than the other two groups. The sex ratio and eGFR did not significantly differ between groups. Compared with patients with obesity, patients with obesity and T2DM had higher total cholesterol, glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), urinary protein and urinary albumin levels. However, BMI did not differ between the two obese groups.

Patients with obesity with T2DM had higher glucose, HbA1c, urinary protein and urinary albumin levels at baseline compared with those without T2DM. The mean BMI was reduced from 40.64 to 31.04 kg/m 2, and the mean body weight reduced from 116.23 to 89.43 kg in all patients with obesity 6 months after bariatric surgery. In addition, patients with obesity with T2DM showed significantly reduced fasting glucose levels, HbA1c and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels 6 months after surgery compared with the baseline values. By contrast, there was no change in the fasting glucose or HbA1c levels of the patients with obesity without diabetes after surgery. There was also a significant reduction in the 24 hours urinary protein and urinary albumin levels in patients with obesity with T2DM. However, the eGFR was not affected by surgery in either of the patient groups.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with critical illness, ASPEN 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that critically ill patients with obesity experience more complications than patients with optimal BMI levels. Obtain nutritional assessment and develop a nutrition support plan within 48 hours of ICU admission.

### The correlates of urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) in a high risk Australian aboriginal community [^113LSAUC]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this high risk Aboriginal population, SBP, serum albumin (inverse association), uric acid, CRP, diabetes were significantly associated with albuminuria (p value for GGT was 0.054).

SBP, serum albumin, CRP were significantly associated with microalbuminuria (p value for uric acid was 0.068) while additional risk factors including total cholesterol, ALT, cystatin C and diabetes were significantly associated with overt albuminuria. The shared and the different risk factors for these conditions, traditionally considered to be stages of albuminuria over a continuum, suggest that microalbuminuria and overt albuminuria might reflect different as well as shared phenomena. Different or inconsistent associations of albuminuria with abdominal obesity have been reported in some other studies but no significant evidence in this study. Macroalbuminuria was independently associated with hypertension, diabetes and abdominal obesity in Central Australian Aboriginal communities.

A close link between high blood pressure and microalbuminuria has been reported by others. In the relationship, higher blood pressure might cause microalbuminuria by increasing glomerular filtration pressure and subsequent renal damage, and adequate control of SBP was associated with low risk for development of microalbuminuria. In addition, the magnitude of urinary albumin excretion determines the severity of BP elevation, and there exist heritability and genetic associations between increased urinary albumin excretion and BP in some ethnic groups. CRP, a member of the class of acute phase reactants, is regarded as a sensitive marker of inflammation and was reported as an important contributor to albuminuria (but not an independent predictor for overt albuminuria) in this study. CRP levels are affected significantly by an individual's genetic makeup and life style. People who smoke, have elevated BP, who are overweight or have less physical activity, tend to have higher level of CRP. CRP has been reported to be a novel cardiovascular risk factor, and we have reported that it is independently associated with the development of diabetes in this Aboriginal cohort. A significant association between CRP level and microabuminuria has also been reported in some other epidemiological studies. The relationship might indicate that chronic inflammation is a potential mediator between microalbuminuria and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in severely obese adolescents [^117B7EaP]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical and laboratory features of obesity associated proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

Study Design

The patients were seen over a 12-year period at two large children's hospitals. Renal biopsies, performed for the diagnosis of unexplained heavy proteinuria and prepared for light, immunofluorescent, and electron microscopy, were read independently by two pediatric pathologists. Blood pressure, body mass index, serum levels of creatinine, albumin, and cholesterol, and 24-hour urinary protein were measured.

Results

Seven African American adolescents were identified with obesity-associated proteinuria, which was characterized by severe obesity (120 ± 30 kg), markedly elevated body mass index (46 ± 11), mild hypertension (134/74 ± 10/18 mm Hg), slightly low to normal serum albumin levels (3.6 ± 0.2 g/dL), moderately elevated serum cholesterol levels (196 ± 60 mg/dL), and elevated 24-hour protein excretion (3.1 ± 1.3 g/dL). Calculated creatinine clearance was normal in 6 patients and decreased in one. Typical renal histologic features included glomerular hypertrophy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, increased mesangial matrix and cellularity, relative preservation of foot process morphology, and absence of evidence of inflammatory or immune-mediated pathogenesis. One patient showed a dramatic reduction in proteinuria in response to weight reduction. Three patients who were given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had reduced urinary protein losses from 2.9 g to 0.7 g per day. One patient developed end-stage renal disease.

Conclusion

Obese adolescents should be monitored for proteinuria, which has distinct clinical and pathologic features and may be associated with significant renal sequelae. Such proteinuria may respond to weight reduction and/or treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

### Joint associations of obesity and estimated GFR with clinical outcomes: a population-based cohort study [^115AtsMm]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

We found that obesity also accentuates the known association between lower eGFR and the likelihood of placement in a long-term care facility, perhaps because obesity may further impede activities of daily living among people who already have reduced functional status due to chronic illness. The lack of an association between obesity and the adjusted risk of myocardial infarction among people with reduced eGFR (in contrast to the significant association observed among those with eGFR > 60 mL/min*1.73m 2) may be attributable to confounding by inflammation among the subset of non-obese people with evidence of wasting and/or malnutrition, which have been associated with a higher risk of vascular disease and other adverse outcomes. However, since we did not have data on inflammation, wasting or malnutrition, this suggestion is speculative.

Previous studies have consistently shown that obesity modifies the association between eGFR and the risk of death but generally did not examine how obesity interacts with albuminuria to influence the likelihood of death or other clinical outcomes. For example, prior reports indicate that obesity is associated with excess mortality in people with apparently normal kidney function, and in those with mild to moderate reductions in eGFR. Lu et al's study of 453,946 US Veterans demonstrated a significantly higher adjusted risk of death among participants with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 but only among those with eGFR > 30 mL/min*1.73m 2. Below this level of eGFR, the adjusted risk of death among participants with and without obesity did not significantly differ. Differences between our study and previous work may relate to our use of a cohort drawn from the general population as compared to a subset thereof (e.g. U. S Veterans; Israeli adolescents), our ability to adjust for both eGFR and albuminuria, the comprehensive panel of comorbidities for which we adjusted, or greater statistical power due to the large sample size of the current cohort.

Results

Clinical characteristics of the study population

The baseline characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1. Patients with obesity had higher BMI, systolic blood pressure, and white blood cell counts, as well as higher levels of glucose, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglyceride, and urinary albumin and lower high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol than healthy volunteers. Patients with obesity and diabetes were older and had higher serum glucose levels than patients with obesity but without diabetes.

### Relationship between obesity and B-type natriuretic peptide levels… [^112vcG3T]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

As seen in Table 1, patients who were overweight or obese were younger and had more frequent edema on examination but were equally as likely to have CHF vs noncardiac sources of dyspnea. The data in Table 1 also demonstrate that body weight as recorded in the database, not height, differed across the BMI categories and hence was the principal determinant of BMI. The mean and median BNP levels according to BMI for the study population are also given in Table 1. A nearly 3-fold difference was seen in mean BNP values at the extremes of the BMI groupings. This finding is in keeping with the observation that patients with CHF and a smaller body size have a greater degree of cardiac cachexia and higher mortality rates. 18–21 Conversely, in individuals without CHF, lower levels of BNP tended to occur in participants with larger BMI values.

Our multivariate analysis, in a very small subset, found that there was no independent relationship between BMI and BNP when we accounted for the known factors affecting BNP, such as sex; age-derived variables, including renal function; and CHF severity. There was an approximate 1: 1 ratio of African Americans to whites in the BMI categories, but this ratio increased to almost 2: 1 in the highest BMI categories. However, according to the multivariate analysis, African American race was not statistically significantly related to the measured BNP value. Our findings suggest that much of the inverse relationship between BMI and BNP can be explained by confounding, particularly by age in individuals without CHF and by the severity of disease in those with CHF. These observations are in agreement with those from previous studies14, 23 that demonstrated that BNP values are lower in patients who are younger and less ill.

In conclusion, high levels of BNP in patients with low body weights and, likely, advanced CHF accounted for the inverse relationship between BNP levels and BMI. There does not seem to be an independent relationship between measures of body weight or size and BNP when all other factors are taken into account. Clinicians should be wary of the univariate relationship between BMI and BNP level that we have demonstrated in the present study.

### Hypoalbuminemia, body mass index, and weight loss as predictors of outcomes in head and neck cancer… [^115huYXB]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract e18027 Background: Malnutrition is a major complication of head and neck cancer and has pertinent implications on survival. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 320 patients with head and neck cancer from a tertiary hospital in Western Australia from 2013
- 2021. Weight and albumin were collected from different timepoints in the patient's journey, including at diagnosis and end of treatment. Treatments received, recurrences and survival data were also collected. Initial univariate analyses were performed using Chi squares. At diagnosis, 12% of patients were hypoalbuminemic, 75% had normal albumin, and albumin was unknown in 13%. Hypoalbuminemia at diagnosis strongly correlated with lower survival compared with patients with normal albumin with 1 year OS 35% vs 82%. Patients with normal albumin at diagnosis had higher disease-free survival compared to hypoalbuminemic patients.

By the end of treatment, 22% of patients were hypoalbuminemic, 48% had normal albumin, and 30% were unknown. Hypoalbuminemia at end of treatment was also prognostic, with 1YS 72% vs 89% and 2YS 52% vs 72% when compared to patients with normal albumin. Of patients who were treated with curative intent, there was no significant difference in the rate of relapse. Percentage body weight loss of > 20% was associated with worse survival with 65% mortality during the study period compared with 35% in patients who lost ≤ 20% body weight. 1YS was 71% in patients who lost > 20% body weight compared to 86%, although this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Hypoalbuminemia and low BMI at diagnosis and end of treatment, in addition to % body weight loss of > 20% were all associated with worse survival in head and neck cancer patients.

### Even low levels of albumin in urine tied to worsened kidney disease… [^112qAEsd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

For decades, researchers characterized normal albuminuria as a urine albumin-creatinine ratio of less than 30 mg/g. That has led some clinicians to believe that patients with lower ratios don't need additional treatment. But a new study in Annals of Internal Medicine challenges that assumption by showing that even low levels of albuminuria are a risk factor for kidney failure in people with chronic kidney disease. People with urine albumin-creatinine ratios of 15 mg/g or more had about a 5% to 6% greater absolute risk of kidney failure than those who had ratios of 5 to less than 15 mg/g and of 0 to 5 mg/g, respectively. The findings are based on data from more than 1600 participants across 7 US centers. Harris E. Even Low Levels of Albumin in Urine Tied to Worsened Kidney Disease. JAMA. 2024;

### Hypoalbuminemia in patients with multiple myeloma… [^114VUreU]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Clinical data of 65 patients with myeloma were analyzed to identify factors associated with hypoalbuminemia. The serum albumin level was not affected by patient age and gender, type of myeloma, and the occurrence of Bence Jones protein, lytic bone lesions, or hypercalcemia, and it was not related to changes in body weight or in liver and renal function. The albumin level, lower in patients with proteinuria, was unrelated to severity of proteinuria. Albumin level correlated significantly with the monoclonal IgG level, hemoglobin concentration, clinical stage of disease, and estimated body tumor burden. Further analysis indicated the disease stage or the tumor burden as the dominant factor in determining albumin level. An albumin level of 29. 0 g/L or less identified unequivocally advanced disease.

Practically all patients with stage III myeloma had a serum albumin level of 37. 0 g/L or less. Thus, hypoalbuminemia is primarily related to the extent of myeloma proliferation and is therefore of diagnostic and prognostic importance.
