## Question

What anticoagulation is recommended for a fib?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what anticoagulation is recommended for atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about risk stratification for thromboembolism using CHA2DS2-VASc. Then, I should verify the treatment thresholds and whether anticoagulation is indicated. Next, I will compare anticoagulant options, especially DOACs versus warfarin, and check exceptions like mechanical valves or mitral stenosis. After that, I need to review dosing principles, renal and hepatic considerations, and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I should consider special scenarios such as cardioversion, ablation, device-detected AF, and peri-procedural management, and close with monitoring and shared decision-making recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the risk stratification framework. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is the standard tool to estimate annual stroke risk in nonvalvular AF, with 2 points for age ≥ 75 and prior stroke/TIA, and 1 point each for congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease, age 65–74, and female sex, and it applies regardless of AF pattern (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent) [^9c2efa35] [^21540faf].

> I need to check the treatment thresholds. Anticoagulation is recommended when the estimated annual thromboembolic risk is ≥ 2%, which corresponds to CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, and it is reasonable to consider anticoagulation when risk is ≥ 1% but < 2% (CHA2DS2-VASc 1 in men or 2 in women), using shared decision-making to weigh benefits and bleeding risk [^9c2efa35] [^974e97a2] [^4d043133].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about low-risk patients. For men with CHA2DS2-VASc 0 or women with 1 (excluding female sex), no antithrombotic therapy is recommended because the stroke risk is low and the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation is unfavorable, so I should avoid overtreatment in this group [^e2f6d6ec] [^5c9080f1].

> Next, I should review agent selection. In patients without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, DOACs are preferred over warfarin because they reduce stroke, systemic embolism, and intracranial hemorrhage and improve survival; warfarin remains indicated for mechanical valves or rheumatic mitral stenosis, with a target INR of 2.0–3.0 and attention to time in therapeutic range [^9c2efa35] [^5536d21a] [^1c16a6e6].

> Wait, let me verify the DOAC options and dosing principles. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban are all acceptable choices; selection should be individualized based on renal function, hepatic function, drug interactions, and patient preference, and I should avoid non–evidence-based reduced doses because underdosing is associated with worse adherence and worse outcomes, so I need to ensure FDA-labeled dosing is used [^9c2efa35] [^53adea19] [^2bbe2bfd].

> I will now examine renal and hepatic considerations. DOACs require dose adjustment in chronic kidney disease and are generally avoided in advanced kidney disease or dialysis, whereas warfarin is not renally cleared but needs close INR monitoring; I should confirm creatinine clearance and liver enzymes before initiating and recheck at least annually, and I should remember that dabigatran is contraindicated with mechanical valves [^5c9080f1] [^310cf6d5].

> Let me consider special scenarios, starting with cardioversion. For AF duration ≥ 48 hours or unknown, I should ensure 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or perform transesophageal echocardiography to exclude thrombus before elective cardioversion, and continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion regardless of baseline stroke risk, reassessing long-term therapy thereafter [^026d338c] [^7a3ec441].

> For catheter ablation, I should confirm that uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended, with warfarin targeting INR 2.0–3.0 or DOACs continued per protocol, to minimize thromboembolic risk during the procedure [^c6d07061].

> But wait, what about device-detected AF. I need to check the duration thresholds: for episodes ≥ 24 hours with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2, consider anticoagulation within shared decision-making; for episodes 5–24 minutes with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 3, consider anticoagulation; for episodes < 5 minutes, do not initiate anticoagulation solely for that finding, given evolving evidence and uncertainty [^4f30d625] [^13990253] [^275cfd2c].

> I should double-check peri-procedural management. When uninterrupted anticoagulation is not feasible, interrupt DOACs without bridging based on agent, renal function, and procedure bleeding risk, and resume 1 day after low-risk procedures and 2–3 days after high-risk procedures; avoid routine bridging except in mechanical valves or recent stroke/TIA, and avoid bridging with warfarin in most cases [^9b79f7dc] [^a5d512db].

> Next, I should review bleeding risk assessment. HAS-BLED helps identify modifiable bleeding risks and should not be used in isolation to deny anticoagulation; instead, I should correct reversible risks (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, labile INR, concomitant NSAIDs, alcohol excess) and monitor high-risk patients more closely, recognizing that high bleeding risk often coexists with high stroke risk [^a1d26c2c] [^cae7c5d3] [^db47f4bb].

> Let me verify monitoring and follow-up. For warfarin, check INR frequently during initiation and at least monthly when stable, aiming for TTR > 70%; for DOACs, reassess renal and hepatic function at least annually and at clinically meaningful changes, and periodically reassess stroke and bleeding risks to ensure ongoing net benefit and appropriate dosing [^21540faf] [^00ede67d].

> I should confirm that aspirin is not an alternative for stroke prevention in AF. Aspirin monotherapy or aspirin plus clopidogrel should not be used as substitutes for anticoagulation in patients who are candidates for oral anticoagulation, given inferior efficacy and persistent bleeding risk [^9c2efa35].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making is emphasized. Patient values, preferences, and clinical context should guide the choice of agent and the decision to anticoagulate in borderline-risk scenarios, and clinicians should revisit prior decisions not to anticoagulate as patient risk profiles and preferences evolve over time [^21540faf] [^702e0566].

---

For atrial fibrillation, **anticoagulation is recommended for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women** [^9c2efa35] to prevent stroke and systemic embolism, with **DOACs preferred over warfarin** unless there is moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve [^21540faf]. For patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women, anticoagulation is reasonable after shared decision-making [^974e97a2]. Aspirin is not recommended for stroke prevention in AF [^9c2efa35]. Anticoagulation should be individualized based on renal function, bleeding risk, and drug interactions, and reassessed periodically [^00ede67d].

---

## Risk stratification and indications for anticoagulation

The CHA2DS2-VASc score is the **standard tool** for stroke risk stratification in AF [^4d043133]. It assigns points for congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years (2 points), diabetes, stroke/TIA/thromboembolism (2 points), vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex [^e2f6d6ec].

| **Cha2ds2-vasc score** | **Recommended anticoagulation strategy** |
|-|-|
| 0 (men) or 1 (women) | No anticoagulation recommended [^e2f6d6ec] |
| 1 (men) or 2 (women) | Consider anticoagulation after shared decision-making [^974e97a2] |
| ≥ 2 (men) or ≥ 3 (women) | Anticoagulation strongly recommended [^9c2efa35] |

## Choice of anticoagulant therapy

### Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) are **preferred over warfarin** for most patients with nonvalvular AF because of lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage and comparable or superior efficacy in stroke prevention [^9c2efa35] [^21540faf]. They offer advantages such as fixed dosing, rapid onset/offset, and no routine laboratory monitoring [^310cf6d5].

---

### Warfarin

Warfarin remains indicated for patients with **mechanical heart valves** or **moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis** [^5c9080f1], as DOACs are contraindicated or lack sufficient evidence in these settings [^5c9080f1]. Warfarin requires INR monitoring with a target INR of 2.0–3.0 [^5536d21a], and maintaining a time in therapeutic range (TTR) > 70% is essential for efficacy and safety [^e2f6d6ec].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: DOACs require dose adjustments based on creatinine clearance, and some agents (e.g. dabigatran) are contraindicated in severe renal impairment [^310cf6d5].
- **Bleeding risk**: HAS-BLED score should be used to identify modifiable bleeding risk factors but should not be used in isolation to withhold anticoagulation [^a1d26c2c] [^cae7c5d3].
- **Drug interactions**: DOACs have fewer dietary and drug interactions compared to warfarin, but careful consideration is still required [^310cf6d5].

---

## Peri-procedural and cardioversion management

- **Uninterrupted anticoagulation**: Recommended for most procedures, including catheter ablation, to minimize thromboembolic risk [^c6d07061].
- **Cardioversion**: For AF duration ≥ 48 hours, therapeutic anticoagulation for ≥ 3 weeks or TEE-guided strategy is recommended, followed by ≥ 4 weeks of anticoagulation post-cardioversion [^026d338c] [^7a3ec441].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for **bleeding**, assess **adherence**, and reassess **stroke and bleeding risks** [^00ede67d]. Renal function should be monitored at least annually for patients on DOACs [^5c9080f1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Anticoagulation is recommended** for patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women [^9c2efa35].
- **DOACs are preferred** over warfarin for most patients with nonvalvular AF [^21540faf].
- **Warfarin is indicated** for patients with mechanical heart valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^5c9080f1].
- **Aspirin is not recommended** for stroke prevention in AF [^9c2efa35].
- **Individualized decision-making** is essential, considering renal function, bleeding risk, and patient preferences [^a73115ff].

---

Anticoagulation is a cornerstone of AF management, with **DOACs preferred for most patients** and warfarin reserved for specific valvular indications. Regular reassessment and individualized care are critical to optimize outcomes.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

### Practical management of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^a2c1d643]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation has become more complex due to the introduction of new anticoagulant agents, the number and kinds of patients requiring therapy, and the interactions of those patients in the matrix of care. The management of anticoagulation has become a "team sport" involving multiple specialties in multiple sites of care. The American College of Cardiology, through the College's Anticoagulation Initiative, convened a roundtable of experts from multiple specialties to discuss topics important to the management of patients requiring anticoagulation and to make expert recommendations on issues such as the initiation and interruption of anticoagulation, quality of anticoagulation care, management of major and minor bleeding, and treatment of special populations. The attendees continued to work toward consensus on these topics, and present the key findings of this roundtable in a state-of- the-art review focusing on the practical aspects of anticoagulation care for the patient with atrial fibrillation.

### New anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation management [^3d3aff7d]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Three new oral anticoagulants have been evaluated in large registration trials and are now available in many jurisdictions for patients with atrial fibrillation. Questions arise whether these drugs are equally effective and safe for all patients. Now when we are moving away from decades with only one orally available drug for anticoagulation there is opportunity to tailor the therapy according to patient characteristics and preferences. This review addresses the interaction of various patient characteristics with the treatment and what features can assist the physician in the choice of anticoagulant for the individual patient.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — preventing thromboembolism (Class I) states that antithrombotic therapy to prevent thromboembolism is recommended for all patients with AF, except those with low risk or contraindications (Level of Evidence: A), and the selection of the antithrombotic agent should be based upon the absolute risks of stroke and bleeding and the relative risk and benefit for a given patient (Level of Evidence: A). For patients without mechanical heart valves at high risk of stroke, chronic oral anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended in a dose adjusted to achieve the target intensity of an INR of 2.0 to 3.0, unless contraindicated, and factors associated with high risk include prior thromboembolism and rheumatic mitral stenosis (Level of Evidence: A). Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended for patients with more than 1 moderate risk factor, including age 75 y or greater, hypertension, HF, impaired LV systolic function (ejection fraction 35% or less or fractional shortening less than 25%), and diabetes mellitus (Level of Evidence: A). INR should be determined at least weekly during initiation of therapy and monthly when anticoagulation is stable (Level of Evidence: A). Aspirin, 81–325 mg daily, is recommended as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists in low-risk patients or in those with contraindications to oral anticoagulation (Level of Evidence: A). For patients with AF who have mechanical heart valves, the target intensity of anticoagulation should be based on the type of prosthesis, maintaining an INR of at least 2.5 (Level of Evidence: B). Antithrombotic therapy is recommended for patients with atrial flutter as for those with AF (Level of Evidence: C).

### Recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines on atrial fibrillation: a commentary [^14e476f1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide a commentary on the recommendations for stroke prevention from the 2012 focused update of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation and the evidence (or lack of it) supporting these recommendations. These guidelines strongly advocate a major clinical practice shift towards initially focusing on the identification of 'truly low risk' patients who do not need any antithrombotic therapy. After this initial decision-making step, effective stroke prevention - that is, oral anticoagulation therapy (whether as well-controlled adjusted dose warfarin or with one of the novel oral anticoagulants) - could be offered to patients with atrial fibrillation with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors. The 2012 focused update guideline also provides additional guidance on advances in stroke and bleeding risk assessment that are evident since publication of the 2010 guideline, as well as recommendations on the use of the novel oral anticoagulants and the left atrial appendage occlusion devices that have been increasingly used in European clinical practice over the last 2 years.

The North American Thrombosis Forum Atrial Fibrillation Action Initiative consensus document is a comprehensive yet practical briefing document focusing on stroke and bleeding risk assessment in patients with atrial fibrillation, as well as recommendations regarding anticoagulation options and management. Despite the breadth of clinical trial data and guideline recommendation updates, many clinicians continue to struggle to synthesize the disparate information available. This problem slows the uptake and utilization of updated risk prediction tools and adoption of new oral anticoagulants. This document serves as a practical and educational reference for the entire medical community involved in the care of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation thresholds in atrial fibrillation — intermediate risk: although risk stratification schemes identify patients who benefit most and least from anticoagulation, the threshold for use of anticoagulation is controversial, and opinion is particularly divided about anticoagulation for those at intermediate risk (stroke rate 3% to 5% per year); some advocate routine anticoagulation at this level, whereas others favor selective anticoagulation with weight given to bleeding risks and preferences, and the threshold of benefit at which AF patients choose anticoagulation varies, with some at intermediate risk electing anticoagulation whereas others do not.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, general indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to re-evaluate the need for and choice of stroke risk reduction therapy at periodic intervals to reassess stroke and bleeding risk, net clinical benefit, and proper dosing in patients with AF at risk for stroke.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, general indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to decide on the therapy to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF with an estimated annual risk of stroke or thromboembolic events ≥ 2% based on the risk of thromboembolism, regardless of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^08b94442]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, which is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The use of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate or high risk of stroke, estimated by established criteria, improves outcomes. However, to ensure that the benefits exceed the risks of bleeding, appropriate patient selection is essential. Vitamin K antagonism has been the mainstay of treatment; however, newer drugs with novel mechanisms are also available. These novel oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors) obviate many of warfarin's shortcomings, and they have demonstrated safety and efficacy in large randomized trials of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. However, the management of patients taking warfarin or novel agents remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations when selecting anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation. This review will discuss the rationale for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation; risk stratification for treatment; available agents; the appropriate implementation of these agents; and additional, specific clinical considerations for treatment.

### Comparing the guidelines: anticoagulation therapy to optimize stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation [^f170f6ab]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important risk factor for stroke. According to a pooled analysis of controlled clinical trials with warfarin, anticoagulation therapy reduces stroke risk by 62%. However, clinicians must decide whether the benefit of long-term anticoagulation therapy with available agents outweighs the risk of bleeding for individual patients. Guidelines issued by the American College of Chest Physicians and by the joint American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology task force recommend antithrombotic therapy to protect AF patients from stroke based on risk-stratification algorithms. Risk factors for stroke AF patients include age ≥ 75 years; hypertension; thyrotoxicosis; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; congestive heart failure; and history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism. Patients at high risk for stroke experience greater absolute benefit from anticoagulation therapy than patients at low risk. The guidelines are consistent in recommendations for high-risk patients (warfarin therapy, international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0) and low-risk patients (aspirin 325 mg), but differ for intermediate-risk patients with diabetes or heart disease. The guidelines continue to evolve, and future guidelines are likely to incorporate new clinical data, including the CHADS₂ algorithm for determining risk and the results of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management trial, the Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation study, and the Stroke Prevention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation II to V trials.

Atrial fibrillation oral anticoagulation efficacy — Meta-analysis using intention-to-treat shows adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation reduces all stroke versus placebo with a risk reduction of 62% (95% CI 48% to 72%). By on-treatment analysis excluding patients not undergoing oral anticoagulation at the time of stroke, the preventive efficacy of oral anticoagulation exceeded 80%. Among the randomized trials, 4 were placebo controlled; of the 2 that were double blinded with regard to anticoagulation, one was stopped early because of external evidence that oral anticoagulation was superior to placebo, and the other included no female subjects. In 3 trials dosing was regulated by prothrombin time ratio; 2 used INR target ranges of 2.5 to 4.0 and 2.0 to 3.0. Follow-up was generally between 1 and 2 y, with the longest 2.2 y.

### Are atrial fibrillation patients receiving warfarin in accordance with stroke risk? [^63fb240e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter provide recommendations for anticoagulation based on patients' overall risk of stroke. To determine the real-world compliance of physicians with these recommendations, we conducted a retrospective cohort study examining the utilization of warfarin in atrial fibrillation/flutter patients by stroke risk level.

Methods

Patients with a qualifying atrial fibrillation/flutter diagnosis during ≥ 18 months' continuous enrollment between January 2003 and September 2007, and with ≥ 6 months' eligibility after the first atrial fibrillation/flutter diagnosis, were identified from the US MarketScan database (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY). Warfarin use within 30 days of the first diagnosis was assessed according to stroke risk, estimated using the Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age > 75 years, Diabetes, Stroke (CHADS₂) score.

Results

Of 171,393 patients included in the analysis, 20.0% had a CHADS(2) score of 0 (low risk), 61.6% a score of 1–2 (moderate risk), and 18.4% a score of 3–6 (high risk). Warfarin, recommended for high stroke-risk patients, was given to only 42.1% of those with a CHADS(2) score of 3–6. A similar percentage of patients with moderate (43.5%) or low stroke risk (40.1%) received warfarin. Only 29.6% of high-risk, 33.3% of moderate-risk, and 34.1% of low-risk patients who were started on warfarin received uninterrupted therapy for 6 months following their initial prescription.

Conclusions

These data suggest that guideline recommendations that anticoagulation should be provided in accordance with stroke risk in atrial fibrillation patients are not routinely followed in clinical practice. The causes and clinical implications of under-utilization of anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation patients with high stroke risk warrant further study.

### Key recommendations… [^5c9080f1]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Anticoagulation is recommended for AF at a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 2 for men and 3 for women without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. The score has not been validated for mitral stenosis or mechanical valves.
- Direct oral anticoagulants are recommended over warfarin for AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. Warfarin is still recommended for mitral stenosis and mechanical valves.
- Although CHA 2DS 2-VASc scores of 0 for men and 1 for women do not require treatment, scores of 1 for men and 2 for women are indeterminate and anticoagulation may be considered by shared decision-making. Key Recommendations HIGH-QUALITY EVIDENCE Based on high-quality evidence, oral anticoagulants should be prescribed for women with AF and a CHA.

Direct oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are preferred to warfarin unless the patient has concomitant moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Based on new data, the recommended set-points for anticoagulation have been increased, and the previous recommendation to prescribe an anticoagulant for all patients with AF who have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack has been removed. For patients taking warfarin, an international normalized ratio test is recommended at least every week at the start of treatment and monthly when stable within the recommended range. Warfarin is the recommended anticoagulant for patients with AF and moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Dabigatran should be avoided in patients with AF and a mechanical heart valve.

Renal and hepatic function should be assessed before initiating direct oral anticoagulant therapy, then at least each year thereafter. Based on expert opinion, patients with AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve who are taking warfarin, but whose international normalized ratio is not being maintained in a therapeutic range, should have their treatment regimen changed to a direct oral anticogulant. Because there are no data indicating that the benefits are greater than the harms, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban should be avoided in patients with AF and ESRD or on dialysis.

### Ineligibility for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^7af7d1b4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although anticoagulation therapy markedly reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, up to 50% of these patients are deemed ineligible for anticoagulation. In this manuscript we provide a framework to assess the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation with an increased risk of bleeding. We also review recent data related to the novel oral anticoagulants targeting thrombin or factor Xa, and discuss how the introduction of these agents raises the distinction between eligibility for vitamin K antagonist therapy specifically, and eligibility for anticoagulation in general.

Conclusions

We found that the use of oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with AF newly recommended for anticoagulation under the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines did not result in a reduction in the composite risk of stroke, SE, and death; yet, it was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. These results do not support the changes to anticoagulant therapy recommended by the 2014 guidelines; however, further research is needed to evaluate the benefit/risk ratio of oral anticoagulation in this cohort with low to moderate risk.

### How I use anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^c5ef6979]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and conveys a significant risk of morbidity and mortality due to related stroke and systemic embolism. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the mainstay of thromboembolism prevention, and management of anticoagulation can be challenging. For patients without significant valvular disease, decisions around anticoagulation therapy are first based on the presence of additional stroke risk factors, as measured by the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75, diabetes, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65–74, and sex category [female]) score. Patients with increased CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores (by regional guidelines) should next be evaluated to determine if they are candidates for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) therapy. This should focus on assessment of concomitant valve disease and/or impaired renal function. In eligible patients, the cumulative data support a preference for NOACs over warfarin, as NOACs appear safer and more effective as a group. However, there are no direct, randomized comparisons between NOACs, and therefore, selecting among them can be difficult. In addition, important patient groups remain underrepresented in major clinical trials, and their management is often left to clinician judgment. Data from emerging clinical trials will help guide physicians; however, patient engagement in decisions regarding OAC management will remain vital to ensuring appropriate balance of risks and optimizing health outcomes.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: translating clinical trial data into clinical practice [^b9c82eb5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. In light of the limitations of available pharmacologic treatment options (suboptimal efficacy plus safety and tolerability issues), atrial fibrillation management should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities that could influence response to specific management approaches. The importance of adequate anticoagulation should not be overlooked. This review provides a practical guide for primary care physicians, internists, and cardiologists on current management strategies for atrial fibrillation, based on recent guidelines and current clinical data.

Atrial fibrillation — recommendations for managing anticoagulants emphasize interaction management, appropriate warfarin intensity, and avoiding off‑label DOAC dosing: For patients with AF receiving direct oral anticoagulants, optimal management of drug interactions is recommended for those on concomitant interacting drugs; for patients with AF receiving warfarin, a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 is recommended along with interaction management, consistent vitamin K intake, and routine INR monitoring to improve time in therapeutic range and minimize preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding; for patients with AF, non–evidence‑based doses of DOACs should be avoided to minimize preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding and to improve survival.

Risk-based selection of oral anticoagulation — In patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have an estimated annual risk of stroke or thromboembolic events ≥ 2%, selection of therapy to reduce the risk of stroke should be based on the risk of thromboembolism, regardless of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent (COR 1, LOE B-R). In patients with AF at risk for stroke, reevaluation of the need for and choice of stroke risk reduction therapy at periodic intervals is recommended to reassess stroke and bleeding risk, net clinical benefit, and proper dosing (COR 1, LOE B-NR).

### Patients with atrial fibrillation and CHA₂DS₂-VASc score 1: "To anticoagulate or not to anticoagulate? That is the question! " [^fc72e744]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

There is uncertainty regarding the optimal therapy for preventing thromboembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score 1. In fact, no extensive data on this topic are available, and the latest guidelines provide different recommendations. In this article, we examine current results on the use of various antithrombotic agents, including the newer oral anticoagulant agents, in those patients. Several factors must be considered and weighted in this setting and may influence the choice of the antithrombotic approach: the expected incidence of both thromboembolic stroke and bleeding complications as well as their impact in terms of morbidity and mortality, the patient's bleeding risk profile, an accurate, further stratification of the thromboembolic risk beyond the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, and socioeconomic issues.

### Analysis of oral anticoagulant dosing and adherence to therapy among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^2bbe2bfd]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is reduced dosing of direct oral anticoagulants not recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) associated with longitudinal adherence to anticoagulation treatment among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation?

Findings

In this cohort analysis of 86 919 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 10 964 (12.6%) were underdosed not according to FDA recommendations. Receiving a not-recommended dose occurred more frequently in patients with worse renal function and was associated with a lower likelihood of adherence and higher risk of anticoagulation discontinuation by 1 year.

Meaning

These findings suggest that there is a need for efforts to improve the quality of direct oral anticoagulant use and dosing.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a 5‐fold increase in stroke and thromboembolism risk. 1 Oral anticoagulation has been shown to reduce this risk by ≈60% 2; however, anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding. Although the benefits of stroke prevention outweigh the risk of bleeding in patients with moderate to high risk of stroke, 3 the benefit/risk ratio of anticoagulation in patients with low risk remains unclear. In March 2014, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) updated their guidelines for the use of anticoagulation in patients with AF, recommending oral anticoagulation therapy for patients with CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2. 3 Before 2014, only patients with CHADS₂ ≥ 2 were recommended for anticoagulation. 4 CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc are 2 validated scores that predict the risk of stroke in patients with AF: CHADS 2 score is calculated as the sum of 6 points: 1 for congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and age older than 75 years, and 2 for a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. 5 In addition to these factors, female sex, vascular disease, and age 65 to 74 years are assigned 1 point in the calculation of the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score, and age older than 75 years is assigned 2, for a possible sum of 9 points. 5

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current status and near-future directions [^3f2fca5f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke is an important part of atrial fibrillation management. However, stroke risk is not homogeneous and varies with associated morbidities and risk factors. Risk stratification schemes have been developed that categorize patients' stroke risk into classes based on a combination of risk factors. According to the calculated level of risk, guidelines recommend patients with atrial fibrillation receive antithrombotic therapy either as a vitamin K antagonist or aspirin. Despite recommendations, however, many patients with atrial fibrillation do not receive adequate thromboprophylaxis. We will discuss some of the underlying reasons, in part related to the drawbacks associated with vitamin K antagonists. These highlight the need for new anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation. The novel oral anticoagulants in development may overcome some of the limitations of vitamin K antagonists and address their underuse and safety concerns.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^68ce27f6]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — general approach to recommendations about new oral anticoagulants: The panel elected to make recommendations only for those drugs that have received regulatory approval for use in AF (ie, dabigatran), and based on RE-LY, there is evidence that dabigatran is no worse than VKA therapy with respect to nonfatal stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality in patients with nonvalvular AF. Therefore, for patients with nonrheumatic AF, whenever we recommend (or suggest) VKA therapy, we also recommend (or suggest) the use of dabigatran, and in these situations, our recommendations simply refer to oral anticoagulation. The document states, We address the specific question of whether to use dabigatran over adjusted-dose VKA therapy in section 2.1.11, and notes that RE-LY data do not directly address the use of dabigatran in patients with AF and mitral stenosis or other special situations; thus, we have not extrapolated the data from RE-LY to these clinical situations and have instead restricted those recommendations for oral anticoagulation to adjusted-dose VKA therapy, while there is direct evidence from RE-LY regarding dabigatran in patients with AF undergoing cardioversion.

### Patients and physician perspectives about oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation… [^702e0566]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Upon follow-up, 119 patients in the BOAT-AF study were prescribed anticoagulation, as compared with 55 879 of 387 975 similar patients at other centers in the PINNACLE Registry. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study suggest that patients with AF who are not receiving anticoagulation are more willing to consider anticoagulation than their physicians. These data emphasize the need to revisit any prior decision against anticoagulation in a shared decision-making manner. When the panel of cardiologists reviewed the information for appropriateness of anticoagulation, they assessed that 408 could be considered appropriate, 239 may be appropriate and 170 would rarely be appropriate. The total of 647 who were considered appropriate or may be appropriate contrasts with the 221 overall that the physicians would consider oral anticoagulant.

We also found that both the patients and their corresponding physicians responded that they would be open to starting oral anticoagulation 16. 9% of the time. Our data emphasize the need to revisit any prior decision against oral anticoagulation and to use shared decision-making between patient and physician to arrive at an optimal treatment plan. In order to benchmark the patient and physician responses, we conducted an external review of the appropriateness of oral anticoagulation. Due to the absence of an already established appropriateness criteria for anticoagulation beyond the CHA2DS2-VASc score, the central committee used the best clinical judgment based on available guidelines. 9 Patients with AF and no clear contraindication were deemed appropriate. Patients also reported a significantly higher tolerable maximum number of bleeds that would justify warfarin use than physicians.

Our own study supports this disconnect between physician and patient preferences regarding oral anticoagulant risks and benefits, wherein patients were more willing to consider oral anticoagulant risks than physicians. With bleeding risk often cited as a reason for not prescribing oral anticoagulants and the improved bleeding profile ascribed to NOACs as a class, the rate of oral anticoagulant use has increased while the percentage of vitamin K antagonists use has declined. 11, 12 Oral anticoagulant use both in the US and worldwide has increased steadily in the past decade.

### Stroke prevention in atrial… [^563638d7]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation The incidence of AF increases with age and with the presence of structural heart disease. Impact on Morbidity A significant increase in the incidence of stroke was noted among participants with AF in the Framingham study. Clinical Trials of Anticoagulation in Nonvalvular AF General consensus has been reached regarding the recommendations for anticoagulation in patients with rheumatic AF. However, until recently, clear-cut recommendations have not been available for management of patients with nonvalvular AF. Since 1989, many large, prospective, randomized trials have been conducted to evaluate the risks and benefits of warfarin or aspirin therapy in the prevention of stroke. The results of these trials provide a strong foundation for recommendations regarding the use of anticoagulation therapy in patients with nonvalvular AF. The data clearly favor anticoagulation with warfarin to an intended INR of 2. 0 to
3.

0 in high-risk groups with AF. Based on these observations, it is generally recommended that anticoagulation be instituted for three weeks before cardioversion is attempted in patients with AF of more than two days' duration. To minimize thromboembolic complications, anticoagulants should be continued for four weeks after cardioversion. This period is required for recovery of atrial mechanical contractility after conversion to a sinus rhythm. Such a recommendation is based more on tradition and theory than on findings from controlled trials. Final Comment Anticoagulation with warfarin is clearly beneficial in patients with non-rheumatic AF who are at moderate risk for stroke and have a low risk of bleeding as a result of anticoagulation. 26, 27 Anticoagulation with warfarin should also be instituted in patients with a high risk of emboli unless the risk of bleeding is very high.

A decision to initiate anticoagulation must be individualized, with the physician carefully weighing the risk of bleeding against the potential reduction in embolic risks. Current recommendations for antithrombotic therapy for AF necessitate individualization of therapy after an integrated clinical assessment that evaluates thromboembolic risk due to AF alone, other potential indications for anticoagulation, hemorrhagic risk and nonmedical factors related to compliance, the patient's ability to follow through with INR monitoring, the patient's gait stability, the risk of other trauma and the patient's preferences. 26.

### Risk stratification for stroke in atrial fibrillation: a critique [^bbbdc5ed]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the demonstrable success of oral anticoagulants in reducing the rate of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, they continue to be seriously underutilized. Indications for their use as stated in the guidelines incorporate a number of risk score algorithms, the most widely used being the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Nonetheless there are several limitations to the various scores currently in clinical use and a critique of these is the focus of this review. In this review we discuss the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation and its role in thromboembolic stroke risk. We amalgamate this with the basis of major professional society anticoagulation recommendations with regards to the strengths and limitations of current risk stratification strategies and discuss gaps in our current evidence base and next steps to address those gaps.

We recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of the baseline risk of stroke (Grade 1B), and decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

### Use of oral anticoagulation in a real-world population with device detected atrial fibrillation [^1ea9f9db]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Current US guidelines strongly support the use of chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ≥ 2 stroke risk factors, without regard of AF duration or burden. 1 Device‐detected AF of various durations, often referred to as subclinical AF, has been shown to be associated with increased stroke risk, though at a rate less than that of clinically detected AF. 2, 3, 4 Anticoagulation recommendations for clinical AF are based on studies of stroke risk in the clinical AF population. 1 While patients may have both clinical and subclinical AF, the increasing use of implantable and consumer‐grade technologies capable of detecting AF will likely increase the latter population significantly. There is, however, considerable clinical equipoise about the management of these episodes of subclinical AF, particularly those that are paroxysmal and of short duration. Even the 2019 update of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines noted that it is not yet clear what the optimal management strategy is in these patients with regards to anticoagulation. 1 There are trials currently being conducted to answer this question, but in the meantime, clinicians are presented with such clinical scenarios daily. 5, 6

A recent statement from the American Heart Association noted the considerable evidence gap in answering this clinical question. 7 Given the uncertainty of anticoagulation management in device‐detected AF and the absence of randomized trial results for guidance, it is of interest to determine the practice patterns of anticoagulation use in patients with device‐detected AF among US physicians.

### Outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation newly recommended for oral anticoagulation under the 2014 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / Heart Rhythm Society guideline [^53d2dd7b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of the updated 2014 guidelines was to better distinguish between patients with moderate and those with low risk, 6 which means that many more patients are recommended to receive anticoagulation now than before 2014. Specifically, two thirds of patients not recommended for anticoagulation under the 2011 guidelines are recommended for anticoagulant therapy under the 2014 guideline. 6 For example, all women older than 64 years are recommended for therapy now regardless of risk profile. 6 This guideline update was highly controversial because previous studies that evaluated the benefit/risk ratio of oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with low or low to moderate risk have yielded conflicting results: several studies have demonstrated the benefit of anticoagulation in men with CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score 1 and women with CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score 2, 7, 8, 9 whereas others have found that oral anticoagulation did not reduce the risk of stroke in this low‐risk group, but did increase the risk of bleeding. 10 For this reason, the publication of this guideline, which was based mostly on expert opinion rather than quantitative data, was followed by concerns on the strength of the evidence supporting this guideline update and the potential increase in the incidence of bleeding in this population. 11

To the best of our knowledge, no prior study has specifically evaluated the benefit/risk ratio of oral anticoagulation therapy in a cohort of US patients who are newly recommended for anticoagulation under the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline. To address this gap in literature, we used claims data from a 5% random sample of Medicare Part D beneficiaries for patients with newly diagnosed AF who are recommended to receive oral anticoagulation under the 2014 guideline but who were not under the 2011 guideline, ie, those with CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 2 and CHADS 2 score < 2. This study sample was used to compare the combined risk of stroke, systemic embolism (SE) and death, and the risk of bleeding between patients who used oral anticoagulation and those who did not use oral anticoagulation therapy.

### Integrating real-time clinical information to provide estimates of net clinical benefit of antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation [^f36682aa]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation are based on stroke risk as calculated by either the CHADS2 or the CHA2DS2VASc scores and do not integrate bleeding risk in an explicit, quantitative manner. Our objective was to quantify the net clinical benefit resulting from improved decision making about antithrombotic therapy.

Methods and Results

This study is a retrospective cohort study of 1876 adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or flutter seen in primary care settings of an integrated healthcare delivery system between December 2012 and January 2014. Projections for quality-adjusted life expectancy reported as quality-adjusted life-years were calculated by a decision analytic model that integrates patient-specific risk factors for stroke and hemorrhage and examines strategies of no antithrombotic therapy, aspirin, or oral anticoagulation with warfarin. Net clinical benefit was defined by the gain or loss in quality-adjusted life expectancy between current treatment and treatment recommended by an Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool. Current treatment was discordant from treatment recommended by the Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool in 931 patients. A clinically significant gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy (defined as ≥ 0.1 quality-adjusted life-years) was projected in 832 patients. Subgroups were examined. For example, oral anticoagulant therapy was recommended for 188 who currently were receiving no antithrombotic therapy. For the entire cohort, a total of 736 quality-adjusted life-years could be gained were treatment changed to that recommended by the Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool.

Conclusions

Use of a decision support tool that integrates patient-specific stroke and bleeding risk could result in significant gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy for a primary care population of patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Differences in anticoagulant therapy prescription in patients with paroxysmal versus persistent atrial fibrillation [^596cb03e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation experience a similar risk of thromboembolism. Therefore, consensus guidelines recommend anticoagulant therapy in those at risk for thromboembolism irrespective of atrial fibrillation classification. We sought to examine whether there are differences in rates of appropriate oral anticoagulant treatment among patients with paroxysmal vs persistent atrial fibrillation in real-world cardiology practices.

Methods

We studied 71,316 outpatients with atrial fibrillation and intermediate to high thromboembolic risk (CHADS2 score ≥ 2) enrolled in the American College of Cardiology PINNACLE Registry between 2008 and 2012. Using hierarchical modified Poisson regression models adjusted for patient characteristics, we examined whether anticoagulant treatment rates differed between patients with paroxysmal vs persistent atrial fibrillation.

Results

The majority of outpatients (78.4%, n = 55,905) had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In both unadjusted and multivariable adjusted analyses, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were less frequently prescribed oral anticoagulant therapy than those with persistent atrial fibrillation (50.3% vs 64.2%; adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.76). Instead, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were prescribed more frequently only antiplatelet therapy (35.1% vs 25.0%; adjusted RR 1.77; 95% CI, 1.69–1.86) or neither antiplatelet nor anticoagulant therapy (14.6% vs 10.8%; adjusted RR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.26–1.44; P < .0001 for differences across all 3 comparisons).

Conclusions

In a large, real-world cardiac outpatient population, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a moderate to high risk of stroke were less likely to be prescribed appropriate oral anticoagulant therapy and more likely to be prescribed less effective or no therapy for thromboembolism prevention.

### Benefits and risks of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^89060295]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the most common clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia in the United States. It increases both the risk for and the severity of strokes and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, decreased quality of life, and related health care costs. Guidelines recommend anticoagulation therapy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Clinical trials have established that vitamin K antagonists are effective for stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation for whom anticoagulation is recommended. However, vitamin K antagonists remain underutilized for a variety of reasons, including drug, physician, and patient factors. While vitamin K antagonists considerably reduce the risk of stroke, the absolute risk reduction varies according to individual patient risk factors. Accurately assessing each patient's true risk of stroke and bleeding is essential when determining which (if any) antithrombotic strategy should be used. Several stroke risk stratification schemes exist; of these, CHADS(2) is widely employed and simple. New, more sophisticated schemes may generate more precise risk estimates and better identify those patients for whom anticoagulant therapy offers a net clinical benefit. More studies are needed to determine the utility of bleeding risk stratification systems, as well as the role of surgical and interventional alternatives to anticoagulation treatment. Several novel oral anticoagulants are in (or have completed) phase 3 clinical trials. Dabigatran etexilate, approved in the United States in October 2010 for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, now offers the first oral alternative to warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Anticoagulation in the elderly [^d8028f48]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulation therapy has demonstrated benefit in the treatment and prevention of a variety of thromboembolic disorders. Most individuals who receive oral anticoagulant therapy are elderly patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and acute or recurrent venous thromboembolism. Anticoagulation in elderly patients poses unique challenges for the practicing clinician because they are simultaneously at higher risk for recurrent thromboembolism and major bleeding, including catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage. The pharmacology of warfarin in the elderly is reviewed, including important drug interactions and current dosing recommendations for elderly patients. Evidence of the benefits and risks of oral anticoagulation therapy are reviewed for patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. This information should enable practitioners to better assess the relative risks and benefit of oral anticoagulation therapy to guide treatment decisions in the elderly.

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^310cf6d5]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA.

### Which patients with atrial fibrillation Do not need… [^c339f408]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is not indicated for use in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are at low risk for embolic cerebral vascular events. The classification of "low risk for embolic stroke" is defined as a 1 percent annual risk for stroke or lone atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is beneficial in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at moderate or high risk for stroke. Patients with absolute contraindications to anticoagulation therapy should not take warfarin. 1, 2.

1, 2 The Atrial Fibrillation Investigators pooled data from five large RCTs covering 3, 691 patient-years. The annual rate of stroke was found to be 4. 5 percent among the control groups and

1. 4 percent in the warfarin groups. The absolute risk reduction was 3. 1 percent, and the number needed to treat was 32.
2. Patients with absolute contraindications to warfarin anticoagulation therapy should not receive warfarin. These patients were systematically excluded from all RCTs of warfarin and atrial fibrillation. Based on this evidence, warfarin therapy is not indicated for low-risk patients but is beneficial in moderate- and high-risk patients. Defining the exact risk for stroke is the critical task in determining if a patient should take warfarin.

Clinical Commentary In practice, the decision to anticoagulate with warfarin can be complex. The evidence supports quantifying the patient's risk for embolic stroke. However, patients at greatest risk for stroke often have a risk for hemorrhage or difficulty complying with warfarin therapy monitoring. In some patients, other antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel remain a reasonable alternative.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^5536d21a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

### Time trends in adherence to guideline recommendations for anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction [^c6871476]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. The incidence of AF is increasing, and one in three middle-aged persons may develop AF during their lifetime. AF is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and remains one of the major causes of stroke. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines strongly recommend treatment with anticoagulation therapy in patients with AF with an increased risk of stroke. However, several studies have previously demonstrated low physician adherence to this recommendation. In patients with AF and myocardial infarction (MI), the prescription of anticoagulation has been particularly challenging, since these patients also need antiplatelet treatment. However, the ESC guidelines underscore the importance of treatment with anticoagulation also in these patients.

The aim of the present cohort study was to investigate time trends in adherence to the ESC guideline for prescription of anticoagulation therapy in patients with AF discharged from hospitals in Norway after MI in the period from 2013 to 2019.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023 — Anticoagulation of typical atrial flutter (AFL): For patients with AFL, anticoagulation therapy is recommended according to the same risk profile used for atrial fibrillation (AF). In patients with AFL who undergo successful cardioversion or ablation resulting in restoration of sinus rhythm, anticoagulation should be continued for at least 4 weeks postprocedure. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation and have had AF previously detected before AFL ablation should receive ongoing oral anticoagulation as indicated for AF. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful CTI ablation and are deemed to be at high thromboembolic risk, without any known previous history of AF, should receive close follow-up and arrhythmia monitoring to detect silent AF if they are not receiving ongoing anticoagulation in view of significant risk of AF. In patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful CTI ablation without any known previous history of AF who are at high risk for development of AF, it may be reasonable to prescribe long-term anticoagulation if thromboembolic risk assessment suggests high risk (> 2% annual risk) for stroke.

### Outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation newly recommended for oral anticoagulation under the 2014 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / Heart Rhythm Society guideline [^32ed94f6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In March 2014, the American Heart Association updated their guidelines for the management of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in atrial fibrillation, recommending OAC for all patients with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2. Previously, only patients with CHADS 2 ≥ 2 were recommended for anticoagulation. This study compared effectiveness and safety outcomes of OAC among patients who would receive OAC using the 2014 guidelines but not the 2011 guidelines.

Methods and Results

Using claims data from a 5% sample of 2013–2014 Medicare beneficiaries, we identified patients with initially diagnosed atrial fibrillation between 2013 and 2014 and selected those who would receive OAC under the 2014 guidelines but not the 2011 guidelines (those with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥ 2 or CHADS 2 score < 2). Patients were categorized according to their use of OAC after first atrial fibrillation diagnosis (2937 users and 2914 nonusers). Primary outcomes included the composite of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism and death, and any bleeding event. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to compare the risk of primary outcomes between the 2 groups, while controlling for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. There was no difference in the combined risk of stroke, systemic embolism, and death between the treatment groups (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.84–1.20). The risk of bleeding was higher for patients receiving OAC than for patients not receiving OAC (hazard ratio, 1.70, 95% confidence interval, 1.46–1.97).

Conclusions

The benefit of OAC is not well defined in this patient population, and new studies that minimize residual confounding are needed to fully understand the risk/benefit of OAC in patients with atrial fibrillation and low to moderate stroke risk.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^d7feb4c2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to use data from a nationally representative sample of Medicare fee‐for‐service beneficiaries with Part D coverage to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulation therapy in a cohort of patients with AF who were newly recommended to receive oral anticoagulation by the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS updated guideline. We found that the use of oral anticoagulation in this cohort was associated with an increased risk of any bleeding and GI bleeding but not with a reduction in the combined risk of stroke, SE, and death.

Several European studies have demonstrated the benefit of anticoagulation in men with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 1 and women with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 2. 7, 8, 9 In addition, using a Taiwanese database, Chao et al 18 showed that warfarin therapy in patients newly recommended for anticoagulation under the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines was associated with an 11% reduction in the composite risk of stroke, bleeding, and mortality. In contrast, our results are consistent with a recent study by Golive and colleagues, who used data from a US integrated health system and found no significant reduction in the risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack with anticoagulation in a sample of patients with AF who had a CHADS 2 score of < 2. 10 The apparently conflicting results of these studies may be attributable to higher time in the therapeutic range with oral anticoagulation therapy in Europe than in the United States, 19 as well as differences in patient characteristics between the 2 continents.

Our study constitutes an important contribution to this existing literature because, using recent data from a US nationally representative sample of patients with AF, it is the first to evaluate safety and effectiveness outcomes of anticoagulation therapy in the cohort of patients with AF newly recommended for anticoagulation as a result of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline update. In doing so, we found that oral anticoagulation therapy did not significantly reduce the combined risk of stroke, SE, and death in this population with low to moderate risk. Our findings reinforce the need for systematically evaluating the benefit/risk ratio of anticoagulation in this population using data or study designs that minimize the risk of residual confounding. 11, 20 Understanding the benefit/risk ratio of treating patients with AF at low and moderate risk with oral anticoagulation is increasingly important because the standards of care for these patients have evolved as a result of the approval of NOACs. 21, 22

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA PM-1 — anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter — states that direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) are recommended over warfarin in DOAC-eligible AF except with moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). Among patients treated with warfarin, the international normalized ratio (INR) should be determined at least weekly during initiation and at least monthly when anticoagulation (INR in range) is stable (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). In AF except with moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended for assessment of stroke risk (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B). For AF with mechanical heart valves, warfarin is recommended (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B). Selection of anticoagulant therapy should be based on thromboembolism risk irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B). In AF, anticoagulant therapy should be individualized using shared decision-making after discussion of absolute and relative risks of stroke and bleeding and the patient's values and preferences (Class 1, Level of Evidence: C). For atrial flutter, anticoagulant therapy is recommended according to the same risk profile used for AF (Class 1, Level of Evidence: C). Reevaluation of the need for and choice of anticoagulant therapy at periodic intervals is recommended to reassess stroke and bleeding risks (Class 1, Level of Evidence: C).

### Atrial fibrillation decision support tool: population perspective [^959ea0b2]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriate thromboprophylaxis for patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF) remains a national challenge. The recent availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with comparable efficacy and improved safety compared with warfarin alters the balance between risk factors for stroke and benefit of anticoagulation. Our objective was to examine the impact of DOACs as an alternative to warfarin on the net benefit of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) in a real-world population of AF patients.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with paroxysmal or persistent nonvalvular AF. We updated an Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool (AFDST) to include DOACs as treatment options. The tool generates patient-specific recommendations based upon individual patient risk factor profiles for stroke and major bleeding using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) calculated for each treatment strategy by a decision analytic model. The setting included inpatient and ambulatory sites in an academic health center in the midwestern United States. The study involved 5,121 adults with nonvalvular AF seen for any ambulatory visit or inpatient hospitalization over the 1-year period (January through December 2016). Outcome measure was net clinical benefit in QALYs.

Results

When DOACs are a therapeutic option, the AFDST recommends OAT for 4,134 (81%) patients and no antithrombotic therapy or aspirin for 489 (9%). A strong recommendation for OAT could not be made in 498 (10%) patients. When warfarin is the only option, OAT is recommended for 3,228 (63%) patients and no antithrombotic therapy or aspirin for 973 (19%). A strong recommendation for OAT could not be made in 920 (18%) patients. In total, 1,508 QALYs could be gained if treatment were changed to that recommended by the AFDST.

Conclusions

Availability of DOACs increases the proportion of patients for whom oral anticoagulation therapy is recommended in a real-world cohort of AF patients and increased projected QALYs by more than 1,500 when all patients are receiving thromboprophylaxis as recommended by the AFDST compared with current treatment.

### Anticoagulation: updated guidelines for outpatient management [^3d9c7707]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation therapy is recommended for preventing, treating, and reducing the recurrence of venous thromboembolism, and preventing stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation. Direct oral anticoagulants are first-line agents for eligible patients for treating venous thromboembolism and preventing stroke in those with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Vitamin K antagonists are recommended for patients with mechanical valves and valvular atrial fibrillation. Vitamin K antagonists inhibit the production of vitamin K-related factors and require a minimum of five days overlap with parenteral anticoagulants, whereas direct oral anticoagulants directly inhibit factor II or factor Xa, providing more immediate anticoagulation. The immediate effect of direct oral anticoagulants permits select patients at low risk to initiate treatment in the outpatient setting for venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism. Low-molecular-weight heparin continues to be recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with venous thromboembolism and active cancer, although there is growing evidence of effectiveness for the use of direct oral anticoagulants in this patient population. Validated bleeding risk assessments such as HAS-BLED should be performed at each visit and modifiable factors should be addressed. Major bleeding should be treated with vitamin K and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for patients already being treated with a vitamin K antagonist. Idarucizumab has been effective for reversing the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, and andexanet alfa has been effective for reversing the effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban.

### Atrial fibrillation and stroke: a practical guide [^0bc38d1e]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurologists and stroke physicians will be familiar with atrial fibrillation as a major cause of ischaemic stroke, and the role of anticoagulation in preventing cardioembolic stroke. However, making decisions about anticoagulation for individual patients remains a difficult area of clinical practice, balancing the serious risk of ischaemic stroke against that of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage. Atrial fibrillation management requires interdisciplinary collaboration with colleagues in cardiology and haematology. Recent advances, especially the now-widespread availability of direct oral anticoagulants, have brought opportunities to improve stroke care while posing new challenges. This article gives an overview of the contemporary diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation, and the associated evidence base. Where there is uncertainty, we describe our own approach to these areas, while highlighting ongoing research that will likely guide future practice.

Atrial fibrillation — risk stratification for thromboembolism includes four directives: Patients with AF should be evaluated for their annual risk of thromboembolic events using a validated clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc; patients with AF should be evaluated for factors that specifically indicate a higher risk of bleeding, such as previous bleeding and use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, in order to identify possible interventions to prevent bleeding on anticoagulation; patients with AF at intermediate annual risk by risk scores (eg, equivalent to CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women) who remain uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation can benefit from consideration of factors that might modify their risk of stroke to help inform the decision; and in patients deemed at high risk for stroke, bleeding risk scores should not be used in isolation to determine eligibility for oral anticoagulation but instead to identify and modify bleeding risk factors and to inform medical decision-making, labeled "1 B-NR", "1 B-NR", "2a C-LD", and "3: No Benefit" respectively.

### Methodologic differences across studies of patients with atrial fibrillation lead to varying estimates of stroke risk [^44c7445f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who take oral anticoagulants (OACs) have a dramatically reduced risk of ischemic stroke, 1 but face an increased risk of bleeding, which can be fatal. As a result, the decision to anticoagulate an individual patient should be based on the expected net clinical benefit of OAC (ie, the difference between the reduction in stroke risk and the increase in bleeding risk, weighted by the severity of each of these respective outcomes). 2 Because of this balance of benefits and harms, patients at low risk of ischemic stroke may have little or even negative net clinical benefit from OAC treatment. Decision analyses have shown that the threshold of absolute stroke risk for an average individual patient at which OAC treatment yields a net clinical benefit is between 0.9% and 2% per year. 3

Current guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) have recommended the use of the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc stroke risk scoring system. 4, 5, 6 The CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score incorporates patient characteristics to create a point score, with increasing scores corresponding to higher risks of ischemic stroke. 7 The most recent ESC and AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines both recommend using OAC at a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 2 or greater (not including "female" as a risk factor for the ESC threshold).

An underlying assumption of these guidelines is that each CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc point score corresponds to a fixed stroke rate off anticoagulant therapy, which can be extrapolated to a positive or negative net clinical benefit should anticoagulants be taken. To support this assumption, the guidelines cite off‐anticoagulant stroke rates from large cohort studies. 7, 8, 9 However, our and others' previous work has shown wide variation in the reported stroke rates from different cohorts of patients with AF. 5, 10 Depending upon AF cohort, a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 2 would lead to a positive or a negative expected net clinical benefit, calling into question the general applicability of guideline recommendations. The fact that wide variation in stroke rates is seen in studies from the same or adjacent countries argues that variation in study methodology is an important contributor to variation in observed rates. The current study seeks to explain this variation by comparing relevant worldwide AF cohorts according to core methodologic features.

Bleeding risk scores and anticoagulation decision-making — Unless an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation is present, bleeding risk scores have limitation in clinical decision-making because the most commonly used scores (HAS–BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, and ATRIA) are based on clinical factors that indicate higher risks of both stroke and bleeding, and patients with higher risk of bleeding also tend to have a higher risk of stroke. Furthermore, a bleeding risk score cannot be interpreted in isolation because it does not assess the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation or balance the risk of bleeding against the risk of stroke. Population-based studies suggest that the benefits of stroke prevention with anticoagulation generally outweigh the risks of bleeding, even in patients determined to be at high risk for bleeding. Decision-making about oral anticoagulation should be based on consideration of both benefits and harms, not by using bleeding risk scores in isolation, and the best utility of these scores may be identifying potential modifying risk factors.

### Antithrombotic treatment for secondary prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack and non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a European Stroke Organisation guideline [^c113c863]. European Stroke Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and non-valvular atrial fibrillation have a high risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events. The aim of this guideline is to provide recommendations on antithrombotic medication for secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular outcomes in these patients. The working group identified questions and outcomes, graded evidence, and developed recommendations according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) standard operating procedure for guidelines. The guideline was reviewed and approved by the ESO guideline board and the ESO executive committee. In patients with atrial fibrillation and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of recurrence over antiplatelets or no antithrombotic treatment. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are preferred over vitamin K antagonists because they have a lower risk of major bleeding and death. Recommendations are weak regarding timing of treatment, (re-)starting oral anticoagulants in patients with previous intracerebral haemorrhage, and treatment in specific patient subgroups of those of older age, with cognitive impairment, renal failure or small vessel disease, because of a lack of strong evidence. In conclusion, for patients with atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are the preferred treatment for secondary prevention of recurrent stroke or thromboembolism. Further research is required to determine the best timing for initiating oral anticoagulants after an acute ischemic stroke, whether or not oral anticoagulants should be (re)started in patients with a history of intracerebral haemorrhage, and the best secondary preventive treatment in specific subgroups.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — risk stratification and anticoagulation thresholds: Calculation of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended (COR 1, LOE B-NR) to guide decisions on prescription of oral anticoagulation to reduce risk for stroke in individuals with AF. Prediction instruments are commonly applied to patients with nonvalvular AF to guide stroke prevention therapy, and the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended by the AHA to inform risk-based anticoagulation of patients with nonvalvular AF of any duration. For treatment thresholds, oral anticoagulation is recommended for patients with an annual stroke risk ≥ 2% (generally a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women).

### Atrial fibrillation: a review [^131e4e56]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the US, approximately 10.55 million adults have atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is associated with significantly increased risk of stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic kidney disease, and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms of AF include palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope, exertional intolerance, and fatigue, although approximately 10% to 40% of people with AF are asymptomatic. AF can be detected incidentally during clinical encounters, with wearable devices, or through interrogation of cardiac implanted electronic devices. In patients presenting with ischemic stroke without diagnosed AF, an implantable loop recorder (ie, subcutaneous telemetry device) can evaluate patients for intermittent AF. The 2023 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) Guideline writing group proposed 4 stages of AF evolution: stage 1, at risk, defined as patients with AF-associated risk factors (eg, obesity, hypertension); stage 2, pre-AF, signs of atrial pathology on electrocardiogram or imaging without AF; stage 3, the presence of paroxysmal (recurrent AF episodes lasting ≤ 7 days) or persistent (continuous AF episode lasting > 7 days) AF subtypes; and stage 4, permanent AF. Lifestyle and risk factor modification, including weight loss and exercise, to prevent AF onset, recurrence, and complications are recommended for all stages. In patients with estimated risk of stroke and thromboembolic events of 2% or greater per year, anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant reduces stroke risk by 60% to 80% compared with placebo. In most patients, a direct oral anticoagulant, such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban, is recommended over warfarin because of lower bleeding risks. Compared with anticoagulation, aspirin is associated with poorer efficacy and is not recommended for stroke prevention. Early rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation to restore and maintain sinus rhythm is recommended by the 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for some patients with AF. Catheter ablation is first-line therapy in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF to improve symptoms and slow progression to persistent AF. Catheter ablation is also recommended for patients with AF who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to improve quality of life, left ventricular systolic function, and cardiovascular outcomes, such as rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalization.

Conclusions and Relevance

AF is associated with increased rates of stroke, heart failure, and mortality. Lifestyle and risk factor modification are recommended to prevent AF onset, recurrence, and complications, and oral anticoagulants are recommended for those with an estimated risk of stroke or thromboembolic events of 2% or greater per year. Early rhythm control using antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation is recommended in select patients with AF experiencing symptomatic paroxysmal AF or HFrEF.

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a north American perspective-2018 update [^9e7252a0]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

The optimal antithrombotic treatment regimen for patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation represents a challenge in clinical practice. In 2016, an updated opinion of selected experts from the United States and Canada on the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention was reported. After the 2016 North American consensus statement on the management of antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, results of pivotal clinical trials assessing the type of oral anticoagulant agent and the duration of antiplatelet treatment have been published. On the basis of these results, this focused update on the antithrombotic management of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention recommends that a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant be preferred over a vitamin K antagonist as the oral anticoagulant of choice. Moreover, a double-therapy regimen (oral anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y 12 inhibitor) by the time of hospital discharge should be considered for most patients, whereas extending the use of aspirin beyond hospital discharge (ie, triple therapy) should be considered only for selected patients at high ischemic/thrombotic and low bleeding risks and for a limited period of time. The present document provides a focused updated on the rationale for the new expert consensus-derived recommendations on the antithrombotic management of patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Association of oral anticoagulation with stroke in atrial fibrillation or heart failure: a comparative meta-analysis [^f0b2555e]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are common causes of cardioembolic stroke. Oral anticoagulation is strongly recommended (Grade 1A) for patients with atrial fibrillation to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. – In contrast, clinical trials in patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm have not reported superiority of oral anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy or control for cardiovascular prevention, – and guideline recommendations are inconsistent. For example, the Heart Failure Society of America recommends anticoagulation with warfarin, with an international normalized ratio (INR) target of 2 to 3 for patients with HFrEF and a history of thromboembolism. Conversely, the American Heart Association make a level B recommendation against anticoagulation in heart failure in the absence of atrial fibrillation. Several factors may explain the apparent difference in the efficacy, or interpretation of efficacy from clinical trials, of oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation compared with HFrEF in sinus rhythm. First, the mechanism of ischemic stroke may differ between populations, and patients with HFrEF may have a higher prevalence of competing stroke etiologies, for which oral anticoagulation is not superior to antiplatelet therapy (eg, small vessel disease). Second, the risks associated with oral anticoagulant therapy may differ in patients with HFrEF than in patients with atrial fibrillation, for example, the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, which may offset benefits in the reduction of ischemic stroke. Third, differences in the primary outcome measures between trials of patients with HFrEF (which mostly used composite outcomes, including all-cause mortality) and trials of patients with atrial fibrillation (which mostly used all stroke) may account for the observed difference in efficacy of oral anticoagulation. In addition, there may be differences in the relative contribution of stroke to a composite outcome between populations.

While prior meta-analyses have examined the effectiveness of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation or HFrEF individually, our meta-analysis specifically evaluates the comparative association of oral anticoagulation with incidence of stroke, other cardiovascular events and mortality in populations with atrial fibrillation compared with populations with HFrEF in sinus rhythm.

Safety of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy

In the anticoagulation group, 406 (13.8%) patients presented with any bleeding event, 125 (4.3%) with GI bleeding, and 9 (0.3%) with IC bleeding, compared with 218 (7.5%), 86 (3.0%), and 10 (0.3%) in the no anticoagulation treatment group, respectively (Table 2). The unadjusted cumulative incidence rates of any bleeding (0.18; 95% CI, 0.16–0.19) were higher for patients taking oral anticoagulants than for those who did not take oral anticoagulants (0.11; 95% CI, 0.10–0.13) (Table 2). Results from adjusted analyses were consistent with this observation: the risk of any and GI bleeding were higher for patients on any oral anticoagulation therapy than for those who did not use anticoagulation (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.46–1.97 for any bleeding, and HR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06–1.77 for GI bleeding) (Table 2). There were no differences in the risk of intracranial bleeding between treatment groups. The risk of bleeding events other than intracranial and GI bleeding was also higher for patients taking anticoagulants than for those not taking anticoagulants (Table S2).

Results of Subgroup Analyses

Table S3 shows the results of subgroup analysis after stratifying the sample into 2 groups according to CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc. The results from these subgroup analyses were consistent with the results from the overall sample: for the 2 subgroups, the combined risk of stroke, SE, and death did not differ between patients on anticoagulation therapy and those who did not use any oral anticoagulation therapy (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.82–0.41 for a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 2, and HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.75–1.18 for a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3 or 4). However, the risk of any bleeding was higher for patients on oral anticoagulation (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.41–2.19 for a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 2; HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.30–1.99 for a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 3 or 4).

Atrial fibrillation (AF) periprocedural anticoagulation management — In patients with AF (excluding those with recent stroke or TIA, or a mechanical valve) on warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) undergoing an invasive procedure or surgery, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging anticoagulation is recommended. In patients with AF on warfarin anticoagulation and an annual predicted risk of thromboembolism of ≥ 5% undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change, continued anticoagulation is recommended in preference to interruption of warfarin and bridging anticoagulation with heparin to reduce the risk of pocket hematoma. In patients with AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent risk of stroke on DOAC anticoagulation and undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change, either uninterrupted or interrupted DOAC is reasonable. If an invasive procedure or surgery cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted DOAC, the timing of DOAC interruption should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure. After DOAC interruption for a procedure or surgery, resumption of anticoagulation the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery is reasonable, as long as hemostasis has been achieved and further bleeding is not anticipated. For patients with AF on warfarin who are holding warfarin for a surgery or procedure, except in patients with mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA, bridging anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered.

### Application of a decision support tool for anticoagulation in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation [^ecdaa2d1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation affects more than two million Americans and results in a fivefold increased rate of embolic strokes. The efficacy of adjusted dose warfarin is well documented, yet many patients are not receiving treatment consistent with guidelines. The use of a patient-specific computerized decision support tool may aid in closing the knowledge gap regarding the best treatment for a patient.

Methods

This retrospective, observational cohort analysis of 6,123 Ohio Medicaid patients used a patient-specific computerized decision support tool that automated the complex risk-benefit analysis for anticoagulation. Adverse outcomes included acute stroke, major gastrointestinal bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. Cox proportional hazards models were developed to compare the group of patients who received warfarin treatment with those who did not receive warfarin treatment, stratified by the decision support tool's recommendation.

Results

Our decision support tool recommended warfarin for 3,008 patients (49%); however, only 9.9% received warfarin. In patients for whom anticoagulation was recommended by the decision support tool, there was a trend towards a decreased hazard for stroke with actual warfarin treatment (hazard ratio 0.90) without significant increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.87). In contrast, in patients for whom the tool recommended no anticoagulation, receipt of warfarin was associated with statistically significant increased hazard of gastrointestinal bleeding (1.54, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

We have shown that our atrial fibrillation decision support tool is a useful predictor of those at risk of major bleeding for whom anticoagulation may not necessarily be beneficial. It may aid in weighing the benefits versus risks of anticoagulation treatment.
