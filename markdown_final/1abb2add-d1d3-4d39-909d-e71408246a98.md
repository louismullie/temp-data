## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for an esophageal foreign body sensation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of an esophageal "foreign body sensation". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is a true ingested foreign body versus a structural or motility disorder versus a functional globus syndrome. Then, I should verify red flags and urgency criteria to triage imaging and endoscopy. Next, I will review key mimics such as eosinophilic esophagitis, structural narrowing, motility disorders, and psychosocial contributors. Finally, I need to outline an age-specific prioritization and a practical diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm aligned with society guidelines, while self-checking for pitfalls like radiograph false negatives and missed EoE during food impaction removal [^115yiHSc] [^111WCJL5] [^115twbAs] [^112Jv4bF].

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: "foreign body sensation" can reflect a true object lodged in the esophagus, an underlying esophageal pathology manifesting as dysphagia or odynophagia, or a functional disorder such as globus where the "lump in throat" is typically nonpainful, not associated with dysphagia, and may improve with eating, which is a crucial discriminator that I should verify during history taking before jumping to invasive testing [^113ED8S8] [^111rwSPH] [^115yiHSc].

> I need to check for true foreign body ingestion first because it drives urgency: coins, button batteries, magnets, sharp bones, dentures, toys, and impacted food bolus are the common culprits, and timing plus object type dictates emergent or urgent endoscopic management, with flexible endoscopy first-line in most cases and airway protection paramount in high-grade obstruction, especially in children and the proximal esophagus [^111WCJL5] [^114Ct5tc] [^115twbAs] [^112jHiY7].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic choke points and complications before deciding imaging: upper esophageal sphincter, aortic arch crossing, and LES are classic narrowing sites, and sharp objects and button batteries carry high perforation and caustic risks; plain radiographs can miss up to nearly half of cases, whereas CT is far more sensitive and should be used when perforation or extraluminal migration is suspected or when radiographs are negative but symptoms persist, so I should not be falsely reassured by a normal X-ray if the story is convincing [^1173Mhq7] [^116Qdh1m] [^114Kq1CW] [^114ywxfd].

> Hold on, I should double-check coin versus button battery on imaging because management urgency diverges: radiographic differentiation is imperfect, but careful AP views and digital techniques improve accuracy, and any doubt should push me toward emergent removal as for a battery given the risk of rapid tissue injury; I must also remember that rare mimics like stacked coins can look like a battery, so intraoperative confirmation and early endoscopy remain prudent when uncertainty persists [^113AafdE] [^115XfWz5] [^115twbAs] [^115GWqvF].

> Next, I will examine inflammatory and immune-mediated causes because they are critical mimics that often present with food impaction: eosinophilic esophagitis is strongly linked to impaction and recurrent dysphagia, with atopy, male sex, and endoscopic features increasing pretest probability; I should take esophageal biopsies at the time of food bolus removal and pursue histology thereafter if suspicion persists, as a meaningful proportion of children with prior esophageal foreign body ultimately have EoE on follow-up [^114czBGv] [^115RyUU5] [^115rCEYU] [^112Jv4bF].

> Let me consider structural and mechanical obstruction next, and I need to ensure I do not overlook subtle rings or webs: peptic strictures, Schatzki rings, webs, benign and malignant tumors, Zenker diverticulum, and post-surgical changes are key intrinsic causes, while extrinsic compression from goiter, mediastinal masses, or vascular anomalies such as an aberrant right subclavian artery can produce dysphagia and a perceived "foreign body", so targeted imaging and endoscopy with biopsies are warranted when alarm features or weight loss are present [^112DobUW] [^114rYBVu] [^1173Mhq7].

> I should review esophageal motility disorders because they can mimic a stuck sensation without any object: achalasia classically causes dysphagia to solids and liquids and regurgitation refractory to PPIs, while spasm or hypercontractile patterns may present with chest pain and intermittent dysphagia; I will reserve high-resolution manometry for patients with persistent symptoms after endoscopy excludes structural disease, and I will also screen for opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction and scleroderma, which alter management trajectories [^116qiid3] [^115yiHSc] [^112aNc7Z] [^113LqLSq].

> But wait, what if the exam and endoscopy are normal and the symptom profile fits globus or functional dysphagia: in that case, I should confirm the absence of alarm signs, consider reflux testing if typical GERD features coexist, and recognize a role for esophageal hypersensitivity and central modulation in symptom generation, guiding reassurance and neuromodulator or behavioral therapies after exclusion of organic disease [^113ED8S8] [^111rwSPH] [^111ptpcU].

> I will now examine neurologic and systemic contributors because localization can be misleading: stroke, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, and bulbar palsies typically cause oropharyngeal dysphagia with coughing or aspiration signals, yet patients may report a neck "lump" or sticking; careful history and, when indicated, videofluoroscopy help differentiate oropharyngeal from esophageal sources before I attribute symptoms to a foreign body [^113LqLSq] [^1153PJYZ] [^114rYBVu].

> I should double-check psychosocial and behavioral risk factors because they shift pretest probabilities: anxiety and depression can amplify globus or functional symptoms, developmental delay and autism increase the risk of accidental ingestion, and psychiatric comorbidity may drive intentional ingestion, so screening for these elements can refine whether I prioritize urgent endoscopy versus a more measured workup for functional disorders [^111rwSPH] [^1124CR96] [^111WCJL5].

> Let me reconsider age-specific prioritization before finalizing the plan: in children, true foreign body ingestion and food impaction dominate the initial differential, with EoE present in a notable minority and thus warranting biopsy when feasible at extraction; in adults, structural strictures, rings, and malignancy rise in prominence, and this should shape the threshold for urgent EGD versus initial empiric reflux therapy only in truly low-risk scenarios [^111WCJL5] [^115rCEYU] [^1124CR96] [^112DobUW].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic algorithm with built-in safety checks: start with focused history and exam to elicit alarm features and characterize oropharyngeal versus esophageal symptoms; if ingestion of a hazardous object is suspected or the patient cannot handle secretions, proceed to emergent endoscopy with airway protection; obtain biplanar radiographs for radiopaque objects but do not rely on them to exclude radiolucent items, and use CT when perforation, migration, or uncertainty persists; avoid barium in suspected impaction to preserve endoscopic visualization [^117DPQRW] [^115twbAs] [^116Qdh1m] [^115UugNu].

> Hold on, I should verify timing for intervention because delays increase complications: perform emergent endoscopy within 2–6 hours for complete obstruction, sharp objects, and button batteries, and within 24 hours for other esophageal foreign bodies, recognizing that persistent symptoms after negative radiographs still mandate endoscopy and that food bolus may be managed by gentle push or retrieval depending on safety and local expertise [^115twbAs] [^115GWqvF] [^115AHHWg] [^112uELC4].

> Initially, I thought plain radiography would be adequate screening, but wait, the false-negative rate can be substantial, so I should prefer CT to localize bones and radiolucent objects and to detect complications, and I must remember that coin versus battery misclassification on X-ray happens, so equivocal images should default to battery-level urgency rather than watchful waiting [^116Qdh1m] [^114Kq1CW] [^113AafdE] [^115XfWz5].

> After relief of an impaction or if the history suggests inflammatory disease, I should confirm mucosal assessment with biopsies for EoE and consider infectious etiologies in immunocompromised hosts; if symptoms persist despite histologic or endoscopic remission in EoE, I need to check for concomitant motility disorders, and if infectious esophagitis does not respond as expected, I should evaluate for refractory infection or additional immunologic dysfunction [^115RyUU5] [^112Jv4bF] [^111cbdZa] [^114q2XBF].

> Finally, I need to ensure awareness of complications and red flags that mandate escalation: longer duration of impaction and leukocytosis correlate with major complications, sharp objects can migrate extraluminally requiring cross-sectional localization, and occasionally deeply embedded foreign bodies require advanced endoscopic or surgical approaches, so I should maintain a low threshold for CT and multidisciplinary input when the clinical course deviates from expectations [^111FLCnZ] [^111fNJcp] [^112bTYXQ] [^113XacB8].

Foreign body sensation in the esophagus has a broad differential, including **true foreign bodies** (coins, bones, dentures, batteries, magnets, food bolus) [^112DobUW], **structural lesions** (strictures, rings, webs, tumors, diverticula) [^114rYBVu], **motility disorders** (achalasia, spasm, scleroderma) [^112aNc7Z], **inflammatory/infectious causes** (EoE, GERD, esophagitis) [^112Jv4bF], and **functional/psychogenic disorders** (globus, anxiety) [^111ptpcU]. Evaluation should start with history and exam [^117DPQRW], then use **plain radiographs** for radiopaque objects [^112jHiY7], **CT** for radiolucent or complicated cases [^116Qdh1m], and **endoscopy** for diagnosis and therapy [^113q2ipT] [^115twbAs]. Management is guided by the cause, with urgent endoscopy for high-risk objects [^115GWqvF] and tailored therapy for structural, motility, inflammatory, or functional etiologies [^112aNc7Z] [^115yiHSc].

---

## True foreign bodies

- **Coins**: Common in children; usually radiopaque and easily identified on plain radiographs [^11515M8V].
- **Bones**: Fish or chicken bones are common in adults; often radiolucent and may require CT for detection [^114Kq1CW].
- **Dentures**: Common in elderly; radiolucent and difficult to detect on plain films [^116Qdh1m].
- **Batteries**: Button batteries are emergencies due to rapid mucosal injury; require immediate removal [^115GWqvF] [^115twbAs].
- **Magnets**: Multiple magnets can cause pressure necrosis and perforation; urgent removal indicated [^115GWqvF].
- **Food bolus**: Commonly meat; associated with underlying esophageal pathology such as strictures or eosinophilic esophagitis [^115RyUU5] [^113LqLSq].

---

## Structural lesions

Structural lesions include **esophageal strictures** — benign (peptic, caustic, radiation-induced) or malignant — that cause progressive dysphagia and a foreign-body sensation [^112DobUW]. Esophageal rings and webs, such as a **Schatzki ring** or those seen in Plummer-Vinson syndrome, typically cause intermittent dysphagia and a foreign-body sensation [^115yiHSc]. Esophageal tumors may be benign (leiomyoma) or malignant (**adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma**) and usually present with progressive symptoms [^113LqLSq]. Esophageal diverticula, including **Zenker's and epiphrenic diverticula**, are associated with regurgitation and halitosis [^115yiHSc].

---

## Motility disorders

Motility disorders include **achalasia**, defined by impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation with progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids [^112aNc7Z] [^116qiid3]. Diffuse esophageal spasm causes intermittent dysphagia and chest pain, whereas scleroderma results in esophageal dysmotility due to smooth-muscle atrophy and fibrosis [^115yiHSc].

---

## Inflammatory and infectious causes

Inflammatory and infectious causes include **eosinophilic esophagitis**, an allergic condition common in younger patients with an atopic history that causes rings and strictures [^112Jv4bF]. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (**GERD**) leads to chronic reflux with esophagitis and stricture formation [^113LqLSq]. Infectious esophagitis due to **Candida, herpes simplex virus, or cytomegalovirus** is common in immunocompromised patients [^111cbdZa].

---

## Functional and psychogenic disorders

Within functional and psychogenic disorders, **Globus sensation** is a persistent sensation of a lump or foreign body without structural abnormality and is often associated with anxiety or stress [^111ptpcU] [^113ED8S8]. Functional esophageal disorders encompass **functional dysphagia** or hypersensitivity and are diagnosed by exclusion [^115yiHSc].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **History and physical examination**: Essential to differentiate true foreign body ingestion from other causes [^113q2ipT] [^117DPQRW].
- **Plain radiographs**: Initial imaging for suspected radiopaque foreign bodies (coins, batteries, metals) [^112jHiY7] [^113AafdE].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: High sensitivity for radiolucent foreign bodies and complications (perforation, abscess) [^116Qdh1m] [^114Kq1CW].
- **Endoscopy**: Gold standard for diagnosis and removal of foreign bodies; also identifies structural lesions and allows biopsy [^113q2ipT] [^115AHHWg].

---

## Management strategies

- **True foreign bodies**: Emergent endoscopic removal for batteries, magnets [^115GWqvF], sharp objects, and complete obstructions; urgent removal within 24 hours for other objects [^115twbAs].
- **Structural lesions**: Endoscopic dilation, surgical intervention, or oncologic treatment depending on etiology [^115yiHSc].
- **Motility disorders**: Medical therapy (calcium channel blockers, nitrates), botulinum toxin injection, or surgical myotomy [^116qiid3].
- **Inflammatory/infectious causes**: Medical management with proton pump inhibitors, corticosteroids, or antifungal/antiviral therapy [^112Jv4bF].
- **Functional disorders**: Reassurance, behavioral therapy, and neuromodulators [^113ED8S8].

---

Foreign body sensation in the esophagus has a broad differential, including true foreign bodies, structural lesions, motility disorders, inflammatory/infectious causes, and functional/psychogenic disorders. A **structured diagnostic approach** [^115yiHSc] and targeted management are essential for effective treatment.

Foreign bodies in the cervical oesophagus are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department. In rare instances, the foreign body may move completely through the oesophageal lumen, such that it is unable to be visualized during endoscopy. Subsequent imaging may show the foreign body within the cervical soft tissue. This rare complication is known as a migrating oesophageal foreign body.

We present the case of a 56-year-old woman who accidentally ingested a wire, which became lodged in the proximal oesophagus. Following initial imaging, the wire migrated completely through the oesophageal lumen, rendering it invisible during endoscopy and ultimately requiring open neck exploration for removal.

### Application of a double-balloon method to remove button battery at the entrance of esophagus in a 17-month-old child: a case report [^114Ct5tc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Due to the natural curiosity and poor safety awareness of children, foreign body ingestion is particularly common in this demographic. The types of foreign body impactions in the digestive tract of children are complex and diverse, including batteries and magnetic foreign bodies. The associated complications and risks are also increasing. The treatment methods and outcomes vary depending on the size, type, quantity, nature, impaction site, and retention time of the foreign bodies. Notably, 80–90% of gastrointestinal foreign bodies can be discharged naturally; 10–20% require endoscopic treatment, and less than 1% necessitate surgical operation. Therefore, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of gastrointestinal foreign bodies are particularly important. Endoscopic surgery is widely used for treating foreign body ingestion and is one of the methods recommended by both domestic and foreign guidelines for gastrointestinal foreign body impaction.

### Unusual foreign body, a spoon, in the esophagus of a middle-aged female: A case report and review of the literature [^111MEGEi]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Low credibility.

In adults, a large metal foreign body in the esophagus is rarely seen and is usually caused accidentally. Here, we have described an unusual case of a foreign body (spoon) in the esophagus of an adult patient. A 48-year-old woman initially presented to the emergency department with marked dysphagia, drooling, and radiating pain to the chest. She had swallowed a spoon while trying to vomit because of feeling sick. Radiological images revealed a spoon stuck in the esophagus. The edge of the spoon was grabbed with forceps and safely extracted under hypnic anesthesia. No esophageal perforation was detected on evaluation with esophagography using Gastrografin the next day. This case highlights an unusual situation in an adult patient showing a long, nonfood-type foreign body in the esophagus. It is important that an appropriate workup and removal of the foreign body is performed according to the location and type.

### Aberrant right subclavian artery- suggested mechanism for esophageal foreign body impaction: Case report [^1173Mhq7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In normal embryologic development, the subclavian arteries originate from the seventh intersegment arteries. The distal segment of the right dorsal aorta degenerates, and the right seventh intersegment artery becomes confluent with the right fourth arch.

In the anomaly of the aberrant right subclavian artery, abnormal development results from the degeneration of the entire right fourth arch. The right seventh intersegment artery persists in its attachment to the distal descending aorta. In 80% of cases, it crosses between the esophagus and the vertebral column; in 15% of cases, it runs between the esophagus and the trachea; and in 5% of cases, it passes anterior to both the trachea and esophagus.

An aberrant right subclavian artery in the adult patient usually presents with dysphagia. Symptoms are primarily for solid food and are associated with regurgitation, postprandial bloating, or chest pain. We could not find reports of an aberrant right subclavian artery resulting in esophageal foreign body impaction in adults.

The esophagus has three areas of narrowing where foreign bodies are most likely to become entrapped: the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), which consists of the cricopharyngeus muscle; the crossover of the aorta; and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Ingestion of foreign bodies is much more common in children than in adults, and considering the fact that most patients harboring an aberrant right subclavian artery are asymptomatic throughout their lifetime, the association between these two entities could be incidental.

In adults, the incidence of foreign body ingestion is rare.

### Long-term follow-up for missed cases of eosinophilic esophagitis in children with previous foreign body in the esophagus [^115rCEYU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

A foreign body impacted in the esophagus could be a sign of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Our aim was to investigate if children previously diagnosed with a foreign body in the esophagus had a missed diagnosis of EoE.

- **Methods**: In this population-based longitudinal study, all children (0–18 years) diagnosed with a foreign body in the esophagus in Stockholm, Sweden from 2006 to 2016 were identified. In addition to a review of medical files, each family was contacted (n = 325) and asked standardized questions. Children with symptoms indicating EoE were offered esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

- **Results**: We found 325 pediatric cases of foreign body. Two hundred and seven (64%) underwent an endoscopy at the event; biopsies were taken from 3, whereby 2 were diagnosed with EoE. Six additional patients were diagnosed with EoE between the initial event and the study follow-up. Children with persisting symptoms suggestive of EoE at the follow-up (n = 21) were offered EGD, whereof 7 accepted. Four new cases of EoE were found. Hence, 12 (3.7%) of the children with a previous foreign body, either spontaneously released or endoscopically removed, were diagnosed with EoE. In the structured interview, dysphagia, food impactions, drinking excessively with meals, and food allergies were significantly more common in EoE patients.

- **Conclusions**: Children with a foreign body in the esophagus are at risk of having EoE. Biopsies should be taken during foreign body removal, and questions about swallowing problems and allergic diseases should be carefully explored in these children.

### Overlooked radiographic finding results in delayed diagnosis of a retained oesophageal foreign body [^113ykZBm]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Ingestion of foreign bodies in children is a commonly occurring event worldwide. Swallowed foreign bodies usually pass successfully through the alimentary canal, from the mouth to the anus, but occasionally they may become lodged in the lumen of the oesophagus and cause complications. Accurate diagnosis of a retained foreign body is crucial in anticipating and preventing complications, but diagnostic delay can occur. We present a case of delayed diagnosis of a foreign body ingestion in an infant. Based on our experience, we emphasize the importance of accurate interpretation of X-rays, with particular attention paid to the region of highest suspicion by the first-touch physician.

### Dysphagia: A review [^114rYBVu]. The Nurse Practitioner (2020). High credibility.

Esophageal dysphagia can arise from various causes, including eosinophilic esophagitis, left atrial enlargement, Candida esophagitis, esophageal cancer, and acute pharyngitis. Other causes may include Chagas disease, achalasia, mediastinitis, esophageal foreign body, and central pontine myelinosis. Additional conditions such as globus pharyngis, carotid body tumor, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, myasthenia gravis, Gaucher disease, and myotonic dystrophy may also contribute to the development of esophageal dysphagia.

Moreover, anatomical abnormalities like a vascular ring with right aortic arch, esophageal cyst, esophageal atresia, goiter, bulbar palsy, and vagus nerve palsy can be underlying causes. Other conditions, including Zenker's diverticulum, Riedel's thyroiditis, esophageal pouch, Eagle's syndrome, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, diffuse esophageal spasm, cricopharyngeal spasm, paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, esophageal web, Barrett's esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal stricture, also warrant consideration as potential causes.

### Oesophageal dysphagia: A stepwise approach to diagnosis and management [^115yiHSc]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom in the general population, and its incidence varies depending on the specific definition used. A thorough medical history is vital for distinguishing true oesophageal dysphagia from oropharyngeal dysphagia or other causes. Oesophageal dysphagia is considered a red flag alarm symptom, necessitating oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, even after thorough investigations, including oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (with biopsy), barium swallow, and oesophageal manometry, no obstructive cause may be found. This review suggests an algorithm of history-taking and investigation to identify the causes of non-obstructive dysphagia, including functional dysphagia. It then discusses management strategies and outcomes for functional dysphagia.

### Flexible versus rigid endoscopy in the management of esophageal foreign body impaction: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112FL4jQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This study shows that rigid endoscopy (RE) still plays an important therapeutic role in patients with upper esophageal foreign body (FB) impaction, especially in the case of ingested sharp-pointed objects or when general anesthesia is recommended (i.e. in children or in patients with concomitant respiratory symptoms). In the case of a large blunt FB impaction, the excellent exposure of the upper esophagus provided by the rigid endoscope may be crucial for a safe and successful extraction.

In the 2011 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines, the decision to perform RE or flexible endoscopy (FE) was left to the clinician's judgment. Rigid esophagoscopy was considered helpful for proximal FB impacted at the upper esophageal sphincter. In contrast, in the most recent 2016 European guidelines, RE is not even mentioned. This may be due to the lack of expertise of non-ENT specialists in performing RE and to the fact that previous retrospective studies and expert opinions reported a theoretical superiority of FE over RE.

Gmeiner et al. reported higher patient comfort and lower complication rate with FE and proposed a crossover management (from FE to RE and vice versa) in case of failure of the initial treatment. Since FB impaction lasting longer than 24 hours leads to a higher risk of perforation, a multidisciplinary approach in tertiary care centers, where both FE and RE are available, may represent the safest strategy in these patients.

### Urgency of esophageal foreign body removal: Differentiation between coins and button cell batteries [^113AafdE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Coin-shaped button battery foreign bodies have a similar initial presentation to coin ingestion, but delayed retrieval of a battery from the esophagus can have devastating consequences. Variations in timing of retrieval for children with ingestion of coin foreign bodies have been reported. The study assesses the sensitivity and specificity of conventional and digital radiographs to differentiate button batteries from coin foreign bodies.

- **Study design**: 3B case-control study.

- **Study setting**: Tertiary academic medical center.

- **Methods**: A radiographic study of the 12 most common commercially available button batteries and 66 coins of varying international origins was performed. Foreign bodies were placed at the cervical esophagus of a cadaver, and anteroposterior (AP) and lateral conventional radiographs of the neck were obtained. Digital AP and lateral radiographs of standalone coins and batteries were also obtained. Images were blindly read by 2 otolaryngologists and 2 radiologists. Statistical analysis was performed to determine accuracy in identifying coins vs. batteries.

- **Results**: Using conventional radiographs to identify button batteries yielded a sensitivity of 0.88 and a specificity of 0.92 (positive predictive value [PPV] = 0.75, negative predictive value [NPV] = 0.97). Digital radiography yielded an overall sensitivity of 0.98 and specificity of 0.97 (PPV = 0.87, NPV = 0.99). Features of button batteries were only seen on AP conventional radiographs using reverse contrast.

Neither conventional nor digital radiographic imaging had perfect accuracy.

### Esophageal foreign body: A case of a neonate with stridor [^113Jt4iX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 7-week-old female with a 3-week history of progressively worsening stridor who was admitted to rule out a congenital anomaly in the airway or vasculature. After using three different imaging modalities, we discovered an esophageal foreign body causing esophagitis and proximal airway compression. Young infants with symptoms of stridor, wheezing, or retractions will often have a common diagnosis, such as a viral infectious etiology, or, in rarer cases, an anatomic anomaly. This case illustrates that the presence of a foreign body must still remain on the differential, even in this age group.

### Chronic retained foreign bodies in the esophagus [^1168W4Rv]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Two cases of esophageal perforations due to chronic retained foreign bodies are presented. In both patients, a mediastinal mass associated with the foreign body was noted on chest radiography. Retrieval of the foreign bodies, although feasible by esophagoscopy in one patient, was unsuccessful in the second patient, thus necessitating thoracotomy.

### Approach to the patient with dysphagia [^114VKEvY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a fascinating symptom. It is ostensibly simple when defined by trouble swallowing, yet its subtleties in deciphering and its variations in pathophysiology almost mandate a thorough knowledge of medicine itself. With patience and careful questioning, a multitude of various disorders may be suggested before an objective test is performed. Indeed, the ability to diligently and comprehensively explore the symptom of dysphagia is not only rewarding but also a real test for a physician who prides themselves on good history taking.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^111WCJL5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

For the purpose of this paper, an etiological classification of esophageal injuries was used, including: (1) foreign body ingestion, (2) caustic ingestion, (3) esophageal perforations (iatrogenic and spontaneous), and (4) esophageal trauma. Leading specialists in the field conducted a thorough search of MEDLINE and EMBASE for relevant papers on each of these topics between 1985 and June 2018. They were instructed to focus their search to provide evidence-based answers to pertinent questions with immediate practical application. These topics were presented and discussed at the 5th WSES Congress in Bertinoro, Italy, from June 28 to 30, 2018. The level of evidence for each recommendation statement was assigned using the grading system proposed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

Eventually, evidence-based guidelines for the management of esophageal injuries were developed to outline clinical recommendations.

Foreign body ingestion is a significant issue. In the United States, esophageal foreign body (FB) ingestion accounts for more than 100,000 cases per year. In children, accidental ingestion of coins, batteries, toys, and magnets is common. Accidental ingestions also occur in adults, often in association with intoxication or in the elderly with cognitive impairment. Intentional ingestion by patients with psychiatric disorders or by prisoners is not infrequent. Esophageal FB impaction depends on the size and shape of the FB. Impaction usually occurs at the level of the hypopharynx or in the upper thoracic esophagus for anatomical (cricopharyngeus, aortic arch) and physiological reasons.

### Migration of ingested sharp foreign body into the bronchus: A case report and review of the literature [^111LYdTS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Foreign body ingestion is a common emergency in gastroenterology. Foreign bodies are most likely to be embedded in the esophagus, and sharp ones may penetrate the esophageal wall, leading to serious complications.

- **Case presentation**: A 72-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our hospital with a 4-day history of retrosternal pain and a growing cough after eating fish. A chest computed tomography scan indicated that a high-density foreign body (a fish bone) had penetrated through the esophageal wall and inserted into the left main bronchus. Initially, we used a rigid esophagoscope to explore the esophagus under general anesthesia. However, the foreign body was not visible on the side of the esophagus. Subsequently, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed. We divided the fish bone, which traversed the left main bronchus, into two segments using a holmium laser and successfully removed the foreign body. The operation time was short, and there were no complications. The patient was discharged 1 week postoperatively and was symptom-free, even under a liquid diet.

- **Conclusions**: Managing this rare condition presents several challenges. We applied the technique of interventional bronchoscopy to manage the esophageal foreign body flexibly in an emergency, avoiding surgery that would have been more invasive and costly.

### Food allergy masquerading as foreign body obstruction [^111AB1WU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Allergic reactions to peanut and tree nuts can present as upper airway obstruction. The objective of this study is to increase awareness that food allergy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction in children.

- **Methods**: We report an allergic reaction to cashew that was initially misdiagnosed as foreign body aspiration.
- **Results**: When the presenting signs and symptoms of food allergy are limited to upper airway obstruction, they can be confused with foreign body aspiration.
- **Conclusions**: As peanuts and tree nuts are common causes of both food allergy and foreign body aspiration in children, both of these diagnoses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of airway obstruction.

### An unusual cause of chest pain: Foreign body in the oesophagus [^116LGGUk]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

This article reports on two patients who experienced unsuspected oesophageal foreign body ingestion, presenting chest pain as the main symptom. They underwent extensive cardiac evaluation to rule out myocardial ischaemia. Further evaluation revealed the presence of an impacted oesophageal foreign body. Therefore, oesophageal foreign bodies should be considered as potential factors in cases of chest pain.

### Foreign body retained in the esophagus for more than a decade: Thoracic esophagotomy for retrieval [^1166mgvs]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

A foreign body (FB) lodged in the esophagus is not uncommon. Although endoscopic removal is successful in the majority of cases, it can prove difficult for those whose foreign bodies are large or have been incarcerated for a long time. This paper describes the case of a 23-year-old woman who had an FB in her esophagus for at least 13 years. She became symptomatic 2 years before presentation but presented for treatment when dysphagia to both solids and liquids developed. Endoscopic retrieval of the incarcerated FB was unsuccessful, and she eventually required thoracotomy and esophagotomy for its extraction.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^115GWqvF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Therapeutic flexible endoscopy is recommended as first-line treatment for persistent esophageal foreign bodies (Grade 1B), although 80–90% of ingested foreign bodies pass spontaneously through the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with persistent esophageal symptoms, an endoscopic evaluation should be performed, even if the radiographic examination is negative. In patients with food bolus impaction and no evidence of complications, endoscopy may be performed first. The procedure will depend on local practices, but most cases will require anesthetic input, and often a general anesthetic with endotracheal intubation will be used to protect the airway.

- **Indications for emergent flexible endoscopy**: Emergent flexible endoscopy (preferably within 2 hours, at latest within 6 hours) is recommended for sharp-pointed objects, batteries, magnets, and for foreign bodies inducing complete esophageal obstruction (Grade 1B). Emergent flexible endoscopy should be performed in the following cases:

- Sharp-pointed objects due to the high risk of full-thickness perforation (up to 35%)
- Button/disk battery ingestion because of the risk of pressure necrosis, electrical burns, and chemical injury.
- Magnet ingestion due to pressure necrosis.
- Food bolus ingestion with complete esophageal obstruction because of the risk of aspiration as well as perforation.

An endoscopic view of esophageal injury from button battery ingestion (at 6 hours) in a 5-year-old with intellectual disability is shown in Fig. 1.

- **Urgent flexible endoscopy**: Urgent (< 24 hours) flexible endoscopy is recommended for other esophageal foreign bodies.

### Esophageal discoid foreign body detection and classification using artificial intelligence [^11515M8V]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Early and accurate radiographic diagnosis is required for managing children with radio-opaque esophageal foreign bodies. Button batteries are some of the most dangerous esophageal foreign bodies, and coins are among the most common. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence could be used to triage radiographs with esophageal button batteries and coins.

- **Objective**: Our primary objective was to train an object detector to detect esophageal foreign bodies, whether button battery or coin. Our secondary objective was to train an image classifier to classify the detected foreign body as either a button battery or a coin.

- **Materials and methods**: We trained an object detector to detect button batteries and coins. The training dataset for the object detector consisted of 57 radiographs, divided into three groups of 19 images each, featuring either an esophageal button battery, esophageal coin, or no foreign body. The foreign bodies were endoscopically confirmed, and the groups were age and gender matched. We then trained an image classifier to classify the detected foreign body as either a button battery or a coin. The training dataset for the image classifier comprised 19 radiographs of button batteries and 19 of coins, cropped from the object detector training dataset. The object detector and image classifier were then tested on 103 radiographs with an esophageal foreign body and 103 radiographs without a foreign body.

- **Results**: The object detector was 100% sensitive and specific in detecting an esophageal foreign body. The image classifier accurately classified all detected foreign bodies.

### Pediatric esophageal foreign body: Possible role for digital tomosynthesis [^111Gwok1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

Foreign body (FB) ingestion is a common reason for emergency department visits, affecting more than 80,000 children in the United States annually. While most ingested FBs are coins or other radiopaque objects, some are radiolucent FBs such as food. Digital tomosynthesis (DTS) is a radiographic technique that produces cross-sectional images with in-plane resolution similar to that of traditional radiographs. Our pilot study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of DTS to detect FB in comparison to esophagram and clinical impression.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective review on patients aged 0 to 18 years with suspected esophageal FB who received an esophagram with DTS at our institution between January 2014 and June 2016. Digital tomosynthesis images were analyzed by three readers for identification of FB impaction and compared with esophagram and discharge diagnosis. This study was approved by our local institutional review board.

- **Results**: A total of 17 patients underwent an esophagography with DTS for suspected esophageal FB, of which 9 (53%) were suspected of having an FB on esophagram. Compared with esophagram, DTS had a sensitivity of 44%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 62%. Compared with clinical impression, DTS had a sensitivity of 33%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 38%.

- **Conclusions**: This pilot study showed that chest DTS has a very high positive predictive value compared with esophagram and clinical impression in detecting radiolucent FBs.

### Foreign bodies in the esophagus [^113onfDJ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

One third of foreign bodies retained in the gastrointestinal tract are present in the esophagus. Their management depends on the anatomic location, shape and size of the foreign body, and duration of impaction.

- **Methods**: Between 1971 and 2001, 32 patients with foreign bodies in the esophagus were admitted to our service in the Wolfson Medical Center. Their charts were reviewed for preoperative diagnosis, kind and location of the foreign body, length of retention, management of patients, complications, and length of hospitalization.

- **Results**: One patient was admitted with perforation of the esophagus. Thirty of the foreign bodies were extracted at rigid esophagoscopy, and two at thoracotomy. There was one complication (tear of esophageal mucosa) and one death.

- **Conclusions**: The presence of a foreign body in the esophagus is a challenging problem. Perforations may result in death. Impaction mandates immediate extraction. Our experience indicates that the use of a rigid esophagoscope is safe and reliable. Based on this experience and that of other authors, we recommend the use of the rigid endoscope as the instrument of choice for extracting foreign bodies from the esophagus. Surgeons in training should be taught rigid esophagoscopy.

### Dysphagia: Evaluation and collaborative management [^113LqLSq]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration.

Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken.

Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment.

### Migration of ingested sharp foreign body into the bronchus: A case report and review of the literature [^115eaCxg]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old female patient was admitted for "retrosternal pain for 4 days during eating", with a previously healthy medical history. Four days prior, she experienced a foreign body sensation in the pharynx after consuming freshwater fish. Despite this, she continued eating as usual but felt retrosternal pain during meals. One day prior to admission, her pain intensified after eating rice cake and was accompanied by a severe irritant dry cough without the presence of fever, hemoptysis, or hematemesis.

She was admitted to the Regional Medical Center for the National Institute of Respiratory Disease, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. A chest plain computed tomography (CT) scan indicated a "flat esophagus and bronchial bifurcation with a high-density shadow, suggesting a foreign body of 2.8 cm length crossing the left main bronchial wall, with thickened local bronchial wall mucosa" (Figs. 1, 2). Treatment involved supportive care, including fasting, fluid infusion, and monitoring.

During the operation, a rigid esophagoscope (S121; Hangzhou Tonglu Medical Optical Instrument Co. Ltd, Zhejiang, China) was employed under general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube. A mucosal ulcer was observed at the 2 o'clock direction in the esophagus, 26 cm from the incisors, with hyperemia and swelling of the surrounding mucosa. No obvious foreign body was detected in the cavity. Using a fiberoptic bronchoscope (BF-260; Olympus Optical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) via the endotracheal tube, a needle-shaped foreign body, likely a fish bone based on medical history, was identified in the proximal part.

### Diagnostic approach to patients with suspected motility disorders: One size does not fit all [^112j9zS4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Most notably, most of the epidemiological studies in the field include only patients with typical esophageal symptoms, such as dysphagia and/or chest pain. According to guidelines, however, high-resolution manometry (HRM) is needed for the diagnosis of different entities like globus or among patients with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that do not respond to treatment. Data about the epidemiology of motility esophageal motility disorders (mEMD) among patients with non-typical symptoms are lacking.

As previously stated, HRM is the gold standard for mEMD diagnosis. Although, the initial diagnostic approach in a patient with either typical or atypical symptoms includes upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Studies indicate that the presence of compatible endoscopic findings among patients finally diagnosed with mEMD varies. Additionally, a valuable tool in the diagnostic modalities used for patients with esophageal motility disorders (EMD) is the barium swallow esophagogram. Especially since the introduction of timed-barium swallow (TBE), its diagnostic accuracy has increased, particularly in the setting of achalasia. Since TBE is easier to perform than HRM and not as expensive, its use will not be abandoned any time soon. Once again, there are insufficient data about the findings from endoscopic and barium studies among patients with non-typical esophageal symptoms referred for HRM.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of mEMD among patients with typical vs. non-typical symptoms referred for HRM in the era of the Chicago IV classification. A secondary aim of our study was to identify possible differences among findings in endoscopy and TBE between these groups.

### Foley catheter technique for the extraction of coins lodged in the upper esophagus of children [^112NzQTp]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Foreign body ingestion most commonly occurs during the toddler period of childhood due to the behavior, physiology, and anatomical characteristics of children at that age. Coins are the most frequently ingested foreign body, and the ingested coins usually become lodged within the esophagus, most commonly in the upper and middle sections.

Symptoms of the presence of esophageal coins are nonspecific and include choking, respiratory distress, wheezing, dysphagia, drooling, as well as chest and abdominal pain. The clinical findings depend on the characteristics of the foreign body ingestion, such as the degree of obstruction, the site where the foreign body is lodged, and the length of time elapsed between ingestion and evaluation.

A coin lodged in the esophagus should be considered a clinical emergency. The aims of treatment are to prevent tissue damage and decrease the risk of complications. It is important to diagnose the presence of and extract the coin from the esophagus as early as possible. The most common approach is extraction of the coin by rigid esophagoscopy under general anesthesia or, more recently, by balloon extraction under fluoroscopic guidance. However, one of these two methods requires general anesthesia, and the other requires additional exposure to radiation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate our patients who have undergone extraction of coins lodged in the esophagus retrospectively and to assess the safety of this procedure.

### Esophageal emergencies: Another important cause of acute chest pain [^113NjFDj]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with foreign body (FB) ingestions and food bolus impactions can present with retrosternal pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia. The CT appearance of various foreign bodies depends on the composition of the ingested product. Large radiopaque materials, such as batteries and metal, can be easily identified on radiograph and CT. However, an awareness of medical devices, such as transesophageal voice prostheses, is required to avoid mistaking them for abnormal foreign bodies.

Although 80–90% of ingested foreign bodies pass spontaneously, endoscopic intervention is needed in 10–20% of patients. According to clinical guidelines from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, emergent therapeutic endoscopic intervention (within 2–6 hours) is indicated for:

- **Complete esophageal obstruction**: Foreign bodies causing this condition result in an inability to tolerate secretions.
- **Sharp-pointed objects and disk batteries**: These are due to the increased risk of perforation, mucosal damage, and bleeding.

Retrospective studies have shown that delayed therapeutic endoscopy, greater than one day, in patients with sharp foreign body impactions, results in increased complications, especially among the elderly. Urgent endoscopic intervention (within 24 hours) is indicated for partial esophageal obstruction. Emergent surgical intervention is required in patients with esophageal perforation or failed endoscopic retrieval.

### Esophageal perforation caused by edible foreign bodies: A systematic review of the literature [^114ywxfd]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Presentation of a case of esophageal perforation caused by ingestion of a foreign body that was difficult to visualize endoscopically, and a systematic review of the literature with a focus on available diagnostic modalities and missed diagnoses.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE (1946–2014).

- **Review methods**: We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE for cases and studies of esophageal perforation due to foreign bodies.

- **Results**: A systematic review of esophageal perforations caused by foreign bodies revealed 40 studies that included 168 patients. Neck/chest pain, odynophagia, and dysphagia were the most common presenting symptoms, each occurring in the majority of patients. Where reported, diagnostic sensitivity of lateral neck X-rays was 56%, and computed tomography (CT) scan was 100%. Nine of 168 cases specifically mentioned a missed diagnosis. Very few studies reported a failure to visualize the foreign object at the time of primary rigid or flexible esophagoscopy. No studies reported nonvisualization of the foreign body at the time of open surgery.

- **Conclusion**: Esophageal perforations due to foreign bodies are rare but carry potentially devastating complications. Delays in diagnosis are common, and no standard diagnostic algorithm exists. Lateral neck X-rays are an easy but insensitive screening test. Laryngoscopy is an excellent screening test but not always diagnostic. CT is a more sensitive diagnostic method, which can also help guide management based on the detection of complications. Although seldom described, if an object is not visualized at…

### Hypopharyngeal venous malformation presenting with foreign body sensation and dysphagia [^1133DXxx]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Review the importance of imaging selection and clinicoanatomic correlation for vascular malformations presenting with unique symptomatology.

- **Methods**: Case study and literature review.

- **Results**: A 64-year-old female presented with globus and dysphagia ongoing for 40 years. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy discovered a hypopharyngeal mass. A CT scan showed a soft tissue mass with shotty calcifications. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed a bluish compressible mass. MRI showed T2 hyperintensity with heterogeneous enhancement, resulting in the diagnosis of a low-flow vascular malformation.

- **Conclusions**: All globus is not equal. Attention to symptoms, anatomy, and imaging selection is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of vascular malformations uniquely presenting with dysphagia.

### Endoscopic removal of esophageal foreign body embedded in muscularis propria [^113XacB8]. Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

A 53-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of retrosternal pain after the ingestion of hard food. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest indicated a transverse high-density opacity in the middle of the esophagus, extending into the right mediastinum. Esophagoscopy showed edema of the mucosa and granulation tissue at the right posterior esophageal wall 31 cm from the incisors, surface erosion with a small amount of purulent discharge, and no foreign body found in the lumen. Ultrasonography suggested a hyperechoic area in the right posterior muscularis propria layer of the esophagus, connected to a hypoechoic lesion outside the esophagus. Imaging indicated an entirely embedded esophagus-penetrating foreign body and mediastinal abscess. A routine chest and enhanced CT scan revealed a high-density line, 22.9 mm in length, embedded in the middle esophagus and protruding into the mediastinum, with uneven soft tissue enhancement. No vascular injury was detected.

- **Illustration of the major steps involved in endoscopic removal**:
	- Endoscopic removal of the entirely embedded esophagus-penetrating foreign body in a 53-year-old man presenting with a 3-week history of retrosternal pain.
	- Visualization of the foreign body under endoscopic ultrasonography.
	- Visualization of the foreign body under enhanced computed tomography.
	- Visualization of the granulation tissue protruding from the posterior esophageal mucosa with a small amount of purulent discharge.

### Application of a double-balloon method to remove button battery at the entrance of esophagus in a 17-month-old child: a case report [^114jyuNA]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Children have a strong desire for exploration but poor safety awareness, making foreign body impaction in the digestive tract one of the most common critical conditions among them. Due to the popularity of electronic products, the accidental ingestion of button batteries by children is increasing. When button batteries become impacted in the esophagus, they can cause serious complications such as esophageal cauterization and perforation within a short time span. Therefore, more active treatment strategies should be implemented once button battery ingestion occurs. Surgical treatment often causes trauma and various complications, making endoscopic removal of foreign bodies in the esophagus the preferred approach.

- **Case presentation**: We introduced a new method for removing a button battery retained in the esophagus of a 17-month-old child. Once the patient arrived at the hospital, endoscopic surgery was arranged promptly. Upon entry, the gastroscope at the esophageal inlet helped clean up esophageal residues, exposing the button battery. The surrounding esophageal mucosa exhibited minor cauterization-like damage. Initial attempts to remove the foreign body using forceps were unsuccessful after repeated tries. When we attempted to use a disposable balloon to assist in dragging the foreign body, it failed due to the patient's younger age, narrower esophagus, and abnormal drag resistance of the foreign body. Violent dragging presented risks of tearing and perforating the esophagus. Consequently, we employed a columnar balloon to…

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^116Qdh1m]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Which are the appropriate biochemical and imaging investigations?

Initial evaluation should be based on the patient's history and physical examination. Recommended biochemical investigations include complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), blood gas analysis for base excess, and lactate (Grade 2C).

Neck, chest, and abdominal radiographs are useful to assess the presence, location, shape, and size of radiopaque or unknown shape objects (Grade 1C). Plain neck, chest, and abdominal radiographs are particularly useful for assessing the presence, location, size, shape, and number of ingested objects and possible signs of perforation. Although usually employed for initial screening, plain radiography has a false-negative rate up to 47%.

- **Biplanar radiography**: Useful to reduce the false-negative rate. The lateral projection is important for differentiating between tracheobronchial and esophageal foreign bodies (FBs). In cases of food bolus impaction, thin metal objects, wood and plastic objects, glass fragments, fish or chicken bones, false-negative rates at the X-ray evaluation can be up to 85%.

Computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed in patients with suspected perforation or other complications that may require interventional endoscopy or surgery (Grade 1B). In a prospective single-center study including 358 adult patients with symptomatic fish bones impaction, the sensitivity of plain X-ray was 32%, while the sensitivity of CT scan was 90–100%, with specificity ranging from 93.7–100%. For this reason, the CT scan should be considered an essential tool in adult patients reporting accidental ingestion or suspected complications.

Ingested foreign bodies that migrate extraluminally are rare. In such cases, exploration of the neck via an external approach is the recommended procedure to remove the object. However, locating such a foreign body can be a difficult task. We report what we believe is the first adult case of fluoroscopically guided localization of an accidentally ingested foreign body that had migrated into the soft tissues of the neck. We also review the other methods used to locate a migrating foreign body.

### Diagnostic approach to patients with suspected motility disorders: One size does not fit all [^111rmcwL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

- **What is already known**: Dysphagia and retrosternal chest pain are considered typical manifestations of major esophageal motility disorders, although in many patients with non-typical symptoms, motility disorders are suspected as the origin of their symptoms. High-resolution manometry (HRM) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of motility disorders. There are insufficient data regarding the findings of endoscopy and barium studies in patients with non-typical esophageal symptoms referred for HRM.

- **What the new findings are**: In the absence of typical symptoms, a lack of compatible endoscopic and timed-barium swallow findings almost completely rules out a diagnosis of major esophageal motility disorders (mEMD). More than half of the patients referred for HRM will be diagnosed with mEMD, and the rate will be higher when typical symptoms are reported. Achalasia, and especially type II achalasia, is the most commonly diagnosed major motility disorder, even among patients with non-typical esophageal symptoms.

### Esophageal manometry, pH testing, endoscopy, and videofluoroscopy in patients with globus sensation [^111fgvRd]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Low credibility.

Combine techniques commonly employed in the clinical workup of patients with isolated globus sensation to identify the most common pharyngoesophageal abnormality. The primary aim was to retrospectively review high-resolution manometry, pH probe testing, contrast videofluoroscopy, and endoscopy studies in patients with a primary complaint of globus sensation. The specific hypothesis was that esophageal high-resolution manometry identifies the most significant proportion of abnormalities compared to all other modalities.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Methods**: An inclusive retrospective chart review was performed for patients evaluated between 2009 and 2016 with the primary complaint of globus sensation. Age at testing, self-identified gender, associated diagnoses, and results from each modality were collected. Descriptive statistics and pairwise comparisons were performed as well as sensitivity and specificity calculations.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-two patients met the inclusion criteria. The cohort had an age range of 22.7 to 88.5 years and was predominantly female. Esophageal manometry identified abnormalities in 62.8% of patients, and pH testing identified abnormal acidification in approximately 20%. The esophagram identified abnormalities in 24% of patients, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified abnormalities in 22%. Modified barium swallows were normal in 93% of patients. Measures of sensitivity and specificity of other modalities were poor compared to esophageal manometry and pH testing.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with isolated globus sensation…

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^114Q8dip]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The esophagus traverses three body compartments (neck, thorax, and abdomen) and is surrounded at each level by vital organs. Injuries to the esophagus may be classified as foreign body ingestion, caustic ingestion, esophageal perforation, and esophageal trauma. These lesions can be life-threatening either by digestive contamination of surrounding structures in case of esophageal wall breach or concomitant damage of surrounding organs. Early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention are the keys to successful management.

### Guideline for the management of ingested foreign bodies [^113y3ADM]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

This text is part of a series discussing the utilization of gastrointestinal endoscopy in common clinical situations, prepared by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. In preparing this guideline, a MEDLINE literature search was performed, and additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of the identified articles and recommendations from expert consultants. When little or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and reports from recognized experts. Guidelines for appropriate utilization of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus. Further controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify aspects of this statement, and revision may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical consideration may justify a course of action at variance with these recommendations.

### Thoracoscopic removal of dental prosthesis impacted in the upper thoracic esophagus [^1165JTyp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Accidental ingestion of foreign bodies is frequent in adult individuals with mental retardation or psychiatric disorders. Most ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without consequences. However, 10–20% of patients may require endoscopic removal, and 1% or less may require surgery due to entrapment of the foreign body in the cervical (57%), thoracic (26%), or distal (17%) esophagus. Dental appliances are the most common cause of accidental foreign body esophageal impaction, especially in the elderly population with decreased oral sensory perception. The large size, sharp edges, and metal clasps of dental prostheses make endoscopic removal unsafe and carry a high risk of perforation. We present a case of successful thoracoscopic removal of a dental prosthesis impacted in the upper thoracic esophagus.

### Globus: Current concepts and dilemmas [^111rwSPH]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Globus is an area of interest for many medical specialists, including otorhinolaryngologists, gastroenterologists, allergists, and psychiatrists. It may be caused by an organic disease, but it is not uncommon that an underlying etiology remains unidentified even following a full workup has been performed. Patients who suffer from globus usually visit several physicians from different specialties without finding a solution for their symptoms. Identifying the underlying cause of globus is not always a simple task; therefore, structural or functional abnormalities of the thyroid, larynx, pharynx, and esophagus should be investigated.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease is commonly considered to be the underlying cause after being identified in an otorhinolaryngeal (ear, nose, and throat) evaluation, which is usually the first diagnostic step. In the last few years, an inlet patch in the proximal esophagus has been shown to be associated with globus, and its elimination has resulted in symptom resolution in some patients. Finally, globus can be associated with psychiatric disorders as well as oropharyngeal hypersensitivity that could be either chemical or mechanical. Treatment is directed toward an identified organic cause; in those with a functional disorder, the mainstay of therapy includes neuromodulators and psychiatric/psychological interventions.

### Foreign body impaction as presentation of eosinophilic esophagitis [^114czBGv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Esophageal foreign body is a frequent pediatric presentation, and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an important underlying disease. To determine characteristics common in the presentation of esophageal foreign body indicative of underlying EoE and reach a recommendation for the appropriate scenario in which to obtain esophageal mucosal biopsy, 312 pediatric esophageal foreign bodies requiring operative removal were reviewed. Patients older than 18 years or with a known history of esophageal surgery or pathology were excluded. Eligibility criteria were met in 271 cases. Twenty-seven patients were biopsied, and 18 were diagnosed with EoE. The following factors were identified in the EoE population: food impaction (89%), older age (average 12.2 years), male sex (78%), atopic disease (61%), previous esophageal foreign body or frequent dysphagia (83%), and endoscopic abnormalities (100%). These factors are all associated with an underlying diagnosis of EoE, and patients meeting these criteria should be strongly considered for intraoperative esophageal mucosal biopsy.

### The role of esophageal hypersensitivity in functional esophageal disorders [^111ptpcU]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The Rome IV diagnostic criteria delineate five functional esophageal disorders: functional chest pain, functional heartburn, reflux hypersensitivity, globus, and functional dysphagia. These are a heterogeneous group of disorders which, despite having characteristic symptom profiles attributable to esophageal pathology, fail to demonstrate any structural, motility, or inflammatory abnormalities on standard clinical testing. These disorders are associated with a marked reduction in patient quality of life, using considerable healthcare resources. Furthermore, the pathophysiology of these disorders is incompletely understood. This narrative review provides an introductory primer on the structure and function of esophageal perception, including nociception that forms the basis of the putative mechanisms that may give rise to symptoms in functional esophageal disorders. The review also discusses the provocative techniques and outcome measures by which esophageal hypersensitivity can be established.

### Hide and seek: A case of almost missed ingested foreign body [^1117GTLc]. Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old female was referred to our hospital requiring endoscopic removal of an ingested foreign body. She swallowed a fishbone a day ago, resulting in a persistent foreign body sensation in the esophagus. Computed tomography reported a high-density shadow about 2 cm in length located at the level of the esophageal entranceway (Fig. 1). Therefore, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. However, no foreign object or wound was found in the upper gastrointestinal tract after repeated inspection (Fig. 2). Consequently, the foreign body was considered to have already been discharged into the middle/lower digestive tract, and foreign body removal was abandoned.

Careful observation was continued until the endoscope was retracted into the mouth. Suddenly, a surprise occurred — a thin and transparent fishbone was found inserted in the glottis and aligned parallel with the left vocal cord (Fig. 3). Foreign body removal was carried out immediately to prevent its displacement (Fig. 4). The fishbone was successfully removed with biopsy forceps (Video 1 and Fig. 5). Specific foreign body forceps were not used because the foreign body was too thin to be firmly clamped.

### Diagnostic evaluation of dysphagia [^1153PJYZ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Taking a careful history is vital for the evaluation of dysphagia. The history will yield the likely underlying pathophysiologic process and anatomic site of the problem in most patients and is crucial for determining whether subsequently detected radiographic or endoscopic 'anomalies' are relevant or incidental. Although the symptoms of pharyngeal dysphagia can be multiple and varied, the typical features of neurogenic pharyngeal dysphagia are highly specific and can accurately distinguish pharyngeal from esophageal disorders. The history will also dictate whether the next diagnostic procedure should be endoscopy, a barium swallow, or esophageal manometry. In some difficult cases, all three diagnostic techniques may need to be performed to establish an accurate diagnosis. Stroke is the most common cause of pharyngeal dysphagia. A videoradiographic swallow study is vital in such cases to determine the extent and timing of aspiration and the severity and mechanics of dysfunction as a prelude to therapy.

### Complications of foreign bodies in the esophagus [^111FLCnZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Major complications of foreign bodies in the esophagus carry significant risks of morbidity and mortality. A retrospective case-control study was conducted to assess the factors associated with major complications. In total, 273 patients seen over a 7-year period were divided into two groups: 253 had no or minor complications, and 20 had major complications. Age, sex, duration of the foreign body, total white cell count (TWC), and the nature and site of the foreign body were analyzed in both groups. The major complication rate was 7.3%. Duration of the foreign body and TWC were the only statistically significant factors associated with major complications. Six patients required open neck exploration, one had an open thoracotomy, and 13 were treated by endoscopic removal. There were two deaths. Given the significant morbidity and mortality risks, we conclude that patients with a prolonged history of a foreign body in the esophagus and a raised TWC should be treated urgently.

### Removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) clinical guideline [^115UugNu]. Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

This guideline is an official statement of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). It addresses the removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults.

- **Recommendations**:
	- **Nonendoscopic measures**:
		1. ESGE recommends diagnostic evaluation based on the patient's history and symptoms. A physical examination focused on the patient's general condition and to assess signs of any complications is recommended (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
		2. Radiological evaluation is not recommended for patients with nonbony food bolus impaction without complications. Plain radiography is recommended to assess the presence, location, size, configuration, and number of ingested foreign bodies if ingestion of radiopaque objects is suspected or if the type of object is unknown (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
		3. Computed tomography (CT) scan is recommended in all patients with suspected perforation or other complications that may require surgery (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
		4. Barium swallow is not recommended due to the risk of aspiration and worsening of endoscopic visualization (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
		5. Clinical observation without the need for endoscopic removal is recommended for the management of asymptomatic patients with ingestion of blunt and small objects (except batteries and magnets). If feasible, outpatient management is appropriate (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
		6. Close observation is recommended for asymptomatic individuals who have concealed packets of drugs.

### A new trend in the management of esophageal foreign body: Transnasal esophagoscopy [^113LfcFP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The study aimed to analyze the outcomes of patients with esophageal foreign bodies managed by transnasal esophagoscopy and to evaluate the value of lateral neck X-ray.

- **Study design**: Case series with chart review.
- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center, Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.
- **Subjects and methods**: Lateral neck X-ray was used for initial screening in patients suspected of having an esophageal foreign body between 2007 and 2013. Rigid esophagoscopy was used as the standard for further investigations before July 2010 and was replaced by transnasal esophagoscopy after that point.

- **Results**: From January 2007 to June 2010, 43 patients who were suspected of having an esophageal foreign body underwent rigid esophagoscopy, with 31 confirmed cases. From July 2010 to December 2013, 302 patients underwent transnasal esophagoscopy, revealing an esophageal foreign body in only 52 patients. For those 302 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of lateral neck X-ray in detecting an esophageal foreign body were 59% and 83%, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The introduction of transnasal esophagoscopy has altered the diagnosis and management of esophageal foreign bodies. It is a quick and safe procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia and might replace lateral neck X-ray as the initial screening procedure, becoming a useful treatment for patients with an esophageal foreign body.

### Value of helical computed tomography in the early diagnosis of esophageal foreign bodies in adults [^116T4zey]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

To investigate the relationship between early use of computed tomography (CT) and complications associated with esophageal foreign body impaction in adults, a retrospective study was performed on 120 patients (63 females, 57 males, median age 50 years) with a history of foreign bodies. All had negative findings on clinical examination. All cases underwent unenhanced helical CT, and patients with positive findings underwent esophagoscopy within 6 hours. All patients were followed up postoperatively.

CT demonstrated 100% sensitivity, 92.6% specificity, 100% negative predictive value, and 97.9% positive predictive value. Esophageal foreign bodies were associated with a high incidence of complications in adults, and there was a significant difference in the incidence of complications between different durations of impaction (P < .01). In total, 37 patients presented with complications: 32 patients with grade I, 3 with grade II, 2 with grade III, and 0 with grade IV.

Esophageal foreign bodies were associated with a high incidence of complications in adults. CT could detect foreign bodies accurately in the early stages, and then FBs could be removed as early as possible, which may reduce the incidence of complications. Moreover, the great majority of complications were of lower grades. Thus, CT may be a useful first-line radiological tool for the early diagnosis of esophageal foreign bodies in adults.

### Video-mediastinoscope: For extracting upper esophageal foreign bodies [^115bvF7F]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with esophageal foreign bodies require prompt diagnosis and therapy. The proximal dilatation method using a video-mediastinoscope is safe and effective in removing sharp foreign bodies from the upper esophagus, avoiding surgery and possible perforation. The technique proved to be effective and safe, possibly marking the first use of this procedure in the literature. We recommend using a video-mediastinoscope for extracting foreign bodies involving the upper esophagus narrowing.

### Esnm/anms review. Diagnosis and management of globus sensation: A clinical challenge [^113ED8S8]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

Globus is a non-painful sensation of tightness or a lump/foreign body in the throat that is not associated with dysphagia and may actually improve during meals. Several otorhinolaryngologic, thyroid, and esophageal disorders have been linked to globus; however, cause-and-effect relationships are difficult to establish. Consequently, though part of the evaluation, objective otorhinolaryngologic and esophageal testing is often negative. The presence of alarm symptoms, particularly pain, weight loss, dysphagia, or odynophagia, indicates the need for objective testing.

A diagnosis of idiopathic globus requires exclusion of pharyngeal, laryngeal, and esophageal disorders using laryngoscopy, endoscopy, high-resolution manometry, barium radiography, and/or ambulatory reflux monitoring. A trial of acid-suppressive therapy may be reasonable in the absence of alarm symptoms, especially if reflux symptoms are identified. Ablation of heterotopic gastric mucosa in the proximal esophagus has been reported to improve globus symptoms.

Beyond these specific approaches, further management of idiopathic globus consists of reassurance, neuromodulators, and complementary approaches. Globus has a benign course with no long-term consequences, and the overall prognosis is good as the magnitude of symptoms may decline over time.

### Esophageal emergencies: Another important cause of acute chest pain [^114roZ2s]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Computed tomography is an excellent first-line imaging modality for evaluating the esophagus in the emergent setting. It is fast, readily available, and offers the highest spatial resolution for assessing the extent of esophageal injuries and the surrounding mediastinum. The esophagus is partially visualized on neck, abdomen, and thoracic spine CT, and the thoracic esophagus is fully identified on chest CT. Administration of oral contrast in the acute setting is not standardized practice, but it can potentially elucidate esophageal wall injury with the presence of extraluminal contrast material. If suspicion of esophageal pathology is raised on an initial unenhanced study, a CT esophagography can be performed in patients too sick for fluoroscopic evaluation. In this setting, CT from the thoracic inlet to the diaphragm can be performed after quickly administering an approximately 50 mL solution containing 10% intravenous iodinated contrast material, water, and effervescent granules.

The normal esophageal wall thickness on CT varies depending on anatomical location, degree of distension, and sex, ranging from 1.9 to 5.68 mm, with the thickest area in the abdominal esophagus during contraction. While the esophagus is decompressed in the majority of studies, a normal air column can measure up to 10 mm in transverse dimension and up to 15 mm in the segment of the esophagus between the cardiac ventricles and the gastroesophageal junction. Although the degree of tissue delineation is better appreciated with increased mediastinal fat, further details can enhance diagnostic accuracy.

### Calcification of the epiglottis presenting as foreign body sensation in the neck [^1117wNgd]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The epiglottis plays an important role in preventing food of different consistencies from entering the airway during swallowing. Calcification of the epiglottis can potentially alter and limit its movement, causing aspiration among other swallowing problems. Isolated calcification of the epiglottis and its clinical presentation remains a poorly understood entity for radiologists as well as clinicians. Therefore, it is important to recognize the imaging features of epiglottic calcification and its known clinical presentations to help clinicians with early diagnosis and management.

### Suspected esophageal coin — look again [^115XfWz5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A 4-year-old presented to the emergency department, asymptomatic, with the strong suspicion (by history, physical examination, and initial radiographic interpretation by the emergency physician) of an esophageal coin. Closer inspection revealed radiographic signs associated with disk battery ingestion, a surgical emergency. In the operating room, superimposed coins, mimicking the radiographic appearance of a disk (button) battery, were extracted. This case highlights the important management differences between ingested coins and batteries, the need for cautious interpretation of radiographs, and presents a rare mimic of a serious ingestion.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^116LiMAg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The esophagus traverses three body compartments (neck, thorax, and abdomen) and is surrounded at each level by vital organs. Injuries to the esophagus may be classified as foreign body ingestion, caustic ingestion, esophageal perforation, and esophageal trauma. These lesions can be life-threatening either by digestive contamination of surrounding structures in case of esophageal wall breach or concomitant damage of surrounding organs. Early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention are the keys to successful management.

### Consultations for foreign bodies in aerodigestive tract: Assessment of diagnostic modalities [^114Kq1CW]. The Laryngoscope (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the test characteristics of various diagnostic modalities in the workup of foreign body (FB) sensation in the aerodigestive tract.

The methods involved using a database containing all inpatient otolaryngology consultations between 2008 and 2020. Cases of FB sensation were identified by documented encounter diagnosis or hospital problem of FB or globus sensation. Variables including basic patient demographics, clinical presentations, diagnostic imaging modalities, procedures, and outpatient follow-up were collected.

Results indicated that one hundred and six patients were included in the study. A FB was visualized in 55 patients (52%) and removed in 52 patients (49%); 3 patients had a FB that was visualized initially but not found in the operating room. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were found to be 41%, 50%, 58%, and 33%, respectively, for X-ray (XR); 91%, 61%, 70%, and 87%, respectively, for computed tomography (CT). Sensitivity and NPV were 25% and 57%, respectively, for flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FFL). Seventy-one of 106 patients (67%) underwent invasive interventions during their workup for FBs. Ten out of 11 (91%) chicken bones were found in the digestive tract compared to 7 out of 19 (37%) fishbones (p = 0.0046).

The conclusion suggests that in patients with a history of FB ingestion, CT may be more beneficial than XR as a screening tool for locating foreign bodies and guiding further management. FFL alone is inadequate for ruling out a FB in the aerodigestive tract given FB's high likelihood of being in the esophagus.

### Removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) clinical guideline [^115twbAs]. Endoscopy (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for foreign body ingestion, and more specifically in reference to endoscopic removal, the ESGE 2016 guidelines recommend performing emergent therapeutic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, preferably within 2 hours and at the latest within 6 hours, for foreign bodies inducing complete esophageal obstruction, as well as for sharp-pointed objects or batteries in the esophagus. An urgent therapeutic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, within 24 hours, should be performed for other esophageal foreign bodies without complete obstruction.
