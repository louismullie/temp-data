## Question

should sternoclavicular joint mri be done with or without contrast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sternoclavicular joint MRI should be performed with or without contrast. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the general musculoskeletal MRI principles and when contrast adds diagnostic value. Then, I should verify SCJ-specific evidence across key indications: infection, trauma/instability, inflammatory arthritis, and tumor. Next, I will consider pediatric versus adult nuances, scan efficiency, and anesthesia needs. Finally, I need to check safety considerations around gadolinium and propose pragmatic protocol suggestions before synthesizing an indication-based recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the overarching MSK imaging framework. Most routine joint MRIs for pain and internal derangement are accurately performed without contrast, but contrast is classically added for suspected infection, tumor, or rheumatologic/inflammatory disease because enhancement patterns refine diagnosis and staging; this aligns with appropriateness guidance that endorses IV-contrast MRI when spinal or paraspinal infection is suspected, which is conceptually analogous for adjacent cervicothoracic structures including the SCJ region [^114BHk1j] [^117MvHAM].

> Now, focusing on infection of the SCJ, I initially find myself thinking, "Contrast is always required for suspected SCJ infection", because classic imaging in pediatric SCJ septic arthritis demonstrates conspicuous post-contrast synovial enhancement, marrow changes, and soft-tissue involvement that correlate with operative purulence, which is compelling; however, wait, let me verify whether non-contrast protocols can substitute effectively. A recent rapid pediatric MSK infection protocol eliminated contrast entirely, leveraged fluid-sensitive and diffusion-weighted sequences, and maintained diagnostic performance while cutting time to scan, scan duration, and anesthesia rates, suggesting that in children with suspected SCJ infection a non-contrast DWI-based protocol can be sufficient when optimized and available; in adults, evidence remains more limited, so I should be cautious and not overgeneralize beyond pediatrics [^111vAko7] [^112Pk2Ag].

> For trauma and instability, hold on, I should verify whether enhancement truly changes management. MRI's value here is in delineating articular disk tears, capsuloligamentous injuries, subluxation direction, and, in younger patients, distinguishing physeal injury from true dislocation; none of these require contrast because morphology on T1 and fluid-sensitive sequences suffices, and the literature describing SCJ trauma MRI does not mandate gadolinium for diagnostic clarity [^111yGy5z] [^111EjNM3] [^114MTGcR].

> Regarding tumors and tumor-like conditions, let me consider local staging and biopsy planning. Contrast-enhanced MRI helps identify vascularized, viable tumor components, avoids necrotic sampling, and refines assessment of marrow and soft-tissue extension, which is critical for surgical planning; although advanced iron-oxide agents like ferumoxytol have research applications for discerning infiltration patterns, these are not standard, so I should still recommend gadolinium-enhanced MRI when the SCJ mass raises neoplastic concern [^111L912Z] [^115sn78M].

> Next, inflammatory arthritides. I need to check how enhancement informs activity assessment. Dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted techniques can quantify synovitis and treatment response in the cranio-cervical region, and pediatric inflammatory arthritis protocols generally include contrast because synovial enhancement is the key biomarker of active disease; the SCJ is frequently involved in SAPHO and psoriatic-spectrum disorders, where MRI detects active anterior chest wall disease without radiation, so contrast assists in grading activity when that quantification will influence therapy [^1148ExDn] [^113XCAy5] [^113xJxQc].

> I should also weigh pediatric workflow and anesthesia. The rapid non-contrast pediatric infection protocol reduced anesthesia from 53% to 4% and cut both time to MRI and scan duration dramatically, without sacrificing accuracy; but wait, I need to ensure I don't extrapolate this wholesale to adults or to inflammatory quantification, where contrast may still be preferred until equivalent adult data or indication-specific validations are available [^112Pk2Ag].

> Safety can't be ignored. I need to confirm gadolinium risks and contraindications. Gadolinium-based agents are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity, and although acute reactions are rare, severe anaphylaxis can occur, including in children, so contrast use should be indication-driven and risk-balanced; macrocyclic agents such as gadobutrol are widely used and have favorable stability profiles, but the presence of a prior GBCA reaction or strong atopic history should prompt a non-contrast approach when feasible [^112excdm] [^115aLYDU] [^114yazkg].

> Before finalizing, I should double-check protocol specifics and pitfalls. For contrast-enhanced studies, pre- and post-contrast T1 fat-suppressed imaging plus fluid-sensitive sequences provide the necessary assessment; for non-contrast infection protocols, high-resolution T2/STIR with DWI is the backbone, and multiplanar verification prevents misclassification. But wait, I must remember that WB-MRI studies show inflammatory-mimicking signal at the sterno-costo-clavicular region even in healthy individuals, so I need to correlate clinically and avoid overcalling subtle marrow edema without supportive features or enhancement if contrast is used [^112Pk2Ag] [^115heqc3] [^113XCAy5].

> Putting this together, the decision is indication-dependent, not "always with" or "always without". I recommend MRI with contrast when evaluating suspected SCJ infection in adults, tumor or tumor-like masses, or when quantifying active inflammatory arthritis where enhancement will change management; I recommend MRI without contrast for trauma and instability, and I consider a validated rapid non-contrast, DWI-inclusive protocol for pediatric infections when available, recognizing that adult infection workflows still commonly favor contrast pending broader validation. Final selection should integrate the primary clinical question, patient age and sedation needs, prior GBCA reactions, and institutional protocol capabilities, acknowledging that enhancement patterns provide critical information in infection, tumor, and inflammatory indications whereas morphology alone suffices in trauma [^114BHk1j] [^117MvHAM] [^111L912Z] [^1148ExDn] [^111yGy5z] [^112Pk2Ag].

---

Routine sternoclavicular joint MRI should be performed **without contrast** [^114BHk1j]. Contrast is **only indicated when there is a specific clinical suspicion** of infection [^117MvHAM], malignancy [^111L912Z], or inflammatory arthritis [^1148ExDn], as it helps detect synovial enhancement, abscesses, or tumor infiltration. For most cases of trauma [^111yGy5z], degenerative disease [^114BHk1j], or instability [^114MTGcR], **non-contrast MRI is sufficient** and avoids unnecessary risks and costs [^112Pk2Ag].

---

## Clinical indications for MRI of the SCJ

MRI is **indicated for SCJ evaluation** in the following scenarios:

- **Trauma**: Suspected ligamentous injury, dislocation, or physeal injury, particularly in younger patients [^111yGy5z].

- **Degenerative disease**: Evaluation of osteoarthritis or degenerative changes [^113QEJWY].

- **Inflammatory arthritis**: Suspected rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory arthropathies [^112fyUor] [^113XCAy5].

- **Infection**: Suspected septic arthritis or osteomyelitis [^111vAko7] [^115h3xfC].

- **Neoplasm**: Suspected primary or metastatic tumors involving the SCJ [^111L912Z] [^116dgYbu].

---

## Diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced MRI

Contrast-enhanced MRI provides **additional diagnostic information** in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Infection**: Contrast enhancement helps identify synovial inflammation, abscess formation, and extent of infection, which may not be clearly visible on non-contrast MRI [^111vAko7] [^115uVviC].

- **Inflammatory arthritis**: Contrast-enhanced MRI is useful for detecting synovitis [^113XCAy5] and active inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions [^112fyUor].

- **Neoplasm**: Contrast enhancement aids in differentiating benign from malignant lesions, assessing tumor vascularity, and delineating tumor margins [^111L912Z] [^111bR4Zf].

In routine clinical practice, most musculoskeletal MRI studies, including SCJ MRI, **are performed without contrast** unless there is specific clinical suspicion of infection, malignancy, or inflammatory arthritis [^114BHk1j] [^111hqvFp].

---

## Diagnostic value of non-contrast MRI

Non-contrast MRI is **sufficient for most routine clinical indications** involving the SCJ, including:

- **Trauma**: Ligamentous injuries, dislocations, and physeal injuries can be adequately evaluated without contrast [^111yGy5z] [^114MTGcR].

- **Degenerative disease**: Osteoarthritis and degenerative changes are clearly visible on non-contrast MRI [^113QEJWY].

- **Instability**: Chronic instability and subluxation can be assessed without contrast [^113QEJWY].

Non-contrast MRI **avoids risks** associated with contrast agents, such as allergic reactions [^114yazkg] and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [^114JU4xB], and is generally faster and less expensive [^112Pk2Ag].

---

## Risks and benefits of contrast agents

Contrast agents, particularly gadolinium-based agents, carry **risks**, including rare allergic reactions that can include anaphylaxis [^114yazkg], and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis — a rare but serious condition associated with gadolinium-based contrast agents — particularly in patients with renal impairment [^114JU4xB] [^115aLYDU] [^112excdm]. They also increase cost and examination time compared with non-contrast studies [^112Pk2Ag]. However, in selected clinical scenarios — such as infection, inflammatory arthritis, and neoplasm — the diagnostic benefits of contrast-enhanced MRI often outweigh these risks [^111vAko7] [^113XCAy5] [^111L912Z].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend **reserving contrast-enhanced MRI** for specific scenarios, such as suspected infection, malignancy, or inflammatory arthritis. Routine SCJ MRI for trauma, degenerative disease, or instability does not require contrast enhancement [^117MvHAM] [^114BHk1j].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine SCJ MRI should be **performed without contrast** [^114BHk1j]. Contrast-enhanced MRI should be **reserved** for suspected infection, malignancy, or inflammatory arthritis [^111vAko7] [^111L912Z] [^113XCAy5]. The decision to use contrast should be **based on clinical suspicion and the diagnostic question** [^111hqvFp].

### Delayed diagnosis of pediatric sternoclavicular joint infections and clavicular osteomyelitis during the COVID-19 pandemic: A report of 3 cases [^111vAko7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2022). High credibility.

Patient 1 is a 14-year-old adolescent boy who presented with dyspnea and left-sided neck and chest pain. He was initially seen at three different facilities, where his condition was misdiagnosed as a pulled muscle and later as cellulitis, for which he was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Strep throat, infectious mononucleosis, COVID-19, and influenza tests returned negative results.

His symptoms had persisted for 5 days by the time of arrival. On physical examination, he exhibited mild erythema of the left anterior chest wall and a palpable nodule adjacent to the clavicle. The range of motion in his left shoulder was limited due to anterior chest wall pain. Laboratory results indicated an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 31 mm/h, c-reactive protein (CRP) at 6.15 mg/dL, and fibrinogen at 549 mg/dL. He commenced treatment with intravenous (IV) vancomycin and ceftriaxone. CT imaging suggested cellulitis of the anterosuperior left chest wall, while an MRI showed diffuse cellulitis, subperiosteal effusion, and possible sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) septic arthritis.

- **Patient imaging findings**: Preoperative coronal T1 postcontrast and T2 axial images revealed evidence of left SCJ infection with a large effusion of the SCJ, subperiosteal fluid without contrast enhancement, chest wall edema, and intramedullary edema indicative of early osteomyelitis. During surgery, purulence was observed from the left sternoclavicular joint.

### Automatic protocolling of non-contrast musculoskeletal MRIs does not result in increase in patient recall rates for contrast-enhanced studies [^114BHk1j]. Academic Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Physicians spend large amounts of time protocolling imaging studies, which limits their time for other essential clinical tasks. Most musculoskeletal (MSK) MRI studies are performed for the evaluation of joint pain and internal derangements, and usually do not require intravenous contrast. Contrast-enhanced MRI studies, however, are performed to evaluate infections, suspected or established tumors, and rheumatological conditions. Protocolling all MSK MRI studies detracts from other important tasks during the workday. Routine joint MRI scans have an established set of sequences and therefore could be scheduled and performed without special protocols by radiologists. In a large tertiary care center like ours, with multiple MRI magnets, we set up a process of automated protocoling and scheduling of non-contrast joint MRI scans ordered by referring doctors. The purpose of this project was to assess the effect of this newly established process of 'automatic protocoling and scheduling' of MSK MRI scans on the rate of overlooked MRI exams that may have required contrast examinations, and on the patient recall rate to obtain follow-up post-contrast sequences for further diagnostic characterization.

- **Methods**: All MSK reports of MRIs during the last two months of the years before and after the implementation of automatic protocolling (intervention) were searched for indications related to neoplasms, infections, and rheumatological conditions. For each of the three disease categories, we determined the number of MRIs obtained with and without contrast.

### The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of bone tumours and tumour-like lesions [^111L912Z]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Bone tumours and tumour-like lesions are frequently encountered by radiologists. Although radiographs are the primary screening technique, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help narrow the differential or make a specific diagnosis when a lesion is indeterminate or shows signs of aggressiveness. MRI can extend the diagnostic evaluation by demonstrating several tissue components. Even when a specific diagnosis cannot be made, the differential diagnosis can be narrowed. MRI is superior to other imaging modalities in detecting bone marrow lesions and tumoral tissue; faint lytic/sclerotic bone lesions can be difficult to visualize using only radiographs. Contrast-enhanced MRI can reveal the most vascularized parts of the tumour, and MRI guidance makes it possible to avoid biopsying necrotic areas. MRI is very helpful in local staging and surgical planning by assessing the degree of intramedullary extension and invasion of the adjacent physeal plates, joints, muscle compartments, and neurovascular bundles. It can be used in assessing response to neoadjuvant therapy and further restaging. The post-therapeutic follow-up should also be done using MRI. Despite the high quality of MRI, there are a few pitfalls and limitations of which one should be aware. Applications of MRI in bone tumours will probably continue to grow as new sequences are further studied.

- **When a lesion is indeterminate or shows signs of aggressiveness, MRI is indicated**.

- **When MRI does not lead to a diagnosis, biopsy is indicated**.

- **MRI is superior to other imaging modalities in detecting bone marrow lesions and tumoral tissue**.

### A rapid MRI protocol for the evaluation of acute pediatric musculoskeletal infections: Eliminating contrast and decreasing anesthesia, scan time, and hospital length of stay and charges [^112Pk2Ag]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). High credibility.

Acute musculoskeletal infection affects more than 1 in 6,000 children in the United States annually. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for diagnosing musculoskeletal infection; however, it traditionally requires contrast and anesthesia for children, which can delay management. The rapid MRI protocol involves performing MRI without anesthesia and using limited non-contrast sequences optimized for fluid detection and diffusion-weighted images to identify abscesses. It was hypothesized that a rapid MRI protocol would improve imaging and treatment efficiency for pediatric patients undergoing musculoskeletal infection evaluation without substantially affecting accuracy.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center, retrospective study of patients undergoing evaluation for musculoskeletal infection before (60 patients in the traditional cohort) and after (68 patients in the rapid cohort) implementation of the rapid MRI protocol. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were extracted from electronic health records, and statistical comparisons were performed.

- **Results**: The anesthesia rates were 53% for the traditional cohort and 4% for the rapid cohort, while the contrast administration rates were 88% for the traditional cohort and 0% for the rapid cohort. The median time to MRI after ordering was 6.5 hours (95% confidence interval, 5.0 to 8.6 hours) for the traditional cohort and 2.2 hours (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.6 hours) for the rapid cohort (p < 0.01). The median duration of MRI was 63.2 minutes (95% CI, 56.8 to 69.6 minutes) for the traditional cohort and 24.0 minutes (95% CI, 21.1 to 29.5 minutes) for the rapid cohort (p < 0.01).

### Dynamic MRI for articulating joint evaluation on 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanners: Setup, protocols, and real-time sequences [^114Rito5]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Being non-invasive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in the clinical decision-making process. Static morphological MRI is useful for the diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders but does not represent the dynamic physiology of joints. Dynamic in vivo imaging may provide valuable functional information (qualitative and quantitative) in addition to static imaging; thus, it may help in the selection of an optimal treatment strategy. In vivo imaging of the joint motion can be performed using ultrasonography, single or biplanar fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), and MRI. The role of ultrasonography is limited to the evaluation of the soft tissue around the joint. Fluoroscopy and CT scan modalities are limited to the quantification of bone kinematics and expose the individuals to ionizing radiation. MRI provides anatomical details of bones and soft tissues in static and dynamic acquisitions without exposure to ionizing radiation.

Dynamic MRI sequences were developed as early as 1984 for cardiac imaging and were subsequently applied to the musculoskeletal system to quantify bone motion and joint kinematics. Dynamic MRI-based musculoskeletal system evaluations could be significantly different from those performed using static MRI. For example, Muhle et al. showed that dynamic MRI was significantly better than static imaging for the demonstration of patellar tilt angle, particularly at the critical range of patellar instability between 30° and 0° of knee flexion. The existing literature shows no consensus regarding the technical parameters and the use of dynamic MRI in joint evaluation.

### The prevalence of osteoarthritis of the sternoclavicular joint on computed tomography [^1145tqA4]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Symptomatic disorders around the sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) are relatively uncommon. Previous cadaveric and radiographic studies have suggested that asymptomatic osteoarthritic changes are relatively common, progressively increasing with age. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of SCJ osteoarthritis in the general population using computed tomography (CT) scans.

- **Methods**: We assessed 464 SCJs in 232 patients undergoing a standardized axial CT scan of the thorax including both SCJs, across a range of ages from the second to tenth decade. The scans were undertaken for multiple clinical indications; however, none were obtained to investigate SCJ pathology. The predominant changes investigated were for the features associated with osteoarthritis including the presence of osteophytes, subchondral cysts, and subcortical sclerosis.

- **Results**: The CT scans of 244 SCJs (53%) in 137 patients (59%) showed at least 1 sign of osteoarthritis. No patients younger than 35 years had any features of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritic changes were present in 89.6% of patients older than 50 years compared with 9.1% younger than this age. All patients above the age of 61 had at least 1 feature of osteoarthritic changes on at least 1 side of the SCJ. Increasing prevalence was noted with increasing age both in the percentage of SCJs showing any positive signs of osteoarthritis and in the severity of osteoarthritis.

- **Conclusion**: SCJ osteoarthritis is a very common incidental finding on CT scans, particularly with increasing age. This should be taken into consideration.

### Congenital muscular torticollis [^112VTr7F]. Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on congenital muscular torticollis:

- **Definition**: Congenital muscular torticollis is a benign congenital musculoskeletal disorder characterized by unilateral shortening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, leading to ipsilateral head tilt and contralateral rotation of the face and chin.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of congenital muscular torticollis is unknown. Several theories have been proposed, including intrauterine crowding, muscle trauma during a difficult delivery, soft tissue compression leading to compartment syndrome, and congenital abnormalities of soft tissue differentiation within the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of congenital muscular torticollis ranges from 0.3% to 2%.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include breech presentation, prolonged labor, and difficult birth. Associated conditions may include developmental dysplasia of the hip and plagiocephaly.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include ipsilateral head tilt and contralateral rotation of the face and chin, plagiocephaly, palpable pseudotumor, and tightness of the muscle. Untreated congenital muscular torticollis in infancy may lead to craniofacial growth deformity in adults.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Congenital muscular torticollis is not associated with increased mortality.

### Sternoclavicular joint septic arthritis: an interesting lesson in clinical anatomy [^114d2xjB]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

An otherwise healthy 45-year-old man presented to our emergency department holding his left arm in abduction and external rotation. He reported pain in his left shoulder and chest for the preceding 10 days that had become much worse over the last 48 hours and was eased only by holding his arm in this position. The CT of the chest revealed soft tissue swelling around the left sternoclavicular joint, consistent with sternoclavicular joint septic arthritis with significant inflammatory involvement of the medial component of the left pectoralis major muscle. The patient was taken to the theatre for washout of the left sternoclavicular joint and is currently recovering well at home on intravenous antibiotics.

### Anatomical study of the sternoclavicular joint using high-frequency ultrasound [^115XUobH]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

The clavicular cartilage has been reported to be thicker than the sternal cartilage. No difference in thickness was found in our study; however, only the superficial anterior aspect of the two cartilages was accessible to ultrasound, which probably limits the usefulness of this technique for cartilage assessment. The joint space could also be measured with ultrasound, but the clinical relevance of this remains to be demonstrated.

Sternoclavicular osteoarthritis is relatively common, although asymptomatic in most cases. Clavicular and sternal osteophytes were detected in 33.9% and 16.9% of our cases, respectively, despite the relatively young age of the population (median, 35 years). These rates are higher than in a recent CT-based study, which reported 89% sternoclavicular osteoarthritis in individuals over 50 years old, in contrast to 9% in those under 50 years old. The use of high-resolution ultrasound probes in our study might at least partly explain increased detection of small osteophytes.

Bone irregularities at the anterior sternoclavicular ligament attachment were found in 11.9% of patients. These changes may be related to mechanical changes at the insertion site. As the joints assessed in the present study were asymptomatic, this indicates that osteophytes and entheseal bone irregularities can be seen in the absence of any clinical symptoms. However, further studies are needed to assess whether there could be a correlation between osteoarthritis-related changes of the joint and variations in thickness or echostructure of the capsular and/or ligamental structure.

### FDG PET/CT showing a primary lymphoma of the sternoclavicular joint [^116dgYbu]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

We presented a case of primary lymphoma of the sternoclavicular joint. A 67-year-old woman, who had a history of swelling in the sternoclavicular joint region, was initially considered to have osteoarthritis. A chest CT found a soft tissue mass around the sternoclavicular joint. A biopsy demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The subsequent FDG PET/CT revealed FDG-avid articular destruction with a surrounding soft tissue mass, without any other abnormal findings, suggesting a primary extranodal lymphoma of the sternoclavicular joint.

### ACR appropriateness criteria cervical neck pain or cervical radiculopathy [^117MvHAM]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neck pain, specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a cervical spine MRI with IV contrast as the initial imaging in patients with suspected infection accompanied by new or increasing nontraumatic cervical or neck pain or radiculopathy.

### Magnetic resonance imaging protocols for pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis [^115uVviC]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Pediatric musculoskeletal infection can be a challenging clinical diagnosis. MRI protocols should be tailored appropriately to diagnose and localize sites of infection, to determine alternative pathologies that could explain the child's presentation, and to identify complications that could alter treatment or lead to devastating consequences in growing bones. In this review, we discuss MRI protocols tailored for suspected acute appendicular musculoskeletal infection in children. These protocols are based on patient age to generally reflect the developmental stage of the child, the corresponding relevant anatomy and physiology, and the skeletal maturity-dependent physiopathology of musculoskeletal infections.

### What are the differentiating clinical and MRI-features of enchondromas from low-grade chondrosarcomas [^112JQksk]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

To evaluate the role of clinical assessment and conventional and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in differentiating enchondromas from chondrosarcomas of the long bone, the following clinical and MRI findings were assessed:

- **Patient demographics**: age, gender
- **Symptoms**: pain, pain attributable to the lesion
- **Tumor characteristics**: tumor location, tumor length
- **Bone involvement**:
	- **Endosteal changes**: presence and depth of endosteal scalloping
	- **Cortical involvement**: cortical destruction, bone expansion, periosteal reaction
- **Soft tissue involvement**: bone marrow edema, soft tissue edema, soft tissue mass, hemorrhage
- **Additional features**: macroscopic fat, calcification
- **Imaging techniques**: dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI

Clinical and MRI findings were compared with histopathological grading.

Sixty patients with central chondroid tumors were included in the study:

- **Types of tumors**:
	- **Enchondromas**: 27
	- **Cartilaginous lesions of unknown malignant potential**: 10
	- **Grade 1 chondrosarcomas**: 15
	- **High-grade chondrosarcomas**: 8

Key differentiating features between enchondromas and grade 1 chondrosarcomas include:

- Pain attributed to the lesion
- Tumor length
- Endosteal scalloping greater than two-thirds
- Cortical destruction
- Bone expansion
- Soft tissue mass

Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI could not differentiate enchondromas from grade 1 chondrosarcomas.

Previously reported imaging signs of chondrosarcomas are useful in diagnosing grade 1 lesions but have lower sensitivity than in higher grade lesions. Deep endosteal scalloping is the most sensitive imaging sign of grade 1 chondrosarcomas. Pain due to the lesion is an important clinical sign of grade 1 chondrosarcomas. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is not useful in differentiating enchondromas from grade 1 chondrosarcomas.

### Gadavist [^115aLYDU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Gadavist (gadobutrol) injection is a paramagnetic macrocyclic contrast agent administered for magnetic resonance imaging. The chemical name for gadobutrol is 10–[(1SR,2RS)–2,3–dihydroxy–1–hydroxymethylpropyl]–1,4,7,10–tetraazacyclododecane–1,4,7–triacetic acid, gadolinium complex. Gadobutrol has a molecular formula of C18H31GdN4O9 and a molecular weight of 604.72.

Gadavist is a sterile, clear, colorless to pale yellow solution containing 604.72 mg (1.0 mmol) of gadobutrol per mL as the active ingredient, along with 0.513 mg of calcobutrol sodium, 1.211 mg of trometamol, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), and water for injection. Gadavist contains no preservatives.

- **Physicochemical properties**:
	- The thermodynamic stability constants for gadobutrol (log Ktherm and log Kcond at pH 7.4) are 21.8 and 15.3, respectively.

### When is a neck lump not a neck lump? Initial presentation of a solitary sternocleidomastoid muscle in an adult [^115dRzfc]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old woman was referred to us for evaluation of a presumed left-sided neck mass. The referral was based on the visual appearance of subtle neck asymmetry. The patient reported no ENT symptoms. Clinical examination and ultrasonography identified no pathology, but computed tomography revealed that the asymmetry was present because the patient's right sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) was absent. The SCM on the left side was normal. Congenital absence of an SCM is uncommon, and to the best of our knowledge, an initial presentation in an adult has not been previously reported in the literature.

### Anatomical study of the sternoclavicular joint using high-frequency ultrasound [^113TFxXY]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

The sternoclavicular joint is a synovial saddle joint that connects the sternum with the clavicles. It is the only true joint that connects the appendicular skeleton of the upper limb with the axial skeleton of the trunk. This joint is engaged in every movement of the upper limb and is crucial for achieving the full range of movement. Due to the fact that only half of the medial clavicle articulates with the sternum, the joint's stability also relies on soft tissue and ligamentous attachments.

The assessment of the anatomy of the sternoclavicular joint using imaging primarily depends on CT and MRI. Several studies have reported the contribution of ultrasound in detecting sternoclavicular synovitis or guiding joint infiltration. However, to the best of our knowledge, no descriptive study of the anatomy of the sternoclavicular joint using high-frequency ultrasound has been documented in the literature. This absence is surprising, given the superficial nature of the joint, which makes it easily accessible to this imaging modality. Understanding the normal appearance of intra-articular structures, such as the intra-articular disc and cartilage, as well as stabilizing ligaments, might be useful for detecting minor changes in the joint, including trauma and microtrauma, which are not usually indications for ultrasound assessment of the joint.

The purpose of the present study was to determine normal sternoclavicular joint anatomy using ultrasound.

### Pustular palm eruption with axial skeleton involvement [^113xJxQc]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What part of the skeletal system is most commonly affected by this disease?
	- A. Vertebral column – Incorrect. The spine is affected in approximately 33% of patients with SAPHO syndrome.
	- B. Sternoclavicular region – Correct. The anterior chest wall is affected in 63% to 73% of patients with SAPHO syndrome. In early disease, radiography is often normal. Early lesions, when present, are osteolytic and may be accompanied by endosteal or periosteal reaction. As the disease progresses, the lesions become sclerotic. The pathognomonic bull's head sign can be seen with whole-body scintigraphy and refers to increased radiotracer uptake in the sternoclavicular joints and sternum — the manubrium represents the skull of the bull, and the sternoclavicular joints are the horns. Unlike plain radiography, whole-body scintigraphy and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging may identify subclinical disease, although magnetic resonance imaging is preferred because it has similar sensitivity without the radiation exposure. A bone biopsy is also necessary to rule out malignancy and osteomyelitis.
	- C. Carpometacarpal joints – Incorrect. Peripheral arthritis is present in 33% of patients with SAPHO syndrome.
	- D. Iliac crest – Incorrect. Sacroiliitis is present in 27% to 40% of patients with SAPHO syndrome.

### Delayed diagnosis of pediatric sternoclavicular joint infections and clavicular osteomyelitis during the COVID-19 pandemic: A report of 3 cases [^112y9F4p]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Throughout follow-up, the patient had tenderness and limited range of motion of the shoulder. Repeat MRI, 3 months after initial I&D, showed medial clavicular osteomyelitis (Figure 3 C). This prompted a third I&D with the use of tobramycin-impregnated calcium sulfate beads. The patient was restarted on oral clindamycin for 6 weeks. She had improved range of motion and no signs of recurrence at her most recent follow-up.

- **Patient 3**: Patient 3 is a 14-year-old adolescent boy who presented to the emergency department (ED) with right shoulder pain and fever for three days. The patient was COVID-19–negative. Examination revealed tenderness over the right clavicle and pain with shoulder abduction. Radiographs were normal, and the patient was discharged with a suspected viral illness.

	- Four days later, the patient presented to the orthopaedic clinic due to worsening malaise, fever, and shoulder pain. Physical examination demonstrated mild erythema and edema overlying the clavicle and extending to the sternum and base of the neck. There was tenderness to palpation at the clavicle, SCJ, base of the neck, and shoulder. There was limited range of motion because of pain with shoulder flexion and abduction; however, the patient was able to internally and externally rotate the shoulder without pain. The patient was subsequently transferred to the ED due to concerns for possible osteomyelitis and/or SCJI. He was febrile with leukocytosis (white blood cell count — 21) and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR — 86, CRP — 33). The platelet count was 304,000.

### Quantification of synovitis in the cranio-cervical region: Dynamic contrast enhanced and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging in early rheumatoid arthritis — a feasibility follow up study [^1148ExDn]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The objective was to test the feasibility of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCEI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for quantifying synovitis of the cranio-cervical (C-C) region in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and neck pain, both initially and at a six-month follow-up.

- **Methods**: Twenty-seven patients with RA duration of less than 24 months and neck pain were studied using standard qualitative MRI evaluation and two quantitative MRI methods (DCEI and DWI) at the level of atlantoaxial joints. Rate of early enhancement (REE), enhancement gradient (Genh), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were extracted from DCEI and DWI data. MRI was coupled with clinical assessment and radiographic imaging.

- **Results**: Using standard qualitative MRI evaluation, unequivocal active synovitis (grade 2 or 3 contrast enhancement) was observed in 16 (59%) patients at baseline and 14 (54%) at follow up. DCEI and DWI measurements confirmed active synovitis in 25 (93%) patients at baseline and 24 (92%) at follow up. Average REE, Genh, and ADC values decreased during follow-up; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Both qualitative and quantitative MRI methods confirmed active inflammatory disease in the C-C region following therapy, although all clinical criteria showed signs of improvement in the peripheral disease.

- **Conclusions**: The study demonstrated the feasibility of DCEI and DWI MRI for quantifying synovitis of the C-C region in patients with early RA and neck pain. Both techniques can be used as additional methods for evaluating synovitis of the cranio-cervical region.

### Sternoclavicular joint osteophytosis: A difficult diagnosis to swallow [^117CjBd2]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Unexplained dysphagia requires prompt investigation to rule out a possible underlying malignancy. We describe the case of a 60-year-old man who presented to his family practitioner with a 1-year history of increasing dysphagia, accompanied by pain over the front of his chest. He was referred to an ear, nose, and throat specialist. No obvious laryngeal pathology was found at direct laryngoscopy; however, an 'indentation' of the right anterior larynx, which increased with external pressure on the sternoclavicular joint (SCJ), was noted. A subsequent CT scan of his neck demonstrated osteoarthritis of the right SCJ with an abnormally large posterior osteophyte. The patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon specializing in SCJ surgery and underwent an arthroscopic excision of his right SCJ. Soon after surgery, the patient's dysphagia settled, and his symptoms remained resolved one year post-surgery.

### Instability and degenerative arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint: A current concepts review [^113QEJWY]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Injuries to the sternoclavicular (SC) joint typically occur with high-energy mechanisms such as those obtained in automobile accidents or contact sports. Many disorders of the SC joint can be treated nonoperatively. However, surgical treatment may be indicated for locked posterior dislocations; symptomatic, chronic instability; or persistent, painful osteoarthritis that fails nonoperative therapy.

- **Purpose**: To provide an updated review on the diagnosis and management of instability and degenerative arthritis of the SC joint.

- **Study design**: Concepts review.

- **Methods**: A preliminary PubMed database search using the terms sternoclavicular instability, dislocation, arthritis, resection, and stabilization was performed in August 2012. All anatomic and biomechanical studies, review articles, case reports, case series, and technique papers that were relevant to the topic were included.

- **Results**: The search identified 929 articles, 321 of which, after screening of the titles and abstracts, were considered potentially relevant to this study. Of the 321 articles, 30 were anatomic or imaging studies, 2 were biomechanical studies, 69 were review papers, 189 were case series or reports, and 31 were technique papers. The majority of these studies were classified as evidence level 4, with a few scattered level 3 studies. Because the level of evidence obtained from this search was not adequate for systematic review (or meta-analysis), a concepts review of the diagnosis and management of SC joint instability and degenerative arthritis is presented.

### Sternoclavicular joint osteomyelitis in an otherwise healthy 55-year-old man [^111rkZVP]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Sternoclavicular joint osteomyelitis is extremely rare, with only 225 reported cases in the last 45 years. We present an unusual case in an otherwise healthy 55-year-old man with a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He presented to the emergency department following a week of left knee pain that worsened to full-body joint pain with left sternoclavicular swelling. He was started on antibiotics, underwent multiple washouts of the left knee, and was treated for septic arthritis. By MRI and CT, he was found to have left sternoclavicular joint osteomyelitis and abscess and subsequently underwent debridement and resection. We believe that the initial joint injection resulted in haematogenous spread to the left sternoclavicular joint, stressing the importance of a sterile field for joint procedures.

### Predictive findings on magnetic resonance imaging in patients with symptomatic acromioclavicular osteoarthritis [^1158u8K6]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the shoulder can have added value in diagnosing symptomatic osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. Specific MRI signs have been recognized but have not been extensively analyzed before. This study aims to identify predictive MRI signs in patients with symptomatic AC osteoarthritis.

- **Methods**: The MRI scans of 70 patients with symptomatic AC osteoarthritis were compared with those of 70 patients with subacromial pain syndrome and no clinical signs of symptomatic AC osteoarthritis. Seven variables were evaluated on the MRI scans of the AC joint: joint space narrowing, inferior osteophytes, joint effusion, osteolysis, bone marrow edema, impression on the supraspinatus, and inferior joint distension. Logistic regression analysis of these variables was performed.

- **Results**: The presence of inferior osteophytes, bone marrow edema, impression on the supraspinatus, and inferior joint distension was individually associated with symptomatic AC osteoarthritis. Bone marrow edema was observed only in patients with symptomatic AC osteoarthritis. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association between inferior joint distension, as well as impression on the supraspinatus muscle, and symptomatic AC osteoarthritis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the multivariate logistic model was 0.839 (95% confidence interval, 0.771 to 0.907). Interobserver and intraobserver variability showed good to excellent κ values (range, 0.68 to 0.88).

- **Conclusion**: We identified predictive MRI signs in patients with symptomatic AC osteoarthritis.

### A comparison of magnetic resonance imaging findings of the acromioclavicular joint in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients [^113twBqX]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare acromioclavicular (AC) joint magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in asymptomatic patients with those in symptomatic patients. The MRI scans of 25 patients with symptomatic AC joints were compared with 50 asymptomatic control subjects using the same grading scale.

In the symptomatic group, AC joint arthritis grading was normal in 0%, mild in 20%, moderate in 52%, and severe in 28%. In the asymptomatic group, grading was normal in 18%, mild in 66%, moderate in 12%, and severe in 4%. A statistically higher grade of AC arthritis was observed in the symptomatic group (P < .05). Of the symptomatic individuals, 80% demonstrated reactive bone edema in either the distal clavicle (6), the acromion (3), or both sides of the AC joint (11), whereas no individual in the asymptomatic group had this finding (P < .05).

Reactive bone edema on MRI is a more reliable predictor of symptomatic AC pathology than degenerative changes seen on MRI and, when correlated with clinical examination, is reproducible.

### Anatomical study of the sternoclavicular joint using high-frequency ultrasound [^116njREy]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

In no cases could the whole length of the costoclavicular ligament be clearly detected.

The sternal head of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was clearly seen as a hypoechoic structure attaching to the upper part of the anterior surface of the manubrium sterni, medially to the sternoclavicular joint and to the anterior sternoclavicular ligament insertion. In its downward and inward course, it partially covered the medial part of the sternoclavicular joint (Fig. 3). It was easily detected on a slightly upward and outward oblique sagittal plane (longitudinal view) or on a transverse plane.

Clavicular and sternal articular cartilages were not correctly seen in one joint (overweight patient). In all the other cases, only the superficial anterior aspect was seen as an anechoic structure covering the subchondral bone, with a mean thickness of 0.5 mm (SD = 0.1).

The articular disc was seen as an intra-articular hyperechoic triangular structure with its base on the anterior capsuloligamentous structure. It was clearly seen in 39 out of 59 joints (66.1% of cases) in patients with the arm alongside the body (Fig. 4). In 12 patients (20.3% of cases), its margins were not correctly analyzed with the arm alongside the body, but the disc was clearly seen under shoulder antepulsion (Fig. 4). In the other 8 patients (13.6% of cases), the articular disc could not be correctly analyzed due to overweight (1 case), insufficient echogenicity (5 cases), or abundant intra-articular gas (2 cases) (Fig. 5). There was no calcification of the disc.

### Anatomical study of the sternoclavicular joint using high-frequency ultrasound [^115VsV7a]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether ultrasound enables assessment of sternoclavicular structures. A preliminary study in three cadavers was followed by an ultrasound study, performed by two musculoskeletal radiologists working in consensus, in 59 patients without a history of trauma, surgery, or pain in the sternoclavicular joint. The visibility, echogenicity, and thickness of the sternoclavicular structures were assessed.

The anterior sternoclavicular ligament and the interclavicular ligament could be seen in all patients (mean thickness: 1.4 mm and 1.3 mm, respectively). The articular disc was clearly seen in 66.1% of cases, while shoulder antepulsion enabled analysis in an additional 20.3%. Intra-articular joint gas was frequent (33.89% of cases), preventing analysis of the disc in two patients. Only the superficial anterior aspect of the clavicular and sternal articular cartilages could be assessed. Joint effusion was seen in 6.8% of cases. Clavicular osteophytes, sternal osteophytes, and bone irregularities at the anterior sternoclavicular ligament insertion were detected in 33.9%, 16.9%, and 16.9% of cases, respectively.

The anterior sternoclavicular ligament, interclavicular ligament, and anterior intra-articular structures can be visualized by ultrasound. This method of assessment may have clinical applications, particularly in patients with trauma or microtrauma.

### Clinical and therapeutic diversity in adult chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) of the sternocostoclavicular region: a meta-analysis [^112BjL7B]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

First, this review shows that CNO/SCCH as a CNO subtype is insufficiently defined in the present medical literature, and cases are found under a variety of names and classifications. Chinese, Italian, and French studies consequently refer to SAPHO syndrome, Japanese studies use PAO, and Dutch and Scandinavian studies generally use CNO/SCCH. Clinical, biochemical, histopathological, and imaging characteristics, as well as treatment modalities and effects, were diverse and differentially reported and interpreted, as also reflected in the statistical pooling of data. This diversity is a key observation as it seriously hampers insight into the disease of CNO/SCCH.

We found a mean diagnostic delay of 5.3 years, regardless of whether CNO/SCCH was diagnosed as a manifestation of SAPHO or PAO or as a separate entity. The delay may, therefore, not fully be caused by the absence of diagnostic criteria, as these are available for SAPHO syndrome. In any case, this substantial delay is problematic, for it has been associated with irreversible tissue damage and impaired quality of life (QoL). Following our data, the major drawback for fast diagnosis is CNO/SCCH's unspecific presentation. Symptom-wise, pain of the anterior chest wall and shoulder was ascribed to a wide range of alternative diagnoses, many of which are self-limiting and would not require referral, especially not at the relatively young age of presentation. Co-occurrence with pustulosis, a highly particular manifestation found in 53%, should theoretically steer towards CNO/SCCH; however, it is known that osteoarticular.

### Cervical spine involvement in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis - MRI follow-up study [^112L2392]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

- **MRI findings**: Tables 3 and 4 show the analysis of the MRI findings. Table 3 indicates the number of involved sites per specific MRI finding, while Table 4 indicates the number of patients showing specific MRI findings at the various sites. In most patients, multiple sites were involved.

- **Table 3**: Number of sites and quality of MRI findings at diagnosis and follow-up (in brackets) in 13 patients

At the time of diagnosis, atlanto-axial (AA) and atlanto-dental (AD) joints were most frequently affected as shown by joint hyperintensity and gadolinium enhancement. Altogether, 12 (93%) of our patients showed a hyperintense STIR signal, and all 13 showed joint enhancement.

Erosions were only seen in the dens and atlas (example see Figure 1). Narrowing of the cervical spine at the cranio-cervical junction (CCJ) was diagnosed where hypertrophy of the dens was seen (example see Figure 2). Ankylosis (Figure 3) and erosions were seen at 7 sites in 3 patients, and 6 sites in 4 patients at follow-up, indicating that these changes may occur at multiple sites in the same patient. Whereas the number of affected patients and sites with joint hyperintensity, enhancement, and malalignment decreased at follow-up, ankylosis, and erosions were observed.

### Diagnostic performance of a non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging protocol for potential living related kidney donors [^113x44Le]. Academic Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the performance of a non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol for preoperative screening of living related kidney donors.

Forty consecutive subjects (mean age 52.2 ± 11.3 years, range 29–73 years) underwent MR imaging with T2-weighted sequences (coronal and axial plane). They also underwent a non-contrast-enhanced respiratory-gated three-dimensional steady-state free precession MR angiography (NCE-MRA) sequence, and a contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) sequence in the arterial and venous phases. Two blinded readers independently assessed arterial and venous anatomy and potential kidney lesions. Results of non-contrast-enhanced images were compared to CE-MRA, and in a subgroup of 21 subjects to surgery as the standard of reference.

Regarding arterial anatomy, NCE-MRA yielded sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100%, 89%, and 91% compared to CE-MRA. Three kidneys were found to have more accessory renal arteries at NCE-MRA than at CE-MRA. In the subgroup of 21 subjects, one surgically proven accessory artery was depicted with NCE-MRA but not with CE-MRA. The accuracy of T2-weighted images regarding accessory veins or variant venous courses was 99%, with one missed circumaortic vein on T2-weighted images. Two simple cysts were missed on T2-weighted and NCE-MRA but not on CE-MRA images.

A non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging protocol, including NCE-MRA and T2-weighted images, allows for the accurate screening of living related kidney donors.

### The joints in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^113XCAy5]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

MRI is the only diagnostic tool that can assess all relevant anatomical structures in joint inflammation. Contrast-enhanced MRI is able to depict synovial thickening and enhancement, joint fluid, bone marrow oedema as well as damage to cartilage and bone and is therefore potentially a powerful imaging tool in the assessment of joint inflammation and the progression of permanent joint damage. Erosions cannot be assessed clinically, and MRI is thought to have greater sensitivity than radiography in early detection of erosions. The standard MRI protocol in arthritis includes a T1 SE sequence, T2 fat-suppressed sequence or a STIR, and T1 fat-suppressed sequence pre- and post-contrast.

Some may prefer to add a sequence for visualization of cartilage, such as a proton-weighted or 3D DESS sequence. The DIXON fat-suppression technique is increasingly being used because it provides robust, homogeneous fat suppression and can be combined with high-resolution T2-weighted images, offering a better signal-to-noise ratio compared to the STIR sequence, without increasing the scan time. Contrast administration is necessary for the assessment of synovitis; hence contrast-enhanced MRI is part of the standard protocol in JIA. The preferred image planes will vary depending on the joint, but the MRI protocol should allow multiplanar reformatting so potential findings, particularly evidence of joint destruction, could be verified in at least two planes.

In active arthritis, there will always be pathological enhancement of a thickened synovium. In JIA, as opposed to other types of arthritis, the enhancement patterns may differ.

### Anatomical study of the sternoclavicular joint using high-frequency ultrasound [^11163Sxe]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Data are sparse for interclavicular ligament anatomy. This structure was seen in each of our patients, but correct assessment may require an ultrahigh-frequency hockey stick probe and/or a large amount of gel due to the wavy outlines of the superior chest wall, particularly in thin patients. This ligament extended between the superior aspect of the sternal end of the clavicles, but our anatomic and ultrasound studies showed it could be attached to the upper manubrium sterni (in more than half of the patients on ultrasound). The clavicular end of the ligament could not be differentiated from the underlying articular capsule, a feature that was previously reported on MRI. This ligament is one of those involved in sternoclavicular joint stability; however, to the best of our knowledge, the importance of manubrial insertion for its stabilizing effect has not been assessed.

The costoclavicular ligament extends from the undersurface of the medial clavicle to the superior rim of the first rib and costal cartilage. This ligament, which is not strictly speaking a component of the sternoclavicular joint, was not correctly seen on ultrasound in our study, probably because of its depth, as it is covered by the pectoralis major muscle. Elevation of the arm, which was not tried in this study, might improve its assessment by lifting the clavicle.

### Multi-detector row CT of the head and neck: Comparison of different volumes of contrast material with and without a saline chaser [^115XpyFG]. Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different volumes of contrast material with and without a saline chaser on tissue enhancement in multidetector row CT (MDCT) of the head and neck.

- **Methods**: In a blind prospective fashion, 120 patients were randomized into the following four groups: group 1, 80 mL contrast material administered at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/s; group 2, 80 mL followed by 40 mL saline at 2.0 ml/s; group 3, 60 mL at 1.5 ml/s; and group 4, 60 mL followed by 30 mL saline at 1.5 ml/s. The attenuation values of the carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and muscle were measured at an interval of 1.5 s in each patient. The degree of perivenous artifacts was subjectively assessed.

- **Results**: Mean attenuation values in the carotid artery and internal jugular vein were significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 than in groups 3 and 4. The width of the diagnostic window (both carotid and jugular enhancement > 150 HU) was significantly longer in groups 1 and 2 than in groups 3 and 4. The addition of a saline chaser did not result in improved vascular enhancement or a wider diagnostic window but reduced perivenous artifacts compared to using contrast material alone.

- **Conclusion**: Reduction of contrast material from 80 to 60 mL results in insufficient enhancement of neck vessels. In addition, the benefit of a saline chaser technique is not obvious except for its ability to reduce perivenous artifacts.

### Dynamic MRI for articulating joint evaluation on 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanners: Setup, protocols, and real-time sequences [^1151rFKP]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive method that can be used to increase the understanding of the pathomechanics of joints. Various types of real-time gradient echo sequences used for dynamic MRI acquisition of joints include balanced steady-state free precession sequence, radiofrequency-spoiled sequence, and ultra-fast gradient echo sequence. Due to their short repetition time and echo time, these sequences provide high temporal resolution, a good signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, and soft tissue contrast.

The prerequisites for the evaluation of joints with dynamic MRI include suitable patient installation and optimal positioning of the joint in the coil to allow joint movement, sometimes with dedicated coil support. There are currently few recommendations in the literature regarding appropriate protocol, sequence standardizations, and diagnostic criteria for the use of real-time dynamic MRI to evaluate joints. This article summarizes the technical parameters of these sequences from various manufacturers on 1.5 T and 3.0 T MRI scanners. We have reviewed pertinent details of the patient and coil positioning for dynamic MRI of various joints. The indications and limitations of dynamic MRI of joints are discussed.

### Imaging in rheumatology: Reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^113y7YTF]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

When requesting an MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJs), rheumatologists often ask for a contrast-medium-enhanced examination. The reason for this is not clear to many radiologists, and requests are subsequently either ignored or performed grudgingly. Many rheumatologists request a contrast-medium-enhanced examination because this is commonly used in studies published in their literature. As discussed in the section on rheumatoid arthritis, many imaging investigations, including MRI in countries outside the United Kingdom (UK), are supervised and interpreted by non-radiologists. These practitioners often rely heavily on short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and contrast-medium-enhanced T1-weighted (T1w) sequences, often using T1 fat saturation, and may not fully appreciate the role of conventional T1w sequences. Radiologists, on the other hand, use both sequences to assess the examined area and usually do not require further sequences.

Most pathological disease processes are associated with an increased amount of free fluid, which is seen as a signal increase on fluid-sensitive sequences such as T2 fat saturation and STIR, and as a signal decrease on conventional T1w sequences. The anatomical resolution of standard T1w sequences is usually very high, allowing for good anatomical correlation of the findings. The combination of a fat-suppressed fluid-sensitive sequence and a T1w sequence also helps identify fatty (low signal in fat saturation, high in T1w) and sclerotic (low signal in all sequences) bone marrow changes.

Compared with STIR sequences, contrast-medium-enhanced T1w sequences have not been proved superior in the assessment of spinal inflammation.

### Prevalence of sternoclavicular joint calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition on computed tomography [^112MBfp9]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the prevalence of sternoclavicular (SC) joint calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition and its association with age, osteoarthritis, and atlantoaxial CPPD crystal deposition. In 209 consecutive patients, computed tomographic examinations of the cervical spine were retrospectively reviewed. The overall prevalence of CPPD crystal deposition in the SC joint was 17.2% (36/209), which increased with age (p < 0.0001). There was also a significant association between SC CPPD and osteoarthritis (P = 0.024) as well as atlantoaxial joint CPPD crystal deposition (P = 0.006).

### Acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis: Comparison of findings derived from MR imaging and conventional radiography [^1153hgsT]. Clinical Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between routine radiography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the analysis of acromioclavicular (AC) joint osteoarthritis (OA). MR imaging studies of the shoulder in 50 patients, performed over a one-year period at a single institution with corresponding conventional radiographic examinations within one month of the MR imaging study, were retrospectively evaluated by the consensus of two musculoskeletal radiologists with special attention to the AC joint. As a conclusion, the information provided by conventional radiography in the analysis of AC joint OA does not correlate with that provided by MR imaging. AC joint OA is more frequently detected with MR imaging than with radiography. MR imaging provides a better assessment of the full extent of AC joint OA and its effect on the underlying rotator cuff (RC).

### Sternoclavicular joint infection presenting as nonspecific chest pain [^115h3xfC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Sternoclavicular joint infection (SJI), including septic arthritis (SA), is a rare cause of chest pain and is often found in patients with significant risk factors and sources for SA. Most acute care laboratory results lack significant sensitivity to rule out SA. Radiographic findings in common acute care imaging often do not reveal findings of SA and osteomyelitis in the acute phase of the infection.

- **Case report**: We present a patient without significant risk factors for SA, who initially presented with three days of pain in the left chest, left neck, and shoulder. He had a fever and was treated with a short course of antibiotics for possible pneumonia. His symptoms recurred along with a fever 36 days after the initial onset and were then diagnosed radiographically with left-sided SJI. This case reinforces the need to maintain a broad differential diagnosis in the evaluation for chest pain and pursue advanced imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, when the pretest probability of SJI is high, especially in the acute phase of the infection. Emergency physicians should be aware of this.

Ganglion cysts originating from the sternoclavicular joint in children have not been previously reported. In this study, five children who presented with a small mass over the anterior aspect of the sternoclavicular joint were evaluated and treated. Only one patient was symptomatic. A ganglion cyst was suspected in each case and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging in three patients and ultrasound in one patient. Excisional biopsy was performed in three patients, and the diagnosis of a ganglion cyst was confirmed histopathologically. No patient has had a recurrence. Observation of asymptomatic cystic lesions that arise in the sternoclavicular location is recommended.

### Exploring contrast-enhanced MRI findings of the clinically non-inflamed symptomatic pediatric wrist [^113LdH4m]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed with an open bore 1.0-tesla (T) MR scanner (Panorama HFO; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) from December 2008 to January 2015, and a 3.0-T MR scanner (Ingenia; Omega, Philips Medical Systems) from February 2015 until February 2018. Both scanners were equipped with a dedicated wrist coil.

All patients were placed in a feet-first supine position with the arm in a neutral position and the wrist joint positioned in the middle of the wrist coil. The wrist with the most clinical involvement was designated as the target joint for MRI. If there were no differences in clinical disease activity between both wrists, the right side was selected as the target joint.

- **MRI sequences for the 1.0-T MR scanner**: Coronal and transversal T1-weighted images, coronal T1-weighted fat-saturated images, transversal T2-weighted fat-saturated images, coronal T1-weighted post-contrast images, and transversal T1-weighted fat-saturated post-contrast images.

- **MRI sequences for the 3.0-T MR scanner**: Transversal T1-weighted turbo spin echo images, coronal and transversal proton density-weighted images, coronal T1-weighted Dixon pre- and post-contrast images, and transversal T1-weighted fat-saturated post-contrast images.

To standardize the timing of post-contrast image acquisition, thereby reducing time-dependent variability in the degree of (teno)synovial enhancement and improving the distinction between synovial enhancement and joint fluid, all post-contrast images were obtained within less than five minutes.

### Intramuscular granular cell tumor in the sternocleidomastoid muscle: A case report and literature review [^114sm2Bi]. Ear, Nose & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Granular cell tumor (GCT) is a rare soft-tissue neoplasm that originates from Schwann cells. Most cases occur in the subcutaneous or submucosal regions, and intramuscular GCT is even more uncommon. Herein, we describe an atypical GCT growing in the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A 41-year-old Chinese man was admitted to our hospital for a right neck mass. In magnetic resonance images, the mass showed higher signal intensity than the adjacent normal muscle on T2-weighted images and intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images. Slightly enhanced and higher signal intensity was observed in the peripheral rim on contrast-enhanced fat-sat T1-weighted images, and the "stripe sign" was evident. The tumor was completely resected, and pathological examination indicated an atypical GCT. The patient tolerated the procedure well. This is a rare case report of an intramuscular GCT from diagnosis to treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging might help diagnose such tumors, and we review different magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of intramuscular GCTs at other sites.

### Ferumoxytol magnetic resonance imaging detects joint and pleural infiltration of bone sarcomas in pediatric and young adult patients [^115sn78M]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of joint infiltration by a malignant bone tumor affects surgical management. The specificity of standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing joint infiltration is limited. During our MRI evaluations with ferumoxytol nanoparticles of pediatric and young adult patients with bone sarcomas, we observed a surprising marked T1 enhancement of joint and pleural effusions in some patients but not in others.

- **Objective**: To evaluate if nanoparticle extravasation differed between joints and pleura with and without tumor infiltration.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively identified 15 pediatric and young adult patients (mean age: 16 ± 4 years) with bone sarcomas who underwent 18 MRI scans at 1 h (n = 7) or 24 h (n = 11) after intravenous ferumoxytol infusion. Twelve patients also received a gadolinium-enhanced MRI. We determined tumor invasion into the joint or pleural space based on histology (n = 11) and imaging findings (n = 4). We compared the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of the joint or pleural fluid for tumors with and without invasion using a Mann-Whitney U test.

- **Results**: MRI scans 24 h after intravenous ferumoxytol infusion demonstrated a positive T1 enhancement of the effusion in all joints and pleural spaces with tumor infiltration, and no joint or pleural space without infiltration. Corresponding SNR (P = 0.004) and CNR (P = 0.004) values were significantly higher for joints and pleural spaces with tumor infiltration than without. By contrast, unenhanced MRI, gadolinium-enhanced MRI, and 1-h post-contrast ferumox.

### Anatomical study of the sternoclavicular joint using high-frequency ultrasound [^112VShgg]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether ultrasound enables assessment of sternoclavicular structures. A preliminary study in three cadavers was followed by an ultrasound study, performed by two musculoskeletal radiologists working in consensus, in 59 patients without a history of trauma, surgery, or pain in the sternoclavicular joint. The visibility, echogenicity, and thickness of the sternoclavicular structures were assessed.

The anterior sternoclavicular ligament and the interclavicular ligament could be seen in all patients (mean thickness: 1.4 mm and 1.3 mm, respectively). The articular disc was clearly seen in 66.1% of cases, and shoulder antepulsion enabled analysis in an additional 20.3%. Intra-articular joint gas was frequent (33.89% of cases), preventing analysis of the disc in two patients. Only the superficial anterior aspect of the clavicular and sternal articular cartilages could be assessed. Joint effusion was seen in 6.8% of cases. Clavicular osteophytes, sternal osteophytes, and bone irregularities at the anterior sternoclavicular ligament insertion were detected in 33.9%, 16.9%, and 16.9% of cases, respectively.

The anterior sternoclavicular ligament, interclavicular ligament, and anterior intra-articular structures can be visualized by ultrasound. This means of assessment may have clinical applications, particularly in patients with trauma or microtrauma.

### Anatomical study of the sternoclavicular joint using high-frequency ultrasound [^114yD3GM]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

We acknowledge several limitations in our study. Firstly, only 59 patients were included, and the median age of 35 years was young. Larger studies might find different results for the detection prevalence and measurement of the anterior sternoclavicular structures. Secondly, intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was not assessed, as all the ultrasound examinations were analyzed consensually by two musculoskeletal radiologists; this may also have influenced detection prevalence. However, the main goal of the study was to describe the ultrasound aspect of these structures. Furthermore, we did not assess whether the appearance of these anatomical structures was symmetrical, which could be useful in clinical practice.

Finally, we did not perform several dynamic maneuvers to assess whether or not they could optimize the anatomical study of the sternoclavicular joint, especially for better differentiation between anterior capsular and ligamental structures.

### Synovial volume vs synovial measurements from dynamic contrast enhanced MRI as measures of response in osteoarthritis [^116VnLeG]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

The results of this study suggest that changes in signal intensity measurements from synovial enhancement after an intravenous contrast agent correlate more with changes in pain after an intra-articular steroid injection than changes in synovial volume do. In this study, only the relative enhancement rate (RER), maximum and late relative enhancement (RE max and RE late), and K trans change showed a significant association with pain change.

This study indicates that contrast-enhanced intensity measures, such as RE max and RE late, may be more responsive than volume measurements for monitoring synovial change and may be better structural outcome measures for osteoarthritis (OA) treatments targeting intra-articular inflammatory processes. Contrast enhancement depends on various factors, such as synovial vascularity and the fractional volume of the extravascular, extracellular space into which the contrast diffuses, which may change relatively acutely. In contrast, synovial volume may include regions of fibrous tissue that might be chronic.

We included subjects with grade 4 (severe) OA, as recent work has suggested that they also show structural disease progression over time and that the synovitis and its severity are correlated with the Kellgren and Lawrence disease grade.

Although we found a stronger association of synovial signal intensity changes with pain than synovial volume with pain, this association was not strong. This compares with a previous 2.5-year observational study of 270 patients, which showed a correlation of pain with synovitis.

### Transient sternoclavicular joint arthropathy, a self-limited disease [^11714SM9]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) is a true diarthrodial synovial joint and is therefore vulnerable to the same disease processes as other synovial joints. We identified a group of patients with monarticular arthritis of the SCJ that had a benign process and a self-limited disease course.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included 25 female patients who presented with pain or swelling of the SCJ between January 2000 and December 2010. Their mean age was 59 years, and the average follow-up was 44 months. All patients underwent baseline radiographic imaging, technetium bone scan, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Blood profiles were negative for rheumatoid factor in all patients. Functional outcome was assessed with the Rockwood SCJ score.

- **Results**: The patients presented with complaints of pain (72%), local swelling (88%), and redness (8%) that progressed during 4 weeks. The physical examination revealed tenderness (84%), swelling (88%), and limited range of motion (16%). These findings persisted for a median of 5 months. Plain radiographs showed arthritic changes in 5 patients (20%). Increased uptake was observed in all 9 patients who underwent a bone scan. Soft tissue swelling was demonstrated on computed tomography in 5 patients (20%) and on magnetic resonance imaging in 5 patients (20%). One patient had osteoarthritic changes on magnetic resonance imaging. Pain resolved spontaneously in all patients, leaving only swelling in 9 patients and tenderness in 1 patient.

- **Conclusion**: Our experience is that SCJ arthropathy may often be a self-limited disease.

### Atraumatic disorders of the sternoclavicular joint [^112fyUor]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

The sternoclavicular joint is the diarthrodial articulation between the axial and appendicular skeletons. It is subject to the same disease processes that occur in joints, including degenerative arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, infection, and subluxation. Most of these conditions present with swelling of the joint, which may be associated with pain and/or tenderness. Plain radiographs can demonstrate changes on both sides of the joint. Because of variations in anatomy, computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance images are often necessary to clarify the pathology. With the exception of acute infection, most conditions can be managed nonsurgically, with joint resection reserved for patients with persistent symptoms.

### Pitfalls in MR morphology of the sterno-costo-clavicular region using whole-body MRI [^115heqc3]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

To analyze the imaging findings at the sterno-costo-clavicular (SCC) joint region using whole-body (WB) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy individuals, the aim is to minimize misinterpretation as changes due to spondyloarthritis (SpA).

- **Materials and methods**: As part of a cross-sectional study of 122 SpA patients, 75 healthy individuals (42/33 males/females; median age 30.3 years; range 17.7–63.8 years) were scanned using sagittal and coronal WB short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and T1-weighted MRI sequences. The SCC region was analyzed independently by seven readers for bone marrow oedema (BMO), erosions, subchondral fat signal intensity (FSI), and joint fluid accumulation.

- **Results**: SCC changes simulating inflammation were reported by four or more of the seven readers in 15 (20%) healthy individuals (12 male/three female; median age 32.1 years; range 20.2–48 years). Thirteen individuals (17%) had changes at the manubriosternal joint (MSJ); five had BMO, one BMO + erosion, four erosion, two erosion + FSI, and one FSI only. Changes at the sternoclavicular joint occurred in three individuals (4%) encompassing erosion, erosion + FSI + BMO, and joint fluid accumulation, respectively. One patient had both MSJ and sternoclavicular joint changes.

- **Conclusions**: Findings mimicking inflammatory changes occurred in healthy individuals, particularly in the MSJ. Awareness of this is important in the recognition of SCC inflammation in SpA.

### Eovist [^112PR81o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In all four studies, patients underwent a baseline, pre-contrast MRI followed by the administration of EOVIST at a dose of 0.025 mmol/kg, with MRI performed immediately (the "dynamic" phase) and at 10 to 20 minutes following EOVIST administration (the "hepatocyte" phase). Patients also underwent computerized tomography with contrast examinations of the liver. Pre-contrast MRI and EOVIST-contrasted MR images were evaluated in a systematic, randomized, paired, and unpaired fashion by three radiologists who were blinded to clinical information. CT images were also evaluated by the radiologists in a separate reading session.

Diagnostic efficacy was determined in 621 patients. The average age was 57 years (range 19 to 84 years) and 54% were male. The ethnic representations were 90% Caucasian, 4% Black, 3% Hispanic, 2% Asian, and 1% of other ethnic groups.

The combination of non-contrasted and EOVIST-contrasted MR images had improved sensitivity for the detection and characterization of liver lesions compared to pre-contrasted MR images. The improved sensitivity in the detection of lesions was predominantly related to the detection of additional lesions among patients with multiple lesions on the pre-contrast MR images. The false positive rates for detection of lesions were similar for non-contrasted MR images and EOVIST-contrasted MR images, 32% versus 34% respectively. Liver lesion detection and characterization results were similar between CT and the combination of pre-contrasted and EOVIST-contrasted MR images.

### Sternoclavicular joint surgery: How far does danger lurk below [^111bed2r]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Surgical stabilization of the sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) is infrequent, and cardiothoracic surgery assistance is often recommended. Patient safety and surgeon efficiency may be improved by a greater understanding of the anatomic relationships near the SCJ. The purpose of this study is to determine the distances from the SCJ to critical structures in the superior mediastinum.

- **Materials and methods**: Distances from the posterior SCJ to adjacent mediastinal structures were recorded using contrast computed tomography scans of 49 consecutive patients. Patient sex, height, body mass index, side, age, and thickness of the sternum and medial clavicle were also recorded.

- **Results**: The mean distance to the nearest anatomic structure deep to the clavicular region of the SCJ was 6.6 mm and was 12.5 mm for the sternal region. The clavicle was an average thickness of 18 mm, and the sternum was an average thickness of 17 mm. The closest structure was the brachiocephalic vein. An artery was identified as the closest structure in 21.2% of patients. Distance differences between the right and left sides were noted, but sex had no bearing on the distance to structures.

- **Conclusion**: Multiple mediastinal structures are close to the SCJ. The most frequent structure at risk of injury deep to the SCJ is the brachiocephalic vein. Such knowledge may improve patient safety.

### MR imaging of the sternoclavicular joint following trauma [^114MTGcR]. Clinical Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the sternoclavicular (SC) joint in patients who presented to our department with joint pain related to trauma. Clinical history and MRI findings of 41 patients were reviewed retrospectively to establish the types and frequencies of soft tissue injuries and subluxations. Both SC joints were imaged, with the asymptomatic joints used as a control group. Articular disk injuries were identified in 80% of patients. Injuries to the anterior, posterior, interclavicular, and costoclavicular ligaments were observed in 73%, 39%, 29%, and 14% of patients, respectively. Most clavicular subluxations were directed superiorly and posteriorly. Posterior impingement of mediastinal structures was noted in cases of posterior clavicular subluxation, as well as in instances of retrosternal inflammatory or fibrotic tissue without clavicular subluxation. Biomechanical models of the SC joint are discussed to explain how different ligamentous injuries typically result in different types of subluxations.

### Delayed diagnosis of pediatric sternoclavicular joint infections and clavicular osteomyelitis during the COVID-19 pandemic: A report of 3 cases [^116mRGJe]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The discussion around sternoclavicular joint infections (SCJIs) highlights their rarity, typically occurring in immunocompromised patients with risk factors such as diabetes, intravenous (IV) drug use, distant infection, and trauma. These risk factors are infrequently seen in the pediatric population, and none were present in our patients. In this case report, we discuss three unique presentations of rare infectious pathologies.

These cases underscore the unique difficulty of diagnosing musculoskeletal infections in the pediatric population, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. All three patients were admitted during the pandemic and faced delayed diagnoses. On average, it took two evaluations before the diagnosis of SCJI was considered, and 5.3 days elapsed from initial symptoms to the onset of appropriate treatment. Delaying diagnosis can result in the seeding of the infection to adjacent structures and, in extreme cases, can result in death.

Recent literature has stressed the importance for clinicians to maintain a broad differential to limit misdiagnoses of rare conditions during the pandemic. One example is the concern for increased complications of Kawasaki disease secondary to delayed diagnosis after COVID-19 workup. Although COVID-19 is currently one of the leading causes of febrile presentations to the emergency department (ED), other potentially life-threatening conditions should be ruled out in a timely fashion.

Patients 2 and 3 sustained severe infections. They had a total length of hospitalization of 9 and 6 days, respectively. Both patients exhibited marked purulence intraoperatively and required multiple incisions and drainages (I&Ds). They also underwent long antibiotic courses of 15 and 8 weeks, respectively.

### Reflexions about imaging technique and examination protocol 2. MR-examination protocol [^111hqvFp]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Adequate imaging protocol is crucial for any imaging technique. As MR is a time-consuming examination, the physician serves the patient best when he or she makes the best choice of sequences that answer the question of the clinician and provide a definite diagnosis. Although any patient requires an individual protocol, some general rules should be known.

### Dynamic MRI for articulating joint evaluation on 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanners: Setup, protocols, and real-time sequences [^1153wVPK]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive method that can be used to increase the understanding of the pathomechanics of joints. Various types of real-time gradient echo sequences used for dynamic MRI acquisition of joints include balanced steady-state free precession sequence, radiofrequency-spoiled sequence, and ultra-fast gradient echo sequence. Due to their short repetition time and echo time, these sequences provide high temporal resolution, a good signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, and soft tissue contrast.

The prerequisites of the evaluation of joints with dynamic MRI include suitable patient installation and optimal positioning of the joint in the coil to allow joint movement, sometimes with dedicated coil support. There are currently few recommendations in the literature regarding appropriate protocol, sequence standardizations, and diagnostic criteria for the use of real-time dynamic MRI to evaluate joints. This article summarizes the technical parameters of these sequences from various manufacturers on 1.5T and 3.0T MRI scanners. We have reviewed pertinent details of the patient and coil positioning for dynamic MRI of various joints. The indications and limitations of dynamic MRI of joints are discussed.

### Magnetic resonance imaging findings in Kimura's disease [^1141swhu]. Neuroradiology (2004). Low credibility.

Although early diagnosis of Kimura's disease, a rare chronic inflammatory disorder most commonly presenting with asymmetric swelling in the head and neck region, is helpful in avoiding unnecessary diagnostic tests and starting prompt treatment, only a few reports emphasized radiological findings in detail. Magnetic resonance imaging findings showing the infiltrative nature of the disease and diffuse loss of fat tissue, even in nonpalpable normally appearing regions of the head and neck in a young man with Kimura's disease, are presented in this report.

### Imaging in rheumatology: Reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^116YtkLi]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The importance of training for the reliable diagnosis of inflammatory spondyloarthropathy based on MRI has been stressed, and reference instruction manuals and atlases for this purpose have been published. Contrast-medium enhancement and diffusion-weighted imaging with MRI have been found to be more accurate for quantification of treatment response in ankylosing spondylitis. Whether this proves useful in routine clinical imaging remains to be seen.

Use of more exotic contrast media, such as (ultrasmall) superparamagnetic iron oxide particles ([U]SPIO), has also been investigated for the imaging of inflammatory bone marrow lesions. The aim is to define the reason for bone marrow oedema-like change more accurately. As SPIOs are taken up by macrophages, signal change after SPIO administration would indicate the presence of macrophages. This is usually suggestive of infection or severe inflammatory spondyloarthropathy; however, this is a research application and is unlikely to come into routine practice soon, or indeed ever.

Whether an axial sequence is necessary or whether the paracoronal plane alone is sufficient for imaging of the sacroiliac joints (SIJs) is also subject to debate in the relevant literature. Most publications favour the use of the paracoronal plane only, and many radiologists are content with this. However, in almost all imaging examinations, it is regarded as good practice to image in two planes, which reduces uncertainty regarding partial volume effects. The use of 3D sequences in the spine has been found to be useful in this regard.

Usually, the SIJs are imaged with a dedicated approach.

### Management of traumatic sternoclavicular joint injuries [^111yGy5z]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011).

Traumatic sternoclavicular joint injuries account for less than 3% of all traumatic joint injuries. Proper recognition and treatment are vital because these injuries may be life-threatening. Injuries are classified according to patient age, severity, and, in the setting of dislocation, the direction of the medial clavicle. Anterior injuries are far more common than posterior injuries. Posterior dislocation may be associated with complications such as dyspnea, dysphagia, cyanosis, swelling of the ipsilateral extremity, and paresthesia due to compression of the trachea, esophagus, or great vessels. These life-threatening complications may present at the time of injury but can also develop later. Radiography has been largely supplanted by CT for evaluating this injury, although an oblique view developed by Wirth and Rockwood is useful in evaluating isolated sternoclavicular injury. MRI is beneficial in differentiating physeal injury from sternoclavicular dislocation in patients aged less than 23 years.

### A five-year-old boy with anaphylaxis reaction to gadolinium-based MR contrast medium: A case report [^114yazkg]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most widely used tests in orthopedic areas. Gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) contrast media are commonly used for MRI tests. They are known to be safe, with few side effects and a low incidence of acute adverse reactions. Although it is not common, an immediate hypersensitivity reaction can occur in some patients after administering gadolinium-based MR contrast media, causing skin rash, vascular edema, dyspnea, abdominal pain, hypotension, altered mental status, cardiopulmonary arrest, and even death. During a knee joint MRI test in a 5-year-old boy, anaphylaxis, a serious symptom, occurred after injecting gadolinium-based MR contrast medium. Here we report this case along with a literature review.
