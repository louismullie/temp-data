## Question

In males, what are the causes and treatment options for UTI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes and treatment options for male urinary tract infections, including classification, risk factors, diagnostics, treatment, special populations, stewardship, and a final management framework. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how male UTIs are defined and classified. Then, I should verify the main etiologies and risk factors. Next, I will review microbiology and host factors, followed by clinical presentation and diagnostics, including whether imaging is truly mandatory. After that, I need to examine empiric therapy and duration, source control, stewardship and non-antibiotic strategies, and finally synthesize a practical management plan with special population considerations, making sure each step is tightly linked to guideline-quality evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm the classification because it frames everything downstream. Traditionally, UTIs in males are considered complicated owing to the higher likelihood of structural or functional abnormalities and treatment failure risk, although newer EAU guidance emphasizes nuance while still distinguishing uncomplicated versus complicated by host and anatomic factors; practically, most male UTIs are approached as complicated in clinical practice to avoid undertreatment and missed source issues [^114VaKCN] [^113Ym5hA]. I should double-check the definition of complicated UTI as infection occurring in the context of obstruction, catheters, neurogenic dysfunction, immunosuppression, or other host factors, which aligns with radiologic and infectious disease frameworks used for workup and escalation decisions [^112TE65A] [^1137rWfo].

> Next, I will now examine the primary causes and risk factors, and I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing from female data. In men, benign prostatic hyperplasia with post-void residual is a central driver via urinary stasis; bladder outlet obstruction due to strictures or stones, neurogenic bladder, indwelling catheters, and recent urologic instrumentation also substantially elevate risk, which clinically explains the higher rates of complicated presentations and the frequent need for procedural source control in severe cases [^113YGTkC] [^113pPheb] [^112bLb2m] [^113yacG5]. Hold on, I should verify catheter contribution; yes, catheter-associated infections constitute the majority of complicated UTIs, reinforcing the need to remove or replace implicated devices during treatment [^112bLb2m] [^115owYCb].

> I should confirm medical comorbidities that amplify risk and alter pathogen profiles. Diabetes increases UTI risk and atypical pathogens due to glucosuria and immune dysfunction; immunosuppression and chronic kidney disease or transplantation further impair defenses, and advanced age compounds these risks via anatomic changes and immune senescence, necessitating tailored dosing and expanded diagnostic vigilance [^114Sa1vL] [^114VaKCN] [^113YGTkC]. Wait, let me verify the age link to occult malignancy; pyelonephritis in men over 50 has been reported as a marker to evaluate for urogenital cancer, which should shape follow-up after acute stabilization in older men [^113YGTkC].

> I need to check the microbiology so I don't miss resistant or non–E. coli pathogens. While Escherichia coli remains the predominant uropathogen, the spectrum in complicated male UTIs is broader, with Klebsiella, Proteus (notably associated with urolithiasis), Pseudomonas in older or healthcare-exposed patients, Enterococcus, and even polymicrobial infections, particularly in the elderly; this diversity translates to higher empirical failure if narrow regimens are chosen without culture-driven refinement [^1149KsGU] [^117QpXUR]. Let me reconsider resistance patterns in males; multidrug resistance in urinary E. coli is reported higher in men in some cohorts, which underscores early culture, leveraging local antibiograms, and careful step-down strategies [^117W9n9X] [^111vNp5W].

> But wait, what if host hormonal and genetic factors are also at play? Emerging translational data implicate androgens in potentiating severe upper-tract disease via intratubular bacterial communities and renal abscess formation, findings that align with worse pyelonephritis phenotypes in male models; genetic susceptibility clusters for upper-tract disease further suggest that family history and innate immune variations can stratify risk and recurrence severity in men [^1159J1zc] [^114HUzKP] [^115noKkX]. I should confirm clinical relevance; while these data are not yet prescribing changes in routine care, they help explain why a subset of men present with refractory or severe infections despite standard therapy [^116QdTvW].

> Next, I should review how these infections present clinically because atypical presentations can delay care. Older men with febrile UTIs often have fewer localizing urinary symptoms and may present with delirium or nonspecific decline; LUTS can be present but are less prominent than in younger men, and unrecognized prostatic involvement is common, contributing to relapse if not addressed during antibiotic selection and duration planning [^113YGTkC] [^113yacG5]. Hold on, I should verify the implication for follow-up; persistent bacteriuria or symptom relapse after appropriate therapy should trigger evaluation for chronic bacterial prostatitis as a sanctuary site [^113yacG5].

> For diagnostics, I initially thought imaging is mandatory for all male UTIs, but wait, let me verify that nuance. Imaging is generally warranted in complicated presentations, severe illness, recurrent events, or failure to respond, with ultrasound as a first-line, noninvasive tool to detect obstruction or collections, and CT or MRI reserved for suspected abscess, emphysematous infection, or treatment failure; stating "mandatory for all" is too strong, and the approach should be individualized by severity and clinical course [^113kk4VW] [^113pPheb]. I should double-check scrotal and prostatic evaluation; color Doppler ultrasound aids suspected epididymo-orchitis, and transrectal ultrasound can rapidly identify prostatic abscess when local tenderness and systemic signs persist despite therapy [^113kk4VW] [^113pPheb].

> Let me first confirm laboratory thresholds and culture strategy, because under-calling low-count bacteriuria in men can miss infection. Urine culture is essential in men, with lower diagnostic thresholds for bacteriuria than in women, typically at or below 10³ CFU/mL when accompanied by pyuria and compatible symptoms; blood cultures are indicated in febrile or septic presentations, and DRE to assess the prostate should be considered when prostatitis is suspected [^113BEzPi] [^1137rWfo] [^113pPheb]. I need to ensure stewardship discipline here; distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria in older men is critical to avoid unnecessary antibiotics that drive resistance and complications [^113kGXtE] [^1137rWfo].

> I will now examine empiric antibiotic selection, insisting on alignment with local resistance patterns and the clinical syndrome. Fluoroquinolones have favorable prostate penetration but rising resistance rates limit empiric reliability in many regions; third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone are suitable for moderate to severe presentations, often with an aminoglycoside in sepsis, and beta-lactam–beta-lactamase inhibitor regimens are considered for suspected ESBLs; nitrofurantoin is restricted to lower-tract cystitis and is inappropriate for pyelonephritis or prostatitis due to poor tissue levels [^115kmevX] [^111vNp5W] [^117CU9Hp] [^113dJdf1]. Hold on, I should verify the initial choice in catheter-associated complicated cases; EAU 2025 suggests amoxicillin plus an aminoglycoside, a second-generation cephalosporin plus an aminoglycoside, or IV third-generation cephalosporin as reasonable empiric strategies pending culture data and severity assessment [^117CU9Hp].

> Now, duration is where mistakes are common, so I need to check the syndrome-specific evidence carefully. For febrile UTIs in men, randomized data demonstrate that 14 days outperform 7 days for short-term clinical cure, likely due to occult prostatic involvement serving as a reservoir; I should confirm the exact figures, which show a clinically meaningful difference favoring 14 days, establishing 14 days as a practical minimum for febrile male UTIs absent source control issues [^111PE5AN] [^117UYiyk] [^113BEzPi]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overgeneralized to all men; in afebrile men with lower-tract infection treated with ciprofloxacin or TMP-SMX, 7 days was noninferior to 14 days in a VA trial, so duration should be tailored to the presentation rather than applying a uniform 14-day course to every male UTI [^1171F9GK].

> I should confirm the importance of source control, because failing to address anatomic drivers undermines antibiotics. Relief of obstruction from stones or significant BPH, drainage of prostatic or perineal abscesses, and removal or replacement of infected catheters or stents are central to achieving cure in complicated male UTIs, and these decisions often hinge on early imaging and urologic involvement in severe disease [^113pPheb] [^115owYCb]. Let me verify catheter strategy; timely catheter removal or exchange reduces bacterial burden and biofilm persistence, improving antimicrobial efficacy and clinical outcomes [^115owYCb].

> I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship is embedded throughout, given the resistance crisis. E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones exceeds 20% in many communities, undercutting these agents for empiric use; diagnostic and treatment overreach in suspected UTIs is common, with up to half of prescriptions potentially inappropriate, so anchoring treatment on UTI-specific symptoms plus culture improves accuracy and preserves options [^115kmevX] [^111ag7A6]. But wait, let me double-check ASB guidance; in nonpregnant adults and most catheterized patients, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated, except in specific procedural circumstances, to avoid harm and resistance selection [^113kGXtE] [^115owYCb].

> Next, I should review non-antibiotic and adjunct strategies, making sure not to overstate their role in men. Cranberry products may modestly reduce recurrence in selected populations but are less effective than antibiotics and evidence in men is limited; methenamine hippurate is emerging as a non-antibiotic prophylactic option in recurrent infections with growing supportive data; NSAIDs alone are inferior to antibiotics for symptom resolution and risk prevention and are not recommended as first-line; phage therapy remains investigational but is being explored due to AMR pressures [^115isbyo] [^113fX5G2] [^117JSgfm] [^112m772W] [^113955L9] [^113Sj4KX]. Hold on, I should verify clinical positioning; these adjuncts are best considered for prevention or in carefully selected cases, not as substitutes for antibiotics in acute male cUTI or pyelonephritis [^1137rWfo].

> I will now examine special populations because management pivots on context. Older men have more atypical presentations, higher bacteremia risk, and more resistance, requiring vigilant evaluation, renal-adjusted dosing, and follow-up for potential underlying malignancy; men with diabetes have broader pathogen spectra and higher complication rates, reinforcing glycemic optimization and careful coverage; veterans often face high FQ and TMP-SMX resistance, so ceftriaxone remains a useful empiric parenteral option in many centers pending local antibiograms [^113YGTkC] [^114Sa1vL] [^111vNp5W]. I should double-check the stewardship nuance in these groups; tailoring therapy to prior cultures and exposures reduces failure and collateral damage [^1137rWfo].

> Let me consider preventive structural strategies where applicable. In select male populations with recurrent infections, especially infants and potentially older males with persistent risk, circumcision has been associated with substantial reductions in lifetime UTI risk, though adult decision-making requires balancing benefits and individual context; neonatal and preterm data additionally suggest reductions in recurrence post-circumcision, supporting a discussion in high-risk scenarios [^116MdZRY] [^1114yH7M]. I need to ensure this is framed as patient-centered and risk-tailored rather than a blanket recommendation in adult men [^1137rWfo].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical management framework and double-check it aligns with the evidence. First, classify the syndrome and assume complicated until proven otherwise, distinguishing febrile or upper-tract involvement from lower-tract disease; second, assess risk factors such as BPH, stones, catheters, diabetes, and immunosuppression; third, obtain urine culture for all male UTIs and blood cultures if febrile or septic; fourth, perform early ultrasound when obstruction or abscess is a concern and escalate to CT or MRI for severe, refractory, or abscess-suspected cases; fifth, start empiric antibiotics guided by severity and local resistance, avoiding nitrofurantoin for suspected upper-tract or prostatic disease; sixth, choose duration by syndrome, using 14 days for febrile male UTIs and 7 days for afebrile cystitis in men when supported by clinical trajectory; seventh, evaluate for prostatitis when relapse occurs and extend therapy when indicated; eighth, achieve source control by relieving obstruction, draining abscesses, and addressing catheters; ninth, embed stewardship and avoid treating ASB, with close follow-up and post-therapy culture in selected complicated cases to document eradication and guide prevention [^1137rWfo] [^114VaKCN] [^117CU9Hp] [^111PE5AN] [^1171F9GK]. Hold on, I should verify that each step respects local practice variability; yes, the core remains culture-anchored care, anatomy-driven source control, syndrome-specific duration, and resistance-aware empiric choices, adjusted to patient context and guidelines [^1137rWfo] [^113Ym5hA].

Male UTIs are most often caused by **E. coli** and other Gram-negative bacteria [^1149KsGU] [^112TE65A], with key risk factors including **BPH, diabetes, and catheter use** [^113yacG5] [^114Sa1vL] [^115owYCb]. For diagnosis, **urine culture** is required [^1137rWfo] [^111ag7A6]. Empiric therapy should be guided by local resistance patterns [^111vNp5W] [^115kmevX] for afebrile lower UTIs, **7 days of a fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX** are effective [^1171F9GK], whereas **10–14 days** are required for febrile UTIs or prostatitis. Imaging is indicated for recurrent or complicated infections, and addressing underlying causes is essential to prevent recurrence [^113kk4VW] [^113Ym5hA].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

### Common pathogens

- **Escherichia coli**: Most common cause of community-acquired UTIs in men [^1149KsGU] [^112TE65A].
- **Other gram-negative bacteria**: Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter species [^112bLb2m] [^1149KsGU].
- **Gram-positive bacteria**: Enterococcus and Staphylococcus species, particularly in complicated or healthcare-associated infections [^1137rWfo] [^1149KsGU].

---

### Risk factors

- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**: Causes urinary stasis and increases UTI risk [^113yacG5] [^112bLb2m].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: Hyperglycemia and immune dysfunction predispose to UTIs [^114Sa1vL] [^1137rWfo].
- **Urinary catheters**: Indwelling catheters significantly increase UTI risk [^113yacG5] [^115owYCb].
- **Urological procedures**: Instrumentation and prostate biopsy increase infection risk [^113yacG5] [^112TE65A].
- **Immunosuppression**: Weakened immune system increases susceptibility [^1137rWfo].

---

## Clinical presentation

Male UTIs typically present with:

- **Dysuria**: Painful urination [^1137rWfo].
- **Frequency and urgency**: Increased need to urinate [^114AzavG].
- **Suprapubic pain**: Lower abdominal discomfort [^116BApmD].
- **Hematuria**: Blood in urine [^111ag7A6].
- **Fever and chills**: Indicative of upper tract involvement or prostatitis [^112TE65A].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

To identify causative organisms and guide antibiotic therapy, **urine culture** is essential [^1137rWfo]. Imaging with **ultrasound or CT** [^113pPheb] is indicated for recurrent or complicated infections to evaluate for structural abnormalities or obstruction [^113kk4VW].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Antibiotic therapy

Empiric **antibiotic therapy** should be guided by local resistance patterns and refined based on culture results. Common options include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) | Lower UTIs, prostatitis | 7–14 days |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) | Lower UTIs | 7 days [^1171F9GK] |
| Beta-lactams (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins) | Alternative therapy | 10–14 days [^1137rWfo] |

---

For **afebrile lower UTIs**, a 7-day course of fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX is effective [^1171F9GK]. For **febrile UTIs or prostatitis**, **10–14 days** of a fluoroquinolone or beta-lactam are recommended.

---

### Management of underlying conditions

Management of underlying conditions includes treating **BPH** with alpha-blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors to reduce urinary retention and recurrence risk [^113yacG5], and optimizing **catheter care** by minimizing catheter use and ensuring proper hygiene to prevent catheter-associated UTIs [^115owYCb].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventive measures include adequate hydration to maintain urinary flow, good genital hygiene to reduce bacterial colonization, and regular voiding to minimize urinary stasis. Antibiotic **prophylaxis** may be considered for recurrent UTIs or chronic catheterization [^1137rWfo].

---

## Complications

Untreated or recurrent UTIs in men can lead to prostatitis (prostate inflammation), epididymitis (epididymal inflammation), pyelonephritis (kidney infection) [^116QdTvW], and **sepsis** (systemic infection) [^112TE65A].

---

## Conclusion

UTIs in men are primarily caused by gram-negative bacteria, with risk factors including BPH, diabetes, and catheter use [^112bLb2m]. Accurate diagnosis with **urine culture** [^1137rWfo] and timely, **appropriate antibiotic therapy** are essential. Managing underlying conditions and implementing preventive measures are crucial to reduce recurrence and complications [^112TE65A].

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^113pPheb]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections (C-UTIs) are characterized by their association with structural or functional genitourinary abnormalities or conditions that impair host defense mechanisms, increasing the risk of infection acquisition or therapeutic failure. Patients with C-UTIs often present with risk factors such as neurogenic dysfunction, bladder outlet obstruction, obstructive uropathy, bladder catheterization, urologic instrumentation or indwelling stents, urinary tract post-surgical modifications, chemotherapy- or radiation-induced damage, renal impairment, diabetes, and immunodeficiency.

Multidetector CT and MRI provide a comprehensive examination of C-UTIs and systemic infections from unknown sources. Based on experiences at a tertiary care hospital focused on infectious illnesses, this pictorial essay reviews, with examples, the clinical features and cross-sectional imaging findings of C-UTIs affecting the lower urinary tract and male genital organs. Disorders presented include acute infectious cystitis, bladder mural abscesses, infections of the prostate and seminal vesicles, acute urethritis and related perineal abscesses, funiculitis, epididymo-orchitis, and scrotal abscesses. Emphasis is placed on the potential differential diagnoses of lower C-UTIs.

The aim is to provide radiologists with greater familiarity with these potentially severe disorders, which frequently require intensive in-hospital antibiotic therapy, percutaneous drainage, or surgery.

### Erectile dysfunction and diabetes: A melting pot of circumstances and treatments [^114Sa1vL]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

- **Urologic comorbidities**: Urologic comorbidities can occur in both T1DM and T2DM. The primary reason for such comorbidities is urogenital tract infections (UTI), which have higher incidence rates in patients with DM due to increased urinary glucose excretion, greater adherence of bacteria to the uroepithelium, chronic neurologic bladder dysfunction, and weakened immune responses. Furthermore, sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can slightly increase the risk of UTI, despite recent meta‐analyses suggesting no increased risk of severe bacterial infections. Male patients with DM (both T1DM and T2DM) have a threefold higher risk for asymptomatic bacteriuria and an increased risk of UTI recurrence, balanitis, balanoposthitis, and male accessory gland infection. While Escherichia coli has been the most frequently observed pathogen, other unusual microorganisms can be found, such as Klebsiella, fungal infections, gram-negative rods, enterococci, group B streptococci, Pseudomonas, and Proteus mirabilis. As such, early diagnosis of UTI is imperative to avoid complications such as emphysematous cystitis, pyelonephritis, renal failure, and bacteraemia. Balanitis or balanoposthitis, which are very frequent in patients with DM, mainly depend on Candida albicans, whereas male accessory gland infection often occurs in patients with DM with autonomic neuropathy.

DM (T2DM more than T1DM) has also been associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Both hypoxia due to vascular damage and hyperinsulinaemia are, in fact, important stimuli for prostate growth.

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^113kk4VW]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Indications and techniques for imaging urinary tract infections are crucial, especially in cases of complicated urinary tract infections (C-UTIs). Uncomplicated UTIs, typically seen in otherwise healthy young women, generally do not necessitate further investigation beyond laboratory and microbiological studies. Conversely, imaging is generally warranted for patients with recurrent infections, C-UTIs, or those who do not respond to antibiotic therapy. The key aims of imaging in urinary infections and urosepsis are:

- **Confirmation of urological cause**: Imaging can help confirm the presence of a urinary infection.
- **Detection of obstruction and abscesses**: Identifying obstructions and abscesses that may require interventional or surgical treatment is critical.
- **Detection of urolithiasis and retained foreign bodies**: Imaging aids in identifying urolithiasis and foreign bodies such as catheters.

The role of ultrasound is significant as it is a non-invasive, inexpensive, and repeatable method that serves as the mainstay first-line investigation. Ultrasound provides a rapid overview of the entire urinary tract and is effective in detecting urinary obstructions and most abnormal collections. The initial diagnostic assessment of C-UTIs affecting the lower urinary and male genital tract should rely on transabdominal urinary tract sonography. If symptoms and physical signs suggest involvement of the scrotum and perineum, a color Doppler ultrasound (CD-US) with high-resolution linear probes is warranted. Furthermore, if local pain and tenderness allow, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) may offer rapid assessment for the presence of abnormal masses or collections in the prostate and seminal vesicles. Finally, sonography often allows for a simpler, non-invasive post-treatment follow-up of abnormalities detected at cross-sectional imaging.

### The etiology of urinary tract infection: Traditional and emerging pathogens [^1149KsGU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The microbial etiology of urinary infections has been regarded as well established and reasonably consistent. Escherichia coli remains the predominant uropathogen, responsible for 80% of cases of acute community-acquired uncomplicated infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus, which accounts for 10% to 15%. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus species, and enterococci infrequently cause uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis.

The pathogens traditionally associated with UTIs are changing many of their features, particularly because of antimicrobial resistance. The etiology of UTIs is also affected by underlying host factors that complicate infections, such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, or catheterization. Consequently, complicated UTIs have a more diverse etiology than uncomplicated UTIs, allowing organisms that rarely cause disease in healthy patients to cause significant illness in hosts with anatomic, metabolic, or immunologic underlying conditions.

The majority of community-acquired symptomatic UTIs in elderly women are caused by E. coli. However, gram-positive organisms are common, and polymicrobial infections account for up to one in three cases in the elderly. In comparison, the most common organisms isolated in children with uncomplicated UTIs are Enterobacteriaceae. Etiologic pathogens associated with UTIs among patients with diabetes include Klebsiella spp. Group B streptococci, and Enterococcus spp., in addition to E. coli. Patients with spinal cord injuries commonly have E. coli infections. Other common uropathogens include Pseudomonas and Proteus mirabilis.

Recent advances in molecular biology may facilitate further understanding of these infections.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: A randomized clinical trial [^1171F9GK]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Determining optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness. This study's objective was to determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial took place at two US Veterans Affairs medical centers. Afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were enrolled between April 2014 and December 2019, with a final follow-up on January 28, 2020. Out of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days of treatment and were randomized to receive continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.

The prespecified primary outcome was resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment, with a noninferiority margin of 10% selected. The as-treated population (participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses) was used for the primary analysis. A secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included the recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Among the 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years), the study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment regimens.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: A pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^111PE5AN]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Our findings extend recent outcomes from a highly similar controlled randomized Swedish study conducted in women with acute pyelonephritis, demonstrating the non-inferiority of 7- to 14-day antimicrobial treatment. Compared to our study, their patient group was younger, had fewer comorbidities, and fewer cases of complicated UTIs.

In men, our results indicate an increase in the rate of clinical and bacteriological treatment failure following a 7-day treatment regimen compared to 14 days. Although chronic bacterial prostatitis was an exclusion criterion, this failure may be due to prostatic involvement in the infection, a known cause of recurrent UTIs even after appropriate antimicrobial treatment. There is a notable lack of studies focusing on the optimal treatment duration for febrile UTIs in men. One study directly compared different treatment durations in an open, prospective, and randomized trial involving 72 men with community-acquired febrile UTIs, showing similar bacteriological cure rates with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for either 2 or 4 weeks. Similarly, a randomized, double-blind trial in Sweden supported the efficacy of a 14-day treatment with fluoroquinolones in men. These studies collectively confirm that, at present, a 14-day treatment regimen of fluoroquinolones is the minimum necessary for optimal therapy of febrile UTIs in men.

Recently, however, a retrospective analysis of a large database of male veterans indicated that more than 7 days of antibiotic treatment, mostly with ciprofloxacin, was not associated with a reduction in UTI recurrence.

### Urinary tract infections: current and emerging management strategies [^113efeWL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Acute cystitis is one of the most commonly encountered bacterial infections and is responsible for substantial morbidity and high medical costs in the United States and across the globe. Though generally considered to be self-limiting and easily treated with antibiotics, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often incompletely resolved by antibiotic therapy and frequently recur. This is in part due to the ability of uropathogenic bacteria to invade, replicate, and persist within host epithelial cells. The biological complexity of these infections, combined with a dramatic rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens, highlights the need for alternative therapies.

In this review, we examine management strategies for UTIs, as well as emerging treatments, including novel compounds that block bacterial interactions with the urothelium and vaccines focused on preventing both acute and recurrent infections.

### Urinary tract infection in women over the age of 65: Is age alone a marker of complication [^112bWJbi]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We were interested to know if our older female patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) might have differing pathogens or rates of Escherichia coli antibiotic sensitivity and if our physicians managed them in a manner similar or dissimilar to the care provided to younger patients with no complications.

- **Methods**: This was a secondary analysis from patients excluded from a previous retrospective study regarding uncomplicated UTIs.

- **Results**: Twenty-six percent of total patients with UTIs were older than 65 and otherwise medically uncomplicated, whereas 21% were older patients who did have complicating factors. E. coli was a pathogen in 81% of uncomplicated elders' and 54% of complicated elders' cultures. The sensitivity rate of E. coli to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) in both groups was 86%. Physicians were significantly less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP for complicated older patients with complications than for young patients with an uncomplicated UTI (P = 0.017); there was a significant trend of physicians to be less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP with advancing age and complications across all three groups (P = 0.011). Antibiotics rarely needed to be changed after cultures.

- **Conclusions**: The presence of E. coli on culture in patients with a UTI changes based on medical complications, not age. Being medically complex did not result in reduced sensitivity of E. coli to SMX/TMP but was associated with increased rates of the presence of other pathogens. In our setting, treatment employed with SMX/TMP and without the use of culture and sensitivity may be effective.

### Characteristics of febrile urinary tract infections in older male adults [^113YGTkC]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

According to our study, older males with a febrile urinary tract infection (FUTI) present specific clinical characteristics, microbiological patterns, antimicrobial-resistant patterns, and outcomes that differ from those of non-older males. Due to the high frequency of urinary tract infections (UTI) among older patients, it is crucial to consider these differences when attending to geriatric males with FUTI in the emergency department to provide optimal therapeutic care.

Normal voiding is the most important defense against UTI. Increased post-void residual volume, which occurs in aging males mainly due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), causes urinary stasis and predisposes individuals to UTI. Urinary tract abnormalities and the use of indwelling urinary catheters (IUC) are additional contributors to UTI in geriatric patients. A higher frequency of urinary tract abnormalities, mainly BPH but also urogenital cancer, was observed in older patients. In a study by Søgaard et al, acute pyelonephritis in patients older than 50 years was identified as a marker of urogenital cancer, suggesting that older patients with FUTI should be evaluated to rule out this possibility.

- **Clinical presentation**: More than half of the older males included in the study presented lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), consistent with previous descriptions. Despite the frequent occurrence of urinary symptoms in older males, we observed a lower frequency of LUTS, flank pain, and lumbar tenderness compared to non-older patients. Previous studies, particularly those involving patients living in long-term care facilities (LTCF), have noted a lower frequency of localizing urinary symptoms in older patients with FUTI. Although fever is frequently absent or blunted in geriatric patients.

### Expert panel recommendations on lower urinary tract health of women across their life span [^112es4fn]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Women of reproductive age are at significant risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The National Ambulatory Care Survey reported almost 30 million physician office visits for UTIs from 2002 to 2007, with women over 45 accounting for over 26 million (more than 87%) of those visits. Notably, 60% were over 55 years old. Hospitalization rates for UTI in women over 65 were 4–45 times higher than for younger women. The epidemiology and treatment of UTIs are complicated due to a lack of objective diagnostic measures, including variations in collection methods (clean catch versus catheterized), lack of routine cultures to confirm diagnosis, nonspecific symptoms, and a lack of guidelines on the use of antibiotics.

New evidence has shown that urine is not sterile, highlighting our limited understanding of the roles of asymptomatic versus symptomatic bacteria. Additionally, the definition of reinfections is debatable, leading to either lack of appropriate treatment or mistreatment.

The prevalence of bladder pain syndrome (BPS) among women (3.8%) is comparable to other painful conditions, such as migraine (2.1%), asthma (3.7%), and back pain (4.1%), and it is much more prevalent in women than in men. Women with bladder pain also experience chronic pelvic pain. Women with BPS under 30 years of age are more likely to experience urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria, dyspareunia, and pain in their external genitalia than older women, who are more likely to experience nocturia, urinary incontinence (UI), and Hunner's ulcer disease. While the impact of BPS on women is recognized, an improved understanding of the etiology is needed to develop more effective treatments.

### Common questions about recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^113fX5G2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are prevalent in women, including those who are healthy with normal genitourinary anatomy. Recurrent UTIs (ReUTIs) are typically defined as three or more UTIs within 12 months or two or more occurrences within six months. The same species that caused previous infections is usually responsible for these recurrences.

In premenopausal women, established risk factors include sexual intercourse three or more times per week, spermicide use, new or multiple sex partners, and experiencing a UTI before the age of 15. For postmenopausal women, the risk primarily increases due to the sequelae of lower estrogen levels. Episodes of ReUTIs are typically characterized by dysuria, coupled with urinary frequency or hesitancy.

Findings from medical history or physical examination that suggest a complicated infection or another disease process warrant additional evaluation. At least one symptomatic episode should be verified by urine culture to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment, although imaging is rarely necessary.

Short courses of antibiotics prove as effective as longer courses. Patient-initiated treatment reduces the cost of diagnosis, frequency of physician visits, and duration of symptomatic days compared to physician-initiated treatment. It also lessens antibiotic exposure compared with antibiotic prophylaxis. While antibiotic prophylaxis effectively limits UTI recurrence, it increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Cranberry products may help reduce recurrent UTIs in premenopausal women but are less effective than antibiotic prophylaxis, and current data are conflicting. Optimal dosing for cranberry products remains unknown.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: An updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117JSgfm]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common global health issue, particularly affecting women, with approximately 7 million women seeking outpatient care annually for uncomplicated UTIs. These infections, caused by bacterial invasion of the urinary tract, include conditions such as cystitis and pyelonephritis. Due to anatomical factors, women are more susceptible to UTIs, and recurrence is a significant concern, with up to 27% of women experiencing a repeat infection within six months. This recurrence contributes to both clinical and economic burdens.

Antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin, are commonly prescribed for acute UTI treatment but come with side effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances and allergic reactions. More critically, widespread antibiotic use is fueling the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which complicates treatment. Long-term antibiotic use in treating UTIs leads to high overall resistance to commonly used antibiotics, such as ampicillin (39.6%), trimethoprim (23.8%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (22.4%). Despite the approach to managing UTIs predominantly involving antibiotics, there are ongoing concerns about overuse, antibiotic resistance, and potential aftereffects.

Guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) focus on optimizing UTI management; however, challenges remain in antibiotic selection, treatment duration, and the management of reinfections. Recent studies, including a meta-analysis, highlight these ongoing challenges.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^113955L9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Furthermore, even patients with "positive" urine cultures may have asymptomatic bacteriuria and thus not require treatment. Misdiagnosis of UTI is particularly common in elderly women who have other long-standing urinary tract symptoms, such as incontinence. However, the maximum age cutoffs used in four out of five studies (50 to 70 years of age) likely avoided some challenges of diagnosing UTIs in the elderly while also limiting generalizability to these groups. In summary, although there is a subset of individuals who clearly benefit from antibiotics, there is likely another segment that does not benefit from antibiotics and could be appropriately treated with NSAIDs or no therapy.

Another important finding from the included studies was that only 2.0–4.5% of individuals treated with NSAIDs subsequently developed pyelonephritis (based on 3 studies with 1,130 patients). Thus, to avoid one case of pyelonephritis, 22 to 62 people would need to be treated with antibiotics. Notably, these reported rates of pyelonephritis in NSAID groups were higher than placebo arms of prior clinical trials (0.4% and 2.6%). While better follow-up to assess outcomes in the NSAID studies may be partially responsible, NSAIDs have also been associated with worse outcomes in other infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, possibly due to immune suppression. These and other potential adverse effects of NSAIDs must be better understood before these drugs can be used for uncomplicated UTI.

In summary, this review demonstrates the superiority of antibiotics over NSAIDs for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs.

### Urinary tract infection pathogenesis: host factors [^113tCV6p]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). High credibility.

Clinically, host factors in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) may be considered as modifiable or intrinsic and nonmodifiable. Modifiable factors include behaviors associated with increased risk of UTI, as well as anatomic and functional problems of the urinary tract, which are potentially amenable to changes in patient behavior or treatment approaches. Intrinsic and nonmodifiable host factors, such as gender and genetic influences associated with UTIs, are aspects that neither the patient nor the clinician can influence. Although considering nonmodifiable host factors may be discouraging to patients and clinicians at present, some genetic associations have the potential for future predictive value and may interface with future treatments.

### Uropathogen and host responses in pyelonephritis [^116QdTvW]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. The ascent of UTI-causing pathogens to the kidneys results in pyelonephritis, which can trigger kidney injury, scarring, and ultimately impair kidney function. Despite sizable efforts to understand how infections develop or are cleared in the bladder, our appreciation of the mechanisms by which infections develop, progress, or are eradicated in the kidney is limited. The identification of virulence factors that are produced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli to promote pyelonephritis has begun to fill this knowledge gap, as have insights into the mechanisms by which kidney tubular epithelial cells oppose uropathogenic E. coli infection to prevent or eradicate UTIs. Emerging data also illustrate how specific cellular immune responses eradicate infection, whereas other immune cell populations promote kidney injury. Insights into the mechanisms by which uropathogenic E. coli circumvent host immune defenses or antibiotic therapy to cause pyelonephritis are paramount to the development of new prevention and treatment strategies to mitigate pyelonephritis and its associated complications.

### Urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults [^113kGXtE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging. This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults. It discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

### Overview on cranberry and urinary tract infections in females [^115isbyo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) has been used for decades to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Owing to the traditional use of cranberry and its A-type proanthocyanidins' ability to inhibit adherence of the bacterial P fimbriae in a dose-dependent manner, clinical trials have been conducted on different subpopulations.

A Cochrane meta-analysis involving 244 females with symptomatic UTIs suggests that the effect was more pronounced in women with recurrent UTIs (reUTIs) than in elderly males and females or people requiring catheterization. A first head-to-head trial in older females was published, comparing the effectiveness of a low-dose antibiotic versus cranberry. The investigators suggest that cranberry products may have a role in reUTI management for older females.

With regard to antibiotic treatment in women, a recently published study investigated the potential interaction between cranberry juice and beta-lactam antibiotics, supporting the hypothesis that cranberry juice, in usual quantities as prophylaxis for UTI, is not likely to alter the pharmacokinetics of these oral antibiotics. Furthermore, the effects of cranberry in pregnant female patients have been studied. A first pilot trial was published showing a possible protective effect; however, more than one-third of the females withdrew, primarily due to gastrointestinal upset.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^1174T2WE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome.

Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence, often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

The European Association of Urology Urological Infections Guidelines Panel is proposing a new classification scheme for categorizing urinary tract infections (UTIs) into uncomplicated and complicated types.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). High credibility.

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. The use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomatology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women, to 16% in older women in the community, and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities. This demonstrates why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to clinical guidelines.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^111Gwyks]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk of over 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months.

An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs occur in patients with underlying structural or medical problems.

In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections among women in a large integrated health care organization in the United States [^112bLb2m]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections, with an estimated annual incidence of over 150 million cases worldwide. In the United States, UTIs result in approximately 10.5 million office visits, as well as 3 million emergency department (ED) encounters and 400,000 hospitalizations annually, with an estimated annual cost exceeding $4.8 billion. UTIs primarily affect women, followed by male infants and older men. Based on epidemiologic data from a study in the United States, about 1 in 3 women have at least 1 UTI diagnosed by a clinician that requires antibiotic medication, and the lifetime risk of UTIs among women is over 60%.

Clinically, UTIs are categorized as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs) can be differentiated into lower (cystitis) and upper (pyelonephritis) UTIs, and they typically affect individuals who are otherwise healthy. Approximately 75% of uUTIs are caused by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and other pathogens. Complicated UTIs are associated with factors compromising the urinary tract or host defense, such as urinary obstruction, immunosuppression, renal failure/transplantation, and indwelling catheterization. In the United States, 70% to 80% of complicated UTIs are attributable to indwelling catheters, accounting for 1 million cases per year.

### Urinary tract infections: diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^116BApmD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

With the emergence of increasing resistance to common antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), including ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the choice of antibiotics for these infections has become more challenging. This article reviews evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of cystitis and pyelonephritis in the emergency department. The pathophysiology and initial diagnostic workup are discussed, with particular attention given to the urine dipstick.

The utility of hospital antibiograms in making the initial antibiotic choice is also evaluated. **Treatment recommendations**: The treatment section reviews recommendations, highlighting the use of nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated UTIs. The appropriate use of ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX in the treatment of UTIs is also discussed.

### Urinary tract infections and bacterial prostatitis in men [^113yacG5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to highlight advances in research on urinary tract infections (UTIs) and bacterial prostatitis in men in the preceding year.

Recent findings have shown that the antiseptic properties of prostate secretions might play an important role in preventing recurrence. Risk factors for UTIs in men include prostate enlargement and urological interventions, such as transrectal prostate biopsy. Preventive treatment for prostate enlargement has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of UTIs. However, infections following prostate biopsy, such as UTIs and bacterial prostatitis, are increasing due to rising rates of fluoroquinolone resistance. The increasing global antibiotic resistance significantly impacts the management of UTIs in men, necessitating alternative strategies.

Apart from preventing complicating factors leading to UTIs, a more thorough understanding of the pathophysiology may be important in defining new targets for treatment. Interesting results concerning the intracellular mucosal bacterial load in the bladder wall have been discovered in recent years.

In summary, UTIs in men and bacterial prostatitis are currently underrepresented in the medical literature. The rise in antibacterial resistance calls for novel strategies in the prevention and management of UTIs and bacterial prostatitis in men.

### The urinary microbiome: Improving diagnostics and management of urinary tract infections in adult females [^111pQV8y]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

This article discusses the urinary microbiome in relation to urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. It makes biological sense that the microbiota of different niches (bladder, vagina, and gut) interact with each other in health, as well as during a UTI event; however, these relationships remain poorly understood. Future research should close knowledge gaps regarding the interactions between the urinary microbiota and the host, among the microbiota of adjacent niches, and between the microbes within the same microbiota. This new knowledge should result in improved UTI treatment in the age of antibiotic stewardship.

### High incidence of abnormal imaging findings in circumcised boys diagnosed with urinary tract infections [^116aBFWg]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend delaying voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) until the second febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). Similarly, the NICE Guidelines do not recommend VCUG after the first febrile UTI in infants and children under three years of age. Currently, there is no good clinical indicator to determine which patients would benefit from an earlier cystogram. We sought to identify clinical and bacteriologic findings associated with an increased risk of urinary tract anatomic anomalies in pediatric males presenting to the Emergency Department with a UTI.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was performed of all urine cultures from the Emergency Department at our institution between 2006 and 2015. Males under 18 years of age with ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of Proteus, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus were included. Clean catch, catheterized and suprapubic aspiration specimens were included. Bagged specimens and specimens from patients on intermittent catheterization were excluded. Ultrasound and cystogram images were reviewed when available. Univariate and multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance was used to calculate and compare prevalence ratios. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata software, version 15.1 MP (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).

- **Results**: We reviewed 1,585 urine cultures, of which 812 met eligibility criteria including 619 (76.2%) E. coli, 84 (10.3%) Proteus, 55 (6.8%) Klebsiella, 29 (3.6%) Staphylococcus, and 13 (1.6%) Enterococcus.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: A pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^117UYiyk]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Short-term clinical cure rates were analyzed in preset subgroups of patients. In women, short-term clinical cures for the 7- and 14-day arms were 47 of 50 (94%) versus 54 of 58 (93%), respectively. The difference in cure rate was 0.9% (90% CI, –6.9 to 8.7, P non-inferiority = 0.011), confirming non-inferiority. In men, clinical cure rates differed significantly between those treated for 7 or 14 days (38 of 44; 86% vs. 40 of 41; 98%). The difference in cure rate was –11.2 (90% CI, –20.6 to –1.8, P non-inferiority = 0.417, P superiority 2-sided = 0.050), confirming the superiority of the 14-days treatment.

The large difference in risk differences for age was predominantly determined by men. Therefore, and for exploratory reasons, an additional subgroup analysis was performed within the group of men and women. The results are presented in Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Figure S2.

- **Clinical and bacteriologic outcomes**: Data are presented as number (%), unless otherwise indicated. NA: not applicable

	a. Short-term efficacy: endpoints assessed at 10- to 18-days post-treatment visit

	b. Clinical cure: being alive with the absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms through post-treatment visit with no additional antimicrobial therapy for a relapse of UTI prescribed

	c. Bacteriologic cure: elimination of study entry uropathogen or pathogen growth < 10⁴ CFU/mL (women) or < 10³ CFU/mL (men) combined with disappearance of leucocyturia

	d. Cumulative efficacy: endpoint assessed at 70- to 84-days post-treatment visit

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: Challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome and choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance. It is also important to consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: Randomised controlled trial [^115qQwRP]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near-patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections while minimizing antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values.

We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives. Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesized that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of management using dipstick or clinical algorithms compared with the alternative management strategies.

### A genome-wide association study of susceptibility to upper urinary tract infections [^115eTnkM]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Our study has several strengths and limitations. One major strength is the sex-stratified analysis conducted to explore potential sex differences. Despite using data from multiple large biobanks, we had a relatively small number of cases, which may explain the few genome-wide significant hits. Misclassification of our phenotype might occur due to changes in coding practices, regulation guidelines, and traditions over time, as well as differences in coding practices between different countries. Additionally, ICD-9/10 codes serve primarily for billing purposes and are not generated to facilitate research. Individuals used as controls may develop upper UTI after the analyses, which might bias our results in unknown ways. Quality control was performed for each of the three datasets to ensure good quality of the included SNPs in the GWAS analysis. However, different genotyping platforms and imputation pipelines between the three studies may have impacted our results.

As we only evaluated participants of European ancestry, our findings may be less generalizable to other ancestry groups. Ideally, data from separate GWASs should be used for the exposures and outcomes in the two-sample MR approach to reduce the risk of confounding bias due to overlapping participants. Even though some of the exposures and outcomes were from overlapping cohorts, we observed similar effect estimates when we restricted the analyses to nonoverlapping cohorts, indicating that sample overlap was not a major issue in this study.

In conclusion, we identified one genome-wide significant locus and several loci suggestively associated with susceptibility to upper urinary tract infections.

Regarding medical management for catheter-associated urinary tract infections, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend administering any of the following regimens as empirical therapy in patients with complicated pyelonephritis with systemic symptoms:

- **Amoxicillin and an aminoglycoside**: A combination therapy to effectively address infections.
- **Second-generation cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside**: Utilized to enhance the antimicrobial regimen.
- **IV third-generation cephalosporin**: Administered intravenously for systemic infections.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: What should we do [^111uFNwY]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

There is growing awareness that urinary tract infection (UTI), undetected by routine diagnostics, might play a causal role in the generation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This proposal is controversial because the exclusion of UTI is a key step in every guideline concerned with the management of LUTS. As a result, LUTS have become synonymous with noninfective disease. However, there is increasing evidence that patients presenting with LUTS may harbour a UTI despite negative tests.

The problem lies with the diagnostic criteria used in culture-based diagnosis. A significant body of published literature points to the inherent flaws of quantitative urinary microbiological analysis, in which thresholds between 10³ cfu/ml and 10⁶ cfu/ml of a pure growth of a single urinary pathogen are employed to diagnose UTI. Dipstick urinalysis performs equally poorly, hampered by insensitivity and spectrum bias. These tests cannot reliably exclude UTI and do not take into account differences in bacterial strain virulence, host genetic variability, intracellular bacterial reservoirs, or even urine dilution due to high fluid intake before the test.

### Lower urinary tract infections: Management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^113dJdf1]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

Symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for consultation in primary care, where most suspected episodes are managed. Uncomplicated lower UTIs generally resolve quickly, and many are self-limiting. However, 11% of women report experiencing at least one UTI, and 3% report experiencing three or more UTIs in the previous year. There are marked differences across four European countries in culture positivity, antibiotic prescribing, and re-consultation, despite similarities in the presentation of UTI in primary care, the pathogens, and antibiotic sensitivities. The high incidence of UTI and tendency to recur lead to elevated healthcare costs.

UTIs are the second most common reason for antibiotic prescribing. In the UK, recent national clinical guidelines recommend treating lower UTIs with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, particularly nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim, when the risk of resistance is low (e.g. considering previous antibiotic use and previous urine culture and sensitivity results). Amoxicillin or oral cephalosporins are advised for second or third-line therapy for pregnant women and children aged 3 months or more. The choice of second-line antibiotic therapy in adult men should be guided by culture results after considering alternative diagnoses to UTIs. Antibiotic use, even in short courses, can alter the normal microbial composition of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina, selecting for drug-resistant pathogens. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of five studies of UTIs managed in primary care found an increased risk of antibiotic resistance.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^114VaKCN]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

UTIs are characterized according to several schemas and terminologies, which are relevant to their diagnostic work-up. Anatomically, lower UTIs are confined to the bladder (cystitis) and/or urethra, while upper UTIs involve ascension to the kidneys (pyelonephritis). The latter are more commonly associated with both bacteremia (a condition defined microbiologically) and urosepsis (defined clinicopathologically), although they may occur with cystitis alone.

UTIs may be further defined according to patient risk factors. Uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) affects non-pregnant, immunocompetent females without structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities or other predisposing conditions. Notably, an explicit microbiologic diagnosis, such as urine culture, is not necessarily indicated for routine cases of uncomplicated cystitis, as empiric antimicrobial therapy is often appropriate.

Complicated UTI (cUTI) is an umbrella term for infections arising in the context of risk factors listed above for uUTI. Traditionally, a UTI in a male is inherently considered complicated, although this is controversial. Complicated infections secondary to catheterization are termed catheter-associated UTIs.

In terms of temporal dynamics, multiple episodes of symptomatic infection (two within six months or three within one year) with intervening periods of clinical resolution are referred to as reUTIs. These may represent persistent infections by the same offending organism or reinfection by a different species or strain. Likewise, the term chronic UTI is applied loosely to either recurrent or unresolving infections.

### Antimicrobial resistance trends in urine Escherichia coli isolates from adult and adolescent females in the United States from 2011 to 2019: Rising ESBL strains and impact on patient management [^115kmevX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common community-onset bacterial infections and are treated by a variety of healthcare professionals. Uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs), those occurring in females in the absence of underlying abnormalities of the urinary tract or immunosuppression, affect 10–12% of adult women at least once per year in the United States (US), with 20–30% of those experiencing a subsequent reinfection. The incidence of uUTI is bimodal, with peaks in young, sexually active women aged 15–24 years and in postmenopausal women. The microbial etiology of uUTI is well characterized, with Escherichia coli being the predominant uropathogen isolated in community-onset uUTI.

There has been a notable increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among E. coli from community-onset uUTIs in the last two decades. A 2012 in vitro study of E. coli urine isolates from US outpatients (2001–2010) found significant increases in AMR to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Similarly, in a study of urine isolates from 18 European countries in 2018, resistance to TMP-SMX was found in 32.7% (range: 23.1–56.2% across countries) of E. coli isolates from clinical urine samples, and the prevalence of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance was greater than 20%.

The acquisition of AMR genes is especially important among Enterobacterales, as these are associated with the potential to confer cross- or co-resistance to multiple drug classes, causing multidrug resistance (MDR). Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is one of the most clinically relevant MDR phenotypes.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115owYCb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend diagnosing CA-ASB in patients with:

- **Conditions**:
	- An indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter, or intermittent catheterization

### Novel role for androgen signaling in pyelonephritis [^1159J1zc]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Sex differences in urinary tract infection (UTI) susceptibility and severity are well-documented, with past research primarily focusing on anatomical differences between males and females. Historically, experimental UTI studies have utilized female animals due to the ease of transurethral bladder catheterization. Olson and colleagues have developed a sex-independent model of experimental UTI, utilizing direct bladder inoculation, which enables the investigation of sex differences in UTI susceptibility. Building upon previous work with this model, the study implicates androgens as contributors to tubular invasion by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, leading to the formation of luminal bacterial communities that precede renal abscess formation.

### Urologic diseases in America project: Trends in resource use for urinary tract infections in men [^113bGKsQ]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Various types of urinary tract infection (UTI) occur in men. In this study, we examined health care use trends, including epidemiological and economic factors, for UTI in men in the United States.

The analytical methods used to generate these results have been described previously.

Approximately 20% of all UTIs occur in men. Between 1988 and 1994, the overall lifetime prevalence of UTI was estimated to be 13,689 per 100,000 men. Orchitis rates, particularly in older men, are generally higher than those of cystitis or pyelonephritis. Approximately 10% of all inpatient care for men with UTI is for orchitis (12 to 14 per 100,000 population). Rates of outpatient hospital and physician office care for male UTI have increased in the last decade. Rates for emergency room care for UTI in elderly men (85 to 94 years old) were almost twice those in men younger than 85 years. The adjusted mean health care expenditure for privately insured men with UTI was $5,544 in 1999, compared to $2,715 for men without UTI. Total annual health care expenditures for men and women with UTI were $5,544 and $5,407, respectively. Mean time lost from work was slightly higher for men. Based on composite data, overall medical expenditures for men with UTI in the United States were estimated to be approximately $1.028 billion in 2000.

Health care use and economic data on UTIs in men revealed a number of intriguing trends. These results raise various important questions for future research.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility trends for urinary isolates in the veteran population [^111vNp5W]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Low credibility.

Guidance on empiric treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is lacking for the male population, which comprises much of the Veteran population in the United States. This study evaluated susceptibility trends in antimicrobials used for the treatment of UTIs in the inpatient and outpatient Veteran population nationwide.

- **Methods**: Urine culture data was retrospectively obtained from the Corporate Data Warehouse. All urine cultures from Veteran Health Administration patients 18 years of age or older, treated at any VA health care center in 2009 and 2018, were eligible. Antibiograms were constructed for bacterial isolate susceptibility.

- **Results**: In 2009 and 2018, isolates from 54,788 and 58,983 Veterans were analyzed, respectively. Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium isolated. For ceftriaxone, E. coli susceptibilities were relatively high but trended downward from 2009 to 2018. Common urinary pathogen susceptibilities remained low for fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

- **Discussion**: Empiric therapy for Veterans with UTIs should be based on local susceptibility patterns, as previously recommended first-line agents have fallen out of favor due to increasing resistance rates.

- **Conclusions**: Both inpatient and outpatient stewardship is needed to ensure appropriate treatment, as viable treatment options for UTIs are becoming increasingly limited.

### Circumcision and lifetime risk of urinary tract infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116MdZRY]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is common in infant males who are uncircumcised and can lead to renal parenchymal disease of the still-growing pediatric kidney. Although the rate of urinary tract infection is highest in the first year of life, the cumulative incidence during the rest of the lifetime is under-recognized but is expected to be nontrivial. Thus, any intervention that might prevent urinary tract infection would be expected to reduce suffering and medical costs.

We conducted a meta-analysis of 22 studies examining the single risk factor of lack of circumcision, then determined the prevalence and relative risk of urinary tract infection in different age groups (0 to 1, 1 to 16, and older than 16 years). From these data, we estimated the lifetime prevalence.

For age 0 to 1 year, the relative risk was 9.91 (95% CI 7.49–13.1); for age 1 to 16 years, RR was 6.56 (95% CI 3.26–13.2); and for those older than 16 years, it was 3.41-fold (95% CI 0.916–12.7) higher in uncircumcised males. We then calculated that 32.1% (95% CI 15.6–49.8) of uncircumcised males experience a urinary tract infection in their lifetime compared with 8.8% (95% CI 4.15–13.2) of circumcised males (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.15–11.8). The number needed to treat was 4.29 (95% CI 2.20–27.2).

The single risk factor of lack of circumcision confers a 23.3% chance of urinary tract infection during the lifetime. This greatly exceeds the prevalence of circumcision complications (1.5%), which are mostly minor. The potential seriousness of urinary tract infection supports circumcision.

### Urinary tract infections revisited [^116Rexcx]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) remain a significant clinical problem, despite antibiotic treatment and surgical correction of reflux and malformations. Here, we propose that novel molecular tools may be applied to modernize and individualize the diagnosis and therapy of UTIs. Determinants of bacterial virulence and host resistance are relatively well understood at the molecular level, and technology for their detection is within reach.

### Multidrug resistance in urinary E. coli higher in males compared to females [^117W9n9X]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections and a frequent reason for urological referral. Women face a greater risk of UTIs than men, with the risk increasing with age. In men, UTIs are associated with advancing age and underlying urinary tract disorders such as benign prostatic hypertrophy. For both men and women, the most common uropathogen causing UTIs is Escherichia coli, responsible for over half of urinary tract infections. Antibiotic treatment failure can result in urinary sepsis, renal abscesses, and impairment of renal function.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multidrug resistance (MDR) in E. coli are major threats to public health due to limited treatment options. While AMR is a naturally occurring phenomenon in bacteria, resistance accelerates when antimicrobials are misused or overused. It is estimated that almost 50% of prescribed antimicrobials may be unnecessary. There is a recognized increase in E. coli antimicrobial resistance levels. E. coli gain resistance through horizontal gene transfer. The common mechanisms involve genes that code for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), as well as mobile genetic elements such as integrons, transposons, and conjugative plasmids. Amoxicillin resistance is common in E. coli and frequently conferred by the TEM-1/TEM-2 β-lactamase; due to the high level of resistance, amoxicillin is not recommended as empiric therapy for UTIs. For trimethoprim and fluoroquinolones, resistance through mutations in dfrA and qnr genes, respectively, are often co-located with ESBLs.

### Can circumcision prevent recurrent urinary tract infections in hospitalized infants [^1114yH7M]. Clinical Pediatrics (2000). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is an uncommon but concerning condition for hospitalized premature infants. A retrospective chart review of all male infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from June 1996 through March 1999 was conducted at the Medical College of Georgia, a large academic medical center with a tertiary Level III NICU, to investigate the frequency and potential prevention of recurrent UTI in hospitalized infants. The effect of circumcision on the recurrence of UTI was also investigated. There were 38 infants with 53 UTIs among 744 male infants admitted during the study period (5.1%).

Infants were divided into two groups: A1 (< 37 weeks with a single UTI) and A2 (< 37 weeks with more than one UTI). In groups A1 and A2, 57% of the first UTIs were due to Candida or E. coli, while the remaining were due to other gram-negative organisms and Staphylococcus species. The mean gestational age (GA) in groups A1 and A2 was similar (29 ± 2 weeks for A1 and 29 ± 4 weeks for A2); however, the mean GA of infants with Candida UTI was 27 ± 2 weeks, and for bacterial UTI, it was 30 ± 3 weeks (p < 0.01). None of the premature infants in the study had a recurrent UTI once a circumcision was performed. Premature uncircumcised males had an increased risk for UTI (Odds Ratio = 11.1, 95% CI, 3.3–28.9, p < 0.001). Circumcision appears beneficial in reducing the risk for recurrent UTI in these infants.

### Urinary tract infections: Core curriculum 2024 [^1137rWfo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed.

- **Choice and duration of antibiotics**: Varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach.

- **Preventative measures for frequent UTIs**: Some preventative measures can be utilized for individuals prone to frequent UTIs, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

### Androgen exposure potentiates formation of intratubular communities and renal abscesses by Escherichia coli [^114HUzKP]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Females across their lifespan and certain male populations are susceptible to urinary tract infections (UTI). The influence of female vs. male sex on UTI is incompletely understood, in part because preclinical modeling has been performed almost exclusively in female mice. Here, we employed established and new mouse models of UTI with uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to investigate androgen influence on UTI pathogenesis. Susceptibility to UPEC UTI in both male and female hosts was potentiated with 5α-dihydrotestosterone, while males with androgen receptor deficiency as well as androgenized females treated with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide were protected from severe pyelonephritis. In androgenized females and in males, UPEC formed dense intratubular, biofilm-like communities, some of which were sheltered from infiltrating leukocytes by the tubular epithelium and by peritubular fibrosis. Abscesses were nucleated by small intratubular collections of UPEC first visualized at five days postinfection and briskly expanded over the subsequent 24 hours. Male mice deficient in Toll-like receptor 4, which fail to contain UPEC within abscesses, were susceptible to lethal dissemination. Thus, androgen receptor activation imparts susceptibility to severe upper-tract UTI in both female and male murine hosts. Visualization of intratubular UPEC communities illuminates early renal abscess pathogenesis and the role of abscess formation in preventing dissemination of infection. Additionally, our study suggests that androgen modulation may represent a novel therapeutic route.

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^117AaJQi]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). High credibility.

Over 50% of female patients experience at least one episode of uncomplicated UTI during their lifetime, and 20–30% will have recurrences. Recurrent UTI (reUTI), defined as at least two infections within 6 months or at least three within a year, affects female individuals of all ages. However, older women are disproportionately affected, with the rate doubling after age 65.

Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, meaning antibiotic use for a condition when it is not recommended based on best practices, is a well-known contributor to multi-drug antibiotic resistance, adverse events, and gut dysbiosis, increasing the risk of future UTIs. According to practice guidelines, antibiotics for UTI should be prescribed to female patients with reUTI only when UTI-specific symptoms are present and urine culture demonstrates the presence of an organism with pathogenic potential.

This decision-making process is challenging in older female patients, who have a high rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria. In this condition, bacteria with pathogenic potential are present in urine culture in the absence of UTI-specific symptoms, a common scenario for which antibiotics are not recommended. The rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria, already high at 15–20% in older women, increases to 30% in those with reUTI.

Additional challenges that clinicians face when prescribing antibiotics to older female patients include differentiating symptoms of UTI from other common co-existing conditions such as overactive bladder and genitourinary syndrome of menopause, as well as pressure from patients.

### Urinary tract infection in male veterans: Treatment patterns and outcomes [^113HkUjC]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Lengthier antimicrobial therapy is associated with increased costs, antimicrobial resistance, and adverse drug events. Therefore, establishing minimum effective antimicrobial treatment durations is an important public health goal. The optimal treatment duration and treatment patterns for urinary tract infection (UTI) in men are unknown. We used Veterans Affairs administrative data to study male UTI treatment and outcomes.

- **Methods**: Male UTI episodes in the Veterans Affairs system (fiscal year 2009) were identified by combining International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes with UTI-relevant antimicrobial prescriptions. Episodes were categorized as index, early recurrence (within 7 days), and late recurrence. Of the index cases, 4.1% were followed by early recurrence, and 9.9% by late recurrence.

### Is female gender as harmful as bacteria? Analysis of hospital admissions for urinary tract infections in elderly patients [^117QpXUR]. Journal of Women's Health (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial diseases. We related the diagnosis of UTIs based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and in-hospital mortality (IHM) in a cohort of hospitalized elderly subjects.

- **Methods**: All patients admitted between 2000 and 2013 to the general hospital of Ferrara, in northeast Italy, with the ICD-9-CM code for UTIs were included. IHM was the main outcome, and age, sex, type of microorganism, sepsis, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) based on ICD-9-CM were also analyzed.

- **Results**: The total sample included 2,266 patients (1,670 women, 73.7%) with UTIs and identification of a cultural organism. The mean age was 81.7 ± 7.5 years (range, 65–103). One hundred and sixteen cases developed sepsis (5.1%, of whom 34.5% were male and 65.5% were female), and 84 had a fatal outcome (3.7%, of whom 45.2% were male and 54.8% were female). Non-survivors had a lower prevalence of IVUs due to Escherichia coli (53.6% vs. 71.7%, p < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of UTIs due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001). Moreover, non-survivors more frequently developed sepsis (31% vs. 4.1%, p < 0.001) and had higher CCI (2.81 ± 2.43 vs. 2.21 ± 2.04, p = 0.011). IHM was independently associated, in decreasing order of odds ratios (ORs), with sepsis (OR 10.3; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 6.113–17.460, p < 0.001), P. aeruginosa infection (OR 2.541; 95% CI 1.422–4.543, p = 0.002), female gender (OR 2.324; 95% CI 1.480–3.650, p < 0.001), CCI (OR 1.103; 95% CI 1.005–1.210, p = 0.038), and age (OR 1.034; 95% CI 1.002–1.066, p < 0.001).

### The epidemiology of urinary tract infection [^113KDEcE]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections acquired in the community and in hospitals. In individuals without anatomical or functional abnormalities, UTIs are generally self-limiting but have a propensity to recur. Uropathogens have specialized characteristics, such as the production of adhesins, siderophores, and toxins, that enable them to colonize and invade the urinary tract. They are transmitted between individuals both through person-to-person contact and possibly via food or water. Although generally self-limiting, treatment of UTIs with antibiotics leads to a more rapid resolution of symptoms and is more likely to clear bacteriuria. However, it also selects for resistant uropathogens and commensal bacteria and adversely affects the gut and vaginal microbiota. As uropathogens are increasingly becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, it may be time to explore alternative strategies for managing UTIs.

### Urine trouble: Should we think differently about UTI [^115iUiqd]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, as it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the understanding of UTI remains based on a now-disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. Therefore, standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce the opportunity to improve patient care.

- **Four major limitations**: Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified these limitations in the contemporary UTI description:
	1. The language of UTI
	2. UTI diagnostic testing
	3. The Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI
	4. The colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis

Contemporary methods and technology, combined with continued rigorous clinical research, can be used to correct these limitations.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^112m772W]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In this systematic review, we evaluated five randomized controlled trials (involving 1309 patients) comparing NSAIDs with antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Although study protocols and reported outcomes were heterogeneous, two smaller studies with high and unclear risk of bias found no difference between NSAIDs and antibiotics. In contrast, three studies with low risk of bias supported antibiotic therapy over NSAIDs in terms of symptom resolution. Furthermore, two studies at low risk of bias found higher risks of pyelonephritis in patients who received NSAIDs versus antibiotics. The third study with low risk of bias also found a higher risk of pyelonephritis in patients receiving NSAIDs, although the confidence interval for the risk difference included zero. In summary, these findings support the use of antibiotics as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTIs for both symptom resolution and the prevention of pyelonephritis.

Despite the superiority of antibiotic therapy, 39–58% of participants in the NSAID groups achieved symptom resolution by day 3 or 4. For comparison, a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials demonstrated clinical success (symptom improvement or resolution by the first follow-up visit) in 25–54% of participants in the placebo arms. One possible explanation for the resolution of many UTI symptoms without antibiotic therapy is that not all women included in the studies may have had true UTIs. Inclusion in most studies was based on symptoms alone — a commonly accepted approach for uncomplicated UTIs that is consistent with several clinical practice guidelines.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a commonly diagnosed infection in older adults. Despite consensus guidelines developed to assist providers in diagnosing UTI, distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older adults is problematic, as many older adults do not present with localized genitourinary symptoms. This article summarizes the recent literature and guidelines on the diagnosis and management of UTI and ASB in older adults.

### Innate immunity and genetic determinants of urinary tract infection susceptibility [^115noKkX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The susceptibility to infection varies greatly depending on the pathogen, exposure rate, and individual. Genetic predisposition is essential not just for rare monogenetic disorders, but for common infections such as urinary tract infection (UTI), where disease-associated genetic variants primarily control the expression of genes involved in antibacterial defense. Genetic determinants of UTI susceptibility work in concert with social and behavioral risk factors, structural or functional abnormalities, catheters, foreign bodies, or surgery, all of which modify the penetrance of susceptibility genes. As the vast majority of UTI-prone patients lack such risk factors, genetic predisposition is a major determinant of UTI morbidity.

UTI susceptibility runs in families, and UTI-prone individuals experience recurrent, often clustered infections with potentially severe complications, depending on the site of infection and type of UTI. In three-generation family pedigrees, an increased frequency of acute pyelonephritis (APN) was detected in both male and female family members of APN-prone children compared with children without UTI. There was no evidence of increased cystitis morbidity in those families, suggesting that different genetic mechanisms control APN and cystitis susceptibility. Several studies have associated personal and family histories of UTI with an increased risk of acute cystitis, and in one study, 42% of family members were cystitis-prone compared with 11% of controls. The risk increased with the number of affected individuals, especially if a s

### Phage therapy for urinary tract infections: Progress and challenges ahead [^113Sj4KX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common types of bacterial infection, affecting at least 150 million people annually worldwide based on epidemiological estimates from over two decades ago, with recent estimates as high as 400 million. Half of women will have at least one UTI during their lifetime, and of these, approximately 30% will develop recurrent UTIs (reUTIs), defined as symptomatic culture-proven UTI at least twice in 6 months or three times in a year. Recurrent UTIs are associated with the development of intracellular bacterial reservoirs, which may serve as the nidus for subsequent infections and reduce the efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Recurrent UTIs are also associated with repetitive and extended antibiotic use and pose significant therapeutic and public health issues due to alarming increases in antibiotic resistance.

Moreover, the development of new antibiotics has been unable to keep up with the concerning rise in antibiotic resistance, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic options. Vaccine trials for UTIs have had limited impact. Here, we review the putative role of bacteriophage (phage) therapy as a therapeutic for UTIs, highlight patient and microbiological factors that might impact successful treatment, and suggest reporting standards for future work to help advance the field.

### Androgens enhance male urinary tract infection severity in a new model [^115rk2k3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur predominantly in females but also affect substantial male patient populations; indeed, morbidity in complicated UTI is higher in males. Because of technical obstacles, preclinical modeling of UTI in male mice has been limited. We devised a minimally invasive surgical bladder inoculation technique that yields reproducible upper and lower UTI in both male and female mice, enabling studies of sex differences in these infections.

Acute uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) cystitis in C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN males recapitulated the intracellular bacterial community pathway previously shown in females. However, surgically infected females of these strains exhibited more robust bladder cytokine responses and more efficient UPEC control than males. Compared with females, C3H/HeN males displayed a striking predilection for chronic cystitis, manifesting as persistent bacteriuria, high-titer bladder bacterial burdens, and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, males developed more severe pyelonephritis and 100% penetrant renal abscess (a complication that is rare in female mice).

These phenotypes were sharply abrogated after castration but restored with exogenous testosterone, suggesting that male susceptibility to UTI is strongly influenced by androgen exposure. These data substantiate the long-standing presumption that anatomic differences in urogenital anatomy confer protection from UTI in males; however, as clinically observed, male sex associated with more severe UTI once these traditional anatomic barriers were bypassed.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: A pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^113BEzPi]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least a 2-point improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without additional antimicrobial therapy for relapse of UTI.

	- Secondary outcome measures included bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and the rate of UTI relapses.

	- Outcome measures were also analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups such as men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, and patients with bacteremic UTI. Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria (pathogen growth < 10⁴ CFU/mL in women or < 10³ CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture combined with disappearance of leucocyturia).
