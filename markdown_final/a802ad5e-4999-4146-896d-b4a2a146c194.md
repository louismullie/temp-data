## Question

A fib as a cause of heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether atrial fibrillation (AF) can cause heart failure (HF), and if so, how it does so and what the clinical implications are for diagnosis and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the bidirectional relationship between AF and HF and whether causality is supported. Then, I should verify the specific hemodynamic and structural mechanisms by which AF leads to HF. Next, I will examine the evidence for AF-mediated cardiomyopathy and its reversibility. After that, I should review epidemiologic data quantifying risk. Then, I will consider how AF contributes differently in HFrEF versus HFpEF. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical implications for screening, rhythm-control strategies, and guideline-directed therapy, making sure I double-check where the evidence is strongest and where it remains uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the nature of the relationship. AF and HF are tightly interlinked in a bidirectional fashion: HF predisposes to AF via atrial stretch, fibrosis, and neurohormonal activation, while AF can precipitate or worsen HF through hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects, creating a vicious cycle that accelerates disease progression and worsens outcomes [^112syKAb] [^113tVgio] [^112noXtk].

> Now, I need to check the causal mechanisms by which AF leads to HF. Mechanistically, AF causes loss of coordinated atrial contraction, which can reduce cardiac output by about 20–25% in susceptible patients, particularly those with diastolic dysfunction; rapid and irregular ventricular rates increase myocardial oxygen consumption, impair relaxation, and can induce a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy that is at least partially reversible with rhythm control, which is a classic example of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy [^112noXtk] [^112HrcEN] [^115Sq8GM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the evidence that AF can be the primary driver of HF in some patients. AF-mediated cardiomyopathy is a recognized entity characterized by LV dysfunction attributable to AF, with recovery of EF after restoration of sinus rhythm; early identification matters because prolonged AF can lead to irreversible remodeling, so timing of rhythm restoration is critical to maximize reversibility and outcomes [^112HrcEN] [^115Sq8GM] [^112syKAb].

> Next, I should review the epidemiologic signal for causality. AF is associated with a roughly threefold increased risk of incident HF in population studies, and among patients with new HF, more than half have concurrent AF; importantly, new-onset AF in established HF predicts markedly higher mortality and a several-fold increase in HF hospitalization burden, supporting a causal contribution in at least a subset of patients [^112NsZPL] [^113KGZph] [^111EXjXC].

> I will now examine how AF's contribution differs by HF phenotype. In HFrEF, catheter ablation reduces mortality and HF hospitalizations compared with medical therapy in randomized trials, reinforcing that AF can be a modifiable driver of adverse outcomes; in HFpEF, AF is highly prevalent and associated with worse prognosis, but definitive mortality benefit from rhythm control remains unproven pending larger trials, though symptom and functional gains are plausible and under active investigation [^115PPifp] [^111xDEHu] [^112G4eXZ] [^115nzBj7].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical implications for practice. Guidelines advise that in patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF and AF, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected and an early, aggressive rhythm-control approach considered; catheter ablation receives a Class 1 recommendation in appropriate HFrEF patients on GDMT, while in HFpEF, ablation is reasonable for symptom relief and may improve quality of life even as outcome trials proceed; throughout, anticoagulation per CHA2DS2-VASc remains essential, and structured surveillance for AF recurrence is advised after recovery of LV function to detect relapse of AF-mediated cardiomyopathy [^1167s4XL] [^114aCMsK] [^1145nHv8] [^111jDks6] [^115TDppn].

> But wait, what if the LV dysfunction is not purely AF-driven? I should double-check that we exclude ischemia and other cardiomyopathies before attributing causality to AF, because misclassification delays appropriate rhythm-control therapy; in parallel, comprehensive HF therapy should be optimized, as GDMT for HFrEF may mitigate AF and improve outcomes, and emerging data suggest upstream risk-factor modification and early rhythm control can reduce AF progression and HF events, though patient selection and timing are key [^116iz3DN] [^112mKRzj] [^111CcUbX] [^113BCoVW].

> In summary, yes — AF can cause HF, particularly via tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and atrial systolic loss, and this is supported by mechanistic, epidemiologic, and interventional evidence; recognizing AF-mediated cardiomyopathy and intervening early with rhythm control, especially catheter ablation in appropriate HFrEF patients, can reverse ventricular dysfunction and improve survival, while in HFpEF the causal link is strong but mortality benefit remains to be proven, warranting individualized decisions and ongoing trials [^112syKAb] [^115PPifp] [^112G4eXZ] [^115nzBj7].

Atrial fibrillation (AF) can cause heart failure (HF) through **loss of atrial systole** and **tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy**, which reduce cardiac output and promote ventricular remodeling [^112noXtk] [^112HrcEN]. AF increases HF risk threefold and worsens prognosis, especially in HFpEF [^112NsZPL] [^116y6LvV]. Early rhythm control — particularly catheter ablation — improves symptoms, ventricular function, and outcomes in HFrEF, and is increasingly considered in HFpEF [^115PPifp] [^112G4eXZ] [^112syKAb]. Management should include anticoagulation, rate control, and guideline-directed HF therapy, with rhythm control prioritized when AF is suspected to drive HF [^115TDppn] [^1145nHv8].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking AF to HF

AF promotes HF through **interconnected mechanisms**:

- **Loss of atrial systole**: AF abolishes atrial contraction, reducing preload and cardiac output by ~25%, especially in diastolic dysfunction [^112noXtk].

- **Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy**: Persistent rapid AF can cause reversible LV dysfunction via energy depletion, calcium overload, and neurohormonal activation [^112HrcEN] [^115Sq8GM].

- **Neurohormonal activation**: AF activates RAAS and SNS, increasing afterload, preload, and promoting ventricular remodeling [^112noXtk].

- **Irregular ventricular rhythm**: Irregularity further impairs cardiac output and promotes remodeling [^117WkTUa].

---

## Epidemiological evidence

AF and HF frequently coexist, and AF is a **strong independent risk factor** for HF:

- **Prevalence**: AF is present in ~20–30% of HF patients, higher in HFpEF than HFrEF [^113KGZph].

- **Incidence**: AF increases incident HF risk threefold [^112NsZPL].

- **Prognosis**: AF worsens outcomes, increasing mortality, hospitalizations, and stroke risk [^113KGZph] [^116y6LvV].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting causality

Multiple lines of evidence support a **causal role** of AF in HF:

- **Reversibility**: Restoring sinus rhythm improves LV function and symptoms, consistent with causality [^112HrcEN] [^115Sq8GM].

- **Randomized trials**: CASTLE-AF showed ablation reduced death/HF hospitalization vs medical therapy in HFrEF [^115PPifp].

- **Early rhythm control**: EAST-AFNET 4 showed early rhythm control reduced cardiovascular events, including HF [^113wtmtb] [^1172tMhD].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing AF as a cause of HF has **important management implications**:

- **Anticoagulation**: Essential for stroke prevention in AF with HF [^115TDppn].

- **Rate control**: Beta-blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone are options; avoid nondihydropyridine CCBs in HFrEF [^1145nHv8].

- **Rhythm control**: Consider early rhythm control, especially catheter ablation, in HFrEF and selected HFpEF [^112syKAb] [^1145nHv8].

- **Guideline-directed HF therapy**: ACEi/ARB/ARNI, beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors are indicated in HFrEF with AF [^112jsfRP].

---

## Special considerations in HFpEF

AF is especially prevalent in HFpEF and contributes to symptoms and outcomes; however, evidence for rhythm-control benefit is **limited** and ongoing trials (e.g. CABA-HFpEF) may clarify the role of ablation [^112rGbJG] [^115nzBj7].

---

AF can cause HF through loss of atrial systole, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, and neurohormonal activation; **early rhythm control** — particularly catheter ablation in HFrEF — improves outcomes, while HFpEF evidence is evolving [^112syKAb] [^112G4eXZ].

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) were predicted to become epidemics of the 21st century, in part due to increased longevity and the success in reducing overall cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Both conditions are increasingly prevalent, with spiralling cost to healthcare services globally. – The incidence of AF is also predicted to double over the next 20 years, with expectations of 120–215 000 new cases per year by 2030 in Europe alone. Rates of HF in a global AF registry were 33% in paroxysmal, 44% in persistent and 56% in permanent AF. Thus, the combination of these two conditions will have a dramatic impact on healthcare and require a refocusing of CV care.

The pathophysiology and risk factors for HF and AF are closely aligned, and affected patients are usually elderly with a significant burden of comorbidity. Atrial fibrillation is both a cause and consequence of HF, with complex interactions leading to impairment of systolic and diastolic function not present in sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation is associated with a three-fold increased risk of incident HF. Vice versa, the structural and neurohormonal changes in HF make the development and progression of AF much more likely, both in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Regardless of which comes first, patients with concomitant HF and AF have significantly worse prognosis. Given the poor outcomes associated with HF and AF, finding effective therapies for these patients is of paramount importance but also challenging — treatments shown to be effective in one or other of these conditions alone have also been observed to have efficacy or safety concerns in patients with HF and AF combined. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms and inter-relationship of HF and AF, and provide a state-of-the-art synopsis on optimal management, considering how best to combine therapies and the evidence-base supporting their use.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is common, responsible for over half of prevalent HF, yet no therapies have yet been shown to reduce mortality or morbidity. Atrial fibrillation and HFpEF are closely linked, with similar risks and mechanisms as discussed above. Current management is no different to that in sinus rhythm; diuretics to reduce signs and symptoms of fluid overload, and optimisation of hypertension and other comorbidities. Whether MRA have a specific role in improving exercise capacity and diastolic function by reducing fibrosis is currently under investigation. The risk of stroke in AF with HFpEF is similar to HFrEF, and therefore all suitable patients require anticoagulation.

### Heart Failure and atrial fibrillation, like Fire and Fury [^115zkLsh]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart failure and atrial fibrillation are 2 common cardiovascular disorders that frequently complicate one another and exert a significant detrimental effect on cardiovascular health and well-being. Both heart failure and atrial fibrillation continue to increase in prevalence as the risk factors underlying each condition become more common. This review encompasses what is currently known about the epidemiology and pathophysiology of these comorbidities along with incorporation of landmark trials that have contributed to current guidelines. The focus is on clinically relevant considerations, including the contribution of inflammation in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation and heart failure. We explore the emerging role of catheter ablation relative to medical therapy in the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, along with indications for biventricular pacing modalities in cardiac resynchronization therapy. We discuss current guideline-directed therapies and how practice models and national recommendations will likely change based on the most recent randomized controlled trials.

### Comorbidity of atrial fibrillation and heart failure [^116vUrd7]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) are evolving epidemics, together responsible for substantial human suffering and health-care expenditure. Ageing, improved cardiovascular survival, and epidemiological transition form the basis for their increasing global prevalence. Although we now have a clear picture of how HF promotes AF, gaps remain in our knowledge of how AF exacerbates or even causes HF, and how the development of HF affects the outcome of patients with AF. New data regarding HF with preserved ejection fraction and its unique relationship with AF suggest a possible role for AF in its aetiology, possibly as a trigger for ventricular fibrosis. Deciding on optimal treatment strategies for patients with both AF and HF is increasingly difficult, given that results from trials of pharmacological rhythm control are arguably obsolete in the age of catheter ablation. Restoring sinus rhythm by catheter ablation seems successful in the medium term and improves HF symptoms, functional capacity, and left ventricular function. Long-term studies to examine the effect on rates of stroke and death are ongoing. Guidelines continue to evolve to keep pace with this rapidly changing field.

### Atrial fibrillation and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: new insights and unresolved questions [^112tyA2t]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) frequently occur together as a result of shared functional, structural, and electrical remodeling, thereby worsening the prognosis and quality of life of affected patients. Despite substantial advances in elucidating the complex interplay between AF and HFrEF, numerous critical questions remain unanswered, underscoring the need for continued investigation to address the persistent uncertainties surrounding this challenging comorbidity. The development and wide application of catheter ablation for rhythm control has highlighted the importance of controlling AF in patients with HFrEF, along with the benefits of rhythm control in this population. Whereas early rhythm control appears to be important, many questions remain unanswered about optimal timing parameters, benefits of specific energy sources and lesion sets, and the role of ancillary pharmacologic therapy. Personalized management is essential for optimized care of patients with AF and HFrEF, but extensive additional research is required to enable the individualized care needed. In this narrative review, we aim to analyze the rapidly evolving evidence regarding the interrelationships between these common conditions, discuss the underlying basic mechanisms, review evidence regarding treatment options, and highlight gaps in knowledge.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: a comprehensive review [^111DQdpL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation are 2 major disorders that are closely linked. Their coexistence is associated with adverse prognosis. Both share several common predisposing conditions, but their interaction involves complex ultrastructural, electrophysiologic, and neurohormonal processes that go beyond mere sharing of mutual risk factors. Rate control approach remains the standard therapy for atrial fibrillation in heart failure because current strategies at rhythm control have so far failed to positively impact mortality and morbidity. This is largely because of the shortcomings of current pharmacologic anti-arrhythmic agents. Surgical and catheter-based therapies are promising, but long-term data are lacking. The role of non-anti-arrhythmic therapeutic agents also is being explored. Further progress toward improved understanding the complex relationship between atrial fibrillation and heart failure should improve management strategies.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^116ZA3Mo]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are two conditions that are likely to dominate the next 50 years of cardiovascular (CV) care. Both are increasingly prevalent and associated with high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. They are closely inter-related with similar risk factors and shared pathophysiology. Patients with concomitant HF and AF suffer from even worse symptoms and poorer prognosis, yet evidence-based evaluation and management of this group of patients is lacking. In this review, we evaluate the common mechanisms for the development of AF in HF patients and vice versa, focusing on the evidence for potential treatment strategies. Recent data have suggested that these patients may respond differently than those with HF or AF alone. These results highlight the clear clinical need to identify and treat according to best evidence, in order to prevent adverse outcomes and reduce the huge burden that HF and AF are expected to have on global healthcare systems in the future. We propose an easy-to-use clinical mnemonic to aid the initial management of newly discovered concomitant HF and AF, the CAN-TREAT HFrEF + AF algorithm (Cardioversion if compromised; Anticoagulation unless contraindication; Normalize fluid balance; Target initial heart rate < 110 b.p.m.; Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone modification; Early consideration of rhythm control; Advanced HF therapies; Treatment of other CV disease).

### Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation – A key role in heart failure therapy? [^115hDfpE]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) are epidemic cardiac diseases and are often detected in the same patient. Recent evidence suggests that this is not a mere coincidence but that the strategy of AF treatment may impact HF development. This review comprehensively summarizes current trial data on rhythm and rate control strategies in atrial fibrillation with a special focus on catheter ablation of AF in HF patients. For a long time, rate and rhythm control strategies for AF have been regarded as equal regarding long term mortality. Decision making has been based on the symptoms of patients. Current trials, however, show that the treatment strategy of AF and its effectiveness may significantly impact survival of HF patients. The benefits of rhythm control in HF patients may have been masked by side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. If rhythm control, however, is achieved by catheter ablation, a reduction of HF related mortality can be observed. As catheter ablation of AF may reduce mortality in HF patients, AF ablation should be preferred over medical treatment in HF patients. In general, HF patients may profit most from rigorous AF treatment.

### Atrial fibrillation and heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction: new assessment of an old problem [^116t7Gom]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF)-specifically, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)-often coexist, and each contributes to the propagation of the other. This relationship extends from the mechanistic and physiological to clinical syndromes, quality of life, and long-term cardiovascular outcomes. The risk factors for AF and HF overlap and create a critical opportunity to prevent adverse outcomes among patients at greatest risk for either condition. Increasing recognition of the linkages between AF and HF have led to widespread interest in designing diagnostic, predictive, and interventional strategies targeting all aspects of disease, from identifying genetic predisposition to addressing social determinants of health. Advances across this spectrum culminated in updated multisociety guidelines for management of AF, which includes specific consideration of comorbid AF and HF. This review expands on these guidelines by further highlighting relevant clinical trial findings and providing additional context for the evolving recommendations for management in this important and growing population.

Future directions

Given the limited treatment options for patients with HF and AF, there is a clear unmet need in this important patient population. Future investigation is particularly required for rate control, optimal methods of rhythm control, and prevention. There is also a need to stratify the use of various treatments to improve efficacy and safety, and a number of studies are addressing whether genetic profiling can help to personalize our therapeutic approach.

Despite advances in many areas of AF, it seems that the evidence to guide best practices for rate control is more uncertain than ever. Adequately powered prospective clinical trials are needed to clarify optimal rate-control targets and the best pharmacologic treatments to achieve rate control in patients with HF and AF. While ablation represents a promising alternative to AAD, clinicians require more information on the balance between effectiveness, complications, and potential prognostic benefits. Finally, given the poor outcomes observed in patients with HF and AF, perhaps the best treatment strategy is to prevent AF from occurring in the first place. Clinical trials of interventions targeted at left atrial substrate and preventing disease progression may have an important role in this regard. Table 3 presents some of the main studies currently recruiting that will assess patients with HF and AF. It is clear that the combination of these two common CV conditions will continue to challenge physicians both in CV and general medicine for many years to come.

Mechanisms and pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation in heart failure

Heart failure and AF share risk factors and common pathophysiologic processes (see Figure 1). Hypertension, smoking, obesity, diabetes, renal impairment, sleep apnoea, and coronary artery disease are all associated with an increased risk of developing both HF and AF. In HF, neurohormonal imbalance and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) leads to maladaptive physiological changes including increased filling pressures and afterload. These can lead to increased left atrial stretch and fibrosis, contributing to the development of conduction abnormalities and facilitating the initiation and maintenance of AF. – The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system also directly contributes to proarrhythmic remodelling, with angiotensin II causing atrial fibrosis and anisotropic conduction. Patients with HF also demonstrate altered calcium handling and calcium overload, which can lead to after-depolarizations and arrhythmia.

Figure 1
Shared and synergistic mechanisms in heart failure and atrial fibrillation. There is a cycle of interdependence between heart failure and atrial fibrillation and each makes the other more likely to occur. RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

Atrial fibrillation can promote the development of HF by a number of established mechanisms. Loss of atrial systole in AF impairs LV filling and can decrease cardiac output by up to 25%, particularly in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Irregular and/or rapid ventricular conduction in AF can lead to LV dysfunction and in some patients, a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Restoration of sinus rhythm increases stroke volume and LV emptying even before contractility improves, explaining why some patients with HF gain rapid haemodynamic improvement with cardioversion.

### Managing atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115VG6jA]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are increasing in prevalence worldwide. Atrial fibrillation can precipitate and can be a consequence of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and cardiomyopathy. Atrial fibrillation and heart failure, when present together, are associated with worse outcomes. Together, these 2 conditions increase the risk of stroke, requiring oral anticoagulation in many or left atrial appendage closure in some. Medical management for rate and rhythm control of atrial fibrillation in heart failure remain hampered by variable success, intolerance, and adverse effects. In multiple randomized clinical trials in recent years, catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction has shown superiority in improving survival, quality of life, and ventricular function and reducing heart failure hospitalizations compared with antiarrhythmic drugs and rate control therapies. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in management toward nonpharmacological rhythm control of atrial fibrillation in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The primary objective of this American Heart Association scientific statement is to review the available evidence on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation in relation to heart failure and to provide guidance on the latest advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. The writing committee's consensus on the implications for clinical practice, gaps in knowledge, and directions for future research are highlighted.

1 PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is by far the most common sustained arrhythmia and one of the most challenging ones to treat. By the year 2030, there will be an estimated 14‐17 million patients with AF in the European Union. 1 It is a worldwide leading cause of hospitalizations and cardiovascular death accounting for 35% of all arrhythmia‐related hospital admissions. 2 Without appropriate therapy, patients are confronted with a 1.5‐1.9‐fold increased risk for death as well as a 5‐fold increased risk for stroke and thromboembolic events. 3, 4

As AF is a heterogeneous and multifactorial rhythm disorder, different clinical presentations from self‐limiting paroxysmal AF to permanent AF are observed. Up to date, the mechanisms of sustained AF and the nature of arrhythmogenic substrates are still a matter of debate and inter‐individual differences between patients most likely account for inconsistencies. 5

Importantly, recent longitudinal data from the Framingham Heart Study 6 highlighted the fact that the risk factor burden and the existence of multiple morbidities have a crucial role in the lifetime risk of atrial fibrillation. Participants with at least one elevated risk factor were confronted with a lifetime AF risk as high as 37.8%. 6 Of note, diabetes mellitus seems to be a major factor for the development of AF. Patients with diabetes mellitus were shown to have a lifetime risk of AF of approximately 40%. 7 This could be explained by the strong relationship between autonomic dysfunction in diabetic patients and AF. 8 In line with this, diabetes has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of stroke, even in younger patients. 9 Other less well‐studied risk factors, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are also linked to AF, 10 which is probably driven by systemic inflammation. 11

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation: recent advances and open questions [^112rGbJG]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) are frequently associated and can be caused or exacerbated by each other through different mechanisms including cardiac remodelling and rate-related left ventricular incompetency. AF is particularly common in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, defined as left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≥ 50%), with a prevalence ranging around 40–60%. AF and HFpEF may manifest with similar symptoms, and diagnostic uncertainties may exist for the diagnosis of HFpEF due to their interrelations influencing test results for echocardiography and natriuretic peptides. HF patients with AF have a poorer prognosis than those with sinus rhythm and, importantly, the higher risk brought by AF is generally higher in patients with HFpEF than in those with HF and a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF defined as LVEF ≤ 40%). This commentary discusses some recent advances in the understanding for the natural history of patients with HFpEF associated with AF and for the several different aspects of their medical management.

### Pathophysiology of concomitant atrial fibrillation and heart failure: implications for management [^117WkTUa]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) are two conditions regularly encountered in clinical practice. They share many common risk factors, and are often seen concurrently in an individual patient. Global aging of the population is likely to lead to an increase in the prevalence of both AF and HF alone, as well as in their combined state. The relationship between these two diseases is not simply coincidental; clinical and experimental data have defined multiple pathophysiological mechanisms to explain how either condition contributes to the de novo development of the other. The development of AF in the setting of HF, and vice versa, is associated with clinical deterioration and worsening prognosis, which indicates the need for an improved understanding of the clinical and pathological relationships between these conditions. Future research on pharmacologic therapies, such as antiarrhythmic medications, and nonpharmacologic strategies including atrioventricular nodal ablation and pulmonary vein isolation, will help to define the optimal therapeutic approach for concurrent AF and HF. This step is vital to improve both the outcomes of patients affected by these conditions and the cost-effectiveness of their care.

### Atrial failure as a clinical entity: JACC review topic of the week [^112Wf5fy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial dysfunction has been widely considered a marker or consequence of other cardiac conditions rather than the cause itself. Here, we propose the term atrial failure as a clinically relevant entity, defined as any atrial dysfunction causing impaired heart performance, symptoms, and worsening quality of life or life expectancy. Aspects of the etiology, mechanisms, and consequences of atrial failure are discussed. Recent advances in cardiac electrophysiology and imaging have improved our understanding of the highly complex atrial anatomy and function, underlying the paramount importance of the atria in optimal heart performance. It is time to reappraise the concept of the failing atrium as a primary cause or aggravating factor of the symptoms in many of our patients. The concept of atrial failure may foster basic and translational research to gain a better understanding of how to identify and manage atrial dysfunction.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: epidemiology, pathophysiology, and rationale for therapy [^111vs3xh]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) affects almost 5 million patients in the United States and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Atrial fibrillation (AF), like HF, affects millions of patients and markedly increases in prevalence with age. As the US population ages, the number of patients afflicted with HF and AF will continue to grow. HF with preserved ejection fraction is particularly common in the elderly population. The prevalence of AF in patients with HF increases from < 10% in those with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I HF to approximately 50% in those with NYHA functional class IV HF. The pathophysiologic changes that occur in patients with HF and AF are complex and incompletely understood. Alterations in neurohormonal activation, electrophysiologic parameters, and mechanical factors conspire to create an environment in which HF predisposes to AF and AF exacerbates HF. Mechanisms include atrial remodeling and tachycardia-induced myopathy. The development of AF in HF appears to independently predict death resulting from pump failure and total mortality. Although the currently available therapeutic options for AF in patients with HF are varied, their effect on prognosis remains unknown and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials. It will be critical to define and plan therapies specifically for those patients with AF, HF, and preserved ejection fraction in addition to the population with low ejection fraction that has dominated previous investigations.

### Advancing research on the complex interrelations between atrial fibrillation and heart failure: a report from a US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute virtual workshop [^116xuJ4z]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The interrelationships between atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) are complex and poorly understood, yet the number of patients with AF and HF continues to increase worldwide. Thus, there is a need for initiatives that prioritize research on the intersection between AF and HF. This article summarizes the proceedings of a virtual workshop convened by the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to identify important research opportunities in AF and HF. Key knowledge gaps were reviewed and research priorities were proposed for characterizing the pathophysiological overlap and deleterious interactions between AF and HF; preventing HF in people with AF; preventing AF in individuals with HF; and addressing symptom burden and health status outcomes in AF and HF. These research priorities will hopefully help inform, encourage, and stimulate innovative, cost-efficient, and transformative studies to enhance the outcomes of patients with AF and HF.

### Atrial fibrillation-mediated cardiomyopathy [^112HrcEN]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

AF-mediated cardiomyopathy (AMC) is an important reversible cause of heart failure that is likely underdiagnosed in today's clinical practice. AMC describes AF either as the sole cause for ventricular dysfunction or exacerbating ventricular dysfunction in patients with existing cardiomyopathy or heart failure. Studies suggest that irreversible ventricular and atrial remodeling can occur in AMC, making timely diagnosis and intervention critical to optimize clinical outcome. Clinical correlation between AF onset/burden and progression of cardiomyopathy/heart failure symptoms provides strong evidence for the diagnosis of AMC. Cardiac MRI, continuous cardiac monitoring, and biomarkers are important diagnostic tools. From the therapeutic standpoint, early data suggest that AF ablation may improve long-term outcomes in AMC patients compared with medical rate and rhythm control. Patients with more AF burden and less severe underlying structural heart disease are more likely to experience left ventricle function recovery with successful AF ablation. Despite recent advances, significant knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the epidemiology, mechanisms, diagnosis, management strategies, and prognosis of AMC.

### The role of atrial fibrillation catheter ablation in patients with heart failure [^11475iaq]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) frequently coexist, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic options for patients with AF and HFrEF are limited due to few antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) choices and historically equivocal effects of procedural interventions on mortality. However, recent randomized trials examining catheter ablation (CA) in AF patients with HFrEF have shown a beneficial effect on arrhythmic burden and HF symptoms, as well as an improvement in mortality. This review focuses on the role of CA for AF patients with HFrEF.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Currently available data, particularly the CASTLE‐AF trial, clearly suggest that it seems appropriate to advise HF patients with AF to undergo catheter ablation treatment. It can be safely performed and is highly efficient as rhythm control strategy for HF patients with AF. Most importantly, catheter ablation has proven beneficial influences on LV function and overall mortality compared to drug therapy.

Future studies like the RAFT‐AF study (Randomized Ablation Based Atrial Fibrillation Rhythm Control vs Rate Control Trial in Patients with Heart Failure and High Burden Atrial Fibrillation, 2011‐2020) will certainly further expand our knowledge about AF ablation in HF patients with the aim of further improving clinical practice.

Rate vs. rhythm control of atrial fibrillation

Although sub-group data suggest that sinus rhythm is associated with improved outcomes in patients with AF (including all-cause survival), clinical trials have failed to demonstrate superiority of either a rate or rhythm-control strategy. For example in the AF-CHF trial, there was no difference in CV death when comparing a rate vs. rhythm-control strategy in patients with HFrEF and NYHA classes II–IV (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.86–1.30, P = 0.59), with similar findings for all-cause mortality and worsening HF. There are several reasons that rhythm control has failed to improve survival in clinical trials, including limited efficacy and adverse effects of available treatments, or delayed intervention such that the cumulative effects of AF are already unable to be reversed. Sinus rhythm can be difficult to achieve and maintain, particularly in patients with HF. In the rhythm control arm of AF-CHF, 21% crossed over to rate control, 82% were taking amiodarone, 27% were in AF at 4-year follow-up, and 58% had at least one episode of AF during the trial. On the other hand, in studies of catheter ablation of AF, restoration of sinus rhythm is associated with significant improvement in left ventricular function (11% increase in LVEF on average). While there are no clear differences in CV outcomes, patients with AF and HF who spend a higher proportion of time in sinus rhythm suffer less severe functional impairment (NYHA class III symptoms in 27 vs. 35%, P < 0.0001). Based on these and other data, current guidelines reserve rhythm-control therapy for those patients who experience AF-related symptoms or worsening HF despite adequate rate control.

Specific rate-control therapies

The three available therapies for rate control of AF in the context of HFrEF are discussed below and summarized in Table 1.

It is important for the reader to appreciate that the relatively short existence of current AF and HF stages limits their easy transference to the large body of science that exists about therapeutic strategies for the management of coexisting AF and HF. Suffice it to say that most of the current knowledge on treatment strategies is obtained in the symptomatic stages of both conditions.

### Atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure: should we aim to control the heart's rate or its rhythm? [^116EN5DD]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

The Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure trial, which was conducted in patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, demonstrates that prognosis is independent of whether treatment is targeted towards controlling the heart's rate or its rhythm. The study also showed that other factors, such as use of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, oral anticoagulants, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, can have a major influence on prognosis. Antiarrhythmic drugs (primarily amiodarone) were well tolerated, and adequate rate control was achieved with adjusted doses of beta-blockers combined with digoxin. Future studies should focus on the clinical importance of radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation, versus that of traditional approaches to treatment.

Synopsis — atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart failure (HF) is described as the most common cause of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, and persistent AF can lead to left ventricular dysfunction and HF that may be partially or completely reversed with adequate arrhythmia control; routine pharmacological rhythm compared with rate control has not demonstrated benefit on clinical outcomes in patients with HFrEF, although a recent subgroup analysis of patients with HF (most heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) demonstrated benefit of early rhythm control compared to rate control on clinical outcomes; several trials have compared AF catheter ablation with medical therapy in patients with HFrEF, and although earlier trials were small and focused on endpoints such as improvement in LVEF, QOL, and 6-minute walk, 2 of the largest trials have shown a benefit in reducing mortality rate and HF hospitalization; patients with AF and HF may undergo atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) for rate control refractory to medical therapy, and patients with HF appear more likely to develop or worsen cardiomyopathy related to right ventricular pacing dyssynchrony and have improved outcomes with biventricular or conduction system pacing.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — persistent AF may worsen myocardial function, and early rhythm control may improve outcomes: it can be difficult to determine the extent of the contribution of AF to cardiomyopathy and even onset HFrEF; allowing AF to persist long term, regardless of reasonable rate control, may result in worsening HF and cardiomyopathy; an early and aggressive approach to rhythm control can reduce AF burden, resulting in favorable ventricular remodeling and halting of any occult arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy; in a prespecified analysis, early rhythm control significantly improved the composite outcome of death, stroke, or hospitalization for worsening of HF or ACS, and this was not altered by HF status; however, only 17% of the HF population had LVEF < 40%.

General considerations for atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) — prevalence and mortality associations indicate that the prevalence of AF is higher in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction compared with HFrEF; in the Framingham cohort, among individuals with new AF, more than one‑third (37%) had HF, and conversely among individuals with new HF, more than half (57%) had AF. A meta‑analysis including 539 969 patients from 9 observational and 7 randomized trials found AF associated with increased total mortality irrespective of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with an OR of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.32‑1.48) in randomized trials and an OR of 1.14 (95% CI, 1.03‑1.26) in observational studies. The risk of mortality is higher when AF is incident after a diagnosis of HF as compared with prevalent AF, and in patients with HFrEF compared with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

8 Role and Impact of Rhythm Control in HFpEF

The AFFIRM trial showed no impact on mortality with a rhythm control strategy over rate control. However, there was no HF endpoint in the primary outcome. An important post hoc analysis of the AFFIRM trial examined HF emergence (defined as 2 HF class change) in subjects enrolled in the trial who had no history of HF or HF at baseline enrollment and normal baseline LVEF. There was no difference in cardiac or all‐cause mortality with rate or rhythm control strategies (Figure 10A). However, individuals randomized to a rhythm control strategy had 32% relative risk reduction in the composite of HF emergence and CV death compared to rate control (Figure 10B). This was driven largely by a 30% risk reduction in HF emergence, which had important prognostic implications for future CV hospitalization or death. As seen in Figure 10C, the risk for CV hospitalization for change in 2 HF classes was tripled and for CV death was more than quadrupled. This seriously adversely impacted all‐cause death.

Of note, the Castle AF study emphasized the role of continuous rhythm monitoring for quantifying AF burden and predicting cardiac events. In line with this, a reduction of AF events, strokes, and hospitalization by remote monitoring in heart failure patients was demonstrated in the TELECART Study. 45

Convincingly, a currently published meta‐analysis (2018) of RCTs on atrial fibrillation ablation in patients with HFrEF 41 analyzed six current RCTs (including AATAC, CASTLE‐AF, and CAMERA‐MRI) and showed that ablation in a selected population significantly improved LVEF, QoL and functional capacity (6MWD). The benefit of ablation (reduction of HF related hospitalizations and overall mortality) was attributed to a reduction of AF burden. The complication rate of catheter ablation was similar to the population with normal heart function. 41

### What can rhythm control therapy contribute to prognosis in atrial fibrillation? [^113mQTUh]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a global healthcare problem of growing prevalence and major significance. The consequences of AF include an increased rate of death, stroke and heart failure. Theoretically, a therapeutic strategy aiming at restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm should offset the prognosis impairment associated with AF. However, these expectations were disproven in large randomised controlled trials comparing conventional antiarrhythmic drugs for rhythm control with conventional rate control. These apparently contradictory findings suggest that rhythm control strategies require better therapeutic instruments. These improvements may involve drugs and/or interventions with optimised risk-benefit profile and which also appreciate the specific atrial pathology and the patient's comorbidities. This article addresses important aspects of rhythm control strategies, which may have the potential of a beneficial contribution to the prognosis of AF patients.

### New-onset atrial fibrillation predicts heart failure progression [^111EXjXC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation and heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction have interrelated pathophysiologies. New-onset atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients has been associated with increased mortality, but has not been definitively related to clinical heart failure progression.

Methods

To test the hypothesis that new-onset atrial fibrillation is related to clinical heart failure progression, in 2392 patients without atrial fibrillation at randomization in the Beta-blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial we measured clinical endpoints in patients who did (Group 1, n = 190) or did not (Group 2, n = 2202) develop new-onset atrial fibrillation. Results were also compared with the 303 patients who entered the trial in atrial fibrillation (Baseline/chronic group), and in Group 1/2 patients we conducted a multivariate analysis of covariates potentially related to time to first heart failure hospitalization.

Results

Compared with Group 2, Group 1 patients post atrial fibrillation onset had a ∼2-fold increase in mortality (P < .0001) and a ∼4.5-fold increase in all-cause or heart failure hospitalization days/patient (hospitalization burden, both P < .0001). In Group 1, both types of hospitalization burden were 2.9-fold greater than in the Baseline/chronic group (P < .001), and hospitalization burden increased ∼6-fold (P < .0001) compared with the pre-event period. On multivariate analysis, new-onset atrial fibrillation was a highly significant (P < .00001) predictor of heart failure hospitalization.

Conclusions

In addition to being a discrete electrophysiologic event, in heart failure patients, new-onset atrial fibrillation is a predictor of and trigger for clinical heart failure progression.

### European journal of heart failure consensus statement. heart failure pharmacotherapy for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and concomitant atrial fibrillation: review of evidence and call to action [^112jsfRP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are major global health challenges with rising prevalence and significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden. Despite advances in HF management, AF remains a critical comorbidity that worsens outcomes and requires ad hoc treatment strategies, increasing the risk of non-adherence and side effects. While rhythm control strategies in AF have gained attention for their prognostic benefits in HF, the pharmacological treatment of HF in patients with AF, including the benefit of rhythm versus rate control, remains underexplored. The relationship between HF and AF lacks sufficient evidence and targeted research to assess the optimal treatment strategies. This narrative review critically examines current HF pharmacotherapy in the context of AF, focusing on the four cornerstone treatments and modifiers of prognosis for HF with reduced ejection fraction: beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/sacubitril-valsartan, aldosterone antagonists, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. Although these therapies are well-established in HF patients, their efficacy in patients with concomitant AF requires further prospective investigation. The unique challenges posed by AF, including arrhythmia-induced remodelling and cardiomyopathy, necessitate a more individually tailored treatment. We also highlight critical knowledge gaps and the need for dedicated clinical trials specifically assessing HF therapies in AF subgroups, such as paroxysmal, long-standing persistent and permanent AF, and the benefit of heart rate and rhythm control strategies. The future of precision medicine in HF-AF management lies in bridging these evidence gaps through targeted research and interdisciplinary collaboration.

### Atrial fibrillation: common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line rhythm control. Conversion to sinus rhythm with catheter ablation may be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to take rate or rhythm control medications long-term or if medications have been ineffective.

AF and HF

AF and HF are two entities which clinically may present alone but often are encountered together. AF and HF share many risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus and ischaemic heart disease. Due to these comorbidities and AF itself, an 'atrial cardiomyopathy' can develop as a consequence of the structural, architectural, contractile and electrophysiological changes that occur in the atria. The development of AF or HF first is of interest as the chronology of the diseases may impact prognosis. HF first seems to infer an inferior prognosis. AF, on the other hand, may contribute to the development of HF by several mechanisms. During AF, loss of atrial systole reduces left ventricular (LV) filling and may reduce cardiac output by 25%. Also, the irregularity and a too high heart rate during AF may increase the likelihood to develop LV dysfunction even leading to a reversible form of (tachy)cardiomyopathy. This is illustrated in patients who develop LV dysfunction during AF and show a recovery of LV ejection fraction (LVEF) after restoration of sinus rhythm. Thus, AF is of importance in the development and maintenance of LV dysfunction and, therefore, should be taken into account for every patient presenting with HF (figure 1).

Clinical presentation of AF in HF

Key elements in diagnosing HF are signs and symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF. It, however, is often difficult to diagnose HFpEF in patients with AF. This is due to a large overlap in signs and symptoms. For example, breathlessness and fatigue are important symptoms in HF but may also be found in AF without diagnosed or recognised HF. A recent white paper suggested some signs and investigations to use in clinical practice.

### Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation with heart failure [^115PPifp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study CASTLE-AF was published by Marrouche NF and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation and Heart failure. In the CASTLE-AF study, the trial question was: what is the role of catheter ablation for AF in patients with HF who are otherwise receiving appropriate treatment? In the CASTLE-AF study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CASTLE-AF study, the population was: 363 patients (52 female, 311 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF and HF who did not respond to antiarrhythmic drugs. The key exclusion criteria were candidacy for heart transplantation or planned cardiovascular intervention. In the CASTLE-AF study, the interventions were: n = 179 catheter ablation (to restore sinus rhythm) n = 184 medical therapy alone (for rate or rhythm control). In the CASTLE-AF study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death or hospitalization for worsening HF (28.5% vs. 44.6%; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.87). In the CASTLE-AF study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from any cause (13.4% vs. 25%; HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.86) Significant decrease in hospitalization for worsening HF (20.7% vs. 35.9%; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83) Significant decrease in cardiovascular death (11.2% vs. 22.3%; HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.84). In the CASTLE-AF study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in pericardial effusion and severe bleeding (3 vs. 0 in each). In the CASTLE-AF study, the conclusion was: in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF and HF who did not respond to antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation was superior to medical therapy alone with respect to death or hospitalization for worsening HF.

### Can we predict the occurrence of atrial fibrillation? [^117BSZHQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex disease with increasing prevalence in an aging population and longer survival with cardiovascular diseases. Whereas most clinical efforts have been aimed at predicting risk of AF sequelae such as stroke and heart failure, little is known on primary prevention. AF risk assessment is complicated by the existence of distinct subtypes of AF, such as lone AF or postoperative AF, in contrast to common AF in the elderly. Due to its often intermittent nature, diagnosing AF can be a challenge. Risk prediction becomes reasonable when specific interventions arise. Due to our limited understanding of AF pathophysiology and substantial lack of specific preventive strategies in the population, modification of the general cardiovascular risk profile has largely remained the only option. Initial attempts at combining established risk factors for AF such as age, sex, hypertension, body mass index, electrocardiographic characteristics, and cardiovascular disease in a risk-prediction instrument have produced a robust algorithm. However, known risk factors only explain a fraction of the population-attributable risk of AF, and the search for novel risk indicators is ongoing. More efficient monitoring for electrocardiographic precursors of AF and the field of genomics are evolving areas of AF risk factor research. A better understanding of the underlying substrate of AF will provide targets for prevention. In the future, clinical trials will be needed to establish risk categories, interventions, and their efficacy. Despite a relevant public-health impact, knowledge on risk prediction and primary prevention of AF is still limited today. There are no conflicts of interest to disclose.

### The increasing role of rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation: JACC state-of-the-art review [^115zhLtD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The considerable mortality and morbidity associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) pose a substantial burden on patients and health care services. Although the management of AF historically focused on decreasing AF recurrence, it evolved over time in favor of rate control. Recently, more emphasis has been placed on reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes using rhythm control, generally by using safe and effective rhythm-control therapies (typically antiarrhythmic drugs and/or AF ablation). Evidence increasingly supports early rhythm control in patients with AF that has not become long-standing, but current clinical practice and guidelines do not yet fully reflect this change. Early rhythm control may effectively reduce irreversible atrial remodeling and prevent AF-related deaths, heart failure, and strokes in high-risk patients. It has the potential to halt progression and potentially save patients from years of symptomatic AF; therefore, it should be offered more widely.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection Fraction and Atrial fibrillation: vicious twins [^117Pq9AS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are age-related conditions that are increasing in prevalence, commonly coexist, and share clinical features. This review provides a practical update on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of patients with concomitant HFpEF and AF. Epidemiological studies highlight the close and complex links between HFpEF and AF, the shared risk factors, the high AF occurrence in the natural history of HFpEF, and the independent contribution of each condition to poor outcomes. Diagnosis of HFpEF in the setting of AF is challenging because the symptoms overlap. AF is associated with changes in echocardiographic parameters and circulating natriuretic peptides that confound HFpEF diagnosis. Symptomatic improvement with diuretic therapy supports the presence of HFpEF in patients with concomitant AF. Important knowledge gaps need to be addressed by a multidisciplinary and translational research approach to develop novel therapies that can improve prognosis.

### Implications of atrial fibrillation for guideline-directed therapy in patients with heart Failure: JACC state-of-the-art review [^113qgHnw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) are common cardiovascular conditions that frequently coexist. Among patients with HF, more than one-half also have AF. Both are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the prevalence of each is increasing globally, and this trend is expected to continue owing to an aging population and increased life expectancy. Diagnosis of AF in a patient with HF is associated with greater symptom burden, more frequent hospitalizations, and a worse prognosis. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF can affect the incidence of AF. Once present, AF can influence the efficacy of some components of GDMT for HF. In this review, we discuss the effect of GDMT for HF across the spectrum of ejection fraction on prevention of AF as well as the benefit of GDMT in patients with vs without AF.

### Rhythm control versus rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: insights from get with the guidelines-heart failure [^114CzeSf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for one half of all heart failure (HF) visits and hospital admissions in the United States. Patients with HFpEF have similar risks of morbidity and all‐cause mortality as patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). 1, 2 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in patients with HF, occurring in approximately one third of patients. 3, 4, 5, 6 In patients with HFpEF, the prevalence of AF ranges from 15% to 41% in registries and clinical trials. 6

Patients with HF and AF have worse outcomes than patients with HF without AF. 7 The HF guidelines focus their recommendations on prevention of thromboembolism and symptom control with the goal to correct underlying causes of AF and HF and optimize HF management. The guidelines then differentiate patients who develop HF as a result of AF and patients who have HF and go on to develop AF. 8 Patients with newly diagnosed HF in the presence of AF with rapid ventricular response are recommended to undergo rhythm control, as a rate‐related cardiomyopathy is a reversible cause of HF. There is no other specific recommendation for rate versus rhythm control in the HF guidelines. 8 The AF guidelines recommend rhythm control only in patients who remain symptomatic despite rate control treatment. 9 A recent meta‐analysis revealed that all‐cause mortality is significantly higher in patients with AF and HFrEF compared with patients with AF and HFpEF, yet stroke risk and HF hospitalization rates were similar among both groups. 10 Similar comparisons in the GWTG‐HF (Get With The Guidelines — Heart Failure) registry extends these prior findings, demonstrating that AF is common in patients with HF and associated with higher mortality, readmissions, and HF readmissions. 11

HFpEF and AF have shared risk factors, confer increased risks for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and frequently occur together. 6, 12 Despite accumulating epidemiologic data detailing worse outcomes in patients with HFpEF complicated by AF, there are no medical therapies that have been definitively shown to improve outcomes for patients with HFpEF. As a result, the guideline writing committees limit their scope to treatment of associated comorbidities. 8, 13, 14, 15, 16 To describe current treatment patterns and subsequent outcomes in patients with HFpEF complicated by AF, we analyzed the GWTG‐HF registry linked to Medicare claims data.

Atrial fibrillation and heart failure — synopsis highlights that it is clear that AF may worsen HF but also that HF increases the risk of AF. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rhythm control with antiarrhythmic agents versus rate control have not shown a benefit of rhythm control, whereas more recent RCTs with ablation show that ablation may be preferable to antiarrhythmic drugs for a rhythm control strategy. Patients with a cardiomyopathy thought due to rapid AF despite attempts at rate control should be aggressively treated to maintain sinus rhythm and, if unsuccessful, atrioventricular nodal ablation with placement of a CRT device can be considered.

### Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy: focus on atrial fibrillation [^115Sq8GM]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Arrhythmias and heart failure (HF) are common causes of morbidity and premature death worldwide, and patients who present with both conditions have particularly poor outcomes. Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC) is a condition in which arrhythmias, often atrial fibrillation (AF), but also frequent atrial or ventricular ectopic beats, cause or aggravate HF. The hallmark of this condition is partial or complete reversibility of left ventricular systolic dysfunction after restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Differentiation between HF that causes arrhythmias and arrhythmias that cause HF remains challenging, leads to the underuse of rhythm-control therapy and, consequently, to the under-diagnosis of AIC. In this Review, we describe the various pathophysiological mechanisms of AIC, with a focus on AF as the underlying arrhythmia. We then discuss the epidemiology, clinical presentation and assessment of patients with AIC, with consideration of the complex interactions between AF and left ventricular dysfunction. We also present the therapeutic approach taken in patients presenting with suspected AIC, including restoration of sinus rhythm to unmask a diagnosis of AIC and treatment of HF. We conclude with a discussion of priorities for future research and the observation that there is an urgent need for objective, easily quantifiable parameters to identify patients with AIC.

At the same time, presence of AF also enhances the risk of heart failure events, stroke, and cardiovascular death (Table 1).

Atrial fibrillation and left ventricular function. Atrial fibrillation directly impairs ventricular functionand can even result in arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathythat will reverse after restoration of normal sinus rhythm using AF ablation. In other patients, heart failure can predispose to AF, and AF and heart failure share genetic and acquired pathomechanisms. A high AF burden was associated with more heart failure events in a large population of patients with paroxysmal AF. There is a strong bidirectional association between heart failure and AF burden, where heart failure can contribute to AF, and vice versa. Controlled clinical trials of rhythm control and AF ablation, interventions that lower AF burden, reduce heart failure events in patients with reduced left ventricular function and AF. Ongoing studies testing AF ablation will determine whether reducing AF burden can improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and AF (NCT055008256).
Atrial fibrillation and stroke. Reduced flow in the left atrium and especially in the left atrial appendage, endothelial dysfunction, and activation of local and systemic prothrombotic signalling combine to enhance thrombogenesis in the left atrium and cardioembolic stroke in patients with AF. This leads to cardioembolic strokes that are commonly found in patients with AF. The incidence of cardioembolic strokes can be significantly reduced by oral anticoagulants. Left atrial appendage occlusionand early rhythm control therapyeach reduce stroke by one-third on top of anticoagulation, demonstrating a prominent atrial contribution to stroke. On the other hand, atrial arrhythmia may be more frequent in the acute phase after a stroke. Thus, interactions between comorbidities and AF appear to create an atrial prothrombotic milieu.
Cardiovascular death can be due to AF and occur independent of AF. The reductions in mortality seen in anticoagulation trials, suggest that stroke prevention can reduce cardiovascular deaths. The effects of early rhythm controland AF ablation, on cardiovascular death and total mortality suggest that rhythm control can have similar effects, probably by preventing stroke and heart failure events. Overall, these effects of AF on cardiovascular death compete with other diseases causing cardiovascular death, and the contribution of AF on cardiovascular death will depend on the number, intensity, and quality of treatment of other cardiovascular diseases.

### Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): advances and challenges [^1118JhCU]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

This state‐of‐the‐art review is based on the Philippe Coumel Lecture in 2024 (Figure 1). It highlights the confluence of two major cardiovascular epidemics, atrial fibrillation and heart failure, with preserved ejection fraction. In these conditions, advances in electrophysiology and heart failure physiology are intertwined and are integrated in this review. This constellation of disease states has its own unique epidemiologic features, pathophysiology, experimental and clinical mechanisms; and an increasing knowledge base with respect to clinical presentation, prognostic implications, and therapeutic options from pharmacologic advances and non‐pharmacologic interventions. Major advances, continuing challenges, and future directions in this condition are described in this rapidly evolving field of scientific endeavor.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115TDppn]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in chronic heart failure — anticoagulation and rhythm control — has specific directives. Patients with chronic HF with permanent-persistent-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 (for men) and 3 (for women) should receive chronic anticoagulant therapy. For patients with chronic HF with permanent-persistent-paroxysmal AF, a direct-acting oral anticoagulant is recommended over warfarin in eligible patients. For patients with HF and symptoms caused by AF, AF ablation is reasonable to improve symptoms and quality of life.

### Atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction "twindemic"-shared root causes and treatment targets [^115TsJig]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are comorbid conditions that are increasingly prevalent and have a high socioeconomic burden. This article discusses their shared pathophysiology, focusing on the triad of hypertension, obesity, and aging. We highlight the misperception that pharmacological heart rate lowering is beneficial, which has resulted in an overprescription of β-blockers in HFpEF and AF. In contrast, heart rate modulation through accelerated pacing provides hemodynamic and structural advantages, which have yielded significant improvements in quality of life, physical activity, and AF burden in the personalized pacing for diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (myPACE) trial of patients with preclinical or overt HFpEF.

### Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation – A key role in heart failure therapy? [^116CELX5]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This gap has recently been closed by a large, multicenter RCT. The CASTLE‐AF Study (Catheter Ablation vs Standard Conventional Therapy in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Atrial Fibrillation) for the first time compared catheter ablation with medical drug therapy (rate or rhythm control) in a large group of patients with HF and AF. At 33 centers in the United States, Australia and Europe (17 in Germany), 387 patients with either paroxysmal or persistent AF, chronic HF (NYHA II‐IV) and a LVEF of < 35% were randomized (179 patients on ablation arm, 184 patients on medical therapy arm). The medical rhythm control approach was done with amiodarone in about 30% of patients. Importantly, catheter ablation significantly reduced AF burden. Since all patients included in the study had an ICD or a CRT‐D device, the time in SR could be exactly quantified and was documented to be 63.1% vs 21.7% favoring the PVI‐arm. The primary endpoint, hospitalization for worsening HF or death, occurred in a median follow‐up of 37.8 months in 28.5% of catheter ablation patients vs 44.6% on drug therapy (P = 0.007). The number of deaths after ablation was also lower than on drug therapy (13.4% vs 25% of patients, P = 0.01). Benefits were due to a reduced number of hospitalizations for acute worsening of HF (20.7% vs 35.9%, hazard ratio 0.56, 0.37‐0.83), and a decreased number of cardiovascular deaths (11.2% vs 22.3%; hazard ratio 0.49; 0.29‐0.84). Furthermore, there was an improvement in LVEF (median absolute increase at 60‐month 8.0% in the ablation group vs 0.2% in the medical management arm; P = 0.005). 44

### Catheter ablation in end-stage heart failure with atrial fibrillation [^111FJZpP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

The role of catheter ablation in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation and end-stage heart failure is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a single-center, open-label trial in Germany that involved patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation and end-stage heart failure who were referred for heart transplantation evaluation. Patients were assigned to receive catheter ablation and guideline-directed medical therapy or medical therapy alone. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause, implantation of a left ventricular assist device, or urgent heart transplantation.

Results

A total of 97 patients were assigned to the ablation group and 97 to the medical-therapy group. The trial was stopped for efficacy by the data and safety monitoring board 1 year after randomization was completed. Catheter ablation was performed in 81 of 97 patients (84%) in the ablation group and in 16 of 97 patients (16%) in the medical-therapy group. After a median follow-up of 18.0 months (interquartile range, 14.6 to 22.6), a primary end-point event had occurred in 8 patients (8%) in the ablation group and in 29 patients (30%) in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.52; P < 0.001). Death from any cause occurred in 6 patients (6%) in the ablation group and in 19 patients (20%) in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.72). Procedure-related complications occurred in 3 patients in the ablation group and in 1 patient in the medical-therapy group.

Conclusions

Among patients with atrial fibrillation and end-stage heart failure, the combination of catheter ablation and guideline-directed medical therapy was associated with a lower likelihood of a composite of death from any cause, implantation of a left ventricular assist device, or urgent heart transplantation than medical therapy alone.

### Is rhythm control superior to rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure? [^111WMXCK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

In 1,009 patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, the 2-year mortality rate was 31% in patients treated with rate control (n = 505) versus 29% in patients treated with rhythm control (n = 504). After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics and medications, no significant difference in mortality was found between the 2 groups.

### Heart failure-related death in subjects with atrial fibrillation in the United States, 1999 to 2020 [^113dGVWe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The rising trend of HF‐related death in patients with AF noted in the present analysis is concerning. This underscores the need for more robust cardiovascular surveillance in patients with HF through the implementation of opportunistic/systematic AF screening programs aimed to identify early the subjects at risk and to institute appropriate treatments. Furthermore, the present data suggest that further research is warranted to understand which of the contributing factors is the primary driver of the trends and, if related to an increase in the disease burden, to reverse the observed increasing trend. At the same time, the promotion of primordial, primary, and secondary prevention strategies remains fundamental to provide rapid and individualized expert‐based care. Additionally, the present findings should be used as an impetus to redouble efforts to consider AF ablation as an early therapeutic option. Indeed, the degree of atrial derangement, due to the underlying atrial fibrosis, remains a major determinant for AF outcomesand for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in the long‐term period. In this regard, although AF ablation has been associated with a lower risk of HF hospitalization and all‐cause death by several randomized controlled trials and small observational studies, the beneficial effect of such electrophysiological procedure appears to be more modest analyzing large data set. This phenomenon is likely to be multifactorial. Indeed, results derived from randomized controlled trials derived from a highly selected population, whereas such strict eligibility criteria are not used in daily clinical practice. Furthermore, the prevalence of comorbidities is frequently different comparing validating studies and population derived from a large database influencing the selection of patients for AF ablation; indeed, in daily practice, several patients are often considered poor candidates for the interventional procedure. Finally, the timing of the procedure, which is currently very heterogeneous in clinical practice, may significantly impact patients' outcomes.

### Rhythm control versus rate control for atrial fibrillation and heart failure [^1111cSD7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

It is common practice to restore and maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. This approach is based in part on data indicating that atrial fibrillation is a predictor of death in patients with heart failure and suggesting that the suppression of atrial fibrillation may favorably affect the outcome. However, the benefits and risks of this approach have not been adequately studied.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the maintenance of sinus rhythm (rhythm control) with control of the ventricular rate (rate control) in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less, symptoms of congestive heart failure, and a history of atrial fibrillation. The primary outcome was the time to death from cardiovascular causes.

Results

A total of 1376 patients were enrolled (682 in the rhythm-control group and 694 in the rate-control group) and were followed for a mean of 37 months. Of these patients, 182 (27%) in the rhythm-control group died from cardiovascular causes, as compared with 175 (25%) in the rate-control group (hazard ratio in the rhythm-control group, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P = 0.59 by the log-rank test). Secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups, including death from any cause (32% in the rhythm-control group and 33% in the rate-control group), stroke (3% and 4%, respectively), worsening heart failure (28% and 31%), and the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or worsening heart failure (43% and 46%). There were also no significant differences favoring either strategy in any predefined subgroup.

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, a routine strategy of rhythm control does not reduce the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, as compared with a rate-control strategy. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00597077.)

### Prognostic implications and global perspectives of atrial fibrillation in patients hospitalized for heart Failure [^115zt2pZ]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) each contributes to global disease burden and can coexist. The interplay of prior HF, prior AF, and presenting rhythm have not previously been jointly considered in prognostic implication.

Objectives

The authors sought to assess 1-year all-cause mortality according to permutations of prior HF, prior AF, and AF as presenting rhythm, in a global cohort of patients hospitalized for HF.

Methods

REPORT-HF enrolled patients during hospitalization for acute HF from 44 countries over 6 continents. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compute HRs for the primary outcome of 1-year all-cause mortality.

Results

Of 13,401 participants (median age 67 years, 61% men), 58% had prior HF. AF prevalence (prior or newly detected) at HF admission was 39%, varying by left ventricular ejection fraction and race subgroups. Compared with patients with no prior HF, no prior AF, and presenting in sinus rhythm, 1-year all-cause mortality was elevated in patients with prior HF, prior AF, and presenting in AF (adjusted HR: 1.54 [95% CI: 1.34–1.78]; P < 0.001) and in patients with prior HF, no prior AF, and presenting in AF (adjusted HR: 1.51 [95% CI: 1.20–1.90]; P < 0.001), but not in patients with no prior HF and with prior AF or presenting in AF. These results were conserved across left ventricular ejection fraction and race subgroups.

Conclusions

In a global cohort of patients hospitalized for HF, permutations of prior HF, prior AF, and AF as presenting rhythm differentiate outcome. History of prior HF influences the prognostic implications of AF in patients hospitalized for HF. (Global Noninterventional Heart Failure Disease Registry [REPORT-HF]; NCT02595814).

### Atrial fibrillation and outcomes in heart failure with preserved versus reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^114W3T84]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) represent 2 worsening epidemics nationally and internationally. – AF remains the most common, clinically relevant arrhythmia in adults and is independently associated with a 4‐ to 5‐fold higher risk of ischemic stroke, as well as poorer quality of life, higher hospitalization rates, and excess mortality. – AF frequently complicates HF, affecting approximately one third of all adults with HF. However, the epidemiology of HF has been changing, with an increasing proportion of patients being diagnosed with HF and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HF‐PEF). Limited data exist on contemporary incidence rates and outcomes associated with AF in the setting of HF‐PEF compared with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HF‐REF).

Within a large, multicenter cohort of adults with HF, we examined the association of preexisting versus incident AF with clinically relevant outcomes among adults with HF‐PEF and HF‐REF.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) progression — strategy comparisons — indicates that AF commonly, but not always, progresses over time, with large registries showing more progression on a rate-control strategy than a rhythm-control strategy over a 1- to 2-year period. Across two registry studies, progression to a more sustained AF burden occurred in 26% to 28% with rate control versus 6% to 11% with rhythm control, whereas in ORBIT AF progression was common regardless of strategy (66% for rate control and 56% for rhythm control). Additional factors important to AF progression include age, presence or absence of heart failure (HF) or other comorbidities, left atrial (LA) size, heart rate, and modifiable risk factors.

Atrial fibrillation — quality of life is considerably impaired compared with age-matched controls, and sustained sinus rhythm is associated with improved quality of life and better exercise performance than atrial fibrillation in some studies but not others. In the SPAF study cohort, Ganiats et al. found the New York Heart Association functional classification, originally developed for heart failure, an insensitive index of quality of life in patients with atrial fibrillation. In another study, 47 of 69 patients (68%) with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation considered the arrhythmia disruptive of lifestyle, but this perception was not associated with either the frequency or duration of symptomatic episodes.

12 Concluding Remarks

It is particularly fitting at the conclusion of this review to remember once again the parting words of Phillippe Coumel upon his retirement: "After Claude Bernard's inauguration of a method that presupposes understanding before treating, that places the diagnostic approach before therapeutic sanction, isn't modern cardiology in the process of moving to the opposite approach, which consists of treating before understanding?"

The Coumel method of careful observation, critical analysis, and deductive reasoning should remain the guiding North Star in our future endeavors in arrhythmia research. It is necessary to find the mechanisms of disease state observations, which are often based on anecdotal and pilot study breakthroughs in treatment. Far too often we are dismissive of such work in our evidence‐based world. All too frequently, conflicting evidence emerges when trials are done without a true understanding of the disease state. Post hoc analyses often find the "gems" that spur science, but we must be cautious as the diagnostic criteria and observation methods are evolving.

### Role of carvedilol in atrial fibrillation: insights from clinical trials [^116RK8dt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation affects approximately 2 million people in the United States and is a common comorbidity among patients with heart failure. Clinical studies indicate that the benefits of the beta-blocker carvedilol in patients with heart failure extend to patients with heart failure complicated by atrial fibrillation. The results of the Carvedilol in Atrial Fibrillation Evaluation (CAFE) trial provide support that carvedilol has incremental benefit when added to digoxin for the management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure. Additional recent studies suggest that carvedilol may be useful in managing postsurgical atrial fibrillation and also may prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation among patients who undergo cardioversion.

### Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation [^114xjxRz]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting over 33 million individuals worldwide, and its prevalence is expected to more than double over the next 40 years. AF is associated with a twofold increase in premature mortality, and important major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart failure, severe stroke and myocardial infarction. Significant effort has been made over a number of years to define the underlying cellular, molecular and electrophysiological changes that predispose to the induction and maintenance of AF in patients. Progress has been limited by the realisation that AF is a complex arrhythmia that can be the end result of various different pathophysiological processes, with significant heterogeneity between individual patients (and between species). In this focused Review article, we aim to succinctly summarise for the non-specialist the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of AF. We address all aspects of pathophysiology, including the basic electrophysiological and structural changes within the left atrium, the genetics of AF and the links to comorbidities and wider systemic and metabolic perturbations that may be upstream contributors to development of AF. Finally, we outline the translational implications for current and future rhythm control strategies in patients with AF.

Comorbidities potentially involved in the development of HFpEF. Iron deficiency, diabetes mellitus, obesity, renal failure, hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension increase the risk of HFpEF through structural and functional cardiac change and systemic inflammation (Reproduced with permission from).

Current practice guidelines have included consideration of the natural history of each disease state. With the reclassification of HF into preserved EF (HFpEF), mid‐range EF (HFmrEF), and reduced EF (HFrEF), HF categories form a continuum. Thus, HFmrEF will share some features with HFpEF and HFrEF, and the behavior at the ends of each adjoining range may overlap with the next category. Current day classification of HF overall also defines stages in the HF lifecycle from A to D. These range from an at‐risk population (Stage A), to pre‐HF (Stage B), symptomatic HF (Stage C), and advanced HF (Stage D). Most of the discussion in this review will focus on Stages C and D, but increasing interest is emerging on the role of AF treatment strategy on HF Stages B and C.

The evolution of the modern classification of AF has emerged from a consensus document of international societies of arrhythmology. It was previously based on AF episode duration, ability to self‐terminate or requiring interventions for termination, or failure to successfully terminate and revert to stable sinus rhythm with interventions. Rather than a classification of AF events, a newer proposal defines four stages of the AF lifecycle and mirrors the HF terminology. Stage 1 of the life cycle includes those at risk for AF with or without modifiable comorbid conditions that confer risk. Stage 2, referred to as pre‐AF, includes individuals with structural or electrical abnormalities that predispose a patient to AF. Stage 3 includes three categories of manifest AF. Stage 3A, which was previously defined as paroxysmal AF, includes AF episodes that self‐terminate within 7 days. Stage 3B, which is commonly referred to as persistent AF, includes AF episodes not self‐terminating within 7 days and requiring intervention for termination. Stage 3C includes long‐standing persistent AF, defined as an episode duration of > 12 months. Stage 3D in the life cycle refers to successfully ablated (surgically or percutaneously) AF subjects. Stage 4 in the AF life cycle is defined as a condition of permanent AF when no further efforts at rhythm control are undertaken after agreement between the patient and clinician.

### Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure [^112QRV2L]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) both have become major cardiovascular epidemics, adversely affecting quality of life, decreasing longevity, and imparting a large economic burden on the healthcare system. Both share similar risk factors and frequently coexist, leading to increased morbidity and mortality relative to patients with either condition alone. Although evidence-based treatment guidelines for both diseases exist, consensus treatment strategies are less clear when AF and HF co-occur. Given the risks of antiarrhythmic drugs and their incomplete success in maintaining sinus rhythm, catheter ablation has become an increasingly popular alternative to pharmacologic rhythm control in symptomatic patients with AF with normal cardiac function. Although multiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy of catheter ablation in AF, studies examining the use of catheter ablation specifically in patients with HF have recently begun to emerge and provide some guidance in this group of patients. In this review, we examine the effects of catheter ablation of AF in patients with HF on maintenance of sinus rhythm, left ventricular ejection fraction, exercise capacity, quality of life, hospitalization, and mortality rates. Data regarding both HF with reduced ejection fraction and preserved ejection fraction are discussed.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) — comparative effects of rhythm control versus rate control are described with quantitative trial data. Early initiation of rhythm control (< 1 year) in AF was associated with 15% and 19% reductions in a composite endpoint, though some studies reported increased emergency department visits and health care resource utilization with rhythm control. In AF-CHF (Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure), rhythm control did not affect cardiovascular mortality but was associated with improved QOL. In an EAST-AFNET 4 HF analysis, rhythm control reduced the composite endpoint (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56–0.97]; P = 0.03). In CABANA, catheter ablation–based rhythm control was associated with a 46% reduction in mortality in HF compared with medical therapy. In AF-CHF, amiodarone was the preferential rhythm-control strategy (82% of patients).

Tachycardiomyopathy

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is a long-recognized complication of AF, affecting as few as 3% and as many as 25% of patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias. Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, including decreased density of-type calcium channels and β-adrenergic receptors, increased intracellular calcium and diastolic contracture, impaired myocardial blood flow due to raised left ventricular diastolic pressure, oxidative stress, and even deleterious polymorphisms in angiotensin converting enzyme.

The diagnosis should be considered in a patient with no prior CV history who presents with new-onset HF in the setting of AF with rapid ventricular conduction. When evaluating patients with AF and left ventricular dysfunction, it is paramount to exclude other underlying causes of ventricular dysfunction, including ischaemia. Once ischaemia has been ruled out, other indicators of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy should also assessed (e.g. left ventricular hypertrophy, alcohol/drug use, infiltrative disorders, etc.). It is important to emphasize that there are no established diagnostic criteria for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and the diagnosis can be elusive in the majority of patients with established CV disease or when the initial presentation is missed.

Once anticoagulation has been initiated and the risk of thrombus has been addressed, sinus rhythm should be restored with cardioversion. Several methods can be used to maintain sinus rhythm; short-term amiodarone (3 months) is often helpful and allows for recovery before deploying a more durable treatment modality such as catheter ablation. Recovery of ventricular function confirms the diagnosis and may take up to 6 weeks. Patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy have similar outcomes following catheter ablation compared with patients without structural heart disease.

HFpEF: a setting where the holistic ABC approach is of major interest for the management of AF with HF

Oral anticoagulation is also a major pillar to improve outcomes in patients with AF and HFpEF, but we need to look beyond anticoagulation in these patients. However, a simple unique and one-size-fits-all approach may not be applicable or sufficient in the case of HFpEF with AF. Regarding early rhythm control for possibly improving outcomes in AF patients, most benefit occurs if intervention is early and in younger patients and those with fewer coexisting conditions and if it also includes an association of care with attention to anticoagulation management, risk-factor control, lifestyle factors, and regular follow-up visits needed to ensure adherence and effective care approaches.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure (HF) — rate control and rhythm strategy guidance emphasizes rate targets, agent selection, and anticoagulation. Digoxin 'slows atrioventricular conduction more effectively at rest than during exercise', while 'Beta-blockers are more effective than digoxin during exercise… and are preferred because of their favorable effects on the natural history of HF'; verapamil and diltiazem 'should be avoided', and if beta-blockers are 'ineffective or contraindicated… amiodarone may be a useful alternative'. If tachycardia persists, 'Atrioventricular nodal ablation may be needed'. For rate targets, 'every effort should be made to reduce the ventricular response to less than 80 to 90 beats per min at rest and less than 110 to 130 beats per min during moderate exercise'. For stroke prevention in this setting, 'Anticoagulation should be maintained in all patients with HF and a history of atrial fibrillation, regardless of whether sinus rhythm is achieved'. Evidence on rhythm control notes 'a total of 5032 patients in 4 separate trials' with 'no improvement in mortality or morbidity using a strategy of aggressive rhythm control'.

### Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation with heart failure [^111xDEHu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Mortality and morbidity are higher among patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure than among those with heart failure alone. Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has been proposed as a means of improving outcomes among patients with heart failure who are otherwise receiving appropriate treatment.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation who did not have a response to antiarrhythmic drugs, had unacceptable side effects, or were unwilling to take these drugs to undergo either catheter ablation (179 patients) or medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) (184 patients) for atrial fibrillation in addition to guidelines-based therapy for heart failure. All the patients had New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less, and an implanted defibrillator. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure.

Results

After a median follow-up of 37.8 months, the primary composite end point occurred in significantly fewer patients in the ablation group than in the medical-therapy group (51 patients [28.5%] vs. 82 patients [44.6%]; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.87; P = 0.007). Significantly fewer patients in the ablation group died from any cause (24 [13.4%] vs. 46 [25.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.86; P = 0.01), were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (37 [20.7%] vs. 66 [35.9%]; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.83; P = 0.004), or died from cardiovascular causes (20 [11.2%] vs. 41 [22.3%]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.84; P = 0.009).

Conclusions

Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite end point of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy.

Management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure (HF) — key guideline recommendations state that in patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF and AF, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected, and an early and aggressive approach to AF rhythm control is recommended; in appropriate patients with AF and HFrEF on guideline-directed medical therapy and with reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation is beneficial to improve symptoms, quality of life (QOL), ventricular function, and cardiovascular outcomes; in symptomatic AF with HFpEF and reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation can be useful to improve symptoms and QOL; for AF with HF, digoxin is reasonable for rate control, either with other rate-controlling agents or as monotherapy if others are not tolerated; when AF with HF presents with rapid ventricular rates and beta blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for acute rate control; in AF, HF, HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 50%) with refractory rapid ventricular response and not candidates for or failing rhythm control, atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with biventricular pacing can be useful to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; in AF and HF with implanted biventricular pacing where effective pacing percentage cannot be achieved pharmacologically, AVNA can be beneficial to improve functional class, reduce ICD shock risk, and improve survival; after recovery of LV function from AF‑induced cardiomyopathy, long-term surveillance can be beneficial to detect recurrent AF; for suspected AF‑induced cardiomyopathy or refractory HF symptoms on pharmacological rate control, a stricter rate-control strategy (target heart rate ≤ 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during moderate exercise) may be reasonable; in AF and HFrEF undergoing AVNA, His bundle or left bundle branch area pacing may be reasonable as an alternative to biventricular pacing to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; and in AF with known LVEF < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered because of the potential to exacerbate HF.

### Screening for unrecognized HFpEF in atrial fibrillation and for unrecognized atrial fibrillation in HFpEF [^114P7Au6]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Because of the bidirectional relationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), individuals with either condition require consideration of screening for the other. In this review, we summarize current evidence and rationale for screening for occult HFpEF in adults with clinical AF; and occult AF in patients with clinically recognized HFpEF. Assessment of pretest probability for occult HFpEF in symptomatic AF patients may help guide additional testing such as exercise right heart catheterization to diagnose HFpEF and guide HFpEF-specific therapies. In patients with HFpEF, AF screening will identify cases of occult AF where anticoagulation may decrease stroke risk, and correlation of previously unknown AF episodes with paroxysmal symptoms may prompt consideration for rhythm control. Therefore, screening may help clinicians understand the etiology of the often-overlapping symptoms, and it may help guide treatments to slow progression of both conditions and their complications.

Effects on heart failure (HF) with rate versus rhythm control in AF — event rates and follow-up: HF may develop or deteriorate during either type of treatment, and studies showed no significant difference between strategies. In AFFIRM, 2.1% in the rate-control group and 2.7% in the rhythm-control group developed HF after an average follow-up of 3.5 y. In RACE, hospitalization for HF was 3.5% with rate control and 4.5% with rhythm control during an average follow-up of 2.3 y; similarly, there were no differences in STAF or HOT CAFE, and the AF-CHF study is investigating this further.

### Catheter-based ablation to improve outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: rationale and design of the CABA-HFpEF-DZHK27 trial [^115nzBj7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in heart failure (HF) and negatively impacts outcomes. The role of ablation-based rhythm control in patients with AF and HF with preserved (HFpEF) or mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) is not known. The CABA-HFPEF-DZHK27 (CAtheter-Based Ablation of atrial fibrillation compared to conventional treatment in patients with Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial will determine whether early catheter ablation for AF can prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HFpEF or HFmrEF.

Methods

CABA-HFPEF-DZHK27 (NCT05508256) is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open, interventional multicentre strategy trial with blinded outcome assessment. Approximately 1548 patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF diagnosed within 24months prior to enrolment and HFpEF or HFmrEF will be randomized to early catheter ablation within 4weeks after randomization or to usual care. All patients receive anticoagulation, rate control, and HF management according to current guideline recommendations. Usual care can include rhythm control in symptomatic patients. Patients will be followed until the end of the trial for the primary outcome, a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, and total unplanned hospitalizations for HF or acute coronary syndrome. The safety outcome comprises complications of catheter ablation and death. The trial is powered for a rate ratio of 0.75 (two-sided alpha = 0.05, 1-beta = 0.8).

Conclusion

CABA-HFPEF-DZHK27 will define the role of systematic and early catheter ablation in patients with AF and HFpEF or HFmrEF.

### Atrial fibrillation burden: a new outcome predictor and therapeutic target [^113BCoVW]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is not a dichotomous disease trait. Technological innovations enable long-term rhythm monitoring in many patients and can estimate AF burden. These technologies are already used to detect and monitor AF. This review describes the relation between AF burden and outcomes and potential effects of AF burden reduction. A lower AF burden is associated with a lower risk of stroke and heart failure in patients with AF: stroke risk without anticoagulation is lower in patients with device-detected AF and a low AF burden (stroke rate 1%/year) than in patients with persistent and permanent AF (stroke rate 3%/year). Paroxysmal AF shows intermediate stroke rates (2%/year). Atrial fibrillation burden-reducing interventions can reduce cardiovascular outcomes in patients with AF: early rhythm control reduces cardiovascular events including stroke and heart failure in patients with recently diagnosed AF and cardiovascular conditions. In patients with heart failure and AF, early rhythm control and AF ablation, interventions that reduce AF burden, reduce mortality and heart failure events. Recent technological innovations allow to estimate AF burden in clinical care, creating opportunities and challenges. While evidence remains limited, the existing data already suggest that AF burden reduction could be a therapeutic goal. In addition to anticoagulation and treatment of cardiovascular conditions, AF burden reduction emerges as a therapeutic goal. Future research will define the AF burden that constitutes a relevant risk of stroke and heart failure. Technologies quantifying AF burden need careful validation to advance the field.

### Atrial fibrillation and risk of adverse outcomes in heart failure with reduced, mildly reduced, and preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116y6LvV]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently co-exist. Contemporary classification of HF categorizes it into HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Aggregate data comparing the risk profile of AF between these three HF categories are lacking.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at determining any significant differences in AF-associated all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular mortality (CV), and stroke between HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases until February 28, 2023. Data were combined using DerSimonian-Laird random effects model.

Results

A total of 22 studies comprising 248323 patients were retained: HFrEF 123331 (49.7%), HFmrEF 40995 (16.5%), and HFpEF 83997 (33.8%). Pooled baseline AF prevalence was 36% total population, 30% HFrEF, 36% HFmrEF, and 42% HFpEF. AF was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality in the total population with pooled hazard ratio (HR) = 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–1.21), HFmrEF (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05–1.50) and HFpEF (HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09–1.24), but not HFrEF (HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.93–1.14). AF was associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalizations in the total population (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.14–1.46), HFmrEF (HR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.20–2.24), and HFpEF (HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.17–1.83), but not HFrEF (HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.87–1.18). AF was only associated with CV in the HFpEF subcategory but was associated with stroke in all three HF subtypes.

Conclusions

AF appears to be associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization in HFmrEF and HFpEF. With these findings, the paucity of data and treatment guidelines on AF in the HFmrEF subgroup becomes even more significant and warrant further investigations.

### About atrial fibrillation | Heart disease… [^1157CrYK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What it is Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart. AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. Symptoms Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms:

- Irregular heartbeat.
- Heart palpitations.
- Lightheadedness.
- Extreme fatigue.
- Shortness of breath.
- Chest pain. Risk factors The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib.

Risk factors for AFib include:

- Advancing age.
- High blood pressure.
- Obesity.
- European ancestry.
- Diabetes.
- Heart failure.
- Ischemic heart disease.
- Hyperthyroidism.
- Chronic kidney disease.
- Moderate to heavy alcohol use.
- Smoking.
- Enlargement of the chambers on the left side of the heart. How is AFib related to stroke. AFib increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes. Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining. What are the consequences of AFib. More than 454, 000 hospitalizations with AFib as the primary diagnosis happen each year in the US. The condition contributes to about 158, 000 deaths each year.

The death rate from AFib as the primary or a contributing cause of death has been rising for more than two decades. Circulation. 2022; 145: e153–e639.

### Atrial fibrillation ablation in heart failure with reduced vs preserved ejection fraction… [^112G4eXZ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The primary outcome was HF events, defined as HF hospitalization, clinically significant worsening of HF, or unscheduled visits to a clinician for treatment intensification. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Results. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that catheter ablation for AF was associated with reduced risk of HF events in patients with HFrEF but had limited or no benefit in HFpEF. Results from ongoing trials may further elucidate the role of catheter ablation for AF in HFpEF. Atrial fibrillation and heart failure are rapidly growing cardiovascular epidemics, and the conditions often occur concomitantly; their coexistence carries a substantial incremental effect on morbidity and mortality. 1, 2 However, HF phenotypes based on degree of left ventricular dysfunction have varying etiologies, clinical presentations, and long-term outcomes.

3 HF with preserved ejection fraction constitutes approximately half of HF cases and is expected to become the dominant form. 4 Furthermore, AF is more prevalent in patients with HFpEF than in individuals with HF with reduced EF. 5, 6. The primary outcome was HF events, defined as HF hospitalization, clinically significant worsening of HF leading to an intervention, or an unscheduled visit to a clinician for treatment intensification. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. Additional outcomes of interest were change in left ventricular ejection fraction, functional status as measured by a 6-minute walk test, and quality of life as measured by the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire, which produces a total score ranging from 0 to 105, with lower scores indicating better quality of life.

AF is a coexistent condition in more than half of patients with HFpEF and is associated with an approximately 30% to 40% increase in HF hospitalizations and mortality. 35, 36 Consistent with our findings, patients with HFpEF are additionally more often females and are of older age. 37 These. The association with cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality may also be similar to that of HF events given that differences in point estimates were similar for the different outcomes. However, we found no statistical evidence of effect modification for mortality between patients with HFrEF and HFpEF. This nonsignificant interaction P value may reflect lack of power owing to the small number of deaths from a limited number of studies enrolling patients with HFpEF, which consequently resulted in wide CIs in this group.
