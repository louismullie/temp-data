## Question

non displaced maxillary fracture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a management pathway for a non-displaced maxillary fracture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how "non-displaced maxillary fracture" is defined. Then, I should verify the imaging requirements and how displacement or subtle injuries are judged. Next, I will assess indications for non-operative versus operative management and what thresholds change management. After that, I should detail a conservative care protocol including activity modification, occlusion guidance, analgesia, antibiotics, and follow-up. Then, I need to outline when and how to pivot to operative management, including timing and techniques. Finally, I will address special populations such as pediatrics and older adults, and close with complications, follow-up, and documentation standards.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definition so I don't jump to conclusions. "Non-displaced maxillary fracture" generally refers to a fracture through the maxilla without measurable step-off or gap and without disruption of buttresses that would alter facial width, height, projection, or occlusion; many maxillary sinus wall and frontal process fractures are managed non-operatively, and non-displaced zygomaticomaxillary complex injuries often avoid surgery as well, whereas dentoalveolar injuries or alveolar process fractures may behave differently due to tooth-related contamination and instability and often merit splinting or fixation, so I need to be precise about location and pattern rather than just the label "non-displaced" [^114JJbxk] [^112jyPkJ].

> Next, I should review imaging because accurate characterization drives everything. Multidetector CT with thin slices and multiplanar reformats is the first-line modality to detect and quantify displacement, comminution, sinus involvement, and associated injuries; it is far superior to plain radiographs for subtle midface fractures and is the standard in contemporary practice for both diagnosis and surgical planning, so I should confirm CT has been obtained and interpreted using clinically relevant descriptors such as buttress integrity, sinus wall continuity, and any alveolar or dental involvement [^112A1Y9w] [^1173Vwhn].

> Hold on, let's not conflate terms. I initially thought "non-displaced maxillary fracture" could include alveolar process fractures; wait, let me verify and correct that. Alveolar process fractures, even if minimally displaced, carry a risk of contamination from the oral cavity and dental root injury, and they are generally treated with stabilization and prophylactic antibiotics rather than pure observation, so they should not be grouped under routine non-displaced maxillary fractures for conservative management; I need to ensure I distinguish isolated sinus wall or buttress fractures from dentoalveolar injuries before finalizing a non-operative plan [^112jyPkJ].

> I will now examine the key factors that determine whether non-operative management is safe and appropriate. Non-operative care is reasonable when there is no clinically significant displacement, no occlusal disturbance, no evidence of sinus outflow obstruction, no orbital floor involvement or entrapment, no comminution of load-bearing buttresses, and no open or grossly contaminated wound; I should double-check occlusion clinically, confirm sinus drainage on CT if symptoms suggest blockage, and screen the orbits for diplopia, enophthalmos risk, and muscle entrapment before proceeding conservatively [^115qzWYf] [^1148Kvs6].

> Let me outline the conservative management protocol and be explicit about each element so there is no ambiguity. I need to ensure the patient maintains a soft, non-chew diet for approximately 2 to 4 weeks to offload masticatory forces, avoids nose blowing for about 4 weeks to prevent sinus barotrauma and emphysema, and uses a supportive mouthguard if available during risky activities; I should also provide analgesia, brief antihistamine/decongestant if sinus congestion is present, and, importantly, avoid routine prophylactic antibiotics for closed, non-operative facial fractures including maxillary sinus wall injuries because evidence and consensus statements do not support them, reserving antibiotics for open/contaminated injuries or if infection develops [^115WTJzN] [^111TWBJk] [^111weY81].

> Wait, I should verify follow-up cadence and safety-netting so we don't miss delayed displacement or complications. A clinical reassessment at 1 to 2 weeks with a low threshold to repeat imaging if new symptoms arise is prudent; many maxillary sinus wall and zygomatic arch injuries remodel and improve over time even without surgery, and radiology literature supports the value of documenting stability or expected remodeling trajectories to avoid unnecessary intervention, so I will set expectations and plan interval reassessment accordingly [^1178hrrX].

> I need to ensure I am clear about red flags that should trigger a change in management. Any new malocclusion, worsening facial asymmetry, diplopia or restricted gaze suggesting orbital floor entrapment, persistent or severe epistaxis indicating deeper injury, new sinus pain with fever suggesting obstruction/infection, or progression on interval imaging should prompt expedited ENT/OMFS consultation and consideration of operative intervention; for orbital entrapment or globe malposition, time-sensitive repair is indicated to prevent ischemic muscle injury and fibrosis, typically within 1 to 2 weeks in adults and urgently in pediatric trapdoor fractures, so I should not delay if these emerge [^1113HtTv] [^114iyLiy] [^115dsfLq].

> Let me consider when to pivot to operative management and what that entails, keeping timing and technique aligned with evidence. Operative fixation is indicated for displaced fractures with malocclusion, comminuted or unstable buttresses, persistent diplopia with positive forced ductions or CT entrapment, large orbital floor defects with enophthalmos risk, open/compound fractures, or failure of conservative management; in those scenarios, ORIF using miniplates at key buttresses, orbital floor reconstruction with titanium or absorbable implants when indicated, and restoration of occlusion are standard, with subunit-first sequencing and careful attention to dental roots and sinus outflow [^112A1Y9w] [^114iyLiy].

> But wait, what if passive reduction fails at the time of surgery; I should review contingencies. In some maxillary fractures, passive repositioning of occlusion is not achievable due to impaction or soft-tissue interposition; in those cases, a Le Fort I osteotomy may be required to mobilize the maxilla into the correct occlusal position before fixation, a maneuver that reliably restores occlusion when conventional maneuvers fail, so I should anticipate this possibility in preoperative planning [^114BHyCp] [^114m8G91].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with pediatrics, because bone biology and growth change the calculus. Children heal rapidly and many non-displaced maxillary fractures, including sinus wall injuries, can be managed conservatively with close follow-up; however, pediatric orbital trapdoor fractures require urgent surgical exploration due to the risk of ischemic muscle injury and fibrosis, and when implants are needed in very young children, resorbable materials or bone grafts are preferred to mitigate growth restriction risks, so I need to tailor decisions to age, dentition, and developmental stage [^115usWmN] [^115Fnujc] [^111KZtst].

> I should also consider older adults and medically complex patients, where comorbidities and bone quality may alter risk. In frail patients, prolonged immobilization or general anesthesia may carry higher risk, so a conservative approach with careful monitoring is reasonable when anatomy and occlusion are stable; conversely, poor bone quality or dentition may predispose to collapse or malunion, lowering the threshold for stabilization, so shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment are essential [^114JJbxk].

> I will now examine potential complications and how to mitigate them proactively. Malocclusion and nonunion are uncommon with stable, non-displaced patterns but can occur if buttress integrity is unrecognized or if secondary displacement occurs; persistent sinus disease or mucocele may follow untreated sinus wall fractures with outflow obstruction; orbital injuries can lead to enophthalmos or diplopia if volume or muscle mechanics are not restored; and rare infections can occur, though routine antibiotics do not prevent them in closed injuries, reinforcing the need for selective use and vigilant follow-up [^115qzWYf] [^1148Kvs6] [^115WTJzN].

> Let me reconsider documentation and communication because surgical planning hinges on precise radiology-clinician alignment. Reports should specify the exact anatomic location, degree of displacement and comminution, buttress involvement, sinus outflow status, dental or alveolar involvement, and any orbital findings; using shared terminology such as Le Fort patterns, zygomaticomaxillary complex, naso-orbito-ethmoid, and orbital blowout improves clarity and supports appropriate non-operative or operative decisions, so I should request and review the CT with the radiologist when the description is incomplete [^112A1Y9w] [^1175wUSv] [^111aVV9T].

> Finally, I should confirm the follow-up plan and patient education so expectations are aligned. Patients should receive written instructions on diet, nose-blowing precautions, oral hygiene, warning signs of complications, and a scheduled check-in at 1 to 2 weeks with a low threshold for earlier contact if malocclusion, new diplopia, fever, or worsening pain develops; if symptoms persist beyond several weeks or new functional deficits appear, interval imaging and specialty referral should be arranged to reassess for delayed instability or occult injuries that may have been missed initially [^111weY81] [^1113HtTv].

---

Non-displaced maxillary fractures are best managed with **conservative care** [^114JJbxk], including a soft diet, avoidance of nose blowing, and close follow-up, as most heal uneventfully without surgery [^notfound]. Surgery is reserved for persistent pain, malocclusion, or cosmetic deformity. CT is the **gold standard** for diagnosis and follow-up, and antibiotics are not routinely needed unless there is sinus infection or contamination [^112A1Y9w] [^115WTJzN]. Prognosis is excellent with adherence to conservative management and regular monitoring.

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patients typically present with **facial pain, swelling, and tenderness**, often with epistaxis or nasal congestion; malocclusion is uncommon in non-displaced fractures. Diagnosis relies on **clinical examination** and imaging; CT is the gold standard [^112A1Y9w] for detecting subtle fractures, assessing sinus involvement, and guiding management [^1173Vwhn].

---

## Imaging modalities

- **CT scan**: Gold standard for diagnosing non-displaced maxillary fractures; provides detailed anatomical information and helps assess sinus involvement and associated injuries [^112A1Y9w] [^1173Vwhn].

- **Panoramic radiography**: Useful for initial screening, particularly in resource-limited settings, but may miss subtle fractures [^113u91fw].

- **MRI**: Not routinely used but may be considered in specific cases to assess soft tissue involvement.

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **preferred approach** for non-displaced maxillary fractures, with most patients achieving satisfactory outcomes without surgical intervention [^notfound]. Key components include:

- **Dietary modifications**: Soft diet for 2–4 weeks to minimize stress on the fracture site.

- **Activity restrictions**: Avoidance of nose blowing, strenuous activities, and contact sports to prevent displacement.

- **Pain management**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs as needed.

- **Follow-up**: Regular clinical and radiographic follow-up to monitor healing and detect any delayed complications.

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is rarely indicated for non-displaced maxillary fractures but may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Persistent pain or discomfort**: Despite conservative management.

- **Malocclusion**: Development of bite disturbances.

- **Cosmetic deformity**: Visible facial asymmetry or deformity.

- **Sinus involvement**: Chronic sinusitis or persistent nasal obstruction.

---

## Potential complications

Although non-displaced maxillary fractures generally heal without significant complications, potential risks include:

- **Delayed healing or non-union**: Rare but possible, particularly in patients with poor bone quality or inadequate immobilization.

- **Malocclusion**: Improper healing leading to bite disturbances.

- **Sinus complications**: Chronic sinusitis or nasal obstruction due to improper healing.

- **Infection**: Rare but possible, particularly in cases involving sinus contamination.

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

The prognosis for non-displaced maxillary fractures is **excellent**, with most patients achieving full recovery within 4–6 weeks. Conservative management is effective in approximately 90% of cases, and surgical intervention is rarely required.

---

## Patient education and follow-up care

Patient education is essential to ensure adherence to conservative management and prevent complications. Patients should be instructed on dietary restrictions, activity limitations, and the importance of regular follow-up visits. Follow-up care typically involves **regular clinical examinations and periodic imaging** to monitor healing progress and detect any delayed complications.

---

Non-displaced **maxillary fractures** are typically managed conservatively, with excellent prognoses. Conservative management includes dietary modifications, activity restrictions, **pain management**, and regular follow-up. Surgery is **rarely indicated** unless complications arise.

### Radiographic predictors of FACE-Q outcomes following non-operative orbital floor fracture management [^111XzaY7]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Orbital floor fractures are common injuries treated by multiple surgical subspecialties. Controversy exists regarding the operative indications. This study sought to correlate radiographic characteristics of orbital floor fractures with validated patient reported outcome measures following non-operative management.

Materials and Methods

Patients who underwent non-operative management of an orbital floor fracture at Yale New Haven Hospital from 2013 to 2018 were queried retrospectively. Patients with GCS < 15 and/or distracting facial soft tissue or bony injuries were excluded from analysis. CT images, demographic information, and FACE-Q patient reported outcomes (Satisfaction with Eyes, Psychological Function, Social Function, and Appearance Related Psychosocial Distress) were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS with statistical significance set at P < .05.

Results

Eighteen patients were included in the study. The mean time between injury and completion of the survey was 3.6 years. Fifty-six percent of patients had a right-sided fracture. The mean fracture area was 73.6 mm (Range:15–172 mm), and 913 mm (Range: 0–3106) was the mean volume displaced into the maxillary sinus. The unaffected inferior rectus muscle shape (height/width) was 0.5 (Range: 0.2–0.98) compared to 0.8 (Range 0.4–1.6) for the affected inferior rectus. After controlling for the time interval between survey and injury, gender, income, and education, rounding of the inferior rectus muscle was a significant predictor of appearance related psychosocial distress (P = 0.006). Inferior rectus rounding was stratified into "severe" (75%) and "moderate" (25%) categories. Severe rounding was associated with a larger orbital floor fracture area (110 versus 64 mm; P = 0.074), volume displaced into the maxillary sinus (1,716 versus 610 mm; P = 0.024), and worse appearance-related psychosocial distress (70 versus 25; P = 0.013). Sixty-one percent of patients followed up in clinic with a mean duration of 194 days.

Conclusion

Prior studies have correlated presenting radiographic findings to follow-up clinical findings. However, this study is the first to assess long-term outcomes using validated patient-reported questionnaires. Inferior rectus muscle belly rounding significantly correlated with appearance related psychosocial distress. This radiographic finding may be valuable to consider in orbital floor fracture management.

### Diagnosis and management of common maxillofacial injuries in the emergency department. part 1: advanced trauma life support [^112iwXef]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Maxillofacial injuries are often seen in the emergency department. Fractures of the facial skeleton are commonly seen after assault, road traffic accidents, falls, and sporting injuries in a ratio mandibular:zygoma:maxillary of 6:2:1. Clinicians must be familiar with their management so that appropriate treatment may be used.

### Interventions for the management of mandibular fractures [^114z1p1n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fractures of the mandible (lower jaw) are a common occurrence and usually related to interpersonal violence or road traffic accidents. Mandibular fractures may be treated using open (surgical) and closed (non-surgical) techniques. Fracture sites are immobilized with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or other external or internal devices (i.e. plates and screws) to allow bone healing. Various techniques have been used, however uncertainty exists with respect to the specific indications for each approach.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to provide reliable evidence of the effects of any interventions either open (surgical) or closed (non-surgical) that can be used in the management of mandibular fractures, excluding the condyles, in adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013), metaRegister of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors.

Main Results

Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF™ and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient-oriented outcomes were largely ignored and post-operative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post-operative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I(2) = 0%). Similarly, no difference in post-operative infection between the use of two 3-dimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I(2) = 27%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events.

Authors' Conclusions

This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances.

### An update on maxillary fractures: a heterogenous group [^114JJbxk]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to review the different types of maxillary fractures and highlight their diagnostic and therapeutic differences.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients who sustained maxillary fractures was conducted through the Einstein Healthcare Network during the years 2016–2017. Descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis were used to categorize continuous and categorical variables, respectively.

Results

The cohort of patients (n = 141) were predominately African American (62%) and male (75%) with a mean age 45.3 years. The most common maxillary fracture was maxillary sinus (29%), followed by zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) (26%), frontal process (20%), dentoalveolar (16%), and LeFort (9%). Dentoalveolar fractures were mostly evaluated by the oral maxillofacial surgery service (74%), while ZMC and LeFort fractures were more commonly referred to an otolaryngologist (56% and 67%, respectively). Patients with dentoalveolar fractures were more likely to undergo wire splinting (61%). All patients with frontal process and maxillary sinus fractures were managed non-operatively. Most patients with ZMC fractures were managed non-operatively (78%) while the remainder underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) (22%). Patients with LeFort fractures more commonly underwent maxillomandibular fixation (MMF)/ORIF (83%). Dentoalveolar fractures were the most likely to be operated on the same day (93%) while ZMC and LeFort fractures were repaired within 1 week (88% and 100%, respectively).

Conclusion

Maxillary trauma is very heterogenous in comparison to other maxillofacial trauma patterns. Each fracture type is treated uniquely and can involve one or more provider teams depending on the extent and severity of the injury, as well as hospital resources.

### Three-dimensional navigation-assisted open reduction and internal fixation of a subcondylar and ramus fracture on a maxillary oligodontia patient [^116cruJw]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Among facial bone fractures, nasal bone fractures have the highest incidence, while condyle fractures come in second. Generally, a condylar fracture is attributable to the indirect force delivered to the mandibular condyle during a facial contusion. Among all condyle fractures, most patients are dentulous, and edentulous patients account for only a small proportion. Due to its rarity, treatment of condylar fractures in patients with edentulous mandibles has been little considered in the literature.

Currently, the most appropriate treatment for condylar fractures is still under debate. Closed management has been the main treatment for cases of mild or moderately displaced condylar fractures. Early joint immobilization with strict occlusion control postclosed reduction is required to avoid permanent complications. On the other hand, open reduction with internal fixation has the advantages reducing displaced bony fragment to the most ideal anatomic site. Inappropriate occlusal restoration by closed reduction, lateral extracapsular displacement, and condyle fracture in edentulous patients who cannot have splint or impossible IMF are a few of the many indications of open reduction. The management of condylar fractures in edentulous patients is especially difficult due to the absence of a guide for occlusal analysis and the repositioning of displaced bony segments. Therefore, it seems that no strict rules of indications can be applied to edentulous patients with mandibular condylar fractures, but clinical decisions have to be taken in agreement with the patient on a case-by-case basis.

### Management of nasal fractures [^114W4qxC]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The goal of treatment for nasal fractures is to restore the pretraumatic state and normal function. The decision by the surgeon regarding the surgical approach should be based on the degree of injury, the presence of concomitant facial injuries, patient compliance, training of the surgeon, and the presence and degree of septal injury. The use of a closed or open approach will then depend on the extent of the injury.

### The epidemiology and management of pediatric maxillary fractures [^114QUYt5]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most literature regarding traumatic Le Fort or maxillary fractures exists in the adult population, with limited information regarding the epidemiology and management of pediatric fractures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate fracture mechanism, surgical management, and associated injuries in pediatric patients with Le Fort fractures.

Methods

A retrospective chart analysis of all pediatric patients age ≤ 18 years diagnosed with facial fractures at a single level 1 trauma center over a 10-year period (January 2006-December 2015) was performed. Demographics, fracture location, mechanism of injury, and hospital course were abstracted as well as associated injuries and need for operative management.

Results

A total of 1274 patients met inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine (5.4%) presented with Le Fort fractures. Factors associated with Le Fort fractures included motor vehicle collisions (P < 0.001), increased age (P < 0.001), and traumatic brain injury (P < 0.04). Patients with Le Fort fractures were more likely to need intensive care unit admission (P < 0.001), surgical management (P < 0.001), transfusions (P < 0.001), secondary fixation surgery (P < 0.001), and have a longer length of stay (P < 0.001). Multivariate showed increased odds for increased age (OR 1.1; 95%CI 1.04–1.17) and concomitant orbit fractures (OR 8.33; 95%CI 4.08–19.34). Decreased odds were associated for all mechanisms of injury other than motor vehicle collisions (Other blunt trauma: OR 0.36; 95%CI 0.2–0.6. Penetrating trauma: OR 0.13; 95%CI 0.01–0.6).

Conclusion

Maxillary or Le Fort fractures represent a small portion of pediatric facial fractures but require high rates of operative management. The high velocity required to create this fracture type is associated with significant traumatic comorbidities, which can complicate the hospital course.

### Contemporary management of traumatic fractures of the frontal sinus [^117Sfnmq]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

This article discusses the classic and contemporary management strategies for treating frontal sinus fractures. The goals of management of frontal sinus fractures are to create a safe sinus by minimizing the likelihood of early and late complications while preserving the function of the sinus and maintaining the cosmetic appearance of the upper face. The assessment and classification of patients with frontal sinus injuries, their management, and the treatment of complications are reviewed.

### Severe orbital blow-out fracture: complete displacement of the globe into the maxillary sinus [^115p63MH]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Displacement of the globe of the eye into the maxillary sinus is very rare in cases of facial trauma. Herein, we report a case of complete dislocation of the left globe into the maxillary sinus following a road traffic collision. The patient had prompt surgery to replace the globe after CT imaging confirmed the diagnosis. Subsequently, ongoing follow-up has focused on cosmesis in the affected, non-seeing eye. A multidisciplinary approach has been key throughout the patient's journey.

### The diagnosis and management of facial bone fractures [^111b4s9p]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Appropriate medical care for a patient with a facial fracture can not only optimize aesthetic outcomes but also prevent the potential morbidity and mortality of delayed treatment. In this article, we focus on the clinical presentations, physical examination findings, diagnostic imaging, consultations, and follow-up that patients with facial fractures need related to their emergency department management. Specifically, we address the nuances of evaluating frontal, orbital, nasal, maxillofacial, and mandibular fractures.

### Management of orbital fractures: challenges and solutions [^1148Kvs6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fractures of the orbit are common and challenging to manage. They deserve special consideration because surgical or observational management may result in compromise to vision and/or globe position. Most orbital fractures occur in males in their second decade of life. In adults, motor vehicle accidents and assault are the most common mechanisms of injury.–However, in pediatric patients falls and sports-related injuries are more common. Orbital fractures are often broadly referred to as "blowout" fractures; however, not all orbital fractures are isolated orbital injuries. Orbital fractures may be isolated, or combined, with other nonorbital injuries (head, neck, and spine). Many maxillofacial injures involve the orbit, eg: 1) Le Fort II and III fractures, 2) zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures, and 3) nasoorbitoethmoid fractures.

Most surgeons describe the orbital fracture according to the location within the orbit (floor, medial wall, lateral wall, and roof). However, this simplifies the often complex nature of these fractures. Several classification schemes have been proposed to define isolated, multiwalled, and comminuted orbital fractures, as well as, soft tissue displacement.–Essentially, having a classification scheme will improve intersurgeon communication, provide guidelines for surgical management (indications and timing), and establish a standard for research.

Conceptually, management of these injuries has changed little over the years. However, advances in maxillofacial/orbital imaging, introduction of intraoperative navigation systems, better evidence-based surgical indications and timing, and improved implant designs have led to a reappraisal of time-honored techniques and guidance. Although treatment considerations for orbital roof and medial wall fractures will be discussed, this review will primarily focus on challenges and solutions for orbital floor fractures.

### Orbital blowout fracture with globe displacement into the maxillary sinus: a case report and literature review [^116q8QDe]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Blunt trauma in the orbital region often results in fracture of 1 or more bone walls resulting in alteration of the orbital volume with the potential for visual sequelae. This study reports a rare case of displacement of the eyeball into the maxillary sinus after blunt trauma as well as its initial management, treatment, and clinical follow-up. Victims of eyeball displacement have a poor visual prognosis. Even if the patient has already been diagnosed with amaurosis on arrival to the hospital, all measures for rapid eye repositioning and reconstruction of the orbital cavity must be instituted, as well as appropriate clinical and pharmacologic management to avoid further complications.

### Pediatric frontal sinus fracture conservative care: complete remodeling with growth and development [^114syNjh]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

We report a case of an 11-year-old patient presenting with a displaced anterior table frontal sinus fracture, resulting in a contour deformity. Fractures of the anterior table that result in contour irregularities may be an indication for operative management. The frontal sinus, however, continues to develop through late adolescence, and our patient's fracture remodeled completely within 1 year from injury, without operative management. This clinical report indicates that displaced anterior frontal sinus fractures in the skeletally immature have the potential to completely remodel with time, and therefore may be successfully managed non-operatively.

### Epidemiology of facial fractures: incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability estimates from the global burden of disease 2017 study [^115YYUww]. Injury Prevention (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Facial fractures can be disabling injuries that may require complex surgical care from reconstructive plastic surgeons or oral-maxillofacial specialists. While sophisticated diagnostics and surgical treatment approaches have been developed and are routinely utilised in high resource healthcare systems, occult facial fractures are frequent, especially with low energy mechanisms, and may be missed on initial trauma surveys across the wide array of possible causes of trauma. Without a high degree of clinical suspicion and proper diagnostic equipment (CT scans with multiplanar reconstruction, panorex films), the diagnosis of facial fracture may be significantly delayed and may only be apparent once swelling has subsided. In certain instances, this can have devastating consequences, for example, an orbital floor fracture with entrapment of extraocular muscle leading to permanent dysfunction of congruent eye movements. In addition, there may be considerable burden of such injuries in lower resource areas of the world that lack access to timely and effective care, even if surgical intervention is not indicated. In some cases, effective care may involve non-operative management. For instance, a minimally displaced mandibular condyle fracture may be managed with a soft, non-chew diet for several weeks. In the instance of a mandible fracture, meticulous oral hygiene is imperative to prevent odontogenic infections. Regions in which dental hygiene is poor and routine dental care is sparse may be predisposed to poor outcomes with conservative management strategies such as this. Thus, it is important to measure and understand how these injuries occur and where they are most concentrated geographically. Such efforts could help lead to improved resource allocation and better health system planning to ensure that people suffering from such injuries have access to the treatment resources that can mitigate the disability of such conditions and could also help emphasise the importance of injury prevention strategies. Consequently, there is likely considerable value in measuring the burden of these conditions.

### Multidetector CT of midfacial fractures: classification systems, principles of reduction, and common complications [^115qzWYf]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

The advent of titanium hardware, which provides firm three-dimensional positional control, and the exquisite bone detail afforded by multidetector computed tomography (CT) have spurred the evolution of subunit-specific midfacial fracture management principles. The structural, diagnostic, and therapeutic complexity of the individual midfacial subunits, including the nose, the naso-orbito-ethmoidal region, the internal orbits, the zygomaticomaxillary complex, and the maxillary occlusion-bearing segment, are not adequately reflected in the Le Fort classification system, which provides only a general framework and has become less relevant in contemporary practice. The purpose of this article is to facilitate the involvement of radiologists in the delivery of individualized multidisciplinary care to adults who have sustained blunt trauma and have midfacial fractures by providing a clinically relevant review of the role of multidetector CT in the management of each midfacial subunit. Surgically relevant anatomic structures, search patterns, critical CT findings and their management implications, contemporary classification systems, and common posttraumatic and postoperative complications are emphasized. © RSNA, 2018.

### Extreme midface injury and superior maxillary impaction in an adolescent [^112HMznC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We present a case of an adolescent who sustained multiple facial fractures following a high-speed, head-on skiing collision. The patient presented to a level 1 trauma centre with bilateral LeFort I, LeFort II, naso-orbital ethmoid fractures and superior maxillary displacement to the level of the orbits requiring a staged operative approach to (1) disimpact the maxillary LeFort I segment and (2) reduce and fixate the multilevel facial fractures. The patient was discharged home with close follow-up, and after 1 year, had preservation of appropriate facial proportions without complications. This case study focuses on the triage, management and surgical planning of paediatric midface fractures, which are relatively uncommon to treat. Special considerations for repairing facial fractures in adolescents are discussed.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^112A1Y9w]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with facial trauma, multidetector computed tomography is the first-choice imaging test because it can detect and characterize even small fractures and their associated complications quickly and accurately. It has helped clinical management and surgical planning, so radiologists must communicate their findings to surgeons effectively. In Le Fort fractures, there is a breach between the pterygoid plates and the posterior maxilla. These fractures are classified in three basic patterns that can be combined and associated with various complications. Conceptualized when low-speed trauma was predominant, the Le Fort classification system has become less relevant giving more importance on maxillary occlusion-bearing segments. The classification of naso-orbito-ethmoid depends on the extent of injury to the attachment of the medial canthal tendon, with possible complications like nasofrontal duct disruption. Displaced fractures of the zygomaticomaxillary complex often widen the angle of the lateral orbital wall, resulting in increased orbital volume and sometimes in enophthalmos. Severe comminution or angulation can lead to wide surgical exposure. In orbital fractures, entrapment of the inferior rectus muscles can lead to diplopia, so it is important to assess its positioning and morphology. Orbital fractures can also result in injuries to the globe or infraorbital nerve. Frontal sinus fractures that extend through the posterior sinus wall can create a communication with the anterior cranial fossa resulting in leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, intracranial bleeding. It is essential to categorize fracture patterns and highlight features that may affect fracture management in radiology reports of facial trauma.

### Factors associated with delays in medical and surgical open facial fracture management [^1123vmnV]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Associations with early versus delayed treatment

In adjusted analyses, a number of patient factors were independently associated with early vs delayed open facial fracture management (table 2). Of note, table 2 only displays variables showing statistically significant associations; a table displaying all associations with early versus delayed treatment is included as online supplemental table 1. Among those receiving I&D, early treatment was associated with going to the OR within 24 hours of arrival (OR early = 377.26, p < 0.01), and delayed treatment was associated with maxillary fractures (OR early = 0.05, p < 0.01) and concomitant serious head injury (OR early = 0.04, p < 0.01). Among patients receiving irrigation without debridement, early treatment was associated with nasal fractures (OR early = 37.70, p < 0.01) and OR within 24 hours (OR early = 13.54, p < 0.01), and delayed treatment was associated with moderate/severe TBI (OR early = 0.09, p < 0.01). In patients undergoing ORIF, early treatment was associated with concomitant serious abdominal injury (OR early = 35.90, p = 0.01) and OR within 24 hours (OR early = 154.92, p < 0.01), and delayed treatment was associated with moderate/severe TBI (OR early = 0.10, p < 0.01), maxillary fractures (OR early = 0.14, p < 0.01), and concomitant serious head injury (OR early = 0.14, p < 0.01). In patients that received antibiotics, delays in initiation were associated with concomitant serious neck injury (OR early = 0.39, p = 0.04).

### A 162-case review of palatal fracture: management strategy from a 10-year experience [^114LtUrF]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Palatal fractures are frequently associated with Le Fort maxillary fractures in midfacial trauma. They may present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and result in malunion and occlusion problems if not treated properly.

Methods

In a retrospective study of 349 Le Fort maxillary fractures over 10 years, 162 patients were diagnosed with palatal fractures. The classification of fractures was based on the patterns observed on computed tomographic scans and treatment plan including type I, sagittal; type II, transverse; and type III, comminuted. Transverse palatal fractures were stabilized by standard Le Fort I buttresses and alveolar ridge fixation. Additional intermolar wiring fixation was applied for sagittal palatal fractures, and prolonged intermaxillary fixation with dental splinting was applied for comminuted palatal fractures.

Results

Palatal fractures accounted for 46.4 percent of Le Fort maxillary fractures in this study. Motorcycle accident (69.5 percent) was the most common trauma mechanism. In the type I group, all patients achieved satisfactory results except one patient who needed orthognathic surgery because of malocclusion. Thirteen patients required orthodontic treatment without additional surgical intervention. There were three fistula formations in the type III group that required palatal flaps for closure.

Conclusions

The high incidence of concomitant palatal fractures in midfacial trauma suggests the importance of accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate management. Results of this study show that intermolar wiring fixation is a much less time-consuming and more cost-effective method for satisfactory treatment of sagittal fractures of the palate. Simultaneously, a palatal flap for closure of a palatal defect is the key to avoiding fistula formation.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^112jn3hu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Closed, non-contaminated, operative facial fractures

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of closed, non-contaminated, operative facial fractures?

Recommendations: Non-contaminated, operative facial fractures do not require postoperative antibiotics.

Discussion: Fractures of the upper one-third of the face (including fractures of the frontal sinus that do not involve the posterior table), middle one-third of the face (including LeFort fractures, zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures, orbital fractures, maxillary sinus wall, and nasal bone fractures), and lower one-third of the face (non-dentate segments of the mandible) are considered non-contaminated fractures and have a lower frequency of postoperative infections. Therefore, continuing prophylactic antibiotics beyond 24 hours after surgical fixation is not recommended without documented infection. This is based on findings from multiple studies of mandibular and non-mandibular fractures that found no significant difference in infection rates between patients who received preoperative or postoperative antibiotics versus those who did not. In fact, one study concluded that a single dose of antibiotics at the time of induction (20 minutes before surgery) is sufficient. Soong et al conducted a non-blinded randomized study comparing 1 versus 5 days of postoperative antibiotic use after zygomatic or LeFort fracture repair and found no difference in infection rate between groups. The two more recent systematic reviews, one including 13 studies of mandibular and non-mandibular fractures, and the other mandibular fractures only, also found insufficient evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotics beyond 24 hours. In fact, the use of antibiotics for > 24 hours postoperatively is more costly and may lead to more antibiotic-associated complications.

### Multidetector CT of mandibular fractures, reductions, and complications: a clinically relevant primer for the radiologist [^113sv6am]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

After the nasal bones, the mandible is the second most common site of facial fractures, and mandibular fractures frequently require open reduction. In the trauma injury setting, multidetector computed tomography (CT) has become the cornerstone imaging modality for determining the most appropriate treatment management, fixation method, and surgical approach. Multidetector CT is also used to assess the adequacy of the reduction and evaluate potential complications in the postoperative period. For successful restoration of the mandible's form and function, as well as management of posttraumatic and postoperative complications, reconstructive surgeons are required to have a detailed understanding of mandibular biomechanics, occlusion, and anatomy. To provide added value in the diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up of mandibular fractures, radiologists should be aware of these concepts. Knowledge of the techniques commonly used to achieve occlusal and anatomic reduction and of the rationale behind the range of available treatment options for different injury patterns-from isolated and nondisplaced fractures to multisite and comminuted fractures-also is essential. This article focuses on the use of multidetector CT for pre- and postoperative evaluation of mandibular fractures and outlines fundamental concepts of diagnosis and management-beginning with an explanation of common fracture patterns and their biomechanical underpinnings, and followed by a review of the common postoperative appearances of these fractures after semirigid and rigid fixation procedures. Specific considerations regarding fractures in different regions of the tooth-bearing and non-tooth-bearing mandible and the unique issues pertaining to the edentulous atrophic mandible are reviewed, and key features that distinguish major from minor complications are described.

### Management of severe traumatic intrusion in the permanent dentition [^1154m7ci]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

Immediate management, under local anaesthetic delivered using buccal and palatal infiltrations, included debridement of soft tissue abrasions, surgical repositioning of both maxillary central incisor teeth with extraction forceps and provision of a titanium trauma splint bonded to all maxillary incisors (figure 5). No gross contamination of the wound was evident and thus antibiotic prescription was not administered. Following repositioning, no displacement of soft tissue was evident, the affected papillae were well approximated and suturing was not performed in this case. Suturing may benefit in case with detached papillae. Endodontic treatment of the teeth 11 and 21 was initiated 2 weeks following trauma. An interappointment non-setting calcium hydroxide dressing was provided to prevent the development of inflammatory (infection-related) external resorption. Seven weeks following trauma, the splint was removed and orthograde endodontic treatment was completed using gutta percha via the warm vertical condensation obturation technique (figure 6). While there was no evidence of complete alveolar fracture through both the palatal and the labial alveolar plates with a mobile alveolar segment, the positioning of the apices in relation to the labial bone suggested labial plate fracture, and at initial review, it was decided to extend splinting to a total of 7 weeks.

### Controversies in maxillofacial trauma [^1147qTZj]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Craniomaxillofacial trauma management has continued to improve and evolve as a result of advances in technology and scientific inquiry. Controversies exist where there is little evidence-based literature to guide treatment in frontal sinus management, rigid versus absorbable fixation, open versus closed treatment of mandibular condyle fractures, extraction of teeth in the line of fracture, optimal timing for repair of mandible fractures, antibiotic use for facial wounds and fractures, and reconstructive materials in orbital fracture reconstruction. This article reviews current literature to resolve some of the controversies, to improve patient care by reducing variability and uncertainty in the optimal management of facial trauma patients.

### Imaging of mandibular fractures: a pictorial review [^116GNtxW]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Mandibular fractures treatment

Surgical treatments are aimed to restore the anatomy and function of the mandible by immobilising and realigning the fractured bones. Therapeutic approaches range from non-invasive conservative management by "closed" reduction and immobilisation with intermaxillary fixations to "open" surgical reduction with internal fixations.

Numerous factors influence the treatment of mandibular fractures, including the location and degree of fragment displacements, patient's age/health, and surgeon's ability. In the "closed" (non-surgical) reduction, the bone fragments are realigned manually or by using traction devices without surgically exposing the fracture site. The open reduction surgery of mandibular fractures should first ensure the restoration of the occlusion of the mandible to prevent postoperative malocclusion, followed by stabilisation by means of rigid fixations such as plates, screws, and rigid intermaxillary blocks in order to minimise any nonunion, malunion, or delayed union of the fracture segments.

General indications for a "closed" reduction in mandibular fractures are as follows:
Paediatric fractures. An "open" reduction may damage developing dental gems or partially erupted teeth.
Coronoid process fractures. They are rarely treated, unless an impingement on the zygomatic arch is found.
Condylar process fractures. Their treatment is a controversial issue. The most appropriate choice is generally a conservative treatment, unless certain specific conditions mandatorily need an "open" treatment, such as condylar shifts into the middle cranial fossa or external auditory canal, failures in appropriate occlusion, extracapsular lateral dislocations of the condyle (Fig. 21), and infected open joint lesions.

### Postoperative CT of the mandible following trauma: review of normal appearances and common complications [^114FhPav]. Academic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Surgeons aim to restore occlusion and jaw function to baseline status for patients with mandibular fractures using either closed treatment or reduction and fixation.

Materials and Methods

Occlusion is defined as the relationship between the maxillary and mandibular teeth as they approach each other.

Results

Radiologists should be familiar with the goals of repair to help identify which treatment is adequate as well as to diagnose potential complications. Some of the more common complications encountered are infection, nonunion or malunion, and malocclusion.

Conclusion

We provide a comprehensive review of both the desired and untoward CT findings after surgical repair of traumatic mandibular injuries.

### Bone remodeling after surgical and non-surgical management of isolated zygomatic arch fractures [^1178hrrX]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The healing process of isolated zygomatic arch (ZA) fractures is not well understood. This study sought to investigate and compare bony remodeling outcomes following surgical and nonsurgical management of isolated ZA fractures. Through analysis of pre- and post-treatment computed tomography (CT) scans, we aimed to quantify the degree of fracture reduction over time.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study identified subjects presenting to the emergency room with acute isolated ZA fractures between 2011 and 2021 who had both initial post injury and subsequent CT scans of the face. Inclusion criteria required follow-up CT at least 6 months post-injury for nonsurgical patients and at least 1 month for surgical patients. Patients with no measurerable initial fracture displacement or any concurrent facial fractures were excluded. The independent variable was treatment approach (operative vs. nonoperative). The outcome variable was degree of fracture reduction between initial and follow-up CT imaging. Covariates collected included patient age, treatment (operative vs nonoperative) and time to follow-up CT. Bivariate statistical analysis conducted to compare fracture measurements between initial and follow-up, surgical and nonsurgical groups at a significance level of 0.05.

Results

Of 27 patients met study inclusion criteria, 11 (40.7%) underwent surgical reduction and 16 (59.3%) were treated conservatively. The median age at presentation was 48 (IQR 35–64) years old with an average fracture displacement of 0.43 ± 0.2 cm. Both surgical and nonsurgical patients demonstrated significant fracture reduction on follow-up CT (P < 0.001). In the nonsurgical cohort, the average initial fracture displacement was 0.30 ± 0.16 cm, and fracture reduction averaged 19.9% on follow-up (range 0%-41.7%). For the surgical cohort, the average initial fracture displacement was 0.60 ± 0.09 cm and fracture reduction averaged 63.6% (range 11.6%-100%) on follow-up. While the surgical group had a significantly greater degree of fracture reduction compared with the nonsurgical group (P < 0.001), there was no significant difference in final fracture displacement between surgical and nonsurgical groups (P = 0.4).

Conclusion

Bony remodeling occurs following both surgical and nonsurgical management, where comparable outcomes highlight the importance of thoughtful patient selection.

### Management of orbital fractures: challenges and solutions [^115usWmN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Pediatric considerations

Traumatic involvement of the frontal bone and superior orbital rim are more common in children, especially under age 5, due to the increased cranial vault to facial skeleton ratio. The vast majority of these fractures are treated with observation only. One possible issue that can arise is the "growing skull fracture", which is when the fracture site enlarges as the child grows. This potentially leads to a meningocele that can herniate into the orbit causing diplopia, pulsatile proptosis, and hypoglobus. Therefore, long-term follow-up with repeat CT scans is recommended.

It is important to emphasize that orbital greenstick "trapdoor" fractures with extraocular muscle entrapment are more common in children. This fracture is commonly known as the "white eye" orbital fracture (Figure 1). Urgent ophthalmology evaluation and CT imaging are recommended in cases of suspected pediatric orbital injury. Indications for surgical repair in children are essentially the same as in adults. However, children heal quickly; and muscle entrapment may result in fibrosis and shortening of the muscle within a couple days. Earlier intervention is recommended in children with evidence of entrapment, while in the absence of entrapment or immediate enophthalmos, the majority pediatric orbital fractures can be managed conservatively without surgical intervention. Pure orbital fractures in children are less likely to result in late enophthalmos. Surgical repair is not without risk of future problems due to growth and development. When surgery is indicated, the use of rigid implants may lead to orbitomalar growth restriction and maxillary hypoplasia. Many surgeons advocate for the use of split calvarial bone grafts in children younger than 7 years of age. However, as an alternative, resorbable alloplasts can be used successfully.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^1113HtTv]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Orbital fracture strabismus — timing for repair and observation is outlined as follows: Immediate repair is indicated for patients with CT or MR imaging evidence of an entrapped muscle or periorbital tissue associated with a nonresolving oculocardiac reflex; white-eyed blow-out fracture requires urgent repair; and globe subluxation into the maxillary sinus demands immediate surgical repair. Repair within 2 weeks includes symptomatic diplopia with positive forced ductions or entrapment on CT and minimal improvement over time that is best repaired within 1 to 2 weeks; large floor fractures, hypoglobus, and progressive infraorbital hypesthesia that are also best addressed within about 2 weeks; and early enophthalmos or hypoglobus causing facial asymmetry that are best addressed within about 2 weeks. Delayed repair (after 2 weeks) may benefit restrictive strabismus and unresolved enophthalmos, while observation may be considered in cases of minimal diplopia (not in primary or downgaze) with good ocular motility without significant enophthalmos or hypoglobus.

### Management of nasal bone fractures [^114j9rT8]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2005). Low credibility.

This review discusses treatment options for nasal fracture, a common condition due mainly to road accidents, sport injuries, and physical confrontations. Being frequently associated with multiple trauma, many broken noses are not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to secondary nasal deformities and chronic obstructions. A description of nasal anatomy is followed by considerations on the pathogenesis of nasal fracture and its clinical assessment. Each patient's history must be recorded (cause of trauma, previous facial injuries, prior nasal deformity, or obstruction) and careful physical examination guides the choice of treatment (open vs closed reduction), its timing, and the type of anesthesia required. Adequate follow-up is essential. Manipulation under local anesthesia is an effective first-line treatment for simple nasal fractures and should become a standard practice, but any associated septal injury can be responsible for postoperative nasal deformity and obstruction so other options may need to be considered.

### Practice patterns in the use of prophylactic antibiotics following nonoperative orbital fractures [^111weY81]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of posttraumatic orbital fractures diagnosed by emergency departments is estimated to be > 100,000 per year. Majority of these fractures are managed conservatively, without the need for surgical repair. At this time, however, there is no clear consensus on the role of antibiotics in nonoperative orbital fractures in the literature, and there are no standards to support prescribing prophylactic antibiotics in closed orbital fractures. Yet, many of the most commonly cited clinical references recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics. The Wills Eye Manual recommends broad spectrum prophylactic antibiotics and only later acknowledges a controversy in the use of prophylactic antibiotics:

The use of prophylactic antibiotics in orbital fracture is controversial. Antibiotics are recommended if the patient has a history of sinusitis, diabetes, or is otherwise immunocompromised. In all other patients, the decision about antibiotic use is left up to the treating physician.

Aside from recommending patients to avoid blowing their nose for several weeks after the orbital fracture and prescribing nasal decongestant spray, Joseph and Glavas noted: "Many physicians also use prophylactic antibiotics to prevent possible orbital cellulitis from bacterial spread if a fracture creates a direct orbital communication with the sinuses", in their 2011 Clinical Ophthalmology review article on orbital fractures. The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Illustrated Manual of Ophthalmology states that systemic antibiotics have been advocated by some authors. Theoretically, an orbital fracture allows direct communication between the maxillary or ethmoid sinuses and the orbit, allowing for bacteria to spread from the sinuses into the orbit and causing orbital cellulitis. However, in the absence of sinusitis, the sinuses are considered to be sterile, thus technically eliminating the risk of orbital cellulitis following an orbital fracture from this proposed mechanism.

### Pediatric-specific midfacial fracture patterns and management: pediatric versus adult patients [^111KZtst]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to compare the midfacial fracture patterns and management approaches between pediatric and adult patients.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 164 pediatric patients (< 16 years old) and 564 nongeriatric adult patients (16 to 65 years old) with midfacial fractures at a single institution between 2011 and 2016. The location of the fractures, along with the etiology and management of the midfacial fractures, were compared.

Results

Significantly greater proportions of pediatric versus adult patients had sports-related injuries (P < 0.001) and sustained nasal fractures (P < 0.001). On the other hand, significantly greater proportions of adult versus pediatric patients were injured in falls, traffic accidents, or assaults (P = 0.004, P < 0.001, and P = 0.002) and sustained maxillary or zygomatic fractures (P = 0.039 and P < 0.001). Bivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the risks of nasal, maxillary, and zygomatic fractures were significantly related to age status after adjusting for etiology (P < 0.001, P = 0.045, and P < 0.001). In contrast, the risks of hospitalization and surgical treatment were significantly associated with etiology, but not with age status (P = 0.290 and P = 0.847).

Conclusion

These data suggest that the age-related structure and composition of the facial skeleton affect the pediatric-specific fracture patterns independent of the etiology. The comparisons in this study may serve as a guide for the management of pediatric midfacial fractures.

### Computed tomography in traumatic orbital emergencies: a pictorial essay-imaging findings, tips, and report flowchart [^114iyLiy]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical management consists of the removal of displaced bone fragments and internal fixation of the fracture through the positioning of mesh materials to restore the original orbital volume and morphology (Fig. 1).

The integrity of the orbital floor is restored (white arrow); the soft tissue herniation is no longer present

Orbital floor fractures

The orbital floor BOF is the most common fracture and can occur alone (Fig. 2) or in combination with other facial fractures (approximately 50% of cases it is associated with the medial wall fracture). It is often characterized by bone fragments displaced into the maxillary sinus (Figs. 2, 3).

In the lower portion of the herniated tissue, a small hematoma is present (arrowhead). The medial rectus muscle (white asterisk) is swollen and partially entrapped in the fracture of the lamina papyracea (empty arrow)

The most prevalent cause of injury is direct anteroposterior blunt trauma to the globe and orbital boundaries. The potential mechanism for this sort of fracture has been proposed as hydraulic energy and buckling of the floor from impact to the inferior orbital edge.

Nasal fractures are the most frequently fractured facial bone from blunt facial trauma resulting in a significant number of patients seeking treatment. Proper evaluation and treatment in the acute setting can minimize secondary surgeries, lower overall health care costs, and increase patient satisfaction. Nasal fracture management, however, varies widely between surgeons. The open treatment of isolated nasal fractures is a particularly controversial subject. This review seeks to describe the existing literature in isolated nasal fracture management.

### Utility of prophylactic antibiotics in nonoperative facial fractures [^111TWBJk]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Facial fractures are commonly managed nonoperatively. Patients with facial fractures involving sinus cavities commonly receive 7 to 10 days of prophylactic antibiotics, yet no literature exists to support or refute this practice. The aim of this study was to compare the administration and duration of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of soft tissue infection in nonoperative facial fractures. A total number of 289 patients who were admitted to our level I trauma center with nonoperative facial fractures from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2014 were studied. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: no antibiotic prophylaxis, short-term antibiotic prophylaxis (1–5 days), and long-term antibiotic prophylaxis (> 5 days). The primary outcome was the incidence of facial soft tissue infection and Clostridium difficile colitis. Fifty patients received no antibiotic prophylaxis. Sixty-three patients completed a short course of antibiotic prophylaxis and 176 patients received long-term antibiotics. Ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a combination of both were used in 216 patients. Twenty-three patients received clindamycin due to penicillin allergy. Short and long courses of antibiotic prophylaxis were administered more commonly in patients with concomitant maxillary and orbital fractures (P < 0.0001). No mortality was found in any group. Soft tissue infection was not identified in any patient. C. difficile colitis was identified in 1 patient who had received a long course of antibiotic prophylaxis (P = 0.7246). There was no difference in the outcome of patients receiving short-term, long-term, and no antibiotic prophylaxis. Prospective randomized studies are needed to provide further clinical recommendations.

### Management of fractures of the nasofrontal complex [^113scgbQ]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Repair of fractures involving the nasofrontal region remains a mainstay of contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery. This article discusses the epidemiology of these injuries, anatomy of the area, and management of these fractures with insight into potential complications. These include fractures of the frontal sinus, naso-orbital-ethmoidal region, root of the nose, and associated adjacent structures.

### Advanced treatment and stabilization of nasal and septal fractures [^112cXvhY]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Nasal bone and nasal septal fractures are common facial traumas. The proper management of these injuries and their associated complications can both functionally improve nasal breathing and also lead to improved cosmetic outcomes. Closed reduction of these fractures can often be performed at bedside if within the appropriate time window; regardless of whether reduction is performed under local anesthesia, these patients can follow-up in clinic to discuss further management, which might include delayed septorhinoplasty in the operating room.

### Impact of injury mechanisms on patterns and management of facial fractures [^116f9pAr]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Mechanisms causing facial fractures have evolved over time and may be predictive of the types of injuries sustained. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of mechanisms of injury on the type and management of facial fractures at our Level 1 Trauma Center. The authors performed an Institutional Review Board-approved review of our network's trauma registry from 2006 to 2010, documenting age, sex, mechanism, Injury Severity Score, Glasgow Coma Scale, facial fracture patterns (nasal, maxillary/malar, orbital, mandible), and reconstructions. Mechanism rates were compared using a Pearson χ2 test. The database identified 23,318 patients, including 1686 patients with facial fractures and a subset of 1505 patients sustaining 2094 fractures by motor vehicle collision (MVC), fall, or assault. Nasal fractures were the most common injuries sustained by all mechanisms. MVCs were most likely to cause nasal and malar/maxillary fractures (P < 0.01). Falls were the least likely and assaults the most likely to cause mandible fractures (P < 0.001), the most common injury leading to surgical intervention (P < 0.001). Although not statistically significant, fractures sustained in MVCs were the most likely overall to undergo surgical intervention. Age, number of fractures, and alcohol level were statistically significant variables associated with operative management. Age and number of fractures sustained were associated with operative intervention. Although there is a statistically significant correlation between mechanism of injury and type of facial fracture sustained, none of the mechanisms evaluated herein are statistically associated with surgical intervention. Clinical Question/Level of Evidence: Therapeutic, III.

### Epidemiology of C2 fractures and determinants of surgical management: analysis of a national registry [^1157GE11]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

We used regression analysis and decision tree modeling to determine surgical versus non-operative management, as opposed to other studies that describe preferred treatment guidelines based on a review of the literature. Carvalho et al recommend surgical treatment for type III fractures with > 5 mm displacement and type II fractures with > 4 mm to 6 mm displacement and who are non-geriatric. Nourbakhsh and Hanson prefer conservative management for type I and III fractures regardless of age, and surgical management of type II fractures with > 4 mm displacement. Wagner et al take a more general approach and prefer surgical management of geriatric patients with odontoid type II fractures. Rizvi et al examined compliance with their recommendation to operate on younger patients with displaced odontoid type II fractures, older patients with type II fractures regardless of displacement, and all displaced type III fractures regardless of age; the non-compliance rate of 36% was largely driven by age, and the authors conclude that age should play a larger consideration in decision trees for treatment choice. Our findings agree with the aforementioned studies, that displacement of the odontoid fracture and the patients' age both play a role in whether surgical or non-operative management is preferred. The most favored age cut-off in our study was < 80 years old for odontoid type II fractures and < 85 years old for odontoid type I/III fractures, which is older than geriatric age in the aforementioned studies (often described as the 'old old' or octogenarians). Our analysis was more specific than prior studies because it modeled each fracture diagnosis separately and analyzed age continuously.

The gestalt that odontoid type II fractures are surgically managed, and hangman's fractures and odontoid type I/III fractures are non-operatively managed does not appear to be supported by our analysis, as seen in the overall surgical rates were 17.5% and 11.1%, respectively. Still, when comparing the decision trees for odontoid type II and type I/III fractures, the estimated surgical rates were approximately twofold higher for odontoid type II fractures compared with odontoid type I/III fractures in the old old cohort, 9.1% versus 3.8% surgery, and in the younger cohort, 24.9% versus 13.7% surgery; as well as in the younger cohort who had a displaced fracture, 29.3% versus 16.3% surgery.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^112jyPkJ]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Alveolar process

Alveolar process fractures are the most commonly observed pattern of maxillary fracture. Caused by direct force on the alveolar process or by indirect force from an impact on the teeth below through the base of the dental crown, these fractures must be treated with surgical debridement and prophylactic antibiotics to avoid bacterial infection from the oral cavity. Alveolar process fractures involve a risk of dental root avulsion, crown or root fracture (Fig. 15), dental intrusion or extrusion, and malocclusion. A tooth can also be aspirated into the airway, leading to pulmonary atelectasis.

### Le fort fractures with maxillary immobility: classification and the moment concept to rationalize optimal surgical treatment [^114m8G91]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Le Fort fractures with maxillary immobility are an uncommon presentation of facial trauma often associated with the disturbance of occlusion. Historically, cases involving high Le Fort fractures require a coronal extensive approach to mobilize the maxilla for occlusion restoration. Here, we review our institutional series of immobile Le Fort fractures and present their treatment approach, outcomes, classification, and then rationalize our treatment with a concept philosophy.

Materials and Methods

We treated 12 consecutive patients with unilateral and bilateral immobile Le Fort fractures from 2010 to 2017. The mean age was 27.1 years. Ten patients had a unilateral greenstick Le Fort III fracture. Five patients also had associated mandible fractures. Intraoperative occlusions could only be restored after Le Fort I osteotomy was performed on the side of the immobile Le Fort fracture. The mean follow-up period was 1.6 years.

Results

All patients presented good long-term occlusion restoration. There were no cases of nonunion or significant complications. None of the patients complained of any malar or periorbital cosmetic issues during follow-up sessions.

Conclusions

We presented an institutional series and classification of unusual Le Fort fractures with maxillary immobility, including a previously unreported fracture configuration of greenstick unilateral Le Fort III fractures combined with complete contralateral Le Fort I fracture. Based on our moment concept to rationalize treatment, as well as a systematic review of published literature, we advocate the judicious use of Le Fort I osteotomy to efficiently and safely treat these unusual fractures.

### Management of severe traumatic intrusion in the permanent dentition [^116pjMvK]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Investigations

On assessment 36 hours following trauma, relevant clinical findings included abrasions to the upper lip, haematoma around the gingival sulcus in the maxillary central incisor region and the crowns of both maxillary central incisor teeth (11 and 21) appeared apically displaced into the maxillary alveolus with incisal edges partially visible (figure 1). The apices of the maxillary central incisors could be palpated during the extra-oral examination at the nasal sill. Initial pulp sensibility, percussion and mobility of adjacent teeth (maxillary lateral incisors, canines and mandibular incisors) were unremarkable, while the traumatised maxillary central incisors gave negative thermal responses and positive tenderness to percussion. Given the extent of the intrusion and the completed root development, it was accepted that pulp necrosis would occur in both maxillary central incisors.

Radiographic examination with intra-oral and extra-oral films — periapical, maxillary occlusal and OPG views, corroborated the clinical findings that teeth 11 and 21 were intruded by 9 mm (figures 2–4).

### Analysis of readmission and complications after repair of orbital fractures using California's office of statewide health planning and development database [^111FF7Dh]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Orbital fractures represent one of the most common trauma-related facial fractures and may present with a variety of concomitant injuries. Many factors including age, associated diagnoses, and fracture complications are important in determining surgical candidacy. We used a statewide database to determine the prevalence of orbital fractures, rates of surgical repair during initial admission, and early patient outcomes.

Methods

A longitudinal analysis of patients with orbital fracture was performed using California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development patient discharge database for admissions occurring between January 2015 and December 2018. Patients were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. The primary risk factor was surgical management of orbital fractures. The primary outcomes of interest were readmission requiring surgical management and complications of the fracture. Survival models were developed to evaluate the risk of a repair at readmission adjusting for relevant covariates.

Results

Of the 67,408 facial fractures included in our study, 8.7% (n = 5872) were diagnosed with orbital fractures. Among this population, 18.4% (n = 1082) underwent surgical repair during their initial admission. Patients were primarily male (71.1%; n = 4,173) and presented in a nonurgent fashion (93.7%; n = 5501). Less than half (42.8%) of patients with an urgent presentation and 16.8% of patients with a nonurgent presentation underwent repair. Centers of Medicaid & Medicare Services guidelines dictated presentation classification. Repair was associated with a significantly higher survival outcome. Orbital fractures were more frequently repaired in the setting of concomitant zygomatic, nasal, and LeFort I-III fractures. Increased risk in complications was observed in all concomitant fracture groups, and there existed a decreased risk of postsurgical complications in these same cohorts.

Conclusions

Although most orbital fractures were managed nonoperatively, our analysis found that rates of repair for orbital floor, maxillary, and zygomatic fractures were greater than for other facial fractures. Concomitant fractures were associated with an increased hazard ratio for complications. Although low in prevalence overall, the most often observed postoperative complications in this population were diplopia, glaucoma, and blindness/low vision.

### Factors associated with delays in medical and surgical open facial fracture management [^116PheZp]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Variables collected on all patients included demographics (age, sex), injury mechanism (assault/stab/gunshot, motor vehicle/bicycle collision, fall, other), presence and severity (Abbreviated Injury Score, AIS) of non-facial injuries, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, hospital length of stay (HLOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission and LOS, emergency department (ED) discharge destination, total number of open facial fractures, open facial fracture location (mandible, nasal, maxillary, orbital, zygomas, frontal bone), Gustilo-Anderson type of all open facial fractures, trips to the operating room (OR), intubation, and tracheostomy. The following information about facial fracture management was collected: I&D, irrigations without debridement, ORIF, and prophylactic antibiotics. Fracture management was classified as early versus late in the following manner: for I&D, irrigation without debridement, and ORIF, treatment within 24 hours of hospital arrival versus later; previous studies have found no significant associations between delayed surgical management and infection in open facial fractures when a delay was defined as > 48 hoursor > 72 hours, and therefore 24 hours was chosen as a more stringent threshold for evaluation here. Early initiation of prophylactic antibiotics was defined as within 1 hour of hospital arrival, in accordance with EAST and TQIP guidelines for open fractures. Infection was defined as a patient having an infection listed in the complication variable in the trauma registry — to qualify for documentation in the trauma registry as an infection, the patient must have at least one of the following: (1) purulent drainage from the incision; (2) dehiscence of the incision wound (spontaneous or surgeon-inflicted) with organisms present identified either by culture or microbiologic testing and at least one of the following signs of symptoms: (a) fever (> 38°C) or (b) localized pain or tenderness; or (3) an abscess or other evidence of infection of the incision detected on gross anatomic or histopathologic examination or imaging test — and a diagnosis of infection documented in the chart by the patient's physician, which was confirmed by manual chart review by clinical research coordinators that was conducted on all patients with an infection complication in the trauma registry.

Abstract

Spontaneous fracture of the maxillary sinus without preceding trauma or pathology is extremely rare. Our patient presented with a maxillary sinus fracture related to recurrent nose-blowing, in the absence of any other cause. Although rare, spontaneous fracture of maxillary sinus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pain and swelling of the cheek and eye in elderly patients.

Non-operative facial fractures

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of non-operative facial fractures?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics should not be administered for closed, non-operative orbital, upper face, mid-face, or mandibular fractures.

Discussion: The SIS recommends against the use of prophylactic antibiotics for non-operative facial fractures based on the results of two small retrospective studiesand one small single-center randomized study. The study by Malekpour et al compared no antibiotics to a short course (1–5 days) or a long course (> 5 days) of antibiotics on the incidence of facial soft tissue infection or Clostridium difficile colitis. There were no soft tissue infections in any group. Mandibular and open fractures were excluded, limiting extrapolation to these groups. The study by Zosa et al included 403 patients and compared a short course (single dose or no antibiotics) to extended course (> 24 hours) and found no difference in infection rate between treatment groups (3% vs. 5%).

### A new classification of palatal fracture and an algorithm to establish a treatment plan [^112Jc9fr]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Palatal fractures have previously been classified according to the anatomic location of the fracture line, which is helpful for understanding the types of palatal fracture, but which is insufficient for helping the surgeon to decide which fracture to open and how to do so. The purpose of this study was to aid in the establishment of a precise treatment plan by determining the surgical approach and the types of stabilization that should be used for different types of palatal fracture. In a retrospective review of 136 consecutive Le Fort maxillary fractures over 6 years, 18 patients (13.2 percent) with palatal fractures were analyzed. The principle of open reduction and internal fixation was applied to all the patients. In six patients (33 percent), exploration and fixation was done in the palatal surface. Eight patients (44 percent) needed an extended period of immobilization (4 to 6 weeks). No major complications were observed during the follow-up period. An algorithm was devised to help establish a proper treatment plan, and palatal fractures were classified into four types: closed reduction, anterior treatment, anterior and palatal treatment, and combined. The key elements considered in deciding the treatment principle and the classification of a palatal fracture were the possibility of closed reduction, surgical exposure, site of rigid fixation, and stability of fractured segments after rigid fixation. The outcome of reconstruction and the postoperative course differed depending on the type of palatal fracture. This classification scheme provided an easy and simple way to establish a treatment plan and was helpful in learning the treatment principles of palatal fracture.

We present the case of a 53-year-old man who was involved in a motor vehicle accident. A maxillofacial computed tomography scan revealed a large tumor of the left maxilla as well as multiple facial fractures. The tumor extended from the palate to the orbital floor and from the medial to the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. We describe the surgical approach as well as the operative management of incidental fibrous dysplasia of the maxilla in a patient with facial fractures.

### Facial fractures [^114Bsfea]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After reading this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Demonstrate an understanding of some of the changes in aspects of facial fracture management. 2. Assess a patient presenting with facial fractures. 3. Understand indications and timing of surgery. 4. Recognize exposures of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton. 5. Identify methods for repair of typical facial fracture patterns. 6. Discuss the common complications seen with facial fractures.

Summary

Restoration of the facial skeleton and associated soft tissues after trauma involves accurate clinical and radiologic assessment to effectively plan a management approach for these injuries. When surgical intervention is necessary, timing, exposure, sequencing, and execution of repair are all integral to achieving the best long-term outcomes for these patients.

### Assessment of maxillofacial trauma in emergency department [^111icoNs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

MF trauma management is sometimes challenging in emergency room. Knowing the MF trauma presentations, concomitant non facial injuries and TBI patterns are important for emergent management. To our knowledge common literature lacks studies from ED. We believe for MF trauma epidemiology, ED study results are more reliable in the light of information above. Further studies are needed to improve our hypothesis.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^113QKFuu]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many patients seen in emergency departments have facial trauma. In these patients, major findings may go undetected due to multiple trauma, clinicians' inability to perform a thorough physical examination, patients' inability to cooperate, and pronounced facial swelling; thus, facial injuries can be challenging for trauma surgeons.

Most patients with facial trauma are male (56.8–92.8%), and the mean age in reported series ranges from 24.6 to 51.0 years. The most common causes of facial injury are assault (44–61%), traffic accidents (15.8%), and falls (15%). In patients who require surgery, the most commonly fractured bone is the mandible (41.6–75.2%). The second and third most commonly fractured bones vary with the series, being the maxilla and orbit (39.8% each) in one series but the malar bone (15.2%) and maxilla (6.4%) in another. In all emergency department patients (those who require surgery and those who do not), closed nasal bone fractures are the most common, being found in 30.1% to 55.8%.

Although some authors affirm that appropriate physical examination of the face reliably rules out fractures in some patients (as low impact trauma ones) and some clinical variables are associated with facial fractures, physical examination alone cannot classify facial injuries. In other patients like such with polytrauma is widely known that even that physical exam does not rule out fractures because of distracting injuries, obtundation, or facial swelling. Thus, imaging is critical for surgeons to understand which anatomic structures are involved so they can plan the surgical approach and intraoperative technique.

It is essential to know the typical patterns and classifications of facial fractures, including those of the zygomaticomaxillary complex and naso-orbito-ethmoidal complex, because each pattern is often associated with particular functional and esthetic complications. There are also specific terms to classify the location of mandibular and orbital fractures. Radiologists' interpretations of CT scans are important for planning surgery in patients with facial trauma. To ensure efficient communication with surgeons, radiology reports should use the anatomic descriptors and classification schemes that surgeons are familiar with; otherwise, surgeons may choose to rely on their own interpretation of the images. However, an important obstacle in the management of facial trauma is that only low level evidence supports current recommendations.

### Computed tomography in traumatic orbital emergencies: a pictorial essay-imaging findings, tips, and report flowchart [^115dsfLq]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Orbital floor fractures can be complicated by the intraorbital fat herniation towards the maxillary sinus, and entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle (Figs. 3, 4). The extent of the transverse fracture and the presence of soft tissue herniation on CT can help predict the development of chronic diplopia, and the need for surgical repair.

Fig. 4
Coronal CT reconstruction with bone (a) and soft tissues (b) algorithms in a patient with a current fracture of the right orbital medial wall (white arrow) and a previous fracture of the contralateral orbital medial wall (empty arrow). a Huge bone defect of the right lamina papyracea (white asterisk). On the left side, discontinuation of the lamina papyracea caused by a previous fracture is visible, as well as the herniation of the intraorbital fat tissue into the ethmoidal cells (empty arrow). b The medial rectus is thickened and partially displaced through the bone defect (arrow). The left medial rectus muscle shows regular site and morphology (empty arrow)

A particular type of orbital floor BOFs is represented by the trapdoor fracture, which usually occurs in children and toddlers due to the distensibility of immature facial bones. In this type of fracture, the inferior rectus muscle and/or intraorbital fat prolapse through the fracture defect into the underlying maxillary sinus, and the fracture bony fragment springs back into place, acting like a trapdoor. These patients present with limitations in the supraduction of the globe, resulting in diplopia, and often show signs of oculocardiac reflex: bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting. This fracture is also known as "white-eye blow-out fracture". On coronal CT reconstructions, the inferior rectus muscle or the intraorbital fat herniates through a non-displaced inferior orbital wall fracture.

Tips: assess the presence of the herniation of the intraorbital fat and/or inferior rectus muscle through the bone defect.

Remember to check the integrity of the inferomedial orbital strut, a bony thickening that extends from the maxillary to the ethmoid bone, whose anterior part represents an attachment site for the suspensory ligaments. The fracture involvement of the inferomedial orbital strut increases the difficulty of surgical repair, with the risk of globe malposition and eye movement impairment.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^1175wUSv]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

It is essential to use shared terminology to refer to the pattern of facial fractures in radiology reports. Descriptors such as naso-orbito-ethmoidal complex, zygomaticomaxillary complex, and orbital "blowout" can be extremely useful for surgeons, so they should be used when possible. Surgeons require information about the anatomic landmarks and features of the fracture such as the degree of displacement and comminution so they can plan treatment and predict possible complications.

### Closed head injury combined with orbital blowout fracture and displacement of the eyeball into the maxillary sinus in a 14-year-old boy: a case report [^115s2uvg]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, surgeries performed at a later stage are associated with pronounced fibrosis within the orbit, making it more susceptible to scar adhesions. This, in turn, leads to limitations in postoperative eye movement and persistent diplopia. It is essential to acknowledge that the patient in this study experienced traumatic optic neuropathy (TON). A study suggests that TON occurs in 0.5–7% of head injury cases. Apart from increased intracranial pressure, periorbital tissue oedema compressing the optic nerve, and damage to orbital vessels causing optic nerve ischaemia, the traction on the optic nerve induced by the displacement of the eyeball is also a significant factor. Therefore, an early surgical intervention to restore eyeball position, alleviate entrapment of extraocular muscles or the eyeball to restore blood supply, and mitigate periorbital tissue oedema to prevent optic nerve compression or atrophy is paramount for patients with these conditions.

In this case, we prioritised the patient's overall well-being and promptly scheduled surgery for eyeball repositioning and orbital reconstruction. Using transconjunctival access, we reached the fracture plane, removed fragmented bone pieces, expanded the fracture hole, and carefully pulled the eyeball back to its original position after reducing resistance. This approach was crucial to minimize the substantial risk of inducing secondary damage during the traction procedure. At the 12-month follow-up, the patient achieved a visual acuity of 20/200. Despite limited eye movement, the overall outcome was deemed satisfactory.

### Displaced midshaft clavicle fractures in adults-is non-operative management enough? [^114YhdWC]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Displaced fractures of middle third of clavicle are traditionally managed non-operatively. Recently, the trend is towards surgical management considering functional deficits in some of the non-operatively managed patients. The purpose of the study was to examine the functional outcome of non-operative treatment in these injuries, while identifying the factors responsible for less than ideal outcome and determine the guidelines for patient counselling.

Patients and Methods

One hundred patients with displaced fractures of middle third of clavicle were prospectively evaluated clinico-radiologically for one year from injury. Risk factors for non-union were determined using Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression was used to identify factors contributing to functional outcome. Threshold values for the radiological displacements were estimated with the smooth threshold regression using the logistic transition function.

Results

Ninety-four out of 100 fractures united. The factors associated with non-union were: smoking, diabetes and poor soft tissue condition over the fracture. Ninety-two out of 94 patients who had their fractures united achieved "good" (Constant Score above 70) or "very good" (Constant Score above 85) functional outcome at one year, out of which only 49 belonged to "very good" category. The most important factors influencing functional outcome were fracture angulation and clavicular shortening. From the model, it was estimated that with one unit increase in degree of angulation or 1 mm increase in shortening, the odds of scoring above 85 reduces by around 14%. Based on this, an equation and a probability calculator were developed from which the probability of achieving a Constant Score above 85 can be calculated. Threshold analysis yielded 22.8° for angulation and 16.8 mm for shortening at which the probability of achieving "very good" function is only 0.23.

Conclusion

Displaced midshaft clavicular fractures with the intent of achieving "good" outcome must be managed non-operatively. If the patient expectation is not to accept even minor functional deficits, the treatment objective must be raised to achieve a minimum Constant score of 86. Substituting the radiological displacements in the equation, the probability of the patient achieving this objective can be calculated. Non-operative management is offered if this probability figure is acceptable to the patient, otherwise counselled for surgery. Non-operatively managed patients with coexisting diabetes, smoking or poor soft tissue condition must be watched for the possibility of going for non-union.

### Utility of antibiotic use in pediatric facial fractures: a systematic review [^113AS1Fn]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: In regard to antibiotic stewardship, it is important to understand the appropriate time to prescribe antibiotics in pediatric facial fracture management. Objective: To evaluate the utility of antibiotics in pediatric facial fractures and determine situational variables influencing appropriate antibiotic prescription. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for articles published from 2000 to 2022. Inclusion criteria consisted of all studies assessing pediatric facial fractures that mentioned antibiotic use. Results: A total of 13 studies were included in the full review. The reviewed studies comprised 31 pediatric patients ranging from 6 months to 18 years old. Most studies were case reports and case series (N = 9). Antibiotics were prescribed for the majority (96.7%) of patients. Antibiotic regimens varied by timing of administration, antibiotic used, and dosage. Fracture locations also varied widely, including orbital, zygomatic, nasal, mandibular, and maxillary fractures. Conclusions: Additional studies with more substantial evidence are needed to fully understand the situational appropriateness of antibiotic use in pediatric facial fractures.

### Maxillary MRSA osteomyelitis in a paediatric patient: non-surgical management [^111ntnFf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) osteomyelitis of the maxilla is a rare condition in paediatric patients, with limited evidence available for optimal treatment protocols. We present the case of a paediatric patient in the early childhood age group with post-traumatic maxillary osteomyelitis caused by MRSA. The child developed facial swelling following trauma, and imaging revealed maxillary sinus wall thickening and bone erosions. After initial treatment with analgesics, the swelling persisted, leading to surgical intervention and microbiological analysis confirming MRSA infection. The patient was treated with intravenous linezolid and amikacin for 5days, followed by 8weeks of oral linezolid. One year post-treatment, the child remained healthy with no recurrence. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, tailored antibiotic therapy and conservative surgical management to ensure positive outcomes in paediatric maxillary osteomyelitis cases. Further research is needed to establish standardised treatment protocols for facial osteomyelitis in children.

### Passive repositioning of maxillary fractures: an occasional impossibility without osteotomy [^114BHyCp]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present cases where passive repositioning of maxillary fractures was not achievable during surgery, and a method to provide passive occlusal positioning in those cases.

Patients and Methods

Over a 10-year period, the maxillae of 24 patients with fractures of the maxilla could not be passively repositioned during surgery. In these cases, a Le Fort I osteotomy was performed in addition to reduction and fixation of the other midfacial fractures.

Results

All patients had passive restoration of their pretrauma occlusion during surgery. All patients except 1 had maintenance of their pretrauma occlusion at the last follow-up visit (6 weeks or more) following surgery.

Conclusion

When passive positioning of the maxilla is not possible, a concomitant Le Fort I osteotomy can provide passive positioning of the occlusion.

### Facial fractures and mixed dentition-what are the implications of dentition status in pediatric facial fracture management? [^11422R3W]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The stage of maturation of the pediatric facial skeleton at the time of injury has a significant impact on both facial fracture patterns and management strategies. For instance, the relative prominence of the pediatric cranium during the early years of life affords protection to the structures of the midface, whereas delayed aeration of the frontal sinuses may predispose younger patients to frontal bone fractures. The dentition status of a pediatric patient may have similar implications in the setting of facial fracture. In this study, the authors examine the effect of dentition status on facial fracture patterns and management strategies at an urban, level 1 trauma center.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed for all cases of facial fracture occurring in the pediatric patient population at a level 1 trauma center (University Hospital in Newark, NJ) between 2002 and 2014. A database including patient demographics, facial fracture, and concomitant injury patterns, and operative management data was constructed and analyzed.

Results

A total of 72 patients with mixed dentition met inclusion criteria for our study and were compared against patients with primary (n = 35) and permanent (n = 349) dentition. The mean age at presentation was 9.2years, with a male predominance of 68%. The most common fracture etiology was pedestrian struck accident (n = 23), fall (n = 21), motor vehicle collision (n = 12), and assault (n = 9). The most frequently identified facial fractures were that of the orbit (n = 31), mandible (n = 21), nasal bone (n = 19), and frontal sinus (n = 14). Additionally, 8 Le Fort and 4 nasoorbitoethmoid fractures were identified. Twenty-one patients (29%) required operative management for 1 or more facial fractures. Operative intervention was required in 38% of mandibular fractures, with 6 patients requiring only maxillomandibular fixation and 2 requiring open reduction and internal fixation with titanium plating. Nine cases of orbital fracture (29%) were managed operatively - 4 with absorbable plates, 3 with Medpor implants, and 8 with titanium plating. Management of all nasal fractures requiring operative intervention was accomplished through closed reduction. Concomitant injuries included traumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 35), skull fracture (n = 24), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (n = 20), and long bone fracture (n = 12). Seventeen patients required admission to the intensive care unit. Patients with mixed dentition were significantly more likely to sustain frontal sinus and Le Fort fractures (P < 0.01), as well as skull fracture, ICH, and TBI (P < 0.01) as compared to those with permanent dentition.

Conclusions

The dentition status of a pediatric patient may have significant implications in both patterns of injury and operative management strategies in the setting of acute facial trauma. Our study finds that Le Fort and frontal sinus fractures were significantly more common in patients with mixed dentition. Severe concomitant injuries such as ICH and TBI were also significantly more likely in this cohort. A patient's dentition status may also play a role in the decision for ridged fixation of mandibular and orbital fractures, as well as the method of maxillomandibular fixation in maxillary and mandibular alveolar fracture.

### A protocol for the management of maxillofacial injuries in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic [^116GU5pu]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

The oral & maxillofacial region and by that virtue surgery of the same is correlated to an increased risk of the transfer of the SARS CoV-2. In times of a pandemic it is imperative to institute a protocol based management of maxillofacial injuries based on currently available literature which is suggestive, simplistic, executable and amenable to modifications should the rapidly changing situation demand the same. The author, in the present study conducted a review of literature to undertake the task of forming a simplistic protocol which is readily applicable for the management of maxillofacial injuries which would not only provide the clinician guidance on what to do now but caution towards the future implications of his/her present decision.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^116E2TER]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clavicle fractures guideline — non-modifiable risk factors (age and sex) states that the non-modifiable risk factors age and sex do not predict patient reported functional outcomes following mid shaft clavicle fracture regardless of treatment modality, with Quality of Evidence: Low and Strength of Option: Limited. Option statements are used when low quality evidence, no evidence, or conflicting supporting evidence exist. Nonmodifiable factors do not seem to affect patient reported outcomes; therefore there is no significant benefit or harm of this recommendation, and outcome does not go against standard of care. Surgical treatment of clavicle fracture is the preferred treatment in majority of significantly displaced fractures, while non-operative management could be a reasonable option in high-risk patients. This recommendation does not have any effect on the financial aspect of clavicle fracture treatment, and fracture treatment should be acceptable as it does not change the current standard of care.

### Pediatric nasal fractures: evaluation and management [^1123jUZ2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Nasal fractures have been reported as 1 of the 3 most commonly encountered pediatric facial bone fractures. The most common causes of nasal fractures in this age group are auto accidents (40%), sports injuries (25%), intended injuries (15%), and home injuries (10%). Nasal fractures are usually treated with closed reduction (Higuera S, Lee EI, Stal S. Nasal trauma and the deviated nose. Plast Reconstr Surg 2007;120:64S-75S). This results in a significant incidence of posttraumatic deformities, often requiring secondary surgical treatment. For this reason, it is paramount to pay careful attention to the underlying structural nasal anatomy during the initial diagnosis and management.

### Treatment of nasal fractures by paul of aegina [^112PQ1hj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The most exact description of the management of nasal fractures given by any physician of ancient times belongs to Paul of Aegina (AD 625–690). The goal of this article is to describe the therapeutic methods and surgical techniques used by Paul of Aegina in the treatment of nasal injuries.

Study Design

We studied the original Greek texts and the translation published in Venice, titled "The seven books of excellent doctor Paul of Aegina". The sixth book of his medical compendium is devoted to surgery. We identified the treatments and techniques applied to the restoration of injured noses.

Conclusion

In this historical article we present the management of nasal fractures by Paul of Aegina. Paul of Aegina's conservative and surgical management for each form of injury was adopted by later physicians and influenced European medicine, a management surprisingly identical with the way nasal fractures are managed nowadays.

### Management of acute nasal fractures [^111fmzxV]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

In cases of facial trauma, nasal fractures account for approximately 40 percent of bone injuries. Treatment in the primary care setting begins with evaluating the injury, taking an accurate history of the situation in which the injury occurred, and ascertaining how the face and nose appeared and functioned before the injury occurred. Serious injuries should be treated, then nasal inspection and palpation may be performed to assess for airway patency, mucosal laceration, and septal deformity. A thorough examination of the nose and surrounding structures, including the orbits, mandible, and cervical spine, should be completed. Imaging studies are necessary for facial or mandibular fractures. Patients with septal hematomas, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, malocclusion, or extraocular movement defects should be referred to a subspecialist. Treatment in the primary care setting consists of evaluation, pain and infection management, minimal debridement and, when the physician is appropriately trained, closed reduction. If an immediate referral is not indicated, close follow-up, possibly with a subspecialist, should be arranged within three to five days after the injury.

### Maxillofacial and neck trauma: a damage control approach [^116k7ANr]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Initial management considerations in maxillofacial trauma

Once a definitive airway is established, active bleeding may be controlled using nasal packs, oropharyngeal packs and a pressure dressing wrapped around the head in cases of profuse bleeding. Epistaxis is often encountered in maxillofacial trauma and is usually managed by primary compression using tamponades. The goal is to slow down blood loss to a level that it can be replaced by blood products, and allow the patient to be fully assessed and stabilized before being transferred to the operating theatre. Patients with suspected ocular injuries should not have compression dressings applied, pending exclusion of globe rupture and penetrating ocular injuries. Mandibular fractures are bandaged in proper maxillo-mandibular occlusal relations for stabilization. Wiring of the teeth together compromises the airway and should usually be avoided. Avulsed teeth and loose bone fragments should be discarded, as should loose dentoalveolar fragments suspended in the airway, to prevent aspiration of loose dentition or bone fragments. Complete avulsion of the ears, nose and lips cannot usually be reattached without readily available microvascular surgery. Partially avulsed structures should be maintained and kept under proper conditions for a later attempt at reconstruction. Parotid gland and duct and facial nerve branches should also be cautiously cleaned, packed open and preserved for later inspection and repair. Facial lacerations should also be cleaned and packed for later closure. Reduction and fixation of craniofacial fractures often represents the best treatment of hemorrhage. Hemorrhage control must be performed aggressively, while judiciously making every effort to prevent further injury of the supraclavicular nervous system (brain and cervical spine), the eyes and other anatomical structures (major blood vessels, cranial nerves, salivary glands etc.) frequently involved in maxillofacial and neck injuries. Severe cases of hemorrhage in which localized pressure does not achieve hemostasis may be remedied with open surgical hemostasis with vascular ligation, bipolar electrocoagulation or using angiographic embolization. Definitive maxillofacial surgery in patients who have undergone temporary fracture stabilization and soft tissue management may be deferred for 7–10 days after the injury. No compromise of functional and esthetic results and no increased risk of postoperative infection and other complications were noted in such patients. Some maxillofacial injuries, however, warrant immediate attention and must be addressed during initial patient care. These injuries may be defined as "maxillofacial medical emergencies" and include unstoppable bleeding from fractures which require immediate reduction and osteosynthesis and intraorbital or intracranial damage to the optic nerve, which necessitates therapeutic action within a few hours. Retrobulbar hematomas, elevated intra-ocular pressure and direct compression of the optic nerve with secondary vision deterioration may necessitate the immediate administration of corticosteroids in high doses over 48 h and/or immediate decompression of the optic nerve.

### Retrospective clinical study of maxillary sagittal fractures: predictors of postoperative outcome [^111fj9mB]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Because of less attention to the sagittal component of maxillary fractures, these fractures are often misdiagnosed or the reduction is missed leading to maxillary transverse discrepancies. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with good or adverse postoperative outcomes of maxillary sagittal fractures.

Materials and Methods

This study was a single-center retrospective cohort study. The sample was composed of cases of maxillary sagittal fractures treated at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Craniomaxillofacial Trauma Unit of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Xi'an, China) from January 2008 through December 2013. The predictor variables were age, gender, occupation, cause of injury, injury severity, treatment timing, treatment method, and quality of fracture reduction. The outcome variable was the postoperative treatment effect index. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were computed. The P value was set to .05.

Results

The sample was composed of 40 cases. The male-to-female ratio was 4:1; the most vulnerable age group was 20 to 30 years (30%); laborers (72.5%) were more prone to injury; and the main cause of injury was motor vehicle accident (62.5%). No cases of isolated sagittal fracture were found and most (35%) occurred with other maxillary fractures, including Le Fort fractures. A statistically significant association between treatment timing and quality of fracture reduction and the postoperative treatment effect index (P < .05) was found.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that better results are achieved when fractured bone is treated sooner. Anatomic repositioning of the fractured bone is the important predictor for good postoperative outcomes.

### Aesthetic management of the nasal component of naso-orbital ethmoid fractures [^115eBz19]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Discuss the critical anatomic structures of the nose that are affected in naso-orbital ethmoid fractures. 2. Discuss the advantages of early, complete nasal reconstruction of these fractures. 3. Apply a clinical algorithm to such nasal reconstruction. 4. List the techniques used in aesthetic reconstruction of the nose in naso-orbital ethmoid fractures.

Background

Fractures of the naso-orbital ethmoid complex pose challenging management issues. Although basic treatment principles have been well described, the aesthetic management of the nasal component has not been adequately addressed in the literature.

Methods

When secondary nasal deformities occur, they are difficult to correct. Optimal primary correction of the nasal deformity is accomplished using the following four principles: (1) rigid fixation of the nasal pyramid and restoration of nasal height and length; (2) restoration of tip projection; (3) septal reduction/reconstruction; and (4) lateral nasal wall augmentation.

Results

Successful management of naso-orbital ethmoid fractures is a complex and challenging task. Both the bony and soft-tissue components must be addressed and the extent of the injury must be adequately diagnosed to avoid omission of critical steps in the reconstruction. Inadequate treatment of naso-orbital ethmoid fractures can produce a severe cosmetic deformity that is very difficult to correct secondarily.

Conclusion

The authors discuss the nasal component of naso-orbital ethmoid complex injuries and detail the key principles in their algorithm for aesthetic nasal reconstruction.

### Isolated fractures of the posterior maxillary sinus: CT appearance and proposed mechanism [^112aGPNk]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

A heretofore unreported type of facial fracture is discussed. Twenty-two cases of posterior maxillary wall fracture are reviewed, of which 59% demonstrated concomitant mandibular fracture. The proposed mechanism for this injury is an impact from the ipsilateral mandibular coronoid process striking the posterior maxillary wall, with associated mandibular dislocation or fracture. As such, further investigation of the mandible may be warranted when this type of maxillary wall fracture is encountered to exclude concomitant injury.

### Factors associated with delays in medical and surgical open facial fracture management [^116JBmjp]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

In this study, which hypothesized that non-facial injuries would be associated with delayed facial fracture management and investigated multiple facets of open facial fracture management — prophylactic antibiotics, I&D, irrigation without debridement, and ORIF — serious injuries to non-facial regions led to delays in surgical but not medical fracture management, likely because facial fracture management was lower priority than other emergency treatments and/or stabilization efforts. However, in most cases, if the patient went to the OR within 24 hours of hospital arrival for any reason, facial fracture management was undertaken during that trip. This study is unique in investigating factors associated with delays in both medical and surgical open facial fracture management, reporting on a large spectrum of fracture management in patients with open facial fractures.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^1136g1mP]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The outer cardinal lines are composed of the frontal and zygomatic bone processes as well as the maxilla inferiorly. Generally, these outer lines are repaired first in complex injuries and provide the foundation upon which the more central naso-orbito-ethmoidal region can be reconstructed.

The most important point for classification is the displacement and/or comminution of the central fragment of the medial orbital wall, where the medial canthal tendon inserts. Multidetector CT cannot depict the medial canthal tendon itself, but reporting the degree of comminution of the medial orbital wall at the level of the lacrimal fossa can help surgeons plan repair of the tendon.

It is also important to report the degree of comminution of the nasal bones, frontal processes of the maxilla, and nasal processes of the frontal bones to help surgeons decide whether bone grafting is required.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^111aVV9T]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Key points

Radiologists should know anatomical classifications expressed as struts/buttresses and thirds as is the nomenclature used by many surgeons.
Merely listing fractured bones in the report is useless for surgeons.
Reports should focus on critical structures affected because of possible complications.
Displacement and comminution determine the need for surgery, bone grafting, etc.

Distal radius fracture — indications for fixation (non-geriatric patients) state that "Moderate evidence supports that for non-geriatric patients (most commonly defined in studies as under 65 years of age), operative treatment for fractures with post reduction radial shortening > 3mm, dorsal tilt > 10 degrees, or intraarticular displacement or step off > 2 mm leads to improved radiographic and patient reported outcomes", with "Strength of Recommendation: Moderate". The guideline is based on "1 high quality study, and 26 moderate quality studies" using thresholds of "radial shortening > 3mm, dorsal tilt > 10, or intra-articular displacement or step-off > 2mm" in patients "less than 65 years of age", and "we anticipate no risks with implementing this guideline". Future research notes that "more rigid radiographic criteria (e.g. any fracture displacement not just > 2mm)" and assessment of durability "in the longer term (e.g. 10–20 years)" should be studied.

### Adequate union rates for the treatment of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures [^1135R6j3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Non-displaced acute tuberosity (zone 1) avulsion fractures are preferably treated conservatively given comparable union rates and clinical outcomes were found, regardless of chosen management, and fracture healing is typically uncomplicated. Ideal management of displaced zone 1 fractures remains unclear due to the small number of cases identified, although available evidence suggests that both conservative and surgical treatment demonstrate comparable union rates. Acute zone 2 fractures were found to have higher union rates and faster time to union when managed surgically, which the current literature supports as the treatment of choice for all such injuries. Acute zone 3 fractures continue to be rarely reported in the literature, so treatment outcomes remain insufficiently documented and thus preclude any formal management recommendation. Higher level of evidence research on proximal fifth metatarsal fractures will be necessary to provide more definitive conclusions.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^1156ZNF5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guideline — Future research priorities emphasize standardization, longer-term outcomes, and decision-making thresholds, with a note on functional outcomes at one year. Consistency in reporting the definition of displaced clavicle fractures in randomized studies should be sought, and mid- and long-term outcome studies would provide information on value of treatment over time in the adult population. Improved understanding or prediction of which patients are most likely to fail nonoperative or operative treatment will be useful to further tailor clinical decision-making, and the determination of when non-operative treatment should be converted to operative stabilization would be useful in shared decision-making processes. It appears functional outcomes are similar at one year with either operative or non-operative treatment.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^113sRfDt]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Lateral clavicle fracture — operative vs non-operative treatment: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that displaced lateral fractures with disruption of the coracoclavicular ligament complex may benefit from operative repair. Quality of Evidence: Consensus and Strength of Option: Consensus. A systematic literature review yielded no studies that met inclusion criteria for this clinical practice guideline. The work group is of the opinion that given the available evidence supporting modern techniques of fixation and the established high risks of non-union, surgical management may be appropriate in selected patients with displaced lateral clavicle fractures. Surgical management of lateral clavicle fracture with coracoclavicular ligament injury may reduce the risk of non-union and improve patient outcomes, but careful consideration must be made to avoid unnecessary operative interventions in this patient population. No evidence related to cost or resource utilization is available on this topic. Little change is required to implement this recommendation; thus, it is likely to be acceptable to most. Implementation of this recommendation requires little additional surgical change however, public health resources and the associated cost of treatment may make this less feasible in some health care settings. Continued understanding of the impact of displacement, and the role of treatment on clinical outcomes is necessary.

### Prevention and management of osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy: ISOO-MASCC-ASCO guideline [^115PcfBC]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) — determinants of full thickness segmental resection and reconstructive outcomes — show high surgical success, with multiple single-institution series reporting success rates at 90%, and multi-institution cohorts reporting free flap outcomes in ORN including 260 patients with a free flap success rate of 92%, 49 patients with 92% flap success, and 76 patients with total flap loss observed in 4% of patients; the most common complications were wound site infection, metal exposure, and fistulation, which ranged from 20%–47%. There is consensus in the literature that the most advanced cases of ORN require definitive segmental resection, and the Panel describes full thickness ORN as disease extent whereby removal of all necrotic bone is likely to result in oroantral or oronasal defect in the maxilla or pathological fracture in the mandible.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^117SLgKB]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Patterns and classifications

To ensure effective communications with surgeons, it is extremely important for radiologists to describe patterns.

The AO group has proposed a system for classifying craniomaxillofacial fractures in adults (AOCMF) in which anatomic modules are arranged into a hierarchy with three levels of precision to describe these injuries in terms of complexity and details. Level 1 is the most basic; it conveys only whether fractures are present in four anatomical units: the mandible, midface, skull base, and cranial vault. Level 2 describes the location of the fractures in detail within specific regions of the mandible, central and lateral midface, internal orbit, endocranial and exocranial skull base, and cranial vault. Level 3 reports even greater detail about the location of the injury, focusing on morphology (fragmentation, displacement, and bone defects) within specific subregions. The AO classification is not widely adopted for now but it is a promising research tool for the future.

Multidetector CT's exquisite depiction of bone has enabled the development of new subunit-specific principles for the management of midfacial fracture that are supplanting the older, more general Le Fort classification system, which does not adequately reflect the complexity of the individual components of the midfacial region. Nevertheless, the Le Fort classification remains relevant because it is well known and is still widely used in clinical practice.

The following discussion of fracture patterns first focuses on those involving more buttresses and then focuses on those that involve fewer buttresses (e.g. orbital "blowout" or mandibular fractures). It is important to keep in mind that various patterns often coexist in the same patient (Table 2).

Table 2
Patterns and classifications of facial fractures

In midface fractures involving multiple buttresses and damage to the pterygoid plates, the three subtypes of Le Fort fractures should be considered. Determining whether the fracture predominantly affects the lateral or medial portion of the midface will help show whether the pattern corresponds to a fracture of the zygomaticomaxillary complex or naso-orbito-ethmoidal complex.

### Management of displaced fractures of the waist of the scaphoid: meta-analyses of comparative studies [^115gjULR]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Scaphoid fractures with displacement have a higher incidence of nonunion that can cause pain and reduced movement, strength and function. The aim of this study was to review the evidence available and establish the risk of nonunion associated with management of displaced fractures of the waist of the scaphoid.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) controlled vocabulary (scaphoid fractures, AND'd with displaced, or nonunion, or non-healing or cast immobilisation, or plaster or surgery). At present, there are no randomised, controlled trials or studies comparing fixation to plaster cast treatment of displaced fractures of the scaphoid. The search was therefore limited to observational studies of displaced fractures of the scaphoid treated in a plaster cast (non-operative group) or fixed surgically (operative group). The criterion for displacement was limited to gap or step of more than 1 mm. In the non-operative group, we compared the outcome of displaced and undisplaced fractures of the waist of the scaphoid treated in a plaster cast. In the operative group, contingency table analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio of nonunion with plaster treatment compared to surgery.

Results

In the non-operative group, seven studies were included in a meta-analysis with a total of 1401 scaphoids. Ninety-three percent (1311 scaphoids) of these scaphoid fractures healed in a plaster cast. A total of 207 (15%) of all scaphoid fractures showed displacement of at least 1 mm (gap/step) between fracture fragments. Nonunion was identified in 18% (37/207) of displaced scaphoid fractures treated in a plaster cast. The pooled relative risk of fracture nonunion was 4.4 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3–8.7; p = 0.00; I(2) = 54.3%). In the surgical group, we identified six observational studies in which 157 'displaced' fractures of the scaphoid were surgically fixed. Only two of these fractures did not heal. The odds of nonunion were 17 times higher with plaster cast treatment than surgery.

Conclusions

Displaced fractures of scaphoid have a four times higher risk of nonunion than undisplaced fractures when treated in a plaster cast, and the patients should be advised of this risk. Nonunion is more likely if a displaced fracture of the scaphoid is treated in a plaster cast.

### The effectiveness of 1-point fixation for zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures… [^113RNtzh]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Design Case series with chart review. Setting Academic tertiary care medical center. Patients and Methods The study included 29 patients who underwent 1-point fixation at the ZMB for zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures without comminution of lateral orbital rim fractures. Preoperative and postoperative 3D CT scans were obtained to evaluate vertical and horizontal changes of the zygoma, which were were analyzed according to preoperative 3D CT findings. Conclusion Our findings suggest that 1-point fixation at the ZMB provides sufficient stability of the zygomaticomaxillary complex without comminuted fractures of the lateral orbital rim. The most common cause of ZMC fracture was falls, followed by traffic accidents, sports injuries, and assault. A nasal bone fracture was present in 1 patient, and an orbital medial wall fracture without extraocular muscle entrapment was present in 2 patients.

Partial limitation of extraocular muscle movement seen with the upper gaze of the lesion side occurred in 2 patients, but they did not complain of diplopia. Exploration was performed 1 to 18 days after trauma. The ZMB area was fixed with resorbable plates of various shapes, lengths, and thicknesses and with screws of corresponding sizes and weights in 26 patients. The mean VC improved from 1. 28° to
0. 58°, and the mean HC improved from 1. 71° to
0. 92° after 1-point fixation at the ZMB. Postoperative VC was not significantly influenced by comminution of the inferior orbital wall, ZF displacement, or comminution of the ZMB area and zygomatic arch. However, because the ZMB plays a key role in withstanding contraction of the masseter muscle and supporting zygoma, 9 rigid fixation at the ZMB is important in the treatment of tripod fractures.

Tarabichi10 reported successful results with transsinus reduction through the comminuted anterior wall of the sinus and 1-point fixation of malar fractures and pointed out that in vitro studies are misleading because of the absence of serration along the orbital rim and disregard of the roles of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system, uninterrupted periosteum, and skin in stabilizing a fractured zygoma.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures… [^114HY85u]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

MANAGEMENT Nondisplaced acute metatarsal shaft fractures generally heal well without complications. Minimally displaced fractures of the second to fifth metatarsal shafts. Follow-up should occur within three to five days to allow for reduction of soft tissue swelling. At the first follow-up visit, radiography should be performed to assure fracture stability. If stable, the patient can be transitioned to a short leg walking cast or boot. HISTORY Patients with a proximal fifth metatarsal fracture often present after an acute inversion of the foot or ankle. Patients have localized pain, swelling, and inability to bear weight on the lateral aspect of the foot. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Examination should consist of a neurovascular evaluation and palpation of the foot and ankle. There is typically focal tenderness, swelling, and ecchymosis at the base of the fifth metatarsal.

Patients usually cannot bear full weight and sometimes will ambulate only on the medial aspect of the foot. MANAGEMENT: JONES FRACTURES Initial management of a Jones fracture includes a posterior splint and avoidance of weight-bearing activity, with follow-up in three to five days. After that, nonsurgical treatment options include six to eight weeks of short leg non–weight-bearing cast with radiographic follow-up to document healing at six to eight weeks. 2, 6, 20 If evidence of healing is present at that time, weight-bearing activity can progress gradually, along with physical therapy and rehabilitation. If no healing has occurred at six to eight weeks, avoidance of weight-bearing activity should continue for another four weeks. 2, 6, 20 Typical length of immobilization is six to 10 weeks, and healing time is typically up to 12 weeks.

ORTHOPEDIC REFERRAL Patients with fifth metatarsal tuberosity avulsion fractures should be referred to an orthopedist if there is more than 3 mm of displacement, if step-off is greater than 1 to 2 mm on the cuboid articular surface, or if a fragment includes more than 60% of the metatarsal-cuboid joint surface. Patients with Jones fractures should be referred if there is more than 2 mm of displacement, if conservative therapy is ineffective after 12 weeks of immobilization and radiography reveals nonunion, or if the patient is an athlete or is highly active.

### Maxillary-orbital fractures… [^115wGfSi]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

SURGICAL management of trauma is becoming increasingly important. Our present era may aptly be termed "the age of violence. " The incidence of injuries resulting from traffic accidents, assaults, industrial and recreational mishaps, and military casualties is ever increasing. The type of injury and extent of damage varies in direct relation to these differing causes. Thus, traffic accidents are more likely to cause multiple fractures. Assaults usually result in less extensive involvement. An understanding of the cause and mode of production of an injury will result in better treatment. Of increasing incidence are the multiple injuries to the complex orbital-frontal-zygomatic-nasal-maxillary components of the facial skeleton. They are frequently compounded, comminuted, displaced, and contaminated. They may be complicated by involvement of special structures, ie, the orbit and ocular tissues, the nasal, oral, and sinus structures, the nerves, and cranial parts.

These injuries have important effects on appearance, function, and Dalitsch WW. Maxillary-Orbital Fractures: Improved Treatment. Arch Otolaryngol. 1968; 88: 523–528.
