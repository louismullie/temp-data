## Question

reasons for increasing risperdal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why and when to increase risperidone (Risperdal) safely, including indications for dose escalation, pharmacokinetic interactions, patient-specific factors, phase of illness, monitoring, and dose limits with reassessment timelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core indications and therapeutic range for risperidone in adults. Then, I should verify dose–response data and the practical ceiling where risks outweigh benefits. Next, I will examine pharmacokinetics and drug–gene/drug–drug interactions that mandate dose changes. After that, I need to consider organ function, age, and diagnosis-specific nuances. Finally, I should delineate a monitored titration protocol, explicit dose boundaries, when not to escalate, and a clear reassessment plan with contingency pathways such as clozapine consideration.

> Let me first confirm adult dosing fundamentals and the evidence base for escalation: for schizophrenia, a typical adult starting dose is 2 mg/day with increases of 1–2 mg at intervals of at least 24 hours as tolerated, targeting 4–8 mg/day, with diminishing returns and more extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) above 6 mg/day; safety above 16 mg/day has not been established, so that should not be exceeded [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the dose–response curve to avoid overshooting; meta-analytic data indicate risperidone shows a clear dose–response up to an optimal around 4 mg/day for acute schizophrenia, with little additional efficacy and more adverse effects above that, supporting a cautious approach to upward titration and skepticism about routine use above the lower part of the labeled range [^114on1UK].

> Now, let me consider clinical indications to increase dose: if there is inadequate response after an adequate trial at the current dose, escalation within the recommended range is reasonable; partial responders may benefit from careful 1–2 mg/day increments at ≥ 24-hour intervals, but I need to ensure an adequate duration at each dose (often 2–4 weeks) before judging nonresponse unless the patient is acutely ill and requires faster titration in an inpatient setting [^115nUujd] [^114QXVbZ].

> Wait, let me verify what to do in acute exacerbations; in selected inpatients, rapid titration protocols can reach 3 mg twice daily within 16–24 hours and were tolerated in small series, but given limited evidence, I should reserve this for closely monitored settings and default to guideline-concordant titration otherwise [^notfound].

> Next, I should review treatment-refractory pathways; for persistent nonresponse at appropriate doses and durations, high-dose regimens may be tried as a limited therapeutic trial, but only continue beyond three months if clear benefit outweighs risks, and frankly, clozapine should be considered after two adequate antipsychotic trials due to superior efficacy in treatment resistance [^1152Rib7] [^115KA3QH].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetic interactions that mandate dose adjustment; strong CYP3A4 inducers like carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, or phenobarbital can markedly lower exposure and may necessitate up to doubling the risperidone dose while the inducer is on board, with a corresponding decrease when the inducer is stopped to prevent toxicity [^117RsXA7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I need to check the logic around CYP2D6 inhibitors; with fluoxetine or paroxetine coadministration, the risperidone dose should generally be reduced and should not exceed 8 mg/day, but at first I almost said that stopping these inhibitors decreases clearance and requires a dose reduction — that is backwards; stopping a CYP2D6 inhibitor increases clearance and can require a cautious increase back toward the pre-inhibitor dose to maintain efficacy, whereas adding the inhibitor typically necessitates a dose reduction to avoid excess exposure [^117RsXA7].

> Let me consider pharmacogenetics; CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers can have lower exposure to active moieties and may require higher doses within the labeled range, though I should treat this as hypothesis-generating and confirm clinically or with therapeutic drug monitoring if available given the lower-credibility evidence base [^111qZaAs].

> I should confirm organ impairment adjustments before thinking about escalation; in severe renal or hepatic impairment, start low (for example, 0.5 mg twice daily with renal failure, and 0.25–1 mg/day in hepatic impairment depending on severity), titrate slowly, and only consider increases above 1.5 mg twice daily at weekly or longer intervals if clearly tolerated and needed; even in moderate renal impairment, slower titration and ECG vigilance for QT prolongation are prudent, and no dose adjustment is needed when CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min [^115nUujd] [^113TgTw1] [^111zEYJ9] [^116RQbYn] [^1166mutQ] [^111L2F6r].

> Let me think about age; older adults are more pharmacodynamically sensitive with lower clearance on average, so I should start low (e.g., 0.5 mg twice daily) and titrate gradually, aiming for the lowest effective dose; indeed, geriatric dosing often lands below standard adult targets due to side-effect liability, in line with age-aware dosing principles in late-life schizophrenia [^115nUujd] [^1152of27].

> I need to ensure pediatric and adolescent specifics are correct; for schizophrenia in adolescents 13–17 years, start at 0.5 mg daily and titrate to about 3 mg/day since doses above 3 mg/day show no added benefit with more adverse events, and for irritability in autism ages 5–17, 0.5–3 mg/day is typical with careful monitoring for metabolic and prolactin-related adverse effects; for pediatric bipolar mania, 0.5–2.5 mg/day is a common target, without benefit above 2.5 mg/day in trials [^115nUujd] [^114R8FhC] [^115TxPnG].

> Next, I should review how symptom domains and phase of illness guide the upper bound of titration; prominent positive symptoms may justify aiming toward the upper part of the recommended range during acute phases, whereas during maintenance I should favor the lowest dose that maintains remission given the flat efficacy curve and dose-related harms, reinforcing a conservative stance beyond about 6 mg/day absent compelling clinical need [^117FQmoJ] [^115nUujd].

> I will now outline monitoring to anchor safe escalation; I should quantify therapeutic response with standardized scales such as PANSS or BPRS at baseline and follow-up, and I must surveil for EPS (which rise notably above 6 mg/day), metabolic syndrome, weight, glucose, lipids, hyperprolactinemia, and cardiovascular parameters including QT, integrating therapeutic drug monitoring when nonresponse or adverse effects prompt uncertainty about exposure [^115nUujd] [^114jsdet] [^113i4pnt] [^116owmBw] [^114VpLhE].

> But wait, I should specify dose boundaries clearly; do not exceed 16 mg/day because safety above that is unestablished, and in practice doses above about 8 mg/day are rarely justified given marginal efficacy and higher side-effect burden; recent expert consensus also trended the risperidone dosing range to 3–6 mg/day with a maximum of 8 mg/day, which aligns with the risk–benefit profile observed clinically [^115nUujd] [^1179NWAV].

> Hold on, I should verify the stepwise decision pathway before escalating; confirm the diagnosis and rule out pseudo-resistance from nonadherence, ensure an adequate trial at the current dose and duration, reassess side effects and interactions, then increase by 1–2 mg/day at intervals of at least 24 hours as tolerated, with a reassessment window 2–4 weeks after the new dose, and if attempting a high-dose trial, formalize a three-month checkpoint to continue only with clear net benefit [^115nUujd] [^1152Rib7].

> Let me reconsider when not to increase the dose; if adverse effects are prominent at the current dose, if the dose is already above about 8 mg/day without clear incremental benefit, if the patient is clinically stable without indication to change, or if clozapine criteria are met after two adequate trials, escalation is contraindicated and alternative strategies should be pursued [^1179NWAV] [^115nUujd] [^1152Rib7].

> I should double-check special formulations and renal adjustments because they can be overlooked; for long-acting risperidone formulations, establish oral tolerability first and use lower starting doses in renal impairment with slow titration and monthly or less frequent dosing when CrCl is reduced, ensuring ECG monitoring for QT prolongation, whereas no adjustment is needed with normal renal function [^111tX6Lb] [^116gg6fq] [^114aE1yp] [^113VhXST].

> Finally, I need to ensure the overall clinical stance is balanced; escalation should be individualized, evidence-informed, and time-limited when efficacy gains are uncertain, always weighing dose-dependent risks such as EPS, metabolic effects, and hyperprolactinemia against potential symptom improvements, with clear documentation, shared decision-making, and pre-specified reassessment to either consolidate, de-escalate, or pivot to alternative treatments such as clozapine when indicated [^115nUujd] [^1152Rib7] [^117FQmoJ] [^114jsdet].

Risperdal dose increases are driven by **inadequate symptom control** (persistent positive/negative symptoms, mania, or irritability) [^115KA3QH], **relapse prevention** (maintaining therapeutic D2 occupancy) [^114CiiW3], and **pharmacokinetic factors** (CYP2D6 variability, enzyme inducers) [^111qZaAs] [^117RsXA7]. They also address **nonadherence** (missed doses, partial compliance) [^111bg3Na], **clinical deterioration** (agitation, aggression, suicidality) [^114QXVbZ], and **tolerability** (balancing efficacy with side effects) [^114jsdet]. Dose increases should be **individualized** [^1179NWAV], with cautious titration and monitoring for adverse effects, especially in vulnerable populations [^114jsdet] [^1152of27].

---

## Inadequate symptom control

- **Persistent positive symptoms**: Hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking may persist despite initial dosing [^113ogu2F], necessitating dose escalation to achieve adequate symptom control.

- **Negative symptoms**: Apathy, social withdrawal, and diminished emotional expression may require higher doses [^113ogu2F] for improvement.

- **Mood stabilization**: In bipolar disorder [^115kKkS9], inadequate control of manic or mixed episodes may prompt dose increases.

- **Irritability in autism**: Persistent irritability or aggression in autism spectrum disorder [^114R8FhC] may require dose adjustments.

---

## Prevention of relapse

For relapse prevention, **maintenance therapy** [^1115sJ8U] may require dose increases to sustain therapeutic levels in chronic conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can guide dose adjustments to maintain **therapeutic plasma concentrations** [^116owmBw] and prevent relapse.

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

In pharmacokinetic terms, **CYP2D6 genetic variability** [^111qZaAs] significantly affects risperidone metabolism and may necessitate dose adjustments to achieve therapeutic levels. Additionally, **drug interactions** with enzyme inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) can reduce risperidone levels, prompting dose increases [^117RsXA7] [^115nUujd].

---

## Clinical deterioration or exacerbation

In clinical deterioration or exacerbation, acute **agitation and aggression** may necessitate rapid dose escalation [^114QXVbZ] to stabilize the patient. Emergent **suicidality** or severe mood symptoms may also require dose increases to ensure patient safety [^116Y5g94].

---

## Nonadherence or partial compliance

With **nonadherence or partial compliance**, missed doses may necessitate dose adjustments to re-establish therapeutic levels and prevent relapse [^111bg3Na].

---

## Tolerability and side effect management

For tolerability and side-effect management, **balancing efficacy with adverse effects** [^114jsdet] often prompts dose adjustments to minimize extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, and hyperprolactinemia [^117JamwL].

---

## Special populations and clinical scenarios

- **Elderly patients**: Dose adjustments are necessary due to increased sensitivity and risk of adverse effects in elderly patients [^1152of27] [^115nUujd].

- **Pediatric patients**: Dose adjustments are carefully managed to balance efficacy and safety in pediatric populations [^114R8FhC] [^115HqrYc].

- **Treatment-resistant schizophrenia**: Higher doses or augmentation strategies may be considered in treatment-resistant cases [^1152Rib7] [^115KA3QH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines note that the **British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP)** recommends cautious dose escalation with close monitoring of side effects and therapeutic response, particularly in treatment-refractory schizophrenia [^1152Rib7] [^113sr21u]. The **American Academy of Neurology (AAN)** also advises caution with risperidone due to the potential for tardive syndromes [^114QjFpz].

---

## Risks associated with dose increases

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)**: Higher doses increase the risk of EPS, including tardive dyskinesia [^117FQmoJ].

- **Metabolic side effects**: Dose-dependent risks include weight gain, hyperprolactinemia, and metabolic syndrome [^114jsdet] [^117JamwL].

- **Cardiovascular risks**: Higher doses may increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension and QT prolongation [^114jsdet] [^117FQmoJ].

---

Overall, dose increases for Risperdal are driven by inadequate symptom control, relapse prevention, pharmacokinetic factors, clinical deterioration, nonadherence, and tolerability. These adjustments should be **individualized**, **cautiously titrated**, and **closely monitored** to balance efficacy and safety [^112nrTkC].

### Addressing nonresponse in schizophrenia [^115KA3QH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics are recommended as first-line treatment for schizophrenia, but patients may have little or no response to an initial antipsychotic trial. Strategies for managing treatment nonresponse include increasing the dose, addressing nonadherence, augmenting the original medication, and switching the patient to another medication. Clozapine is recommended for patients with schizophrenia who have not responded to two other antipsychotic trials of adequate duration. However, many physicians are hesitant to prescribe clozapine due to the complexity of the treatment regimen and the possibility of severe adverse effects. For patients with resistant schizophrenic symptoms, the benefits of clozapine may outweigh the risks. Data show that patients have more favorable opinions of clozapine treatment than many physicians expect. If clozapine treatment is initiated, physicians should mitigate risk by carefully monitoring and addressing side effects.

### Risperdal [^117RsXA7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dose adjustments for specific drug interactions**: When Risperdal is co-administered with enzyme inducers (e.g. carbamazepine), the dose of Risperdal should be increased up to double the patient's usual dose. It may be necessary to decrease the Risperdal dose when enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine are discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. A similar effect may be expected with the co-administration of Risperdal with other enzyme inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital). When fluoxetine or paroxetine is co-administered with Risperdal, the dose of Risperdal should be reduced. The Risperdal dose should not exceed 8 mg per day in adults when co-administered with these drugs. When initiating therapy, Risperdal should be titrated slowly. It may be necessary to increase the Risperdal dose when enzyme inhibitors such as fluoxetine or paroxetine are discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Administration of Risperdal oral solution**: Risperdal oral solution can be administered directly from the calibrated oral dosing syringe or can be mixed with a compatible beverage prior to administration. Risperdal oral solution is compatible with the following beverages: water, coffee, orange juice, and low-fat milk. It is not compatible with either cola or tea.

### SPL drug information for risperidone [^114jsdet]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of risperidone PO (also known as Risperdal):

- **Aspiration pneumonia**: Use extreme caution in patients with advanced Alzheimer's dementia, dysphagia, or those at risk for aspiration.
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing conditions such as obesity, pre-diabetes, established diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia.
- **Cognitive difficulties and motor impairment**: Use caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- **Fever, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, ALF**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as risperidone has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- **Hyperprolactinemia and weight gain**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as risperidone is associated with an increased risk of these adverse events.
- **Hypothermia and hyperthermia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as risperidone is associated with an increased risk of these adverse events.
- **Increased blood eosinophil count, increased blood glucose, increased serum cholesterol**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as risperidone has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- **Neutropenia and agranulocytosis**: Use caution in patients with leukopenia/neutropenia, including those with pre-existing low white blood cell (WBC) counts and a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia.

### Effect of CYP2D6 genotype on exposure and efficacy of risperidone and aripiprazole: A retrospective, cohort study [^111qZaAs]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme metabolizes the antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole to their active metabolites, 9OH-risperidone and dehydroaripiprazole. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of CYP2D6 genetic variability on risperidone and aripiprazole exposure and treatment in a large patient population.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively obtained patient data from a routine therapeutic drug monitoring database at the Center for Psychopharmacology, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway, between Jan 1, 2005, and Oct 15, 2018. Individuals included in our analyses were CYP2D6-genotyped patients treated with risperidone or aripiprazole. Inclusion criteria for measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters (drug and metabolite serum concentrations) were oral administration of risperidone or aripiprazole, information known about prescribed daily dose and comedications, and age older than 18 years. Exclusion criteria included polypharmacy with drugs known to be CYP2D6 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors. Treatment failure was analyzed in all patients treated with risperidone or aripiprazole without these criteria.

- **Endpoints**: The first endpoint in our analysis was the metabolism of risperidone to 9OH-risperidone and aripiprazole to dehydroaripiprazole, estimated by the log-transformed ratio between the concentrations of metabolite and parent drug (i.e. the metabolic ratio for risperidone [9OH-risperidone]/[risperidone] and the metabolic ratio for aripiprazole [dehydroaripiprazole]/[aripiprazole]). The second endpoint was the measurement of drug exposure, quantified by the…

### A tipping point in drug dosing in late-life schizophrenia [^1152of27]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Minimally effective doses of antipsychotics are likely influenced by several clinical and demographic characteristics of patients, with age being one of the most important elements. In light of age-related physiologic changes as well as interindividual differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic systems, individualized dosing with regard to age will be critically important for safer drug treatment for older patients with schizophrenia.

In the present review, we propose the following cautious psychopharmacologic interventions for this population:

1. Simple regimen (avoid polypharmacy).
2. Be aware of the presence of patients who are very sensitive to drugs.
3. Gradual dose titration.
4. Timely and thorough assessments of therapeutic and side effects.

The age-related antipsychotic sensitivity highlights the importance of finding the lowest possible effective dose of antipsychotic drugs as patients with schizophrenia age to maximize therapeutic effects and minimize side effects.

### Risperidone versus placebo for schizophrenia [^113ogu2F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Risperidone is the first new-generation antipsychotic drug made available in the market in its generic form. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical effects, safety, and cost-effectiveness of risperidone compared with a placebo for treating schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: On 19th October 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We checked the references of all included studies and contacted the industry and authors of the included studies for relevant data.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing oral risperidone with placebo treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened studies, assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and the 95% CI. We created a 'Summary of Findings' table using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

- **Main results**: The review includes 15 studies (N = 2428). The risk of selection bias is unclear in most of the studies, particularly concerning allocation concealment. Other areas of risk such as missing data and selective reporting also caused some concern, although they did not affect the direction of effect of our primary outcome.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^1152Rib7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, and more specifically with respect to the initiation of antipsychotic therapy, the BAP 2020 guidelines recommend the use of high-dose or combined antipsychotic medication regimens for treatment-refractory schizophrenia as a limited therapeutic trial. Side effects and therapeutic response should be closely monitored. Continue high doses beyond three months only if there is a clear clinical benefit that outweighs the risks.

### SPL drug information for risperidone [^113TgTw1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of risperidone PO (also known as Risperdal) in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 10 mL/min:

- **Initiation and dosing**: Start at a dose of 0.5 mg. Do not exceed a frequency of BID.
- **Monitoring and titration**: Titrate slowly and monitor for QT prolongation.
- **Dosage adjustments**: May increase to dosages above 1.5 mg twice daily at intervals of at least one week at a slower rate.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^113sr21u]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Since the introduction of chlorpromazine and haloperidol seven decades ago, the number of drugs for psychosis has steadily increased, resulting in dozens of treatment options for schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Competent use of drugs for psychosis requires clinical experience and knowledge of sound dosing practices. Such practice routinely includes dose increases to achieve symptomatic and functional improvement, gradual dose reduction to find tolerable and effective maintenance doses, and switching among agents and formulations, as occurs in 15%–20% of patients treated with drugs for psychosis each year.

Remarkably, however, consensus remains elusive on how to dose individual drugs for psychosis, including changing from one to an approximately equivalent dose of another, especially with newer agents. Establishing clinically equivalent dose estimates and dosing recommendations contributes to optimizing the use of drugs for psychosis in clinical practice, informs practice guideline development, and aids in designing and interpreting clinical research.

Methods of estimating dosing equivalencies and establishing dosing recommendations have limitations and can yield values that vary substantially. Equivalent doses for many older drugs for psychosis, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, were supported by dose-effect relationships based on laboratory pharmacodynamic data, such as in vitro affinity at cerebral dopamine receptors. This preclinical approach does not account for important interindividual variability.

### SPL drug information for risperidone [^1128ifxc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of risperidone PO (also known as Risperdal) in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement:

- **Reduce starting dose**: Adjust dosage as in eGFR 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m².
- **Titrate slowly**: Monitor for QT prolongation.

### Zyprexa intramuscular [^114VfUXb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mg/day within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately 1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments/decrements of 5 mg QD are recommended.

Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mg/day in clinical trials. However, doses above 10 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10 mg/day (i.e. to a dose of 15 mg/day or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mg/day.

The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, who otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g. nonsmoking female patients ≥ 65 years of age), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.

The effectiveness of oral olanzapine, 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day, in maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients has been demonstrated [see Warnings and Precautions, Drug Interactions, and Clinical Pharmacology].

### Changes in glutamate levels in anterior cingulate cortex following 16 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in antipsychotic-naïve first-episode psychosis patients [^113i4pnt]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

FEP patients enrolled in this longitudinal study entered a 16-week trial of oral risperidone using a flexible dosing regimen. We chose risperidone because it is commonly prescribed, now available as a generic medication, and thus one of the more affordable second-generation antipsychotic medications in the United States. It is considered a first-line treatment in FEP (Robinson et al.). Risperidone was started at 0.5–1 mg and titrated in 1–2 mg increments based on therapeutic and side effects. In the case of excessive side effect burden, as determined by a study physician, patients were switched to aripiprazole started at 2–5 mg and titrated in 2.5–10 mg increments. Four patients were switched to aripiprazole. Use of concomitant medications, including antidepressants, was permitted as clinically indicated and was prescribed after the initial MRI session. Twenty-two medication-naïve FEP were prescribed the following during the trial: trazodone (3), sertraline (10), valproic acid (1), bupropion (1), escitalopram (1), lorazepam (1), suboxone (1), fluoxetine (1), citalopram (1), propranolol (1), and amitriptyline (1). Seventeen other patients were under more than one medication. Compliance was monitored with pill counts at each visit.

- **Clinical assessment**: First, the percent BPRS Positive-4 score reduction (hallucinatory behavior, unusual thought content, suspiciousness, and conceptual disorganization) was calculated after subtraction of minimum possible scores (Leucht, Davis, Engel, Kissling, & Kane), and a greater percentage indicates a greater reduction in positive symptoms.

### Zyprexa intramuscular [^114TTt7S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mg/day within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than one week, since the steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately one week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments or decrements of 5 mg QD are recommended.

Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mg/day in clinical trials. However, doses above 10 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10 mg/day (i.e. to a dose of 15 mg/day or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mg/day.

- **Dosing in special populations**: The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g. nonsmoking female patients aged ≥ 65 years), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.

- **Maintenance treatment**: The effectiveness of oral olanzapine, 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day, in maintaining treatment response in schizophrenia has been established in clinical practice.

### Is clozapine-aripiprazole combination a useful regime in the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia [^1172L6So]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Around 40–70% of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia fail to respond to clozapine. Although combining antipsychotics is commonly practiced with non-responders, there is little evidence for its use. We conducted a retrospective review of case notes of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia on a clozapine-aripiprazole combination at our clozapine clinic. We report changes in psychotic symptoms, social function, weight, total cholesterol, serum glucose, HDL, CGI, and GAF scores pre- and post-aripiprazole augmentation.

- **Effect on clozapine dose**: Clozapine-aripiprazole combination was associated with a 22% reduction in the clozapine dose.
- **Weight changes**: Eighteen out of 24 patients (75%) lost a mean weight of 5.05 kg.
- **Symptom improvement**: There was improvement in positive and negative symptoms and social functions.
- **Biochemical changes**: There was a moderate increase in HDL levels.

Our findings suggest that the clozapine-aripiprazole combination is a safe and tolerable regimen; however, control trials are needed to validate our findings.

### Assessment of strategies for switching patients from olanzapine to risperidone: a randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study [^115fJW7h]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, physicians often need to change the antipsychotic medications given to patients because of an inadequate response or the presence of unacceptable or unsafe side effects. However, there is a lack of consensus in the field regarding the optimal switching strategy for antipsychotics, particularly concerning the speed at which the dose of the previous antipsychotic should be reduced. This paper assesses the short-term results of strategies for the discontinuation of olanzapine when initiating risperidone.

- **Methods**: In a 6-week, randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study, patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder on a stable drug dose for more than 30 days at entry, who were intolerant of or exhibiting a suboptimal symptom response to more than 30 days of olanzapine treatment, were randomly assigned to the following switch strategies (common risperidone initiation scheme; varying olanzapine discontinuation): (i) abrupt strategy, where olanzapine was discontinued at risperidone initiation; (ii) gradual 1 strategy, where olanzapine was given at 50% entry dose for 1 week after risperidone initiation and then discontinued; or (iii) gradual 2 strategy, where olanzapine was given at 100% entry dose for 1 week, then at 50% in the second week, and then discontinued.

- **Results**: The study enrolled 123 patients on stable doses of olanzapine. Their mean age was 40.3 years, with a mean (± standard deviation (SD)) baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of 75.6 ± 11.5. All-cause treatment discontinuation was lowest (12%).

Regarding the use of risperidone PO (also known as Risperdal) in patients with chronic liver disease, Child-Pugh B (moderate): use with caution. Initial dosage is 1 mg/day in one or two divided doses. Titrate cautiously based on tolerability and response in increments of no more than 0.5 mg twice daily and no more frequently than recommended for patients with normal liver function. Doses greater than 1.5 mg twice daily should be titrated at intervals of at least one week.

### Strategies for dosing and switching antipsychotics for optimal clinical management [^112nrTkC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008).

Optimal clinical management of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be achieved through careful antipsychotic dosing and, if necessary, by switching to another well-chosen antipsychotic using suitable switching strategies. For severely ill patients treated in clinical practice, adequate dosing may not result from following the relatively low dosing levels and abrupt titration schedules typically used in clinical registration trials. Data from recent effectiveness trials, naturalistic studies, and the Roadmap Expert Consensus Survey provide evidence of specific dose levels and titration schedules for antipsychotic agents that may be appropriate in clinical practice.

Discontinuation and frequent switching of medication are common among patients treated with antipsychotics, but data suggest that an adequate trial of the first antipsychotic medication should be undertaken before switching to another antipsychotic medication. Making a decision to switch from a typical to an atypical antipsychotic or between atypical antipsychotics should involve consideration of variables relating to the patient, illness, medication, and the patient's environment.

Switching can improve efficacy and tolerability but may also result in predictable side effects or withdrawal symptoms, including weight gain and metabolic effects as well as effects associated with prolactin changes. Many side effects that occur during switching are attributable to receptor profiles and antimuscarinic or antihistaminic blockade. Individualized switching strategies that include careful choice of medication and dose, and suitable titration, are recommended.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^112JVXRg]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

This comparison is important as the clinical use of drugs for psychosis does not always align with manufacturers' recommendations, and these recommendations may not always reflect what will eventually be identified as optimal dosing for newer products. The history of dosing drugs for psychosis is marked by notable changes in practice trends over time, among all such drugs as well as for specific agents, with evidence of the persistence of controversial "high-dose" regimens exceeding typical maximum dosing guidance of ⩾1000 mg chlorpromazine equivalents per day. The discovery that expert opinion is thus far aligned with product monograph dosing for newer drugs for psychosis may offer reassurance that a refined understanding of dosing of drugs for psychosis is emerging. The high level of agreement also may reflect, to some extent, limited clinical experience with newer agents and the corresponding influence of manufacturers' recommendations on clinical practice.

### Making sense of the literature on antipsychotics and long-term functioning: Taking natural history and personalization seriously [^112Mm3Hs]. Psychological Medicine (2024). High credibility.

An important consideration is that there is a scarcity of established guidelines and practical 'know-how' when it comes to dose-reduction and discontinuation of antipsychotics. For clinicians to be more responsive to patient preferences for dose reduction and discontinuation, the psychiatric community must address existing knowledge gaps with a research program that informs us about optimal tapering speed, accompanying psychosocial supports for successful tapering, and strategies for monitoring early warning signs.

All this demands personalization of antipsychotic treatment. This is rather obvious in many ways, and commentators on both sides of the debate are likely to agree on the need for personalization, even when they disagree on what the ideal dose target is. Unfortunately, most clinical services continue to insist on long-term maintenance treatment for everyone and fail to support or adequately guide dose-reduction and discontinuation. This approach is driven by conservatism, paternalism, risk aversion, and outdated knowledge.

On the other hand, in many critical and survivor spaces hostile to psychopharmacology, antipsychotics are demonized, and everyone is encouraged to discontinue. Any attempt at personalization of antipsychotic treatment will be crude and uncertain, but it is what patients deserve. Lex Wunderink puts it well: "Even small steps forward will easily outperform the one-size-fits-all approach".

### Risperidone dosing pattern and clinical outcome in psychosis: an analysis of 1713 cases [^112Gu5kR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

In treating patients with psychosis, practicing clinicians use various dosing strategies of antipsychotic medications, including risperidone. To evaluate the outcome of different risperidone dosing strategies in clinical practice, we undertook a large, prospective, naturalistic study in which the daily dosage was determined freely by local standards of care.

- **Method**: In a 6-week trial between December 2000 and January 2002, 1713 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia and related psychoses were treated with risperidone. The dose, daily changes in dose, and weekly changes in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score were documented. Cluster analysis was performed to identify homogeneous dosing patterns among the heterogeneous total population.

- **Results**: Of the six dosing patterns identified by cluster analysis, a 2-week titration cluster, with a starting dose of 1.8 mg/day titrated to a maximum dose of 4.7 mg/day at day 14, and a 1-week titration cluster, with a starting dose of 2.6 mg/day titrated to a maximum dose of 5.4 mg/day at day 7, showed superior clinical outcomes compared with the other clusters, in which titrations were slower and higher.

- **Conclusion**: Our results indicate that the consensus regarding risperidone dosing is appropriate for clinical practice, whereas a slower titration schedule does not guarantee a better clinical outcome. This finding emphasizes the need for appropriate early titration.

### Risperdal [^115nUujd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: In cases of severe renal and hepatic impairment in adults, initiate treatment with a lower starting dose of 0.5 mg twice daily. The dosage may be increased to above 1.5 mg twice daily at intervals of one week or longer.

- **Adults**:
	- **Usual initial dose**: Risperdal can be administered once or twice daily, beginning with an initial dose of 2 mg per day. The dose may be increased at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 to 2 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg per day. In some patients, slower titration may be appropriate. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4 mg to 16 mg per day. However, doses above 6 mg per day for twice-daily dosing were not shown to be more efficacious and were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, thus generally not recommended. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg per day has not been evaluated in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Adolescents**: The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 3 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of adolescent patients with schizophrenia at doses between 1 mg to 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 3 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events.

### Strategies for switching from conventional antipsychotic drugs or risperidone to olanzapine [^1162sciG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

This study compared the efficacy and safety of four therapeutically relevant strategies for switching clinically stable patients from a conventional antipsychotic drug or risperidone to olanzapine.

- **Method**: Two hundred nine outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder who were clinically stable while being treated with a conventional antipsychotic drug or risperidone were randomly assigned to either abrupt or gradual discontinuation of their prior antipsychotic drug. Patients were further randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to immediate olanzapine initiation (olanzapine, 10 mg q.d. for 3 weeks) or stepwise initiation (a sequence of 1 week each on placebo, olanzapine, 5 mg q.d., and olanzapine, 10 mg q.d.). The efficacy of these four switching paradigms was assessed using the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Improvement scale, Patient's Global Impressions (PGI)-Improvement scale, and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Safety assessments included ratings for extrapyramidal symptoms, cognitive impairment, adverse events, laboratory parameters, weight change, and vital signs.

- **Results**: The paradigm of gradual antipsychotic drug discontinuation combined with an initial full dose of olanzapine, 10 mg/day, had the most favorable efficacy and tolerability profile overall. By week 3, the majority of completing patients on all four switching paradigms were either improved or clinically unchanged (> 90%). No clinically significant differences between switching paradigms were seen in laboratory values or vital signs.

### Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia [^115kXXHY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia, yet they are associated with diverse and potentially dose-related side effects, which can reduce quality of life. For this reason, the lowest possible doses of antipsychotics are generally recommended, but higher doses are often used in clinical practice. It remains unclear if and how antipsychotic doses could be reduced safely to minimize the adverse-effect burden without increasing the risk of relapse.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of reducing antipsychotic doses compared to continuing the dose for people with schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: We conducted a systematic search on 10 February 2021 at the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and WHO ICTRP. We also inspected the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any dose reduction against continuation in people with schizophrenia or related disorders who were stabilized on their antipsychotic treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently screened relevant records for inclusion, extracted data from eligible studies, and assessed the risk of bias using RoB 2. We contacted study authors for missing data and additional information. Our primary outcomes were clinically important change in quality of life, rehospitalizations, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part II [^115HqrYc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Dosing**: When using antipsychotics in young people, particularly in children, it is important to consider efficacy and tolerability when adjusting doses, given that adjusting dosages based solely on body weight has not been found adequate. Although a general recommendation for antipsychotic therapy is to start slow and go slow, a common pitfall is not using full dosages due to concerns about avoiding adverse events. In the event of a lack of efficacy, clinicians should raise dosages to the maximum recommended while monitoring for adverse events. However, increasing antipsychotic dosages above the maximum recommended dose, a common pitfall in cases of inadequate response, should also be avoided, as it is associated with greater differences in side effects than in efficacy. It is important to note that abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medications can also cause withdrawal dyskinesia and a syndrome of deteriorating behaviour in children and adolescents.

- **Management of treatment-resistant psychosis**: Management of treatment resistance is also challenging in children and adolescents with psychosis. There is high variability across practitioners in the waiting time before switching to another antipsychotic in case of treatment non-response. Although recommendations from guidelines may differ, waiting more than six weeks in case of no improvement in psychotic symptoms or functioning is not supported by evidence and should be avoided. A common practice in case of non-response, besides the increase in dosages above the maximum recommended dose, is to use an antipsychotic combination.

### Optimal dosing with risperidone: updated recommendations [^113iQuuw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Drug dosages utilized during controlled clinical trials are not always optimal for patients encountered in day-to-day practice. The original trials of risperidone, a novel antipsychotic, suggested that an initial target dose of 6 mg/day was appropriate. However, these trials were necessarily conducted among patients who were chronically impaired, hospitalized, and often partly drug resistant.

- **Data sources**: Relevant data relating to the dosage of risperidone were identified through an online MEDLINE search using the keywords: risperidone, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, dementia, bipolar disorder, and dose. This was supplemented by a review of international and U.S. Congress abstracts in which the dose of risperidone was specifically described.

- **Conclusion**: Based on naturalistic studies, clinical audits, phase 4 trials, positron emission tomography data, and five years of clinical experience, the currently recommended target dose of risperidone is 4 mg/day for most patients, with less rapid titration than previously recommended. Moreover, a lower dose and slower titration may be appropriate for elderly patients, young patients, and first-episode patients.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^112bNzVM]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

In the absence of direct data in humans regarding the time taken for dopamine D2 receptor adaptations to resolve, we can be guided by observations that tardive dyskinesia (TD) improves over 2–3 years. This is the same time period over which relapse rates of patients discontinued from medication converge with relapse rates of patients maintained on medication, suggesting that this may be a reasonable time period over which to taper patients who have received long-term antipsychotics.

There is some support for this time period for tapering in small studies examining tolerable rates of discontinuation. One study investigated reducing antipsychotics in patients with remitted psychosis by 25% of the most recent dose every 6 months. This reduction follows a logarithmic pattern that closely approximates hyperbolic dose reductions, with three-quarters of patients able to achieve between 25% and 71.4% dose reduction without relapse in the first year of the study. Another pilot study found that patients with chronic schizophrenia, who on average achieved a 42% reduction in antipsychotic dose over 6 months, demonstrated no difference in relapse rates from patients maintained on antipsychotics. This suggests that many patients may tolerate dose reductions of 25%–50% of the most recent dose (corresponding approximately to 5–10 percentage point decrements of D2 occupancy) every 3–6 months. Smaller reductions, such as 10% of the most recent dose made every month, may be more tolerable with the aim of producing a more "evenly spread" perturbation to the equilibrium.

There is likely to be considerable interindividual variability.

The purpose of the present study of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three strategies for switching antipsychotic treatment. This 6-week study represented phase 1 of a longer-term investigation that addressed weight-control strategies and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients switched from olanzapine to risperidone. The results of phase 2 of the study are also summarized below.

### Risperidone augmentation for schizophrenia partially responsive to clozapine: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113sDNZn]. Schizophrenia Research (2007). Low credibility.

Risperidone augmentation of clozapine in refractory schizophrenia has theoretical but only inconsistent support from clinical trials. This study aimed to examine if adding risperidone to stable yet symptomatic schizophrenia outpatients on optimized clozapine monotherapy improves psychopathology.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving a fixed dose of 4 mg/day risperidone added for 6 weeks in 24 outpatients with schizophrenia. Results indicated that subjects who received risperidone showed a non-significant decrease in PANSS total score. However, the PANSS disorganized thought subscale improved significantly (beta = -3.3079, p = 0.047).

In conclusion, our trial does not support the routine addition of risperidone to clozapine in refractory schizophrenia patients. However, much larger trials are needed to conclusively settle the question of added efficacy from this combination.

### Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia [^1174Xzfc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

DIEPSS is a clinician-rated scale assessing extrapyramidal side effects. It consists of eight items concerning individual extrapyramidal symptoms, scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 "normal" to 4 "severe". Similarly, a ninth item measures the global severity and frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms as well as their impact on daily living. A total score can be calculated by summing the scores of the eight individual items (ranging from 0 to 32, with a higher score indicating greater severity of extrapyramidal symptoms), as well as subscores that can be used to measure parkinsonism, akathisia, and dyskinesia. One study used DIEPSS (Takeuchi 2014).

- **Maryland Psychiatric Research Center Involuntary Movement Scale (MPRC)**: MPRC is a clinician-rated scale measuring drug-induced dyskinesia and parkinsonism. The dyskinesia rating consists of 13 items, each of which is scored on an 8-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 7, from lower to higher severity. A total score can be calculated by summing the scores of all relevant items, with a higher score indicating higher severity of dyskinesia. Similarly, the parkinsonism rating consists of 15 items that can be scored from 0 to 7, and a total score can be calculated by summing the scores of all relevant items, with a higher score indicating higher severity of parkinsonism. One study used MPRC (Carpenter 1999).

- **Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)**: BARS is a clinician-rated scale measuring drug-induced akathisia. It consists of three items corresponding to two domains: 1) objective score from 0 to 3 (from lower to higher severity).

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^1179NWAV]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

The average number of participants responding to the 13 agents previously included in ICSAD-1 increased significantly between the two surveys (31.2 (SD = 12.7) vs. 54.8 (SD = 17.3), p = 0.001). There were changes to the equivalent dose for one oral agent (paliperidone), the initial dose for one oral agent (haloperidol), dosing ranges for six oral agents (all but olanzapine and sertindole), and the maximum dose for five oral agents (haloperidol, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, and ziprasidone). Overall, dosing trended modestly lower in ICSAD-2. Average changes to the oral initial dose, dosing range, and maximum dose were −4%, −16% to +3%, and −6%, respectively.

Oral risperidone clinical equivalency and dosing recommendations were unchanged other than a small difference in dosing range (reduced from 4–6 mg/day to 3–6 mg/day) and maximum dose (reduced from 8.5 to 8.0 mg/day), indicating consistency between the two survey results. There were small changes to the dosing recommendations for three SAIs. For the fourth, triflupromazine HCl, there were several fold reductions in equivalency and dosing recommendations between surveys. For all SAIs, the level of consensus remained very low, with an average CV of 78%. There were no differences in clinical equivalency and dosing recommendations for risperidone microspheres between surveys. A complete set of updated clinical equivalencies and dosing recommendations for all drugs for psychosis included in ICSAD-1 and ICSAD-2 is provided.

### Antipsychotic dosing: How much but also how often [^111bg3Na]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Considerable focus has been devoted to determining the appropriate antipsychotic dosage for optimal clinical response, although the frequency of administration remains less clear. Clinicians are aware of the increased risk of relapse related to antipsychotic nonadherence and discontinuation. Practice dictates continuous antipsychotic exposure with the goal of achieving steady-state levels to maintain effectiveness and prevent relapse. Does this mean we need to, or should, administer antipsychotics at least daily? There is a body of evidence challenging this long-established clinical axiom.

### Long-term safety of risperidone [^116jfeRr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

In two pivotal trials comparing risperidone with placebo, the risk of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups when risperidone was administered at the optimal clinical dose of 1 mg/day. During the 12-month open-label extensions of these studies, the incidence of de novo tardive dyskinesia was very low. No clinically significant adverse events, changes in vital signs, or laboratory abnormalities were observed. In summary, the safety and tolerability of risperidone in treating elderly dementia sufferers have been favorable in several clinical trials.

### Risperidone versus olanzapine for schizophrenia [^112Lk9nj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medication is a mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia, with risperidone and olanzapine being the most popular choices among the new generation of drugs.

- **Objectives**: To determine the clinical effects, safety, and cost-effectiveness of risperidone compared with olanzapine for treating schizophrenia.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (June 2004), which is based on regular searches of databases such as BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all clinical randomized trials comparing risperidone with olanzapine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

- **Main results**: We found no difference for the outcome of "unchanged or worse" in the short term (n = 548, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.15). One study, sponsored by the manufacturers of olanzapine, favored this drug for the outcome of relapse/rehospitalization by 12 months (n = 279, RR 2.16 CI 1.31 to 3.54, NNT 7 CI 4 to 25). Most mental state data showed the two drugs to be as effective as each other (n = 552, 2 RCTs, RR 'no < 20% decrease PAN).

### Antipsychotics and hyperprolactinaemia: Clinical recommendations [^117JamwL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

A group of international experts in psychiatry, medicine, toxicology, and pharmacy assembled to examine critically the currently available clinical guidance on hyperprolactinaemia. This paper summarizes the group's collective views and provides a summary of the recommendations agreed upon by the consensus group to assist clinicians in the recognition, clinical assessment, investigation, and management of elevated plasma prolactin levels in patients being treated for severe mental illness. It also addresses the special problems of particular populations, gives advice about information that should be provided to patients, and suggests a strategy for routine monitoring of prolactin. The recommendations are based on the evidence contained in the supplement 'Hyperprolactinaemia in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder: Clinical Implications' (2008). Although the guidance contained in this article is not intended to replace national guidance, such as that of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, it provides additional detail that is unlikely to be covered in existing guidelines and focuses on areas of uncertainty and disagreement. We hope it will add to the debate on this topic.

### Haloperidol [^116Y5g94]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of haloperidol required for treatment. As with all antipsychotic drugs, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.

	- To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Children, debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels.

### High dose antipsychotic polypharmacy and dopamine partial agonists - time to rethink guidelines [^114aGaXG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia limit the use of antipsychotic agents to clinically established maximum doses. This acknowledges both the absence of additional efficacy of dopamine D2 receptor antagonists above a receptor occupancy threshold and the increases in side effects that can occur at higher doses. These limits restrict the dosing of combinations of antipsychotics as they do single agents; drugs sharing the major antipsychotic mechanism of D2 receptor antagonism will act additively in blocking these receptors.

Several newer antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole and cariprazine, act as partial agonists at the D2 receptor site and avoid action at several other receptors, effects at which are responsible for some non-dopaminergic adverse effects. This pharmacology imparts different characteristics to the drugs, often resulting in a more favorable side effect profile. Their partial agonism, along with high affinities for the D2 receptor, also means that these drugs given adjunctively may in part replace, rather than enhance, the D2 antagonism of other antipsychotic agents. This can result in an improvement in certain side effects without loss of antipsychotic efficacy.

This article makes the case for distinguishing the D2 partial agonists from antagonists in defining maximum doses of combined treatments. This differentiation would increase the options available to the prescriber, emphasizing that pharmacological mechanisms need to be understood in identifying optimal treatments for psychotic illness.

### Effects of patient demographics, risperidone dosage, and clinical outcome on body weight in acutely exacerbated schizophrenia [^117M6VHT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Predictors for risperidone-related weight gain remain unclear. This study aimed to identify clinical factors influencing body weight in risperidone-treated patients.

- **Method**: One hundred forty-six newly hospitalized DSM-IV schizophrenia patients with acute exacerbation entered this prospective, 6-week, repeated-measures trial. The mean ± SD risperidone dose was 4.3 ± 1.4 mg/day at week 6. Efficacy, body weight, and tolerability were measured biweekly. Efficacy was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE). For determining the impacts of possible prognostic factors on body weight, we utilized generalized estimating equation methods to control for other variables and the within-subject dependence over repeated assessments.

- **Results**: After the effects of other factors (including baseline body weight) were adjusted, every 1-week increase in treatment duration raised body weight by 0.442 kg (p = .007). Patients who gained weight (or 20%) also had higher weight by 0.513 kg on average (p = .007). Specifically, every 1-point diminution in score in PANSS total, PANSS positive, PANSS negative, and PANSS cognitive, and…

### Haloperidol lactate [^116Upgo4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment. As with all drugs used to treat schizophrenia, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.

- **Factors to consider for initial dosage**: Consideration should be given to the patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels.

- **Parenteral medication**: Administered intramuscularly in doses of 2 mg to 5 mg, is utilized for prompt control of the acutely agitated schizophrenic patient with moderately severe to very severe symptoms. Depending on the response of the patient, subsequent doses may be given as often as every hour, although 4 to 8-hour intervals may be satisfactory. The maximum dose is 20 mg/day.

Controlled trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of intramuscular administration in children have not been conducted.

- **Inspection prior to administration**: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Risperidone versus typical antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia [^112Thj2z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Risperidone is one of the 'new generation' antipsychotics. In addition to its reputed tendency to cause fewer movement disorders than older drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, it is claimed that risperidone may improve negative symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of risperidone for schizophrenia in comparison to 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs.

- **Search strategy**: The original electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1980–1997), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (1997), The Cochrane Library (1997, Issue 1), EMBASE (1980–1997), MEDLINE (1966–1997), PsycLIT (1974–1997), and SCISEARCH (1997) were updated with a new electronic search of the same databases in 2002. The search term used in the update was identical to that used in 1997. Any new studies or relevant references were added to the review. In addition, references of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials were also contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials comparing risperidone to any 'conventional' neuroleptic treatment for people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers, papers ordered, re-inspected and quality assessed. Data were also independently extracted. Where possible, sensitivity analyses on dose of risperidone, haloperidol, and duration of illness were undertaken for the primary outcomes of clinical improvement and side effects (movement disorders).

### Dose-response meta-analysis of antipsychotic drugs for acute schizophrenia [^114CiiW3]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

The dose-response relationships of antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia are not well defined, but such information would be important for decision-making by clinicians. The authors sought to fill this gap by conducting dose-response meta-analyses.

- **Methods**: A search of multiple electronic databases (through November 2018) was conducted for all placebo-controlled dose-finding studies for 20 second-generation antipsychotic drugs and haloperidol (oral and long-acting injectable, LAI) in people with acute schizophrenia symptoms. Dose-response curves were constructed with random-effects dose-response meta-analyses and a spline model. The outcome measure was total score reduction from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale or the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. The authors identified 95% effective doses, explored whether higher or lower doses than the currently licensed ones might be more appropriate, and derived dose equivalencies from the 95% effective doses.

- **Results**: Sixty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The 95% effective doses and the doses equivalent to 1 mg of oral risperidone, respectively, were as follows: amisulpride for patients with positive symptoms, 537 mg/day and 85.8 mg; aripiprazole, 11.5 mg/day and 1.8 mg; aripiprazole LAI (lauroxil), 463 mg every 4 weeks and 264 mg; asenapine, 15.0 mg/day and 2.4 mg; brexpiprazole, 3.36 mg/day and 0.54 mg; haloperidol, 6.3 mg/day and 1.01 mg; iloperidone, 20.13 mg/day and 3.2 mg; lurasidone, 147 mg/day and 23.5 mg; olanzapine, 15.2 mg/day and 2.4 mg; olanzapine LAI, 277 mg every 2 weeks and 3.

### Establishing a dose-response relationship for oral risperidone in relapsed schizophrenia [^114on1UK]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

For many antipsychotics, dose-response relationships remain poorly understood, and high-dose treatment remains commonplace. We aimed to establish the dose-response relationship for oral risperidone in relapsed schizophrenia by searching the known medical literature for fixed-dose studies in this patient group.

Data recovered were used to construct graphs of dose versus response. Eighteen reports evaluating the efficacy of oral risperidone were retrieved. Three studies used fixed doses of oral risperidone for eight weeks in relapsed schizophrenia, and the data from these studies were included. Graphs plotted using these data strongly suggest that doses of around 4 mg daily are optimal.

A dose of 2 mg daily consistently produced a lower level of efficacy. Doses of 6 mg or greater produced no additional benefit, and efficacy tended to be less at 10 mg daily and above. The frequency of extrapyramidal adverse effects increased with dose. The optimal dose of risperidone in relapsed schizophrenia is 4 mg daily. Higher doses are unlikely to improve efficacy and may reduce it, as adverse movement disorders become more common.

### High dose antipsychotic polypharmacy and dopamine partial agonists - time to rethink guidelines [^111CSXVn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia limit the use of antipsychotic agents to clinically-established maximum doses. This acknowledges both the absence of additional efficacy of dopamine D2 receptor antagonists above a receptor occupancy threshold and the increases in side effects that can occur at higher doses. These limits restrict the dosing of combinations of antipsychotics as they do single agents; drugs sharing the major antipsychotic mechanism of D2 receptor antagonism will act additively in blocking these receptors.

Several newer antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole and cariprazine, act as partial agonists at the D2 receptor site and avoid action at several other receptors, effects at which are responsible for some non-dopaminergic adverse effects. This pharmacology imparts different characteristics to the drugs, resulting often in a more favorable side effect profile. Their partial agonism, along with high affinities for the D2 receptor, also means that these drugs given adjunctively may in part replace, rather than enhance, the D2 antagonism of other antipsychotic agents. This can result in an improvement in certain side effects without loss of antipsychotic efficacy.

This article makes the case for distinguishing the D2 partial agonists from antagonists in defining maximum doses of combined treatments, which would increase the options available to the prescriber. It emphasizes that pharmacological mechanisms need to be understood in identifying optimal treatments for psychotic illness.

### Risperdal [^115TxPnG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Although there are no data specifically addressing the reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that after an interval off Risperdal, the initial titration schedule should be followed.

- **Switching from other antipsychotics**: There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching schizophrenic patients from other antipsychotics to Risperdal, or treating patients with concomitant antipsychotics.

- **Bipolar mania**

- **Usual dose**:

	- **Adults**: The initial dose range is 2 mg to 3 mg per day. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 mg per day. The effective dose range is 1 mg to 6 mg per day, as studied in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, short-term (3-week) anti-manic efficacy was demonstrated in a flexible dosage range of 1 mg to 6 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)]. Risperdal doses higher than 6 mg per day were not studied.

	- **Pediatrics**: The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to the recommended target dose of 1 mg to 2.5 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of pediatric patients with bipolar mania at doses between 0.5 mg and 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 2.5 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied.

### Current guidelines and their recommendations for prolactin monitoring in psychosis [^114VpLhE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the use of second-generation antipsychotics and physical health monitoring have begun to include information on hyperprolactinemia and generally recommend that patients should be queried about possible symptoms related to elevated prolactin, such as menstrual abnormalities, galactorrhea, and sexual dysfunction. However, with only two exceptions, none of the guidelines suggest performing baseline plasma prolactin levels. Although several guidelines mention the potential for hyperprolactinemia to be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, there is no guidance on how to monitor for this.

Product labeling for the different antipsychotics informs the clinician about potential risks but is not helpful with precise monitoring recommendations. The internal medicine literature contains important information regarding the pulsatile secretion of prolactin, the differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, and plasma levels of prolactin usually associated with certain symptoms, which would be useful for the prescriber of antipsychotics to be aware of. The prudent clinician should consider obtaining a baseline plasma prolactin level and at least one follow-up measurement when starting any patient on a new antipsychotic. This will help guide clinical decisions about antipsychotic dosage, switching antipsychotic medications, or considering ancillary treatments to protect bone mass. These decisions would be made within the context of considering other adverse events as well as the overall effectiveness of the antipsychotic medication being used.

### The long-term antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia: A selective review of clinical guidelines and clinical case examples [^1115sJ8U]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Low credibility.

There is a long-lasting debate regarding the long-term antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia. The most frequently advocated strategy is continued antipsychotic maintenance treatment, which involves continuous treatment with a constant dose of antipsychotic medication after symptom remission. However, due to the potential side effects of long-term medication, alternative strategies such as targeted intermittent treatment, involving stepwise drug discontinuation and early intervention upon prodromal symptoms or early warning signs, have been discussed.

In this manuscript, we review recommendations from six evidence-based clinical guidelines regarding the long-term antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia. In alignment with the state of current research, all six clinical guidelines recommend continued antipsychotic maintenance treatment. However, recommendations about other aspects, such as the dosage of medication for long-term treatment, the minimum duration of such treatment, and discontinuation strategies, remain vague and heterogeneous.

Furthermore, we provide clinical case examples to illustrate different patient course types exposed to targeted intermittent treatment. Finally, we discuss gaps in clinical guidelines and propose future research avenues in antipsychotic maintenance treatment.

Regarding the use of risperidone ER SC (also known as Uzedy, Perseris) in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 10–20 mL/min, it is advised to exercise extreme caution. The dosing frequency should not exceed once per month. It is important to titrate slowly and monitor for QT prolongation.

### High dose antipsychotic polypharmacy and dopamine partial agonists - time to rethink guidelines [^117FpApx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

The combination of two antipsychotic agents in this way may exceed the high dose threshold. Such cumulative doses are perceived as high risk and understandably may require explicit justification for their prescription. British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines indicate that antipsychotic augmentation to address inadequate symptom response should only be considered after other treatment options have been exhausted, including "several, adequate, sequential trials of antipsychotic monotherapy". This both reflects and guides UK practice where switching is generally preferred to augmentation with another antipsychotic drug, despite the acknowledged paucity of supportive evidence. This often means that drug combinations are avoided with alternative, but perhaps sub-optimal, strategies being employed.

As mentioned above, the pharmacological basis for this high dose risk is clear; additional blockade of D2 receptors above what is necessary for an antipsychotic response will increase the liability for dopaminergic side effects such as EPS and prolactin secretion without increasing efficacy. Furthermore, depending on the particular drugs being combined, other receptor-mediated side effects are likely to increase, some of which, such as metabolic effects and QT prolongation, may contribute to increased mortality. However, this pharmacological argument does not consistently hold up for the combination of partial agonists with antagonists. In terms of the main antipsychotic mechanism — drug action at the dopamine D2 receptor — the dopamine D2 partial agonists should be considered carefully.

### Safety and tolerability of a rapidly escalating dose-loading regimen for risperidone [^114QXVbZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

Risperidone is an "atypical" antipsychotic with strong binding affinity for dopamine-2 and serotonin-2 receptors. It is often used to treat hospitalized patients who have acute psychotic decompensation, with a commonly used therapeutic target dose of 2 to 6 mg/day. The most common clinical practice is to titrate the dose of risperidone to the target therapeutic dose over several days. This study investigated the safety and tolerability of a rapid oral-loading regimen for risperidone developed to achieve therapeutic doses of this antipsychotic within 24 hours.

- **Method**: Rapid-loaded risperidone was initiated with 1 mg. Subsequent doses were increased by 1 mg every 6 to 8 hours up to 3 mg. Dose increases were contingent on tolerance of last administered dose.

- **Results**: Of a sample of 11 consecutive inpatients admitted to an acute psychiatric facility who were treated with this protocol, 7 tolerated the most rapid titration, achieving a standing dose of 3 mg b.i.d. in 16 hours. Three required a slightly slower titration and achieved this target dose in 24 hours. One patient could not tolerate the 3-mg dose but tolerated a standing regimen of 2 mg t.i.d. No patient experienced serious extrapyramidal side effects, sedation, or any other adverse event during the rapid titration, and in no case did risperidone have to be discontinued.

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that aggressive dosing of risperidone is well tolerated in most psychiatric inpatients.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: A meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^117Y47TH]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are highly prevalent and debilitating severe mental illnesses worldwide. Patients often experience both simultaneously because they share a similar causative process of diagnoses.

Risperidone is a leading second-generation antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents, and for the short-term treatment of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. It is indexed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines. However, the manufacturers, Johnson & Johnson, have been involved in over 13,500 legal cases due to their failure to disclose that risperidone may cause hormonal imbalances leading to breast tissue development (gynecomastia) and increased blood prolactin levels (galactorrhoea hyperprolactinaemia) in boys and girls. There have also been black box warnings of misleading marketing of the drug for off-label uses in children and adolescents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and in elderly patients with dementia. Moreover, the clinical benefit of risperidone is questionable when compared to other antipsychotics and was recently found to be only the sixth-best treatment option for overall change in symptoms of schizophrenia.

Paliperidone is another second-generation antipsychotic drug also manufactured by Johnson & Johnson and used to treat schizophrenia. As both risperidone and paliperidone act via the same pathways in the body, research has suggested strong links to drug-induced hormonal issues.

### Zyprexa intramuscular [^113ymj6Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dose selection**: Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mg/day within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately 1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments/decrements of 5 mg QD are recommended.

	- Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mg/day in clinical trials. However, doses above 10 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10 mg/day (i.e. to a dose of 15 mg/day or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mg/day.

- **Dosing in special populations**: The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, who otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g. nonsmoking female patients ≥ 65 years of age), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.

- **Maintenance treatment**: The effectiveness of oral olanzapine, 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day, in maintaining treatment response in schizophrenia patients has been demonstrated in various studies.

### Assessment of strategies for switching patients from olanzapine to risperidone: A randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study [^116PzN6g]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The 6-week, open-label, rater-blinded study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three strategies for switching patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from olanzapine to risperidone. The reason for switching treatments in these patients was the lack of an adequate clinical response to olanzapine, a body mass index (BMI) of more than 26 kg/m², or glucose dysregulation.

Patients were randomly assigned to one of three strategies for switching from olanzapine to risperidone: abrupt switching, gradual switching over one week, or gradual switching over two weeks. Dose adjustments were made in an open-label fashion; however, all psychiatric assessments were performed by raters blinded to study group assignment. The trial was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association).

Patients were recruited at 19 sites in the United States. Participants were men or women aged 18 to 65 years with a DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Outpatients or stable chronic inpatients could be included. All patients were required to have received a stable dose of olanzapine for at least 30 days before randomization and to have had no acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms within the preceding 3 months.

### High dose antipsychotic polypharmacy and dopamine partial agonists - time to rethink guidelines [^117FQmoJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

The dopamine D2 antagonists used as antipsychotic treatments are invaluable for many people with schizophrenia but can be limited by a range of adverse effects. These depend on the pharmacological profile of the antipsychotic drug used, as well as on genetic and other individual features of the patient, and include, inter alia, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), elevated prolactin, sedation, postural hypotension, weight gain, and QT interval prolongation. The underlying receptor mechanisms relate to antagonism at, respectively but not exclusively, striatal and pituitary D2 receptors, histamine H1, alpha1 adrenergic, H1, and 5-HT2C receptors, and hERG ion channels. In general, these side effects are dose-dependent, prompting the introduction of guidelines aimed at avoiding excessively high doses of antipsychotic drugs. Furthermore, it has been established that for most dopamine D2 antagonists, a D2 receptor blockade of approximately 60%–70% is adequate for an antipsychotic action and that drug doses above this threshold are likely to increase side effects without a concomitant increase in efficacy.

This argument also holds true for combinations of D2 antagonist drugs; the UK consensus guidelines indicate that the 'high dose' threshold is reached when the sum of the percentage of the maximum recommended dose for each antipsychotic drug exceeds 100%. The rationale is clear: combining two D2 antagonists at half maximum dose should approximate the effects of one drug at maximum dose, although it is limited by inconsistencies in determining equivalence.

### Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia [^117WMmjj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia, yet they are associated with diverse and potentially dose-related side effects that can reduce quality of life. For this reason, the lowest possible doses of antipsychotics are generally recommended, but higher doses are often used in clinical practice. It is still unclear if and how antipsychotic doses could be reduced safely to minimize the adverse-effect burden without increasing the risk of relapse.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of reducing antipsychotic dose compared to continuing the dose for people with schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: We conducted a systematic search on 10 February 2021 at the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and WHO ICTRP. We also inspected the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any dose reduction against continuation in people with schizophrenia or related disorders who were stabilized on their antipsychotic treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently screened relevant records for inclusion, extracted data from eligible studies, and assessed the risk of bias using RoB 2. We contacted study authors for missing data and additional information. Our primary outcomes were clinically important change in quality of life, rehospitalizations, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

Regarding the use of risperidone PO (also known as Risperdal) in patients with chronic liver disease, Child-Pugh C (severe), use with caution. Initial dosing should be 0.25 to 0.5 mg/day in 1 or 2 divided doses. Titrate cautiously based on tolerability and response in increments of no more than 0.5 mg twice daily and no more frequently than recommended for patients with normal liver function. Doses greater than 1.5 mg twice daily should be titrated at intervals of one week or more. The maximum dose should not exceed the indication-specific recommended maximum dose.

### Blood levels to optimize antipsychotic treatment in clinical practice: A joint consensus statement of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology and the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Task Force of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie [^116owmBw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

The quantification of antipsychotic levels in blood, also known as therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), is a potentially useful tool of modern personalized therapy that can be applied to augment antipsychotic use and dosing decisions. The application of TDM for antipsychotics can be helpful in numerous challenging clinical scenarios, such as lack of therapeutic response, relapse, or adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to antipsychotic treatment. The benefits of TDM may be particularly evident in the treatment of highly vulnerable patient subgroups, such as children, adolescents, pregnant women, and the elderly. The main aim of this article is to aid clinicians who routinely prescribe antipsychotics to successfully apply TDM in routine clinical practice in order to help optimize the efficacy and safety of those antipsychotics.

- **Participants**: Participants were clinicians and researchers, members of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology, and the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Task Force of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (Association of Neuropsychopharmacology and Pharmacopsychiatry).

- **Evidence**: TDM literature on antipsychotics was critically reviewed to provide a condensed clinical decision-making algorithm with therapeutic reference ranges for blood antipsychotic levels, within which patients are most likely to respond and tolerate treatment, although TDM is not equally recommended/supported for all antipsychotics.

- **Consensus process**: A preliminary draft was prepared and circulated to the writing group member.
