## Question

Can you cut molvantek in half

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether molnupiravir (likely "molvantek" is a misspelling) can be cut in half. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the drug identity and the correct dose. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative source explicitly permits or prohibits splitting. Next, I will consider pharmacokinetic and formulation factors that influence whether splitting is reasonable. After that, I should review safety and efficacy implications of dose alteration. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with caveats and alternatives if splitting is not appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the medication and dose. Molnupiravir is an oral antiviral for COVID-19 authorized under EUA for adults with mild-to-moderate disease at high risk of progression, dosed as 800 mg orally every 12 hours for 5 days, typically initiated within 5 days of symptom onset, and there is no labeled dose adjustment for renal or hepatic impairment, which already hints that the product is intended as a fixed-dose, intact tablet regimen [^114PVWHo].

> Wait, let me verify whether any of the provided sources explicitly address tablet splitting. I need to check the FDA EUA materials, IDSA guidance, and the clinical reviews for any mention of crushing, chewing, or splitting. Hold on, I should verify carefully: none of these documents provide instructions or permission to split molnupiravir tablets, and they consistently present the dose as 800 mg twice daily without any alternative administration language, which is a strong signal that splitting is not endorsed by the manufacturer or regulators in this context [^112NEvaf] [^114PVWHo] [^116i9ys2].

> I will now examine formulation and pharmacokinetic considerations that would influence splitting. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue prodrug with a mutagenic mechanism of action; precise dosing and systemic exposure matter for both efficacy and safety, and altering tablet integrity could theoretically change dissolution, absorption, and intracellular phosphorylation, even though I should acknowledge that specific PK data on split tablets are not provided in the supplied references. Given the absence of supportive PK or stability data for split tablets, I should be cautious about assuming bioequivalence after splitting [^112NEvaf] [^115cBbHA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review safety and efficacy implications of dose alteration. Underdosing could reduce antiviral effect and increase the risk of persistent viral replication or rebound, whereas overdosing could increase mutagenic burden and adverse effects; importantly, molnupiravir's clinical benefit is modest and conditional, and guidelines frame it as an option when other therapies are unavailable, reinforcing the need to adhere to the labeled regimen rather than modify it without evidence [^116i9ys2] [^114PVWHo] [^115cBbHA].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot swallow the tablet whole? I should consider alternatives. If swallowing is a barrier, the appropriate course is to discuss with the prescriber or pharmacist about potential solutions; however, since no source here supports splitting molnupiravir, options may include seeking an alternative authorized therapy or a different formulation if available, while ensuring the full 5-day course is completed as early as possible in the disease course to preserve efficacy. I should double-check that no guideline here endorses splitting, and indeed none do, which means any off-label manipulation would be at clinician discretion with uncertain PK consequences [^112NEvaf] [^114PVWHo] [^116i9ys2].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. Based on the available evidence and labeling, there is no authorization or supportive data for cutting molnupiravir tablets in half; the regimen is 800 mg twice daily for 5 days as intact tablets, and splitting is not recommended. If a patient cannot take the tablet whole, I should coordinate with the treating clinician to explore alternatives rather than assume splitting is safe or effective in this case [^112NEvaf] [^114PVWHo] [^116i9ys2].

It is **not recommended** to cut molnupiravir (Lagevrio) tablets in half because there is **no evidence** on dose uniformity, stability, or bioequivalence after splitting. The FDA label specifies 800 mg twice daily for 5 days [^112NEvaf] and does not mention splitting, so altering the tablet could affect efficacy or safety. If a patient cannot swallow whole tablets, consider an alternative therapy or consult a pharmacist for options; **do not split without professional guidance**.

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

Molnupiravir is a prodrug converted to its active form, β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), which is then phosphorylated intracellularly to the active triphosphate. The pharmacokinetics of molnupiravir are characterized by rapid absorption, distribution, and metabolism. Altering the tablet's integrity by splitting could **disrupt the release profile**, potentially changing absorption and bioavailability, which may reduce efficacy or increase adverse effects.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence** or manufacturer guidance supporting the splitting of molnupiravir tablets. The FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) specifies a fixed dose of 800 mg orally every 12 hours for 5 days [^112NEvaf] and does not provide instructions for tablet splitting or dose modification. Similarly, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines [^116i9ys2] do not address tablet splitting or dose modification for molnupiravir.

---

## Risks associated with tablet splitting

Tablet splitting can introduce several risks, including:

- **Dose inaccuracy**: Uneven splitting can result in unequal doses, leading to under- or overdosing.
- **Stability concerns**: Exposing the inner tablet core to air and moisture may degrade the active ingredient.
- **Contamination**: Handling split tablets can introduce contaminants, compromising patient safety.
- **Loss of efficacy**: Altered pharmacokinetics may reduce therapeutic effectiveness.

---

## Alternative solutions

If a patient has difficulty swallowing whole tablets, consider the following alternatives:

- **Alternative formulations**: Consult with a pharmacist to explore available formulations or alternative medications.
- **Patient counseling**: Provide education on proper swallowing techniques or use of aids to facilitate tablet ingestion.
- **Clinical judgment**: Use clinical judgment to assess the necessity of molnupiravir therapy and consider alternative treatments if tablet splitting is unavoidable.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

There is **no evidence** or manufacturer guidance supporting the splitting of molnupiravir tablets. Given the potential risks of dose inaccuracy, stability concerns, and altered pharmacokinetics, it is not recommended to split molnupiravir tablets. If a patient cannot swallow whole tablets, consult a healthcare professional for alternative solutions.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — molnupiravir (Recommendation 28) states that in ambulatory adults (≥ 18 years) with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease who have no other treatment options, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests molnupiravir initiated within five days of symptom onset rather than no molnupiravir (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty of evidence). Other options for ambulatory treatment include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and three-day treatment with remdesivir, and patient-specific factors and product availability should drive decision-making; data for combination treatment do not exist in this setting. Patients who will most likely benefit from antivirals are those with risk factors for progression to severe disease, whereas those without risk factors are less likely to benefit. Patients who put a higher value on the putative mutagenesis, adverse events, or reproductive concerns and a lower value on the uncertain benefits would reasonably decline molnupiravir.

### Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: oral coronavirus disease 2019 antiviral drugs [^117LJ3kP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

At a crucial time with rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant globally, the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for 2 oral antivirals, molnupiravir (in persons aged ≥ 18 years) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) (in persons aged ≥ 12 years weighing ≥ 40 kg), for the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for progression. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, whereas nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor. Drug interactions are a major concern for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir demonstrated a greater risk reduction in hospitalization and death than molnupiravir compared to placebo. Both drugs need to be started within 5 days of symptoms onset and given for 5 days' duration. This article reviews the 2 oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs including the mechanisms of action, antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical experience including trials, adverse events, recommended indications, and formulary considerations.

In the modified intention-to-treat population there were 3704 qPCR viral density measurements (a median of 18 viral load estimates per patient [IQR 18–18] over 8 days) of which 2977 (80%) were above the lower limit of quantification. The median baseline oropharyngeal sample viral density was 10⁵·⁷ SARS-CoV-2 genomes per mL (IQR 10⁴·⁸ to 10⁶·⁴). Both drugs accelerated viral clearance compared with no treatment. Compared with patients receiving no study drug, by day 4 the median viral densities were 10-fold lower in the molnupiravir group and 100-fold lower in the ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir group (figure 2A). Under a linear model fitted to all viral load data up to day 7, relative to the no study drug group, the rates of viral clearance were 37% (95% CrI 16–65) faster with molnupiravir and 84% (54–119) faster with ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. In the non-inferiority comparison, viral clearance was 25% (10–38) slower with molnupiravir than ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. The viral clearance with molnupiravir was less than the non-inferiority margin of 10% relative to ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir with a probability of 0.98. The non-linear model gave near identical results (figure 2B).

### NIOSH hazard controls HC2-control of paint overspray in autobody repair shops… [^114KCy6p]. CDC (2020). Medium credibility.

Control of Paint Overspray in Autobody Repair Shops 1996 DHHS Publication Number 96–106 Hazard Hazardous components of paint spray include metals such as lead and chromium, polyisocyanates, and liquid organic solvents. Autobody workers may develop nervous disorders, skin and eye irritation, respiratory sensitization, asthma and reduced lung function from exposure to paint. Controls Effective control of worker exposure to paint overspray requires the proper selection of spray painting equipment, a properly designed and ventilated spray painting booth, and personal pro- tective equipment. Formal training and maintenance programs will help ensure that all equipment operates properly. Three types of control are recommended: Spray Painting Guns
- HIGH VOLUME, LOW PRESSURE spray painting guns are recommended instead of conventional gravity or siphon-feed spray painting guns because HVLP guns cut paint overspray concentrations in half.

HVLP guns transfer paint more efficiently and can reduce paint usage. Paint Booth Ventilation
- DOWNDRAFT VENTILATION spray painting booths are recommended instead of Cross Draft or Semi-Downdraft Ventilation spray painting booths. Properly operated DOWNDRAFT booths produce lower concentrations of paint overspray compared to the other two types of booths. DOWNDRAFT booths produce a cleaner paint job that requires less buffing. Respiratory Protection
- Properly used and maintained HVLP spray painting guns and downdraft booths will greatly reduce paint overspray concentrations, but they will not completely eliminate overspray from the air workers breathe.

Therefore, PERSONAL RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT is also recommended and a RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PROGRAM that contains all elements required by the OSHA standard will be needed to fully protect workers from this hazard.

### A viroimmunologic model to characterize the antiviral effect of molnupiravir in outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2: implication for treatment duration [^115JFqMx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Mathematically, a drug acting purely on infectious virions would not be expected to produce a major effect on viral dynamics if administered after viral peak, which is the case here. Indeed, in the viral declining phase, most virus originates from cells that are already infected, and the number of new cell infections diminishes rapidly. In contrast, a drug reducing viral production would have a much stronger effect on viral load, as it would immediately reduce the average production from infected cells. Accordingly, reproducing a sensible effect of molnupiravir on viral load requires an assumption that molnupiravir almost fully suppresses the production of infectious particles (Supplementary Table 2). This may explain why clinical trial simulation models assuming molnupiravir action only on infectious particles have estimated much higher in vivo potency of molnupiravir than estimated in vitro. Here, in all scenarios, a model assuming molnupiravir action on viral production fitted the data better than assuming an effect on infectivity. We nonetheless performed a sensitivity analysis using a model where molnupiravir would act exclusively on reducing the proportion of infectious virus, with no effect on viral replication (Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figure 5). While showing a much larger mutation-independent antiviral effect (> 90%), the model still predicted 10 days as the optimal treatment duration, as found for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. We also examined whether treatment duration could be influenced by the timing of treatment initiation. Using molnupiravir as a postexposure prophylaxis would require even longer treatment duration and suggests that 14-day administration could be relevant.

### Incidence of viral rebound after treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir [^114pAeUQ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the incidence of viral rebound after treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir?

Findings

In this cohort study of 12 629 adults in Hong Kong with COVID-19 who were hospitalized and had serial cycle threshold values measured, viral rebound (defined as a cycle threshold value > 40 that decreased to ≤ 40) occurred in 68 antiviral nonusers (0.6%), 2 (1.0%) nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users, and 6 (0.8%) molnupiravir users.

Meaning

In this study, viral rebound was uncommon in adults with COVID-19 after treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir, suggesting that these novel oral antivirals should be prescribed to more patients with COVID-19 in the early phase of the infection.

RESULTS

SARS-CoV-2 Viral Kinetics in the Absence of Molnupiravir

A model including an infection-refractory compartment best described observed viral load (Figure 3, Table 1, Supplementary Table 1). The death rate of productive infected cells, δ₀, was estimated at 0.64 day⁻¹, equivalent to a 25-hour half-life, with a production rate of 4.8 × 10⁴ virions·cell⁻¹·day⁻¹. Peak viral load was estimated at 8.2 log₁₀ copies/mL (90% CI, 8.2–8.3) and coincided with symptom onset (median delay between viral peak and symptom onset, 0 days; 90% CI, 0–1). Spike antibodies increased rapidly after inclusion and reached 90% of their maximal effect (noted A 90) 18 days after symptom onset (90% CI, 18–19), with a level of 1.7 × 10⁴ IU/mL (90% CI, 7.4 × 10³–2.6 × 10⁴). In this model, spike antibodies at their maximal effect increased the elimination of infected cells by approximatively 100%, therefore reducing their half-life by 50%. Overall, the median time to first undetectable RNA, called "viral clearance" in the following, was estimated at 13.5 days after symptom onset (90% CI, 13.5–14.5). This time would be extended to 2.0 days longer (90% CI, 1.0–3.0) in males than females due to a lower antibody increase rate (Supplementary Figure 1).

### A phase 2a clinical trial of molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19 shows accelerated SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and elimination of infectious virus [^116LiHrJ]. Science Translational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The "greater than 1000 copies" metric was selected a priori to account for positive samples that had very high viral RNA on day 2 after inoculation in this assay (i.e. ~10⁷ copies/ml), consistent with saturation and meeting or exceeding the upper limit of detection, which would not allow for an increase greater than fivefold by day 5 after inoculation in the assay. All samples positive for infectious virus by this assay had intra-assay copy numbers of RNA well above the 1000 copy threshold. The limit of quantitation in the RT-PCR assay to detect infectious virus was 200 copies/ml. Three nasopharyngeal swabs (two from 400-mg molnupiravir–treated participants who tested negative and one from a placebo participant who tested positive) were analyzed despite having been received out of temperature range.

Viral genome sequencing

Next-generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase RdRp was performed by Monogram Biosciences on samples collected at baseline and on day 5 to analyze nucleotide changes and confirm the mechanism of action.

DISCUSSION

In this article, we developed a mathematical model to fit virologic, immunologic, and mutagenesis data in patients treated with molnupiravir. Our findings suggest that molnupiravir was largely effective, inhibiting viral replication by 93% at the end of 5-day regimens. While 5-day molnupiravir shortened the median time to viral clearance by about 2 days, our model predicted that 10-day regimens could further shorten time to viral clearance and reduce viral rebound rates after treatment completion.

Mechanistically, our model assumes that molnupiravir inhibits viral replication, with a mechanism that directly affects viral production and another one mediated by an increased transition mutation rate. This mechanism of action can be explained by 2-step viral inhibition, characterized by relatively high selectivity of molnupiravir for incorporation as a cytidine triphosphate analogue, followed by indiscriminate incorporation of either triphosphorylated adenosine (mutagenesis) or guanosine with molnupiravir localized in the template. This distinguishes molnupiravir from remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, which act on viral replication only via direct inhibition, and may suggest a role for drug combination, as found in experimental models. Our analysis elucidated molnupiravir dual antiviral action: while direct viral inhibition occurred immediately upon treatment initiation, the mutagenesis-related effect built up more progressively and remained more sustained after treatment completion (Figure 5). However, our model did not identify a specific effect on the infectivity of viral particles. According to our model, viral infectivity would be nonspecifically inhibited via the reduction of overall viral replication. Thus, molnupiravir would shorten viral infectiousness, not highly by preventing the formation of infectious particles, but primarily via an inhibition of viral production.

### A molnupiravir-associated mutational signature in global SARS-CoV-2 genomes [^115cBbHA]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Molnupiravir, an antiviral medication widely used against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), acts by inducing mutations in the virus genome during replication. Most random mutations are likely to be deleterious to the virus and many will be lethal; thus, molnupiravir-induced elevated mutation rates reduce viral load 1,2. However, if some patients treated with molnupiravir do not fully clear the SARS-CoV-2 infections, there could be the potential for onward transmission of molnupiravir-mutated viruses. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 sequencing databases contain extensive evidence of molnupiravir mutagenesis. Using a systematic approach, we find that a specific class of long phylogenetic branches, distinguished by a high proportion of G-to-A and C-to-T mutations, are found almost exclusively in sequences from 2022, after the introduction of molnupiravir treatment, and in countries and age groups with widespread use of the drug. We identify a mutational spectrum, with preferred nucleotide contexts, from viruses in patients known to have been treated with molnupiravir and show that its signature matches that seen in these long branches, in some cases with onward transmission of molnupiravir-derived lineages. Finally, we analyse treatment records to confirm a direct association between these high G-to-A branches and the use of molnupiravir.

### A viroimmunologic model to characterize the antiviral effect of molnupiravir in outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2: implication for treatment duration [^1159EVfS]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The antiviral efficacy of molnupiravir against SARS-CoV-2 is controversial. Here, we develop a model integrating viral and immune dynamics to characterize the mechanism of action of molnupiravir in vivo and its impact on viral dynamics, during and after treatment.

Methods

We analysed data from the PANORAMIC trial, where 577 outpatients were randomised shortly after symptom onset to receive usual care or molnupiravir for 5 days, and where viral and immunological data were collected for two weeks. We developed a mathematical model that characterized virus/host interaction and accounted for the impact of molnupiravir on viral replication and mutagenesis. The model was used to explore the impact of longer treatment duration.

Results

Molnupiravir reduced RNA replication with an efficacy that reached 93% at the end of a five-day treatment. This effect was mediated through two different pathways, one that increased transition mutation frequency, and other that directly inhibited viral production. Accordingly five-day treatment shortened the median time to clearance of both RNA and infectious virus by approximately 2 days. Treatment duration of 10 days could reduce the time to RNA clearance by 5 days and reduce the occurrence of viral rebounds. Longer treatment durations might be needed in case of post-exposure prophylaxis.

Conclusions

Our model suggests that molnupiravir acts primarily on viral replication, and does not act specifically on viral infectivity. Longer administration of molnupiravir may reduce rebound rate and shorten time to viral clearance.

Molnupiravir Increases Transition Mutations and Strongly Inhibits Viral Replication

A model assuming that molnupiravir reduces viral production rate, π (t), best described viral load data (Figure 2):

where.

The maximal direct effect of molnupiravir in inhibiting viral production, ε MV, was estimated at 67% (90% CI, 66%–68%; Table 1, Supplementary Table 2). Considering molnupiravir's effect on mutations, our model predicted that molnupiravir strongly increased the rate of transition mutations from 66% (90% CI, 66%–66%) at treatment initiation to 88% (90% CI, 87%–89%) on day 5 (Figure 4). This effect on transition mutation inhibited the viral replication rate by 76% (90% CI, 70%–80%; Figure 5). Thus, molnupiravir inhibited viral replication via mutation-independent (E MV) and mutation-mediated (E MP) mechanisms (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Together, these effects led to a strong inhibition of viral replication, estimated to 93% (90% CI, 92%–94%) at treatment completion. The action on transition mutation rate was also more sustained, maintaining a high viral inhibition, > 70% up to 2.0 days (90% CI, 2.0–3.0) after treatment completion. Consequently, 5-day molnupiravir shortened the time to viral clearance by 1.5 days (90% CI, 0.5–2.5) as compared with untreated individuals.

### Incidence of viral rebound after treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir [^114mnEoS]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Some patients treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir have experienced rebound of COVID-19 infections and symptoms; however, data are scarce on whether viral rebound also occurs in patients with COVID-19 receiving or not receiving molnupiravir.

Objective

To examine the incidence of viral rebound in patients with COVID-19 who were treated with the oral antiviral agents nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study identified 41 255 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from January 1, 2022, to March 31, 2022, in Hong Kong and assessed 12 629 patients with serial cycle threshold (Ct) values measured. Patients were followed up until the occurrence of the clinical end point of interest, death, date of data retrieval (July 31, 2022), or up to 30 days of follow-up, whichever came first.

Exposures

Molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Viral rebound, defined as a Ct value greater than 40 that decreased to 40 or less.

Results

Of 12 629 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.4 [20.9] years; 6624 [52.5%] male), 11 688 (92.5%) were oral antiviral nonusers, 746 (5.9%) were molnupiravir users, and 195 (1.5%) were nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users. Compared with nonusers, oral antiviral users were older, had more comorbidities, and had lower complete vaccination rates. The mean (SD) baseline Ct value was slightly higher in nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users (22.2 [6.0]) than nonusers (21.0 [5.4]) and molnupiravir users (20.9 [5.4]) (P = 0.04). Viral rebound occurred in 68 nonusers (0.6%), 2 nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users (1.0%), and 6 molnupiravir users (0.8%). Among 76 patients with viral rebound, 12 of 68 nonusers, 1 of 6 molnupiravir users, and neither of the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users died of COVID-19.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, viral rebound was uncommon in patients taking molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and was not associated with increased risk of mortality. Given these findings, novel oral antivirals should be considered as a treatment for more patients with COVID-19 in the early phase of the infection.

### Characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variation in response to molnupiravir treatment in the AGILE phase IIa clinical trial [^1171joFu]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Molnupiravir was predicted to increase the number of mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1b) and that this would manifest as an increase in the transition/transversion (Ts/Tv) ratio. The sequencing data indicated that transition mutations were significantly increased in viral RNA from molnupiravir treated participants at Day 3 or Day 5 compared to participants given a placebo (Fig. 1c). The frequency of C → U mutations were higher than those for G → A (Fig. 1d). U → C mutations were also significantly increased. All other base changes showed no increase over time in either group (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The implications of greater viral diversity in response to molnupiravir treatment are currently unknown, but it could potentially influence the genetic barrier to resistance. To address this, SARS-CoV-2 sequence was translated in silico at both the dominant and minor variant genome level and treatment-emergent mutations were analysed to assess preferential enrichment of mutations (i.e. was there a greater chance of mutations arising during treatment and then persisting in these regions thereafter). Given the mechanism by which molnupiravir may avoid detection by viral replication machinery, we postulated that the two coding regions more likely to be subject to selection pressure would be nsp12 (the RNA dependent RNA polymerase; RdRp) and nsp14 (the exonuclease). Being able to detect the incorporation of molnupiravir instead of natural nucleotides in the nascent RNA would allow either NSP12 or NSP14 to stall or back-track and excise the mis-incorporated nucleotide analogue. Two previous in vitro studies on the incorporation of molnupiravir into the nascent RNA strand found that molnupiravir did not cause polymerase stalling, but one of the studies demonstrated that molnupiravir was capable of inducing chain termination. If chain termination occurred, this may have placed selection pressure on both the RdRp and the exonuclease to counter the effects of molnupiravir. This is similar to what has recently been described for SARS-CoV-2 in an immunocompromised patient treated with remdesivir. In our study, the data indicated that there was no change in the predicted amino acid sequence of NSP12 and NSP14 at the dominant genome level over the five days of molnupiravir treatment (Fig. 2 b, c).

Practical and clinical considerations — formulations and administration for pediatric initial regimens: The availability of FDC formulations and method of administration are important considerations in the selection of a Preferred initial regimen. BIC/FTC/TAF (Biktarvy) is a single-tablet regimen for children weighing ≥ 14 kg; the tablet may not be crushed or dissolved; however, it can be split in half prior to dosing for ease of swallowing, and it is available in two formulations for children able to swallow pills, including BIC 30 mg/FTC 120 mg/TAF 15 mg for children weighing ≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg and BIC 50 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg for children weighing ≥ 25 kg. ABC/DTG/3TC (Triumeq PD) is a dispersible tablet that can be used in children weighing < 25 kg and should be dissolved in water; each tablet contains all three drugs and the number of tablets per dose is based on a child's weight. ABC/DTG/3TC (Triumeq) is a nondispersible, single-tablet regimen option for children weighing ≥ 25 kg who are able to swallow whole pills; however, a disadvantage is the larger pill size, which can make swallowing challenging compared with the other recommended options. DTG plus FTC/TAF is dosed once daily; DTG is available as dispersible tablets (Tivicay PD) and as a film-coated tablet (Tivicay), and FTC/TAF (Descovy) is available in two different strengths as a single tablet to be swallowed.

Crushing film-coated tablets for administration — dispersible tablets are now considered the preferred formulation for pediatric patients weighing < 20 kg, and film-coated tablets should not be used in children weighing < 14 kg. In children weighing > 14 kg who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets, when the preferred dispersible tablets are not available, the 50-mg tablets may be split into halves with immediate ingestion of both halves or crushed and added to a small amount of semisolid food or liquid, all of which must be consumed immediately. In healthy adults, crushed tablets resulted in slightly higher exposures than whole tablets, and no information exists on the impact of splitting or crushing film-coated tablets on palatability. Some case reports describe DTG-containing film-coated tablets being crushed and successfully administered via orogastric tube or nasogastric tube; if DTG is administered via enteral tube, care should be taken to disperse the tablets completely and flush the tube to avoid clogging.

### Hepatitis C virus RNA levels at week-2 of telaprevir / boceprevir administration are predictive of virological outcome [^116HmRrX]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Triple therapy with telaprevir/boceprevir + pegylated-interferon+ribavirin can achieve excellent antiviral efficacy, but it can be burdened with resistance development at failure.

Aims

To evaluate kinetics of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA decay and early resistance development, in order to promptly identify patients at highest risk of failure to first generation protease inhibitors.

Methods

HCV-RNA was prospectively quantified in 158 patients receiving pegylated-interferon+ribavirin+telaprevir (N = 114) or+boceprevir (N = 44), at early time-points and during per protocol follow-up. Drug resistance was contextually evaluated by population sequencing.

Results

HCV-RNA at week-2 was significantly higher in patients experiencing virological failure to triple-therapy than in patients with sustained viral response (2.3 [1.9–2.8] versus 1.2 [0.3–1.7]log IU/mL, p < 0.001). A 100 IU/mL cut-off value for week-2 HCV-RNA had the highest sensitivity (86%) in predicting virological success. Indeed, 23/23 (100%) patients with undetectable HCV-RNA reached success, versus 26/34 (76.5%) patients with HCV-RNA < 100 IU/mL, and only 11/31 (35.5%) with HCV-RNA > 100 IU/mL (p < 0.001). Furthermore, differently from failing patients, none of the patient with undetectable HCV-RNA at week-2 had baseline/early resistance.

Conclusions

With triple therapy based on first generation protease inhibitors, suboptimal HCV-RNA decay at week-2 combined with early detection of resistance can help identifying patients with higher risk of virological failure, thus requiring a closer monitoring during therapy.

### How soluble misfolded proteins bypass chaperones at the molecular level [^113uThW9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Theoretical distribution of all potential PK cut-sites for random selection

As the LiP-MS data was analyzed across a proteome-wide analysis the data for each individual protein may suffer from a lack of coverage sufficient for random sampling. Therefore, we must generate a theoretical distribution of half-tryptic peptides. First calculating the intrinsic probability of PK cutting at a specific site across the proteome-wide set of dataWhereis the observed probability of a given AA being cut by PK andis the probability of AA across the proteome estimated from the protein databank. We then calculate the probability of observing a half-tryptic peptide with a given length and the number of internal trypsin cut sites across the proteome to control for the different time scales at which PK and trypsin are allowed to digest the protein (1 min for PK, 12 hrs for Trypsin). We then prepare a list of all possible half-tryptic peptides and randomly choose a peptide with replacement 10,000,000 times. For each iteration we generate two random number on the interval [0,1], one for the probability of a PK site being cut and the other for the probability of observing a peptide with a given length and a number of internal trypsin cut sites. If both of these random numbers are less than their respective probabilities than we accept the peptide into the theoretical set if it is not already present.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^116cGk8h]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). High credibility.

Nonoccupational HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) — darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (DRV/COBI/FTC/TAF) is dosed as DRV 800 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 10 mg by mouth once daily. Administration is to take with food; tablet may be split in half, but both parts should be consumed immediately after splitting. Most common side effects include Diarrhea, rash, nausea, fatigue, headache, abdominal discomfort, flatulence; screen for drug interactions; and because it inhibits CYP3A enzyme resulting in many contraindications with medications, drug interaction review is critical. Cautions include risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis, use with caution in persons with a sulfonamide allergy, may cause drug-induced hepatitis, potential exacerbation of HBV infection upon initiation or discontinuation of treatment, and that cobicistat increases serum creatinine without affecting glomerular filtration rate. Renal dosing is eCrCl ≥ 30 mL/min use standard dose; eCrCl < 30 mL/min and not on HD not recommended; and on HD use standard dose and administer after HD on dialysis days. Hepatic guidance is Child-Pugh class A and B use standard dose and Child-Pugh class C not recommended; pregnancy not recommended; and pediatric weight guidance states Weight ≥ 40 kg use standard dose and Weight < 40 kg not recommended.

### No one size fits all-shortening duration of therapy with direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C genotype 1 infection [^115Y4s8r]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2017). Low credibility.

The advent of shorter duration, highly effective and well-tolerated interferon-free therapy now provides an opportunity for virtually all HCV-infected individuals to be cured. However, there continues to be a need to simplify and shorten treatment duration. Shortening therapy to 8 weeks with sofosbuvir and ledipasvir can be considered in treatment patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and low baseline viral load. A number of other 8-week dual and triple therapy direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are in advanced clinical development. Several small studies have further demonstrated the feasibility of 6 weeks of sofosbuvir therapy in combination with an NS5A inhibitor and a protease inhibitor for HCV genotype 1. Four weeks of therapy with various combinations of the currently available DAAs appears to be suboptimal with poor response rates observed in phase 2 trials. Response-guided therapy is another promising tool that may allow for shorter therapy but require further research. Shortening therapy and retreating relapsers may be a viable cost-saving measure, but requires further cost-benefit analysis and more data on the impact of resistance on retreatment options.

2.4 Determination of Radiochemical Purity of Radiolabeled Lymphoseek

Determine radiochemical purity of the reconstituted radiolabeled Lymphoseek by Instant Thin Layer Chromatography (ITLC) using either Whatman Grade 1, 3MM, 31ET Chr or Biodex 150–001 Red Strips (cellulose chromatography paper) using the following method:

Mark the chromatographic strip for origin, mid and solvent front lines with a pencil as shown below:

Apply a small drop (3–10 microliters) of the reconstituted product at the center of the origin line chromatography strip. Let the product spot dry.
Place the strip into a chromatography chamber containing 1 mL of acetone as the developing solvent. Allow the solvent to migrate to the solvent front line (5 cm from the bottom of the Whatman strips and 3.5 cm for the Biodex strip). Remove the strip from the chamber, let it dry and cut it in half. Count each half of the strip with a suitable radioactivity counting apparatus (dose calibrator or multichannel analyzer).

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use)

General Administration Information [see Dosage and Administration (2)]:

Advise patients and caregivers to pay special attention to accurate preparation and administration of their dose to minimize the risk of accidental overdose or underdose of NORVIR.
For Norvir oral powder, advise patients or caregivers to read and follow the Instructions for Use for preparing the correct dose.
Advise caregivers to inform their healthcare provider if their child's weight changes in order to make sure that the child's NORVIR dose is adjusted as needed.
Advise patients to take NORVIR with meals.
For adult patients taking NORVIR tablets, the maximum dose of 600 mg twice daily by mouth with meals should not be exceeded.
Advise patients to remain under the care of a physician while using NORVIR and to take NORVIR and other concomitant antiretroviral therapy every day as prescribed. NORVIR must always be used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Advise patients not to alter the dose or discontinue therapy without consulting with their healthcare provider. If a dose of NORVIR is missed patients should take the dose as soon as possible and then return to their normal schedule. However, if a dose is skipped the patient should not double the next dose.
Continued NORVIR therapy at a dose of 600 mg twice daily following loss of viral suppression may increase the likelihood of cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors.
NORVIR is not a cure for HIV-1 infection and patients may continue to experience illnesses associated with HIV-1 infection, including opportunistic infections. Patients should remain under the care of a physician when using NORVIR.

### Eight weeks of sofosbuvir / velpatasvir for genotype 3 hepatitis C in previously untreated patients with significant (F2 / 3) fibrosis [^112LjHVx]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Medium credibility.

In the light of the available data, we speculated that 8‐week SOF/VEL would be an appropriate treatment regimen for noncirrhotic patients. In order to maximize the number of patients treated and cured of their hepatitis C, we took a pragmatic decision to treat for 8 weeks. This off label treatment duration allowed us to treat three patients for the price of two treatments as per the label.

Our results confirm the efficacy of this approach with excellent intention to treat (95.5%) and per‐protocol (100%) results, and 8 weeks is now the recommended duration for treatment‐naive GT3 patients with F0‐3 disease in Scotland. 8 Excellent results in a cohort of patients with significant drug use and high rates of OAT add to the growing body of evidence that current drug use is not a barrier to successful HCV treatment. 9 Two patients achieved SVR after 6 weeks of treatment, one with F2 fibrosis (LSM 8.8 kPa, viral load 6.7 log IU/ml) and one with F3 fibrosis (LSM 10.3 kPa, viral load 6.6 log IU/ml), indicating that for some patients, successful treatment is possible with even shorter durations of therapy. However, a further two patients with abbreviated treatment failed to achieve SVR, one F2 patient with a high viral load treated for 4 weeks (LSM 7.4 kPa, viral load 6.91 log IU/mL) and one F3 patient with HIV co‐infection treated for 6 weeks (LSM 11.0, viral load 3.43 log IU/mL). Further work is required to better characterize those for whom less than 8 weeks of treatment is sufficient to achieve SVR.

Press a clean cotton ball or gauze pad over the injection site for a few seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You may see slight bleeding or a drop of liquid. This is normal. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if needed.

Step 12: Dispose of (throw away) the used BIMZELX prefilled syringe (see Figure J).

Put the used BIMZELX prefilled syringe in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) the BIMZELX prefilled syringe in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:
made of a heavy-duty plastic,
can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,
upright and stable during use,
leak-resistant, and
properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.
When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away needles and syringes.

2.2	Recommended Treatment Regimen and Duration in Patients 3 Years of Age and Older with Genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 HCV

Table 1 shows the recommended ledipasvir and sofosbuvir treatment regimen and duration based on patient population. Relapse rates are affected by baseline host and viral factors and differ between treatment durations for certain subgroups [see Clinical Studies (14)].

For patients with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection, follow the dosage recommendations in Table 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Refer to Drug Interactions (7) for dosage recommendations for concomitant HIV-1 antiviral drugs.

2.3	Recommended Dosage in Adults

The recommended dosage of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir in adults with genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 HCV is one tablet (90 mg ledipasvir and 400 mg sofosbuvir) taken orally once daily with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The daily dosage of ribavirin is weight-based (1000 mg for patients < 75 kg and 1200 mg for those ≥ 75 kg) administered orally in two divided doses with food.

In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, the starting dosage of ribavirin is 600 mg and can be titrated up to 1000 mg for patients < 75 kg and 1200 mg for those ≥ 75 kg in two divided doses with food. If the starting dosage of ribavirin is not well tolerated, the dosage should be reduced as clinically indicated based on hemoglobin levels.

### Stability of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine tablet halves during prolonged storage under tropical conditions [^116AZfDN]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Eurartesim (40/320 mg) tablets (N = 360; Lot 141450; Exp 11/2016) were purchased from Manson's Chemists Ltd (London E78BA, United Kingdom). Other chemicals were of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or analytical grade from various commercial sources.

The short-term stability of DP tablets halves was investigated within their expiry date (January to April 2016) in a "natural ageing" study over 3 months' light on (320–400 nm) and light off in climatic zone IV(30°C and 70% relative humidity) using a pharmaceutical stability chambers (PSC022, Weiss Gallenkamp, United Kingdom). Two hundred and forty tablets were manually split in half using as fragmentation of tablets was rather high when using a pill cutter. The halves were then put back in their blister.–show the photos of tablets being broken manually and placed in the blister pack for ageing. Two hundred and forty halves were kept in light and 240 halves in darkness in the stability chamber. At defined time points, that is, 0 hours (= nonaged), 24 hours, 3 days, 1 calendar month, and 3 calendar months, 48 tablet halves from each light exposure group were removed (Table 1), and stored in their blister packs at 4°C until analysis (within 1 week of removal from the chamber).

2.4 Procedure for Determining Radiochemical Purity

Use the following procedures for radiolabeling Y-90 Zevalin:

Place a small drop of Y-90 Zevalin at the origin of an ITLC silica gel strip.
Place the ITLC silica gel strip into a chromatography chamber with the origin at the bottom and the solvent front at the top. Allow the solvent (0.9% NaCl) to migrate at least 5 cm from the bottom of the strip. Remove the strip from the chamber and cut the strip in half. Count each half of the ITLC silica gel strip for one minute (CPM) with a suitable counting apparatus.
Calculate the percent RCP as follows:
Repeat the ITLC procedure if the radiochemical purity is < 95%. If repeat testing confirms that radiochemical purity is < 95%, do not administer the Y-90 Zevalin dose.

2.5 Radiation Dosimetry

During clinical trials with Zevalin, estimations of radiation-absorbed doses for Y-90 Zevalin were performed using sequential whole body images and the MIRDOSE 3 software program. The estimated radiation absorbed doses to organs and marrow from a course of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen are summarized in Table 1. Absorbed dose estimates for the lower large intestine, upper large intestine, and small intestine have been modified from the standard MIRDOSE 3 output to account for the assumption that activity is within the intestine wall rather than the intestine contents.

### Minimum costs for producing hepatitis C direct-acting antivirals for use in large-scale treatment access programs in developing countries [^115VGGRW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

METHODS

In this analysis, the molecular structures of HCV DAAs were compared with their closest analogues in the treatment of HIV. We evaluated the likely routes of manufacturing as published by the originator companies and assumed a volume demand based on 1–5 million patients per year to arrive at approximate costs of DAA APIs. We then added on a 40% margin for finished production manufacturing (formulation) to arrive at a projected cost of therapy.

The purpose of this analysis is to logically speculate whether DAAs can be provided for millions of people at a reasonable cost. The analysis is not meant to be exact or to arrive at a "most likely optimized cost" for any individual or combination DAA therapy. Very little information is presently available to estimate actual commercial formulation costs for DAAs. These DAAs are all delivered orally using conventional technologies. Projected API costs for these DAAs range from US$1400–to US$21 000 per kilogram; as such, the very high relative costs of API would justify a 40% increment as a reasonable add-on for estimating cost of the finished dosage form.

The minimum treatment costs of comparator HIV ARVs were calculated using the lowest prices reported by manufacturers to Médecins Sans Frontières in 2012. Minimum costs per gram of ARVs ranged from US$0.20 to US$0.90 per gram for nucleoside analogues, US$0.50 per gram for nucleotide analogues, and US$0.70–$2.10 per gram for protease inhibitors (Table 3).

Table 3.
Minimum Costs of HIV Antiretrovirals, by Increasing Cost per Gram

Four HCV DAAs were included in this study: daclatasvir (phase 3), sofosbuvir (approved December 2013), faldaprevir (phase 3), and simeprevir (approved November 2013). Ribavirin, already available in generic form, was also included in this analysis due to its likely inclusion in future drug regimens. Using the most likely daily dosage identified from clinical trials, the total drug requirement for each DAA was calculated for a 12-week course of each HCV DAA. To estimate the manufacturing cost of each HCV DAA, current routes of synthesis and critical cost-limiting raw materials were taken from the patent literature. In an alternative comparison, each compound was matched to the closest equivalent HIV ARV based on structural similarity.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of setrobuvir, an orally administered hepatitis C virus non-nucleoside analogue inhibitor [^115vpsDu]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

New antiviral agents with activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are needed to optimize treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We evaluated the pharmacokinetics of setrobuvir (a non-nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitor) in healthy volunteers (study 1 & 2) and its antiviral efficacy in patients with genotype 1, noncirrhotic treatment-naive CHC (study 3).

Methods

Three studies investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of setrobuvir. First, sequential cohorts of volunteers were randomly assigned to receive single oral doses of setrobuvir 400 to 3000 mg or placebo in a double-blind, ascending dose study. In the second study, volunteers were randomly assigned to receive multiple doses of setrobuvir (400 or 800 mg once daily [QD] or 600 mg twice a day [BID]). In the third study, patients with genotype 1 CHC received setrobuvir (200, 400, or 800 mg) or placebo BID for 3 days.

Findings

After single doses of setrobuvir (400–3000 mg) to volunteers in a fasted state, peak Cmax and AUC₀–∞ increased in a less than dose-proportional manner. The mean apparent t½z ranged from 22.0 to 31.3 hours and was not dose related. Cmax and AUC increased significantly (4.3- and 6.3-fold, respectively) in volunteers who received 2000 mg with a high-fat meal versus fasting. After multiple oral doses, steady state was achieved after 7 days of dosing (400 or 800 mg QD and 600 mg BID) and accumulation was dose-independent. Mean day 14 plasma exposure increased in a less than dose-proportional manner in volunteers who received 400 and 800 mg QD, but it was more than dose-proportional in volunteers receiving 600 mg BID. Dose did not affect the mean t½z (range, 24.1–26.6 hours), apparent oral clearance (0.254–0.516 L/h), or apparent volume of distribution (9.60–18.1 L). In patients with CHC, dose-related reductions in HCV RNA concentration were apparent within 24 hours of the start of treatment. Reductions from baseline to the end of treatment (day 3) in patients treated with setrobuvir 200, 400, and 800 mg BID were -2.1, -2.2, and -2.9 log10 IU/mL, respectively (vs ≤ 0.1 log10 IU/mL with placebo). Reductions in HCV RNA were greater in patients with genotype 1b (range, -2.7 to -3.1 log10 IU/mL) than in patients with genotype 1a (range, -1.3 to -2.7 log10 IU/mL). Setrobuvir was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events.

Implications

The steady state pharmacokinetics of setrobuvir appear to be dose proportional, and setrobuvir produces a mean reduction of 2.9 log10 IU/mL in HCV RNA over 3 days in patients with genotype 1 (a and b) treated with 800 mg BID. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00782353.

Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) and single-tablet regimens (STRs) in pediatric HIV — "once-daily options for children" include STRs that, among "youth in the United States aged 13 to 24 years who do not have treatment experience", have "some evidence" to "improve the odds of viral suppression", with "emerging evidence also" for safety, efficacy, and tolerability in younger children; although "these data have not been replicated in treatment-experienced adolescents", clinicians "should consider using STRs in children and youth with sustained viral suppression because these regimens reduce pill burden and dosing frequency". The IMPAACT 2019 study "demonstrated safety, efficacy, and appropriate dosing of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet containing abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine (ABC/DTG/3TC) in children aged < 12 years", using "dispersible tablets (Triumeq PD) or an immediate-release tablet (Triumeq) to be swallowed depending on the child's weight". For children "weighing ≥ 14 kg who can swallow pills, additional options include coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF; Biktarvy) or FTC/TAF (Descovy) plus DTG, which is a two-pill, once-daily regimen", and "additional coformulated options are available when children reach 25 kg to 35 kg in weight".

Preferred regimens for children Aged ≥ 2 Years to < 12 Years who are able to swallow pills — options and dosing notes: BIC plus FTC plus TAF (FDC BIC/FTC/TAF, Biktarvy) for children weighing ≥ 14 kg, DTG plus FTC plus TAF (DTG, Tivicay, plus the FDC FTC/TAF, Descovy) for children weighing ≥ 14 kg, and DTG plus ABC plus 3TC (FDC DTG/ABC/3TC, Triumeq) for children weighing ≥ 25 kg if HLA-B✱5701 negative are listed, and the Panel recommends initiating ART with a once-daily, single-tablet regimen of BIC/FTC/TAF (Biktarvy) for children weighing ≥ 14 kg. Two different strengths of BIC/FTC/TAF tablets are available, with the lower-strength tablet for children weighing ≥ 14 kg and < 25 kg, and the product label states the BIC/FTC/TAF tablet can be split and each part taken separately, as long as all parts are ingested within approximately 10 minutes. DTG/3TC/ABC (Triumeq) is another Preferred single-tablet regimen option for children weighing ≥ 25 kg, but the DTG/3TC/ABC pill is much larger than the BIC/FTC/TAF pill and might be more challenging to swallow, and if DTG/3TC/ABC is selected, documentation of a negative HLA-B✱5701 screening should occur prior to treatment initiation. For children weighing ≥ 14 kg, the film-coated tablet of DTG (Tivicay) used in conjunction with the FDC tablets of FTC/TAF (Descovy) is also recommended by the Panel.

Generic antiretrovirals and multi-tablet regimens — economic impact and availability — are highlighted: In 2023, savings to the U.S. health care system from generic drugs and biosimilars totaled $445 billion, including $137 billion and $206 billion in savings to Medicare and commercial insurers, respectively, and total generic and biosimilar savings for the past 10 years are estimated to be $3.1 trillion. Several antiretroviral regimens and components remain listed beyond patent protection and are or will be available as lower-cost generic options, and there is interest in assessing the economic value of newer, more expensive drugs compared with older, less expensive generic drugs with established clinical safety and efficacy, such as generic tenofovir disoproxil.

### Toward consensus on correct interpretation of protein binding in plasma and other biological matrices for COVID-19 therapeutic development [^117FPb1q]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

When considering other relevant tissue compartments for SARS‐CoV‐2, such as the central nervous system or lungs, the case for lopinavir activity is even less favorable. Several independent groups have estimated that the concentrations of lopinavir required to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 replication in epithelial lining fluid and cerebrospinal fluid may be several times higher than those measured in vivo. Thus, a consideration of free drug concentrations in other relevant matrices is likely to be needed to underpin successful therapeutic development, but a lack of standardized methodology complicated robust investigation.

Figure 1b shows the mean plasma concentration time profile for remdesivir following multiple dose administration of 150 mg to healthy volunteers. The free drug fraction of remdesivir in human plasma has been reported as 0.121 (12.1%)and this value has been used to derive the unbound plasma profile, which is also shown in Figure 1b. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) compassionate use summary for remdesivir references two EC₅₀ values as 0.137 μM (82.6 ng/mL) and 0.77 μM (464.0 ng/mL) and this range is also presented in Figure 1b. This EC₅₀ represents an extracellular metric and, therefore, it is appropriate to use plasma rather than intracellular concentrations in this comparison. However, as for other ProTide nucleoside prodrugs (e.g. sofosbuvir and tenofovir alafenamide), remdesivir accumulates intracellularly and its half‐life intracellularly is much longer than in plasma when determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from humans administered the drug intravenously. This sets ProTide nucleosides apart from drugs, such as lopinavir, that do not require intracellular bioactivation and for which the intracellular to plasma ratio remains constant across the dosing interval. Furthermore, drugs in this class are dependent upon multiple activation pathways that are reported to differ between in vitro and in vivo measures. Adequate plasma C max is required to achieve target intracellular concentrations but maintaining plasma concentrations above in vitro ‐defined extracellular cutoffs is not a prerequisite for success of this class because intracellular concentrations are maintained long after plasma concentrations fall below therapeutic concentrations. Thus, the presented comparison should be interpreted with caution for this class and robustly validated cell‐free assay systems will greatly aid understanding. Free drug concentrations of remdesivir in culture media containing serum or anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 activity in the presence of different serum concentrations have also not yet been reported, and it is not possible to derive a prediction of the true unbound antiviral activity. The requirement for reliable demonstration of equivalency in rate and extent of intracellular prodrug bioactivation in vitro and in vivo makes a robust assessment highly ambitious. However, these data caution against the derivation of plasma unbound concentrations using a comparison with an antiviral activity measurement that was obtained in the presence of serum.

Pharmacokinetics

The 14 patients enrolled in the pharmacokinetic lead‐in phase had a median age of 5 years (range, 3‐5), 12 were white (86%), and 9 were female (64%), with a median weight of 20 kg (range, 12‐28). Median BMI was 16 kg/m² (range, 14‐19) with a corresponding median BMI for age percentile of 73% (range, 2‐98). Of the 14 patients enrolled, 13 were included in the intensive pharmacokinetic analysis. The patient who was not included in the analysis did not take the study drug as required within the 30 minutes of initial sampling. Plasma exposures of sofosbuvir, GS‐331007, and ledipasvir in the 13 patients receiving the weight‐based dosages of 33.75 mg/150 mg or 45 mg/200 mg of ledipasvir‐sofosbuvir were comparable to those observed in adults receiving 90 mg/400 mg of ledipasvir‐sofosbuvir in clinical trials. The 90% CIs for GS‐331007 and ledipasvir AUC tau and C max in patients 3 to < 6 were within the predefined pharmacokinetic equivalence boundaries of 50%‐200% when compared to adults from the phase 2 and 3 studies (Table 4). Despite the upper bounds of the 90% CI for sofosbuvir AUC tau and C max exceeding the upper equivalence boundary, the observed sofosbuvir exposures were within the ranges observed in adult phase 2/3 studies, in which no dose‐response relationships for sofosbuvir exposure and safety metrics were observed. Thus, based on the favorable safety profile of sofosbuvir, the increase in exposure was not deemed clinically significant.
