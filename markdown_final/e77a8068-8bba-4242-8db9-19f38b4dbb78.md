## Question

Atrial fibrillation in acute illness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing atrial fibrillation in acute illness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and frame acute atrial fibrillation in the context of acute illness. Then, I should verify the immediate assessment priorities, especially hemodynamics and triggers. Next, I will examine rate versus rhythm control decisions and drug choices in special populations. After that, I need to check anticoagulation strategy, including pericardioversion rules and the uncertainty in critical illness. Finally, I should confirm long-term planning, monitoring, and follow-up, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't anchor on outdated concepts. Acute atrial fibrillation in the setting of acute illness refers to new-onset or previously unrecognized AF detected during hospitalization for another condition, with incidence ranging widely across settings and highest in critical illness and after surgery, and importantly, it carries a high risk of recurrence and adverse outcomes even after the acute precipitant resolves, which mandates structured follow-up and risk stratification [^115pW1DX] [^114JsNzq] [^115SqVJZ].

> I need to check the immediate assessment priorities before jumping to drugs. Hemodynamic instability attributable to AF warrants urgent synchronized direct-current cardioversion without delay, while in stable patients I should confirm duration, identify and treat reversible triggers such as sepsis, hypoxia, electrolyte derangements, myocardial ischemia, thyroid dysfunction, and drug toxicity, and I should screen for structural heart disease and thromboembolic risk using echocardiography when appropriate, because these factors shape both acute and longitudinal management [^114z1UZd] [^115pW1DX] [^1161NRXM] [^114u4Z4h].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about rate versus rhythm control; I should align with guideline-based strategy selection. In hemodynamically unstable patients, immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated, whereas in stable patients, rate control is generally first-line and sufficient for many, with rhythm control reserved for persistent symptoms despite rate control, intolerance of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, or when rhythm restoration is expected to improve outcomes such as in heart failure or ischemia, recognizing that contemporary trials have not shown universal superiority of rhythm over rate control in all-comers [^114z1UZd] [^116cQg1a] [^114u4Z4h].

> Let me think about rate control specifics and targets, and I should double-check exceptions. Beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred for acute rate control in stable patients without decompensated heart failure, with a lenient resting heart rate target of less than 100–110 bpm reasonable initially, while stricter targets can be used if symptoms persist; in decompensated heart failure or critical illness where first-line agents are ineffective or contraindicated, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable, though I must remember amiodarone can facilitate cardioversion and thus trigger thromboembolic risk considerations if AF duration is unknown or prolonged [^111Sdrky] [^113b9KYs] [^115yL76f] [^116MWexS] [^111jfJvB].

> Wait, let me verify rhythm control indications and pericardioversion anticoagulation so I don't miss a safety step. Electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacologic and is preferred when rapid restoration is needed or when drug therapy fails, but if AF duration is unknown or greater than 48 hours, I should either provide therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion or perform transesophageal echocardiography to exclude left atrial appendage thrombus, followed by at least 4 weeks of anticoagulation after cardioversion due to transient atrial mechanical dysfunction; in truly recent-onset AF within 48 hours with low thromboembolic risk, some centers cardiovert without prolonged precardioversion anticoagulation, but I need to ensure shared decision-making and reliable follow-up [^114z1UZd] [^111tGoXH] [^112AkTaH] [^117DwThn].

> I should confirm pharmacologic rhythm control options and their caveats in acute illness. Amiodarone is commonly used in the ICU and in patients with structural heart disease or decompensation, whereas class IC agents like flecainide or propafenone are generally avoided in significant structural heart disease and in acute coronary syndromes; magnesium can be a useful adjunct for rate control and may reduce arrhythmia burden in select contexts, and I need to weigh proarrhythmic risks and hemodynamic effects carefully in critically ill patients [^111jfJvB] [^116Q1V7p] [^116mmop5].

> But wait, what if the patient is critically ill with sepsis; I need to ensure anticoagulation decisions reflect the best available evidence. Observational data in septic AF show no reduction in ischemic stroke with parenteral anticoagulation during critical illness and an increased risk of clinically significant bleeding, and contemporary guidelines rate evidence for anticoagulation in this setting as uncertain, so I should individualize decisions and generally avoid routine therapeutic anticoagulation in septic NOAF unless the thromboembolic risk is very high and bleeding risk is low, with explicit reassessment after ICU discharge [^112D1vyn] [^114T2pLA] [^111QusLS].

> Let me reconsider anticoagulation outside sepsis so I don't overgeneralize. For patients with AF identified during acute medical illness or surgery, I should use CHA2DS2-VASc to guide long-term oral anticoagulation decisions and counsel patients about high recurrence risk, arranging close outpatient follow-up; pericardioversion anticoagulation rules still apply for elective cardioversion, and in patients with acute ischemic stroke and AF, starting anticoagulation at 4–14 days post-stroke is reasonable to balance bleeding and thromboembolic risks [^111QusLS] [^111tGoXH] [^116iyueR].

> I should double-check long-term planning because missing this step is common. Given recurrence rates of roughly 40–70% over several years after acute illness–associated AF, I need to arrange rhythm monitoring with ECGs, Holter, or extended ambulatory monitoring, reinforce lifestyle and risk factor modification, and reassess the need for ongoing rate or rhythm control and anticoagulation at regular intervals, ideally within a structured AF program to ensure continuity [^114JsNzq] [^113RESiY] [^116NqtUk].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and contexts so I don't overlook nuances. In obstructive lung disease, I should avoid beta-blockers and favor nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for rate control, while correcting hypoxemia and acidosis; in acute coronary syndromes, urgent cardioversion is indicated for instability, and rate control with beta-blockade or amiodarone is reasonable, with anticoagulation tailored to ischemic and bleeding risks; in postoperative states, both rate and rhythm control strategies are acceptable with similar short-term rhythm outcomes, and anticoagulation should follow standard pericardioversion rules and stroke risk assessment [^116G8uEa] [^113D4CAt] [^115wTKkF].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach to ensure nothing critical is missing. In acute illness–associated AF, I will stabilize and treat triggers first, use rate control as initial therapy in stable patients with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and a lenient target, escalate to amiodarone when needed and safe, consider rhythm control for persistent symptoms or hemodynamic compromise with appropriate pericardioversion anticoagulation, avoid routine anticoagulation in septic NOAF given uncertain benefit and higher bleeding risk, and ensure robust outpatient follow-up with monitoring and risk factor modification because recurrence and complications are common and preventable with structured care [^115pW1DX] [^111Sdrky] [^114z1UZd] [^112D1vyn] [^111QusLS].

---

Atrial fibrillation (AF) in acute illness is common and often reflects a **reversible trigger** such as sepsis, hypoxia, electrolyte imbalance, or myocardial ischemia [^114JsNzq] [^114uY3B1]. Immediate priorities are to **stabilize hemodynamics**, correct reversible causes, and control the ventricular rate; rhythm control is reserved for instability or severe symptoms [^114z1UZd] [^116cQg1a]. Anticoagulation is individualized: use standard protocols for cardioversion or if AF persists > 48 hours, but avoid routine anticoagulation in critically ill sepsis due to bleeding risk and uncertain stroke benefit [^111tGoXH] [^112D1vyn]. AF in acute illness signals higher risks of stroke, heart failure, and death, and **requires close follow-up** for recurrence and thromboembolic risk stratification after discharge [^114JsNzq] [^111QusLS].

---

## Pathophysiology and triggers

AF in acute illness arises from a **combination of substrate and triggers**: underlying atrial vulnerability plus acute stressors that promote ectopy and reentry [^115pW1DX]. Common triggers include:

- **Sepsis and systemic inflammation**: Strongly associated with new-onset AF; incidence up to 46% in septic shock [^111U4D3w] [^113ZG6EC].

- **Hypoxia and respiratory failure**: Hypoxemia and hypercapnia increase AF risk, especially in COPD exacerbations [^116G8uEa].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and acid-base disorders predispose to AF [^notfound].

- **Myocardial ischemia and heart failure**: Acute coronary syndromes and decompensated HF frequently precipitate AF [^116mmop5].

- **Surgery and trauma**: Postoperative AF is common after cardiac and noncardiac surgery [^114u4Z4h] [^114JsNzq].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

AF in acute illness may be **symptomatic or silent**; continuous monitoring is often required in the ICU [^113bkUiW]. Presentation ranges from palpitations and dyspnea to hypotension, ischemia, or acute heart failure [^111bkLr2]. Diagnosis relies on ECG confirmation, with telemetry or Holter monitoring as needed [^115bxNU8].

---

## Acute management strategies

### Rate control

- **First-line therapy**: Beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) if EF > 40% [^111Sdrky].

- **Lenient rate target**: Resting HR < 100–110 bpm is acceptable initially; stricter targets for persistent symptoms [^113b9KYs] [^115yL76f].

- **Alternative agents**: IV amiodarone or magnesium for refractory cases or when standard agents are contraindicated [^116MWexS].

---

### Rhythm control

- **Indications**: Hemodynamic instability, severe symptoms, or failure of rate control [^114z1UZd].

- **Electrical cardioversion**: Preferred for unstable patients; do not delay for anticoagulation if life-threatening [^112AkTaH].

- **Pharmacological cardioversion**: Amiodarone, flecainide, or propafenone in selected stable patients; consider structural heart disease and QT risk [^111wzG5W].

---

### Anticoagulation

- **General principle**: Anticoagulate before cardioversion if AF > 48 hours or duration unknown; TEE-guided strategy is acceptable [^notfound].

- **Critical illness caveat**: Routine anticoagulation in sepsis-associated AF is uncertain; bleeding risk may outweigh benefit [^112D1vyn] [^114T2pLA].

- **Post-cardioversion**: Continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks, longer if high stroke risk [^111tGoXH].

---

## Long-term implications and follow-up

AF in acute illness carries **high recurrence and adverse outcomes**: recurrence 42–68% at 5 years, with increased risks of stroke, heart failure, and mortality [^114JsNzq]. Post-discharge care should include:

- **Counseling**: Discuss recurrence risk and symptoms [^111QusLS].

- **Monitoring**: Arrange rhythm surveillance and thromboembolic risk reassessment [^1136uqSc].

- **Risk factor modification**: Address hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea, alcohol, and diabetes [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

In obstructive lung disease, **avoid beta-blockers**; use calcium channel blockers for rate control [^116G8uEa]. In acute coronary syndromes, prioritize rate control and anticoagulation; consider rhythm control if ischemia persists [^116mmop5]. In postoperative patients, rate control is generally preferred, with rhythm control for refractory cases [^notfound].

---

AF in acute illness is a **marker of severity** and a driver of adverse outcomes. Management centers on stabilizing hemodynamics, correcting triggers, and individualized rate or rhythm control, with anticoagulation tailored to context. Structured follow-up is essential to address the high recurrence risk and thromboembolic complications [^115pW1DX].

### Atrial fibrillation occurring during acute hospitalization: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115pW1DX]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute atrial fibrillation is defined as atrial fibrillation detected in the setting of acute care or acute illness; atrial fibrillation may be detected or managed for the first time during acute hospitalization for another condition. Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery is a distinct type of acute atrial fibrillation. Acute atrial fibrillation is associated with high risk of long-term atrial fibrillation recurrence, warranting clinical attention during acute hospitalization and over long-term follow-up. A framework of substrates and triggers can be useful for evaluating and managing acute atrial fibrillation. Acute management requires a multipronged approach with interdisciplinary care collaboration, tailoring treatments to the patient's underlying substrate and acute condition. Key components of acute management include identification and treatment of triggers, selection and implementation of rate/rhythm control, and management of anticoagulation. Acute rate or rhythm control strategy should be individualized with consideration of the patient's capacity to tolerate rapid rates or atrioventricular dyssynchrony, and the patient's ability to tolerate the risk of the therapeutic strategy. Given the high risks of atrial fibrillation recurrence in patients with acute atrial fibrillation, clinical follow-up and heart rhythm monitoring are warranted. Long-term management is guided by patient substrate, with implications for intensity of heart rhythm monitoring, anticoagulation, and considerations for rhythm management strategies. Overall management of acute atrial fibrillation addresses substrates and triggers. The 3As of acute management are acute triggers, atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm management, and anticoagulation. The 2As and 2Ms of long-term management include monitoring of heart rhythm and modification of lifestyle and risk factors, in addition to considerations for atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm management and anticoagulation. Several gaps in knowledge related to acute atrial fibrillation exist and warrant future research.

### Atrial fibrillation in critical illness: state of the art [^111QWaEy]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia experienced by critically ill patients. It has been associated with adverse short-and long-term outcomes, including an increased risk of thromboembolic events, heart failure, and death. Due to complex and multifactorial pathophysiology, a heterogenous patient population, and a lack of clinical tools for risk stratification validated in this population, AF in critical illness is challenging to predict, prevent, and manage. Personalized management strategies that consider patient factors such as underlying cardiac structure and function, potentially reversible arrhythmogenic triggers, and risk for complications of AF are needed. Furthermore, evaluation of the effects of these interventions on long-term outcomes is warranted. Critical illness survivors who have had AF represent a unique population who require systematic follow-up after discharge. However, the frequency, type, and intensity of follow-up is unknown. This state-of-the-art review aims to summarize the evidence, contextualize the current guidelines within the setting of critical illness, and highlight gaps in knowledge and research opportunities to further our understanding of this arrhythmia and improve patient outcomes.

### Atrial fibrillation in the ICU [^112LTDvz]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in the ICU. Preexisting AF is highly prevalent among older patients with chronic conditions who are at risk for critical illness, whereas new-onset AF can be triggered by accelerated atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenic triggers encountered during critical illness. The acute loss of atrial systole and onset of rapid ventricular rates that characterize new-onset AF often lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise. Thus, new-onset AF is both a marker of disease severity as well as a likely contributor to poor outcomes, similar to other manifestations of organ dysfunction during critical illness. Evaluating immediate hemodynamic effects of new-onset AF during critical illness is an important component of rapid clinical assessment aimed at identifying patients in need of urgent direct current cardioversion, treatment of reversible inciting factors, and identification of patients who may benefit from pharmacologic rate or rhythm control. In addition to acute hemodynamic effects, new-onset AF during critical illness is associated with both short- and long-term increases in the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death, with AF recurrence rates of approximately 50% within 1 year following hospital discharge. In the absence of a strong evidence base, there is substantial practice variation in the choice of strategies for management of new-onset AF during critical illness. We describe acute and long-term evaluation and management strategies based on current evidence and propose future avenues of investigation to fill large knowledge gaps in the management of patients with AF during critical illness.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation [^111wzG5W]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Acute atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm encountered in clinical practice and is commonly seen in acutely ill patients in critical care. In the latter setting, AF may have two main clinical sequelae: (1) haemodynamic instability and (2) thromboembolism. The approach to the management of AF can broadly be divided into a rate control strategy or a rhythm control strategy, and is largely driven by symptom assessment and functional status. A crucial part of AF management requires the appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis. In patients who are haemodynamically unstable with AF, urgent direct current cardioversion should be considered. Apart from electrical cardioversion, drugs are commonly used, and Class I (flecainide, propafenone) and Class III (amiodarone) antiarrhythmic drugs are more likely to revert AF to sinus rhythm. Beta blockers and rate limiting calcium blockers, as well as digoxin, are often used in controlling heart rate in patients with acute onset AF. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the management of AF in the critical care setting.

### Management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^112R42iw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Although atrial fibrillation remains the most common cardiac arrhythmia, the treatment and disposition remain varied. An accept-able standard of practice requires an evidence-based approach. This approach has revealed that half of the patients who present with acute atrial fibrillation will convert to sinus rhythm without intervention. In the hemodynamically stable subset, ascertaining the on-set of atrial fibrillation within 48 hours is critical because this period dictates when and if anticoagulation should be instituted and if and where electrical or chemical cardioversion needs be performed. The hemodynamically unstable patient, however, requires emergent cardioversion, irrespective of the chronicity of atrial fibrillation. An evidence-based approach may serve to optimize treatment and obviate the need for unnecessary hospital admissions.

Atrial fibrillation — acute medical illness or surgery (including AF in critical care) recommendations specify the following: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) identified during acute medical illness or surgery should be counseled about the significant risk of recurrent AF after the acute illness is resolved (1 B-NR); in such patients, outpatient follow-up for thromboembolic risk stratification and decision-making on oral anticoagulation (OAC) initiation or continuation, as well as AF surveillance, can be beneficial given a high risk of AF recurrence (2a B-NR); and for AF in critical illness due to sepsis, the benefits of anticoagulation during critical illness for stroke prevention are uncertain (2b B-NR).

### Optimizing atrial fibrillation management: from ICU and beyond [^1148GPoR]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) that newly occurs during critical illness presents challenges for both short- and long-term management. During critical illness, patients with new-onset AF are clinically evaluated for hemodynamic instability owing to the arrhythmia as well as for potentially reversible arrhythmia triggers. Hemodynamically significant AF that persists during critical illness may be treated with heart rate or rhythm control strategies. Recent evidence suggests that patients in whom AF develops during acute illness (eg, sepsis, postoperatively) have high long-term risks for AF recurrence and for AF-associated complications, such as stroke, heart failure, and death. Therefore, we suggest increased efforts to improve communication of AF events between inpatient and outpatient providers and to reassess patients who had experienced new-onset AF during critical illness after they transition to the post-ICU setting. We describe various strategies for the assessment and long-term management of patients with new-onset AF during critical illness.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116qWL74]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation during critical illness — after a prescription for OACs within 30 days of admission, over 3-year follow-up there was no significant association between anticoagulation and a lower incidence of ischemic stroke or bleeding, with reported values ischemic stroke (OR, 1.98 [95% CI, 0.29–13.47]) and bleeding (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.29–3.21]). Gaps in knowledge exist and further research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of acute and long-term anticoagulation in critically ill patients with acute atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation after acute illness — monitoring and follow-up considerations include higher detection with continuous monitoring and uncertainty about optimal strategies. In patients with acute AF after cardiac surgery, observational studies show that those who underwent continuous rhythm monitoring had a higher detection of AF; no randomized clinical trial has specifically compared different monitoring strategies for outpatient follow-up of patients with acute AF, although CRYSTAL-AF and SEARCH-AF trials showed increased sensitivity for AF detection with long-term monitoring; and outpatient follow-up with consideration of heart rhythm monitoring and thromboembolic risk stratification is important given the high risk of AF recurrence, particularly after noncardiac surgery and in those with stroke risk factors.

### Screening and management of atrial fibrillation in primary care [^115D5saM]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common chronic disease seen in primary care offices, emergency departments, inpatient hospital services, and many subspecialty practices. Atrial fibrillation care is complicated and multifaceted, and, at various points, clinicians may see it as a consequence and cause of multi-morbidity, as a silent driver of stroke risk, as a bellwether of an acute medical illness, or as a primary rhythm disturbance that requires targeted treatment. Primary care physicians in particular must navigate these priorities, perspectives, and resources to meet the needs of individual patients. This includes judicious use of diagnostic testing, thoughtful use of novel therapeutic agents and procedures, and providing access to subspecialty expertise. This review explores the epidemiology, screening, and risk assessment of atrial fibrillation, as well as management of its symptoms (rate and various rhythm control options) and stroke risk (anticoagulation and other treatments), and offers a model for the integration of the components of atrial fibrillation care.

### Clinical review: clinical management of atrial fibrillation-rate control versus rhythm control [^1142SAom]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in the critically ill and is associated with adverse outcomes. Although there are plausible benefits from conversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm (the so-called 'rhythm-control' strategy), recent randomized trials have failed to demonstrate the superiority of this approach over the rate-control strategy. Regardless of approach, continuous therapeutic anticoagulation is crucial for stroke prevention. This review addresses the findings of these studies and their implications for clinical management of patients with atrial fibrillation.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114JsNzq]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation during acute medical illness or surgery — epidemiology and outcomes show wide incidence and high recurrence with adverse events. Incidence ranges from 1% to 46% in medical illness, with 6% to 22% in severe sepsis, and 3% to 16% after noncardiac surgery; recurrent AF was noted in 42% to 68% in acute medical illness and 39% after noncardiac surgery during 5-year follow-up. In 10 723 patients with newly diagnosed AF (67.9 ± 9.9 years, 41% women), 11% had an acute AF precipitant — cardiac surgery (22%), pneumonia (20%), and noncardiac surgery (15%) — and AF recurrence at 5 years was 41% with a precipitant versus 52% without (adjusted HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69–0.81]; P < 0.001). Regardless of a precipitant, recurrent AF was associated with increased risks of heart failure (HF; HR, 2.74 [95% CI, 2.39–3.15]; P < 0.001), stroke (HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30–1.90]; P < 0.001), and death (HR, 2.96 [95% CI, 2.70–3.24]; P < 0.001).

### The future of atrial fibrillation management: integrated care and stratified therapy [^111xAZtD]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the major cardiovascular health problems: it is a common, chronic condition, affecting 2–3% of the population in Europe and the United States and requiring 1–3% of health-care expenditure as a result of stroke, sudden death, heart failure, unplanned hospital admissions, and other complications. Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, ideally before the first complication occurs, remains a challenge, as shown by patients who are only diagnosed with the condition when admitted to hospital for acute cardiac decompensation or stroke. Once diagnosed, atrial fibrillation requires chronic, multidimensional management in five domains (acute management, treatment of underlying and concomitant cardiovascular conditions, stroke prevention therapy, rate control, and rhythm control). The consistent provision of these treatment options to all patients with atrial fibrillation is difficult, despite recent improvements in organisation of care, knowledge about atrial fibrillation, and treatment options. Integrated care models that provide patient-centred care in, or close to, the patient's community while maintaining access to all specialist treatment options, emerge as the best approach to achieve consistent delivery of these chronic treatments to all patients with atrial fibrillation. Ongoing research efforts will establish when to initiate oral anticoagulation in patients with device-detected atrial high-rate episodes, quantify the prognostic effect of early and comprehensive rhythm control therapy, including atrial fibrillation ablation, and delineate optimum methods to reduce bleeding complications in patients treated with anticoagulation. Additionally, research efforts are needed to define different types of atrial fibrillation on the basis of the main causes of atrial fibrillation to pave the way for the clinical development of stratified atrial fibrillation therapy.

Introduction

The rising prevalence of arrhythmias places an increasing burden on critical care systems worldwide. Supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF), are the most commonly encountered arrhythmias, affecting up to 25% of individuals over 40 years of age. The incidence increases with age, illness severity, and surgical invasiveness, with perioperative AF rates reaching 15–40% after cardiac surgery and up to 46% in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock.

AF is an independent risk factor for mortality in the critically ill. New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) raises a logical question as to whether its deleterious effect could be reversed by cardioversion and return to sinus rhythm (SR). There is limited data on the acute benefits of a rhythm control vs. rate control strategy, although similar outcomes have been documented over long-term follow-up. Non-sustained arrhythmias may spontaneously terminate and require observation only whilst the decision for electrical (DC) or pharmacological cardioversion of NOAF remains debatable.

Major trials from the cardiology setting have failed to demonstrate a benefit of a rhythm control over a rate control strategy. However, most cardiology randomised controlled trials fail to consider the degree of pre-existing left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunction, which can be of paramount importance in the acutely decompensated patient. Indeed, there may be relevant differences in responses to antiarrhythmic therapy in subgroups stratified by pre-existing cardiac function. In the presence of clinical equipoise regarding the best strategy, there is a physiological rationale for the use of echocardiography to help determine whether rhythm control is more favourable in certain populations.

Critical care echocardiography (CCE) has become the imaging modality of choice for investigating haemodynamically unstable patients in the ICU. In addition, CCE has a unique and important role in the assessment of cardiac structure, function, risk stratification, and in guiding the management of an arrhythmia.

In this review, we illustrate the role of CCE in guiding the therapeutic management of the ICU patient presenting with NOAF or an AF of unknown duration in determining whether there is a preference for rhythm versus rate control, antiarrhythmic drug selection, guidance of DC cardioversion, anticoagulation, and the role in immediate follow-up. We also address the limitations of CCE and its parameters in the presence of AF. For literature search details, see Table 1 ESM.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and rhythm control [^117BqSuj]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the arrhythmia most commonly encountered in family practice. Serious complications can include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Initial treatment is directed at controlling the ventricular rate, most often with a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or digoxin. Medical or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is the next step in patients who remain in atrial fibrillation. Heparin should be administered to hospitalized patients undergoing medical or electrical cardioversion. Anticoagulation with warfarin should be used for three weeks before elective cardioversion and continued for four weeks after cardioversion. The recommendations provided in this two-part article are consistent with guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

### Treatment strategies for new onset atrial fibrillation in patients treated on an intensive care unit: a systematic scoping review [^111U4D3w]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

New onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF), usually defined as atrial fibrillation (AF) occurring in patients with no known history of AF, is a common arrhythmia in critically ill patients. NOAF occurs in 5–11% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and up to 46% of patients with septic shock. NOAF in critically ill patients can cause cardiovascular instability and is associated with increased risk of thromboembolism, increased mortality and length of ICU stay, and higher healthcare costs.

Guidelines for management of AF do not directly apply to critically ill patients. NOAF in patients treated on an ICU differs from AF in patients in the community in terms of causes of rhythm disturbance, risks and effectiveness of treatments. The lack of evidence for managing NOAF in patients treated on an ICU means treatment practice differs widely.

We conducted a scoping review to provide an overview of current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological, electrical, and other non-pharmacological NOAF treatments, prophylactic strategies, and acute anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis in critically ill patients. We also aimed to describe commonly used definitions of NOAF in patients treated on an ICU and suggest recommendations and barriers for future research.

A recent scoping review described the incidence, risk factors, outcomes and management strategies related to NOAF during critical illness. It included patients with pre-existing AF and studies conducted outside ICUs. Our review focusses on the comparative evidence for treatment of NOAF in patients treated on an ICU.

### Treatment strategies for new onset atrial fibrillation in patients treated on an intensive care unit: a systematic scoping review [^1135D1pY]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

International guidelines provide advice regarding the management of patients presenting acutely with AF, and/or patients with AF with haemodynamic instability. However, the evidence base and expert consensus on which these guidelines are based does not appear to include patients in the intensive care unit setting. Therefore, whilst they may be used to guide some general aspects of AF management in any patient, such as the recommendation to use cardioversion if the patient is acutely haemodynamically unstable, recommendations regarding pharmacological therapy and whether or not the patient should be anticoagulated, either short or long-term, may not apply to this specific patient population.

Comparative evidence for or against electrical cardioversion for patients in ICU with NOAF was not identified in our review. Electrical cardioversion should be considered in patients where AF is contributing to marked haemodynamic instability. NOAF often occurs alongside haemodynamic instability but is more likely to be a significant contributor where ventricular rates are very high or where there is underlying structural heart disease. As with other treatments, electrical cardioversion should be used alongside aggressive management of underlying AF drivers. Further procedural considerations are detailed elsewhere.

It is unclear whether to administer therapeutic anticoagulation in critically ill patients with NOAF for stroke prevention. Limited evidence suggests bleeding risk outweighs the increased risk of thromboembolism whilst in ICU, but optimal timing of anticoagulation is unknown. Two review articles proposed a patient-centred approach to only administer anticoagulants in patients with high risk of arterial thromboembolic events. Notably, 64% of respondents of a UK wide survey reported that they would not use anticoagulant therapy in critically ill patients with NOAF.

Included studies were consistent in recommending further research as optimal management strategies have yet to be determined. Findings from previous studies of NOAF in patients in ICU may have been affected by the heterogeneity of patients in a general ICU. Future studies of narrower populations may therefore be helpful to determine best practice in specific clinical scenarios.

### New-onset atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^113bkUiW]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Would Improved AF Detection Lead to Better Outcomes?

A variety of continuous ECG monitoring technologies can now unveil otherwise silent paroxysmal AF, prompting earlier diagnosis and treatment. Silent AF occurs frequently in patients with implanted pacemakers and has been associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke. There are no guidelines about the minimum duration of silent or subclinical AF at which to consider therapy for stroke prevention, particularly in the context of acute noncardiovascular illness.

We envision that algorithms to detect AF from ICU ECG monitoring might enable earlier recognition and potentially improve outcomes. Walkey et al proposed a systematic approach to identify and address reversible triggers and have shown that select interventions may indeed lead to better outcomes. As subclinical AF may have no direct impact on patient outcomes, its detection could result in additional diagnostic testing and treatments that would have no benefit. We agree with others about the need for randomized clinical trials to compare the effectiveness of various treatments currently in practice. For example, Gillinov et al recently showed no difference in rate control and rhythm control strategies in ICU patients after cardiac surgery. The study relied on clinical recognition of the arrhythmia, which cannot be standardized and may have differed among the centers. We propose that future studies be conducted using standardized methods of AF detection including analysis of the continuous ECG record.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — recurrence and predictors: An AFFIRM substudy found that with AF recurrence, if one is willing to cardiovert and continue or change the antiarrhythmic drug, about 80% of all patients will be in sinus rhythm by the end of 1 y. Most patients with AF, except those with postoperative or self-limited AF secondary to transient or acute illness, eventually experience recurrence, and risk factors for frequent recurrence of paroxysmal AF (more than 1 episode per month) include female gender and underlying heart disease. In one study of patients with persistent AF, the 4-y arrhythmia-free survival rate was less than 10% after single-shock direct-current cardioversion without prophylactic drug therapy, with predictors of recurrences including hypertension, age over 55 y, and AF duration longer than 3 mo. Serial cardioversions and prophylactic drug therapy resulted in freedom from recurrent AF in approximately 30% of patients, and with this approach predictors of recurrence included age over 70 y, AF duration beyond 3 mo, and HF; other risk factors include LA enlargement and rheumatic heart disease.

### New-onset atrial fibrillation in adult critically ill patients: a scoping review [^1147vuz7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is common and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, its clinical importance and management in critically ill patients are not well described. The aim of this scoping review is to assess the epidemiology and management strategies of NOAF during critical illness.

Method

The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for studies assessing the incidence, outcome and management strategies of NOAF in adult critically ill patients. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

A total of 99 studies were included, of which 79 were observational and 20 were interventional. The incidence of NOAF varied from 1.7% to 43.9% with considerable inter-population variation (very low quality of evidence). Commonly identified risk factors for NOAF included higher age, cardiovascular comorbidities and sepsis. The occurrence of NOAF was associated with adverse outcomes, including stroke, prolonged length of stay and mortality (very low quality of evidence). We found limited data on the optimal management strategy with no evidence for firm benefit or harm for any intervention (very low/low quality of evidence).

Conclusions

The definition and incidence of NOAF in critically ill patients varied considerably and many risk factors were identified. NOAF seemed to be associated with adverse outcomes, but data were very limited and current management strategies are not evidence-based.

### Emergency department patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter and an acute underlying medical illness may not benefit from attempts to control rate or rhythm [^115tSbMQ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Although the management and outcomes of emergency department (ED) patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter have been explored, such studies have typically excluded patients with acute underlying medical illnesses. We seek to describe the ED treatment and outcomes of these complex patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter.

Methods

This retrospective descriptive cohort study used an ECG database from 2 urban EDs to identify consecutive ED patients with an ECG demonstrating atrial fibrillation or flutter from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2009. We categorized patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter as "complex" according to prespecified criteria and then grouped them as being managed with rate or rhythm control attempts, or not. The primary outcome was safety of rate or rhythm control, measured by whether patients had a predefined adverse event or not. The secondary outcome was the success of rate or rhythm control, defined as rate control decreasing the pulse rate by 20 beats/min and successful rhythm control, both within 4 hours of treatment initiation. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the 2 groups.

Results

Four hundred sixteen complex patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter were identified. Patients managed with rate or rhythm control were similar in all baseline characteristics and illness distribution to patients who were not managed in this manner. The 135 patients with attempted rate control (105) or rhythm control (30) had 55 adverse events (40.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 32.5% to 49.5%), whereas the 281 patients not managed with rate or rhythm control had 20 adverse events (7.1%; 95% CI 4.5% to 10.9%), for a risk difference of 33.6% (95% CI 24.3% to 42.5%) and a relative risk of 5.7 (95% CI 3.6 to 9.1). Twenty of 105 patients (19.1%; 95% CI 12.3% to 28.1%) were successfully rate controlled, whereas 4 of 30 (13.3%; 95% CI 4.4% to 31.6%) were successfully rhythm controlled.

Conclusion

In ED patients with complex atrial fibrillation or flutter, attempts at rate and rhythm control are associated with a nearly 6-fold higher adverse event rate than that for patients who are not managed with rate or rhythm control. Success rates of rate or rhythm control attempts appear low.

### Echocardiography guided management of atrial fibrillation [^117GhU7h]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The growing burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) experienced by the general population translates into an increased incidence in the intensive care setting, further aggravated by illness severity. New onset AF has been established as an independent mortality predictor. Cardiology management guidelines are based on major trials that included ambulatory patients with varying degrees of ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and with variable dependences of left ventricular filling on atrial systole. Emphasis is placed on rate control combined with anticoagulation therapy, along with careful consideration of limiting any myocardial depression by antiarrhythmic medication in patients who often already have some form of structural heart disease.

Design

Narrative review Objectives: Critical care echocardiography (CCE) is well established as a widely available diagnostic and monitoring tool in haemodynamically unstable patients. It assists in identifying risk factors associated with arrhythmias, reveals parameters associated with arrhythmia chronicity, and guides therapy to facilitate a return to sinus rhythm. CCE helps guide the crucial management decision to seek either rhythm or rate control and, with rhythm control, monitors return of mechanical sinus rhythm with left atrial recovery post cardioversion. Echocardiography can also help when conflicting management goals are present, such as guideline-driven therapeutic anticoagulation in the intensive care patient that is at significant risk of bleeding.

Results

This review seeks to assist intensive care practitioners managing patients with AF, with a focus on the many benefits CCE offers, blending specific intensive care medicine data to current cardiology guidelines on arrhythmia management in these severely ill patients.

Supraventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation — transient AF concept and updated long-term risks — A prior position paper stated that atrial fibrillation (AF) may be related to acute causes and may not recur and applied the term 'transient' AF to diverse precipitants; however, subsequent data indicate these statements need revision. New-onset AF maintains prognostic significance after ICU discharge, patients with AF-precipitating factors have a consistent risk of long-term recurrences even if transient factors resolve, the recurrence risk does not differ between those with and without precipitating factors, and the risks of stroke and heart failure are elevated. Reported mortality after new-onset AF during acute illness at 30–60 days ranges from 15.8% to 72%. Other organized supraventricular arrhythmias (SVT) in critical illness are less common than AF, often lead to haemodynamic imbalance, and may require DC cardioversion.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) pericardioversion anticoagulation rationale — early experience and trial data support timing and modality: "This led to an empiric recommendation for 3 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion in the prospective, randomized, multicenter ACUTE… study of patients with > 2 days' duration of AF". "Precardioversion anticoagulation of at least 3 weeks may be accomplished via either therapeutic anticoagulation with VKAs or DOACs", and "Cardiac computed tomography… has emerged as an alternate imaging modality to exclude intracardiac thrombus". Justification includes that anticoagulation is continued "for the subsequent 4 weeks after cardioversion", with risks driven by "elevated thromboembolic risks… high early recurrence of AF, and observation of atrial dysfunction 2–5 days". Risks are "elevated around the time of cardioversion, especially within the 30 days after cardioversion", with recovery of atrial systole "over the ensuing 1 month".

### Management of recent-onset sustained atrial fibrillation: pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies [^115fsHyb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recent studies have highlighted significant variations in the management of recent-onset sustained atrial fibrillation (AF). We aim to provide a succinct and clear management algorithm for physicians treating patients with recent-onset sustained AF.

Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of the literature on the management of recent-onset sustained AF with focus on studies reporting cardioversion of AF, antiarrhythmic agents, and anticoagulation. We also reviewed recent practice guidelines on AF management.

Findings

This review provides a guide on a tailored management approach of patients with recent-onset sustained AF. After initial detailed clinical assessment, optimal rate and rhythm control options can be provided, depending on hemodynamic stability, duration of AF episode, and AF stroke risk. Issues surrounding electrical and pharmacologic cardioversion are discussed in detail. We emphasize the importance of thromboembolic risk assessment and appropriate anticoagulation surrounding the point of cardioversion. Last, we highlighted the need for appropriate specialized follow-up care after acute AF management.

Implications

Despite the highly heterogeneous clinical presentations, management of recent-onset sustained AF must include stroke risk assessment, appropriate anticoagulation, and follow-up care in all patients beyond optimum rate and rhythm control strategies.

### Standard versus atrial fibrillation-specific management strategy (SAFETY) to reduce recurrent admission and prolong survival: pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^1125KyWn]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients are increasingly being admitted with chronic atrial fibrillation, and disease-specific management might reduce recurrent admissions and prolong survival. However, evidence is scant to support the application of this therapeutic approach. We aimed to assess SAFETY — a management strategy that is specific to atrial fibrillation.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in patients admitted with chronic, non-valvular atrial fibrillation (but not heart failure). Patients were recruited from three tertiary referral hospitals in Australia. 335 participants were randomly assigned by computer-generated schedule (stratified for rhythm or rate control) to either standard management (n = 167) or the SAFETY intervention (n = 168). Standard management consisted of routine primary care and hospital outpatient follow-up. The SAFETY intervention comprised a home visit and Holter monitoring 7–14 days after discharge by a cardiac nurse with prolonged follow-up and multidisciplinary support as needed. Clinical reviews were undertaken at 12 and 24 months (minimum follow-up). Coprimary outcomes were death or unplanned readmission (both all-cause), measured as event-free survival and the proportion of actual versus maximum days alive and out of hospital. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTRN 12610000221055).

Findings

During median follow-up of 905 days (IQR 773–1050), 49 people died and 987 unplanned admissions were recorded (totalling 5530 days in hospital). 127 (76%) patients assigned to the SAFETY intervention died or had an unplanned readmission (median event-free survival 183 days [IQR 116–409]) and 137 (82%) people allocated standard management achieved a coprimary outcome (199 days [116–249]; hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.76–1.23; p = 0.851). Patients assigned to the SAFETY intervention had 99.5% maximum event-free days (95% CI 99.3–99.7), equating to a median of 900 (IQR 767–1025) of 937 maximum days alive and out of hospital. By comparison, those allocated to standard management had 99.2% (95% CI 98.8–99.4) maximum event-free days, equating to a median of 860 (IQR 752–1047) of 937 maximum days alive and out of hospital (effect size 0.22, 95% CI 0.21–0.23; p = 0.039).

Interpretation

A post-discharge management programme specific to atrial fibrillation was associated with proportionately more days alive and out of hospital (but not prolonged event-free survival) relative to standard management. Disease-specific management is a possible strategy to improve poor health outcomes in patients admitted with chronic atrial fibrillation.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which was first reported in 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China. 1, 2 It infects host cells through angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 membrane receptors, which are highly expressed in heart and lungs, especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. 3 COVID‐19 patients with underlying cardiovascular disease have increased risk of morbidity and mortality from complicated myocardial injury, myocarditis, congestive heart failure (CHF), thromboembolism, and arrhythmias. 4 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia seen in critically ill patients. 5 Several potential pharmacotherapies are emerging. 4, 6 Risks of arrhythmogenic effects of COVID‐19 pharmacotherapies have been noted 4, 7 (Table). The overall objective of this review is to provide practical guidance for clinicians who are managing COVID‐19 patients with concomitant AF recommendations (Figure 1) based on the pharmacological characteristics of COVID‐19 pharmacotherapies, anticoagulants, and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in the setting of limited clinical data.

Atrial fibrillation — electrical and pharmacological cardioversion overview is described as follows: Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute rhythm control and can be achieved electrically or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapidity and efficacy, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, and cardioversion should also be considered for hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable to achieve adequate rate control. In stable AF, both electrical and pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and efficacious; electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacological cardioversion alone but involves the trade-off of anesthesia or sedation. Thromboembolic risks and considerations for anticoagulation apply to both pharmacological and electrical cardioversion.

Atrial fibrillation — initial clinical assessment emphasizes that diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination and confirmed by electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, sometimes in the form of bedside telemetry or ambulatory Holter recordings, and that initial evaluation involves characterizing the arrhythmia pattern as paroxysmal or persistent, determining its cause, and defining associated cardiac and extracardiac factors pertinent to the etiology, tolerability, or history of prior management. A thorough history will result in a well-planned, focused workup that serves as an effective guide to therapy, and the workup can usually take place during a single outpatient encounter, with delay when the rhythm has not been specifically documented and additional monitoring is necessary. Commonly mentioned triggers include alcohol, sleep deprivation, and emotional stress, and stimulants such as caffeine or exercise may also precipitate atrial fibrillation. The physical examination may suggest atrial fibrillation on the basis of irregular pulse, irregular jugular venous pulsations, and variation in the intensity of the first heart sound or absence of a fourth sound heard previously during sinus rhythm, and examination may also disclose associated valvular heart disease, myocardial abnormalities, or heart failure.

### New-onset atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^113iVg7S]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia frequently found among the critically ill. Several acute and chronic comorbid conditions common to the ICU are substrates for its occurrence and potentiate its impact on prognosis. Although AF can be a debilitating illness with potentially catastrophic complications such as thromboembolic stroke and heart failure, these risks can be substantially mitigated by anticoagulation and by control of heart rate or rhythm. Thus, there is an imperative for detection of AF, even in patients without arrhythmia symptoms.

Despite widespread use of continuous electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring, methods for detection of AF in the ICU are not standardized and transient episodes can go unrecognized. The commotion of patients, providers, and technology common to most modern ICUs results in ECG artifact that further obfuscates AF detection. Such short episodes in the context of other acute comorbid conditions are of unclear clinical consequence in the short and long terms (,–).

In this work, we detected AF using mathematical analyses of heart rate dynamics from continuous ECG rather than relying entirely on clinical recognition and chart documentation. The ECG-derived heartbeat interval time series is a robust signal, and we have demonstrated that measurements in its nonlinear domain can assist in the detection of arrhythmia and improve prognostication.

In 74 patient-years of ECG recording from 8,356 consecutive ICU patients, we examined the prevalence, incidence, and burden of AF. We tested the hypothesis that new-onset AF, recognized or not, is associated with outcomes such as ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital mortality, and survival after hospital discharge.

### Approach to and management of the acute stroke patient with atrial fibrillation: a literature review [^115yvcat]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Stroke remains an increasing worldwide cause of disability and mortality, and it is the second leading cause of death in industrialized countries. Patients with atrial fibrillation form a unique group with increased risk of cardioembolic stroke. Despite the widespread application of the National Institutes of Health stroke scale and guidelines, patients with atrial fibrillation represent a clinically challenging group that deserves a special approach during the acute stroke phase. The mechanism of stroke in these patients is either cardioembolic [especially with an international normalized ratio (INR) < 2.0] or hemorrhagic (especially with INR > 5.0) (Figure 1). Atrial fibrillation with valvular heart disease significantly increases the risk for ischemic stroke. Specifically, patients with mitral stenosis who develop atrial fibrillation increase their risk of cardioembolism by 3 to 7 times. Many patients with atrial fibrillation still develop ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke despite appropriate use of anticoagulation. Prior stroke, transient ischemic attacks, congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75, and diabetes mellitus are all well-established risk factors for the development of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The CHADS-2 score is the most widely studied and clinically used method for stratifying patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. In our review, we present the most recent clinical guidelines and trends for the approach to and management of this patient group.

Atrial fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction — management directives and observed risks are as follows: For patients with AF and acute MI, administration of unfractionated heparin is recommended in a dose sufficient to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time to 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value (Level of Evidence: C), intravenous administration of digitalis is reasonable in patients with acute MI and AF associated with severe LV dysfunction and HF (Level of Evidence: C), and the administration of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs is not recommended in the setting of acute MI (Level of Evidence: C). Urgent direct-current cardioversion is appropriate in acute MI patients presenting with AF and intractable ischemia or hemodynamic instability, and intravenous administration of a beta blocker is indicated for rate control in patients with acute MI. Anticoagulants are indicated in those with large anterior infarcts and in survivors of acute MI who develop persistent AF, and treatment with ACE inhibitors appears to reduce the incidence of AF in patients with LV dysfunction after acute MI; in a placebo-controlled trial, carvedilol reduced AF and/or atrial flutter (5.4% vs. 2.3%). Observational data show AF in acute MI occurred in 22% of Medicare beneficiaries 65 y or older, 21% in a LV dysfunction cohort, and 10.4% in a trial population; AF in acute MI was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (25.3% with AF vs. 16.0% without AF), 30-d mortality (29.3% vs. 19.1%), 1-yr mortality (48.3% vs. 32.7%), and a stroke rate of 3.1%.

### Viewpoint: stroke prevention in recent guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: an appraisal [^113G6AX5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Formal guidelines play an important role in disseminating the best available evidence knowledge and are expected to provide simple and practical recommendations for the most optimal management of patients with various conditions. Such guidelines have important implications for many disease states, which thereby could be more professionally managed in everyday clinical practice by clinicians with divergent educational backgrounds, and also more easily implemented in wards or outpatient clinics, eliminating inequalities in health care management. In this brief Viewpoint we provide an appraisal on the recommendations pertinent to the prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke or systemic thromboembolism, as provided in recently published guidelines for the management of this arrhythmia.

Atrial fibrillation — short-term and long-term treatment goals: For patients with symptomatic AF lasting many weeks, initial therapy may be anticoagulation and rate control, while the long-term goal is to restore sinus rhythm. When cardioversion is contemplated and the duration of AF is unknown or exceeds 48 h, patients who do not require long-term anticoagulation may benefit from short-term anticoagulation. Early cardioversion may be necessary if AF causes hypotension or worsening HF, making the establishment of sinus rhythm a combined short- and long-term therapeutic goal. In contrast, amelioration of symptoms by rate control in older patients may steer the clinician away from attempts to restore sinus rhythm. In some circumstances, when the initiating pathophysiology of AF is reversible, as for instance in the setting of thyrotoxicosis or after cardiac surgery, no long-term therapy may be necessary.

### Rationale, considerations, and goals for atrial fibrillation centers of excellence: a Heart Rhythm Society perspective [^113kuikY]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation centers of excellence — clinical roles, resources, and access pathways — require appropriate staffing and dedicated clinics, with centers committing to multidisciplinary and broad-based development. Relying on a single clinician to manage AF patients is no longer feasible in most, if not all, health care systems, and providing comprehensive AF care is best accomplished through a team-based approach that enables identification, referral, and management in a coordinated fashion. Timely access is particularly important when patients are acutely symptomatic, and pathways and systems are needed to help ensure continuity of care across encounters, while newly diagnosed asymptomatic AF or rapid ventricular rate may be detected in preoperative settings, outpatient clinics, or at home with wearable monitors or smartphone-based or direct-to-consumer applications.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter — pericardioversion anticoagulation: Anticoagulation is recommended for 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion for patients with AF of unknown duration or with AF for more than 48 h, and when acute AF produces hemodynamic instability, immediate cardioversion should not be delayed, but intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous injection of a low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated before cardioversion. Pooled data indicate that 98% of clinical thromboembolic events occur within 10 d, supporting administration of an anticoagulant for at least 4 wk after cardioversion and that continuation for a considerably longer period may be warranted even after apparently successful cardioversion. In a multicenter randomized study (n = 1222), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided and conventional strategies using anticoagulation 3 wk before and 4 wk after cardioversion showed comparably low risks of stroke (0.81% with the TEE approach and 0.50% with the conventional approach). For patients with atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion, anticoagulation should be considered with either strategy, and anticoagulation can be beneficial according to the recommendations as for patients with AF.

Management overview — Management of patients with AF involves 3 objectives — rate control, prevention of thromboembolism, and correction of the rhythm disturbance, and these are not mutually exclusive. The initial management decision involves primarily a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy; under the rate-control strategy, the ventricular rate is controlled with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm, while the rhythm-control strategy attempts restoration and/or maintenance of sinus rhythm and also requires attention to rate control. Depending on the patient's course, the strategy initially chosen may prove unsuccessful and the alternate strategy is then adopted.

### Management of atrial fibrillation [^116DqPxZ]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder, and confers a substantial mortality and morbidity from stroke, thromboembolism, heart failure, and impaired quality of life. With the increasingly elderly population in the developed world, as well as improvements in the management of myocardial infarction and heart failure, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation is increasing, resulting in a major public-health problem. This Review aims to provide an overview on the modern management of atrial fibrillation, with particular emphasis on pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Irrespective of a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy, stroke prevention with appropriate thromboprophylaxis still remains central to the management of this common arrhythmia. Electrophysiological approaches could hold some promise for a curative approach in atrial fibrillation.

### Is discharge to home after emergency department cardioversion safe for the treatment of recent-onset atrial fibrillation? [^114Nox4b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Recent-onset atrial fibrillation, defined as a first detected or recurrent episode of atrial fibrillation lasting less than 48 hours, is a commonly encountered dysrhythmia in the emergency department (ED). Cardioversion of stable patients in the ED with recent-onset atrial fibrillation without antecedent anticoagulation would allow for these patients to be discharged directly to home. We searched the literature to determine whether any studies have investigated the safety of this management strategy and identified five that addressed this question. These studies are reviewed herein; importantly, not one ED patient who was cardioverted in any of the five studies suffered a thromboembolic event - the feared complication responsible for most of the controversy surrounding the ED management of atrial fibrillation. According to the available evidence, we conclude that it would be within the standard of care to discharge home stable patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation after cardioversion in the ED with adequate follow-up. It should be noted that although this strategy is safe and effective, the return visit rate for relapsed atrial fibrillation is 3% to 17%, and patients should be made aware of this possibility.

### Health conditions in adults with atrial fibrillation compared with the general population: a population-based cross-sectional analysis [^111yAMcW]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrythmia associated with a high lifetime risk of heart failure, stroke and myocardial infarction. The global prevalence of AF is increasing, having more than doubled between 1990 and 2019 to nearly 60 million cases. Whilst survival in adults with AF has increased, a mortality gap compared with adults without AF remains, highlighting the ongoing importance managing risk factors and comorbidity to improve outcomes.

Comorbidities are associated with an increased rate of hospitalisation and all-cause mortality in adults with AF. Whilst AF incidence and prevalence increases with age, modifiable risk factors including hypertension and excess alcohol consumption have been shown to vary by socioeconomic status (SES). Timely identification and management of comorbid diseases remain integral parts of the management of AF with the 2024 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline on the management of AF placing comorbidity and risk factor management at the forefront of its management principles. Whilst existing AF guideline recommendations refer to a select number of well-known comorbidities, a comprehensive understanding of comorbidity more broadly, is limited. For example, population-based studies have typically examined limited numbers of conditions and seldom consider acute precipitants such as infections, that have been attributed to nearly 20% of newly diagnosed AF cases.

Comprehensively understanding comorbidity in AF more broadly helps in a number of ways including supporting clinicians and policy makers better anticipate service needs and provide holistic care, understanding target AF populations in routine care to judge the generalisability of clinical trial evidence, and identifying less characterised or even new disease-disease interactions requiring further research. The aim was therefore to perform a large-scale characterisation measuring the prevalence of comorbidity more broadly in adults with and without AF.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to revise the 2001 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society [^114a38Dr]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Counteracting atrial electrical remodeling — renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) modulation and amiodarone are associated with reduced atrial fibrillation (AF) in selected contexts. Data are accumulating on the importance of the RAAS in the genesis of AF; irbesartan plus amiodarone was associated with a lower incidence of recurrent AF after cardioversion than amiodarone alone, and angiotensin inhibitors with diuretics significantly reduced AF after catheter ablation of atrial flutter. Amiodarone may reverse electrical remodeling even when AF is ongoing. Inhibition of the RAAS, alone or in combination with other therapies, may prevent the onset or maintenance of AF via hemodynamic changes and prevention of structural remodeling in both the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV). Treatment with trandolapril reduced the incidence of AF in patients with LV dysfunction following acute myocardial infarction (MI), although whether the antiarrhythmic effect reflects reversal of atrial structural or electrical remodeling remains to be clarified.

Key points
- Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia.
- Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. What it is Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart. AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. Symptoms Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms:

- Irregular heartbeat.
- Heart palpitations.
- Lightheadedness.
- Extreme fatigue.
- Shortness of breath.
- Chest pain.

How is AFib related to stroke. AFib increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes. Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining. Treatment and recovery Treatment for AFib can include:

- Medicines to control the heart's rhythm and rate.
- Blood-thinning medicine to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce stroke risk.
- Surgery.
- Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage AFib risk factors. What are the consequences of AFib. More than 454, 000 hospitalizations with AFib as the primary diagnosis happen each year in the US. The condition contributes to about 158, 000 deaths each year.

The death rate from AFib as the primary or a contributing cause of death has been rising for more than two decades. Circulation. 2022; 145: e153–e639.

### Treatment of acute atrial… [^111z9PXG]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is associated with significant morbidity, including an increased susceptibility to embolic stroke. It is estimated that the annual risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is as high as 4. 5 percent. 3 Atrial fibrillation also can decrease exercise tolerance and has been associated with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Although many patients with atrial fibrillation are symptomatic, some patients remain asymptomatic. Thus, it is often difficult to estimate the onset, duration or severity of atrial fibrillation by the history alone. Furthermore, treatment strategies vary, depending on the patient's symptoms and clinical syndrome. Initial treatment also depends on the course of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation may be divided into acute and chronic forms. There are three types of chronic forms: paroxysmal, persistent and permanent. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is defined as recurrent episodes of spontaneously terminating atrial fibrillation.

Persistent atrial fibrillation is defined by persistence of the arrhythmia until cardioversion is performed. Permanent atrial fibrillation is refractory to attempts at cardioversion. Thus, cardioversion is used only in cases of acute and chronic persistent atrial fibrillation and not in cases previously demonstrated to be refractory. In stable patients, control of the heart rate often provides relief of symptoms. However, some patients remain symptomatic despite a controlled heart rate. It is often desirable to restore sinus rhythm in these patients. Unfortunately, it is not known whether restoration of sinus rhythm improves survival, reduces morbidity or even decreases the risk of embolic events. If atrial fibrillation has been present for more than 48 hours or if the onset is unknown, an initial three- to six-week course of anticoagulation is recommended.

Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and at least one risk factor for thromboembolism should be considered for chronic anticoagulation. Most patients benefit from at least one attempt at maintaining sinus rhythm. In patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, cardioversion should be considered as soon as possible, since evidence indicates that the duration of arrhythmia is related to the likelihood of recurrence. Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation do not require cardioversion by definition, although they may require medication to control heart rate and often require antiarrhythmic agents to maintain sinus rhythm.
