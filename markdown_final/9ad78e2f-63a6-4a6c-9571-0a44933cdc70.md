## Question

what does an elevated free kappa and lambda mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means when both free kappa and free lambda are elevated on a serum free light chain assay, and how to interpret that pattern clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic biology of free light chains and what the assay measures. Then, I should verify the difference between monoclonal and polyclonal patterns and how the kappa/lambda ratio guides interpretation. Next, I will review common causes of concurrent kappa and lambda elevation and their prognostic implications. After that, I need to check for confounders like renal function, age, and assay variability. Finally, I will outline a practical, guideline-based workup and monitoring plan, and close with a concise synthesis of what this pattern signifies clinically.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals. Free light chains are immunoglobulin light chains not bound to heavy chains. They are produced at low levels by normal plasma cells and cleared rapidly by the kidneys, so baseline serum levels are low and the kappa/lambda ratio is typically near 0.26–1.65 in people with normal renal function, which anchors how we interpret deviations from normal [^115cW2DQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — when both kappa and lambda are elevated, I need to distinguish monoclonal from polyclonal patterns. A monoclonal process produces a disproportionate excess of one light chain, yielding an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio, whereas a polyclonal process reflects generalized B-cell/plasma cell activation with proportional increases in both chains and a preserved ratio. Thus, the kappa/lambda ratio is the key discriminator for clonality, not the absolute levels alone [^115cW2DQ].

> I will now examine what concurrent elevation with a normal ratio implies. This polyclonal pattern suggests immune activation rather than a clonal plasma cell disorder. It has been observed with chronic infections, inflammatory states, and autoimmune diseases, and population data show that higher combined FLC levels associate with a modestly increased future risk of developing a monoclonal gammopathy, though most individuals do not progress and the elevation itself is not diagnostic of MGUS or myeloma [^112L9erX] [^11224GQG] [^1122UUZo].

> Wait, let me verify prognostic signals beyond plasma cell disorders. Elevated polyclonal FLC has been linked to worse outcomes in other hematologic diseases. In CLL, both monoclonal and polyclonal FLC abnormalities predict shorter time to treatment and poorer survival, and in myeloid neoplasms, higher combined FLC correlates with worse survival independent of conventional risk factors, suggesting that polyclonal FLC elevation may index a more activated or dysregulated immune milieu with clinical consequences [^116btGiE] [^115BuMbJ].

> But wait, what if the ratio is abnormal despite both chains being elevated? I should double-check for a monoclonal process superimposed on polyclonal background or for analytical issues. An abnormal ratio in this context can indicate a true clonal component and warrants confirmatory testing with serum immunofixation and, if needed, urine studies; importantly, standard reference intervals can misclassify some cases, particularly at the low end for lambda disease, so I need to ensure the laboratory's reference ranges and assay platform are considered when interpreting borderline results [^115vqgry] [^112nU6XA] [^115zBrxX].

> Next, I should review confounders that can raise both kappa and lambda without implying clonality. Reduced kidney function decreases clearance of FLCs and can elevate both chains, often widening the expected ratio range. Age also shifts reference intervals upward, and different assays (e.g. Freelite vs N Latex) have distinct performance characteristics and renal adjustments, so I need to check eGFR, apply age- and renal function–appropriate intervals, and use the same assay longitudinally to avoid misinterpretation [^115cW2DQ] [^115uDNnQ] [^111GEFTK].

> Let me consider the clinical workup when both kappa and lambda are elevated with a normal ratio. I should confirm there is no end-organ damage attributable to a plasma cell disorder by assessing for hypercalcemia, anemia, renal dysfunction, bone lesions, and neuropathy; if the screen is negative, routine follow-up rather than immediate invasive testing is reasonable, though I should maintain vigilance for evolution of a clonal process over time given the small but nonzero progression risk in population cohorts [^112duMU4] [^11224GQG].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline-based testing steps if the ratio is abnormal or suspicion remains high. AACC/ASCP/CAP guidance supports confirming an abnormal FLC ratio with serum immunofixation or an equivalent sensitive method, and initial detection of M-protein should pair SPEP with sFLC for maximal sensitivity; in parallel, I should review the complete blood count, calcium, creatinine, and consider 24-hour urine protein and immunofixation if amyloidosis or light chain deposition is suspected, especially when FLC levels are high [^115vqgry] [^115SXdT5] [^113GBni6].

> I need to ensure I am using the most appropriate reference intervals. Recent large cohort data suggest that age- and renal function–adjusted FLC reference intervals improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce overdiagnosis of light chain MGUS. Applying these revised intervals can reclassify some borderline cases and better align risk stratification with progression biology, so I should confirm which reference ranges my laboratory uses and whether they incorporate age and eGFR adjustments [^115uDNnQ] [^111uet99] [^1121d7VS].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. When both free kappa and free lambda are elevated with a normal kappa/lambda ratio, this most often reflects a polyclonal increase in immunoglobulin light chain production due to immune activation, inflammation, or autoimmunity. It is not diagnostic of a clonal plasma cell disorder by itself, but it may carry a modestly increased risk of future monoclonal gammopathy and has been associated with adverse prognosis in some hematologic diseases, so I should correlate with clinical context, renal function, and age, and pursue confirmatory testing if the ratio is abnormal or clinical suspicion persists [^112L9erX] [^11224GQG] [^116btGiE] [^115BuMbJ] [^115cW2DQ].

Elevated free kappa and lambda light chains with a normal κ/λ ratio indicate **polyclonal B-cell activation** [^112L9erX] from chronic inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease [^112L9erX] [^1122UUZo], not a clonal plasma cell disorder [^112L9erX]. This pattern is common in HIV [^112asyj8], hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and SLE, and is also seen with renal impairment due to reduced clearance [^115cW2DQ]. It is not diagnostic of MGUS or myeloma [^112nU6XA]; however, it carries a modestly increased risk of future monoclonal gammopathy [^11224GQG], so **monitoring is reasonable** if persistent or unexplained [^112L9erX].

---

## Physiological and pathological significance

Polyclonal B-cell activation reflects **immune activation** — a generalized, non-clonal increase in plasma cells producing both κ and λ light chains [^112L9erX], yielding a normal κ/λ ratio [^112L9erX]. In contrast, **clonal plasma cell disorders** (MGUS, multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis) feature a monoclonal excess of one light chain, producing an abnormal κ/λ ratio [^112L9erX] [^113GBni6].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with elevated free kappa and lambda light chains

Several **clinical conditions** are linked to elevated free κ and λ light chains with a normal κ/λ ratio:

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Chronic inflammation | Polyclonal B-cell activation [^112L9erX] |
| Autoimmune diseases (RA, SLE) | Polyclonal B-cell activation [^1122UUZo] |
| Chronic infections (HIV, hepatitis) | Polyclonal B-cell activation [^112asyj8] |
| Renal impairment | Reduced clearance of free light chains [^115cW2DQ] |
| Hematologic malignancies (CLL, NHL) | Polyclonal B-cell activation [^116btGiE] [^117KaYbw] |

---

## Diagnostic implications

Elevated free κ and λ with a normal κ/λ ratio is **not diagnostic** of MGUS or multiple myeloma [^112L9erX]; however, it may signal an increased risk of developing monoclonal gammopathies over time [^11224GQG]. Persistent or unexplained elevations warrant periodic monitoring for emergence of a clonal process [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic implications

Polyclonal elevation of free light chains is associated with **increased mortality** in general medical populations [^116ydr3L], likely reflecting systemic inflammation or immune dysregulation. In hematologic malignancies, elevated free light chains correlate with worse outcomes in CLL and NHL [^116btGiE] [^117KaYbw].

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

Management focuses on identifying and treating the **underlying cause** (inflammation, infection, autoimmunity, renal impairment) [^115cW2DQ]. Routine monitoring is advised for persistent or unexplained elevations to detect evolution to monoclonal gammopathy [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory considerations

- **Assay variability**: Different platforms (Freelite, N Latex) have distinct reference ranges and renal-function adjustments; use the same assay for longitudinal monitoring [^115cW2DQ] [^1176eWdR].
- **Renal function**: Impaired clearance elevates both κ and λ; interpret results in clinical context [^115cW2DQ] [^116L8avV].
- **Reference ranges**: Age- and renal-adjusted intervals improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce overdiagnosis [^115uDNnQ] [^1121d7VS].

---

Elevated free κ and λ with a normal κ/λ ratio reflects **polyclonal B-cell activation** from inflammation, infection, autoimmunity, or renal impairment; it is not diagnostic of clonal disease but may indicate a modestly increased risk of future monoclonal gammopathy, so **targeted evaluation and monitoring** are appropriate when persistent or unexplained [^112L9erX] [^115cW2DQ] [^1122UUZo] [^11224GQG].

The prognostic value of baseline serum free light chain ratio (sFLCR) was investigated in 94 multiple myeloma (MM) patients. sFLCR was calculated as kappa/lambda or lambda/kappa, depending on the patients' dominating monoclonal light chain. Median baseline sFLCR was 3.57 in kappa-MM patients, 45.09 in lambda-MM. 'High' sFLCR (≥ the observed median value for kappa- and lambda-MM respectively) correlated with elevated serum creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase, extensive marrow infiltration and light chain type MM. The 5-year disease-specific survival was 82% and 30% in patients with sFLCR lower than and equal or greater than the median, respectively (P = 0.0001). sFLCR was an independent prognostic factor.

Patients and methods

Patient selection

We used a population-based cohort previously assembled by us to estimate the prevalence of MGUS. The original cohort comprised 21,463 out of the 28,038 enumerated Olmsted County residents aged 50 years or older, as of January 1, 1995, in whom blood samples were available for study. From among the 21,462 subjects in the Olmsted County MGUS prevalence cohort, we excluded the 4096 anonymized subjects, 710 subjects who were known to have a plasma cell disorder (MGUS or light chain MGUS), 758 subjects whose remaining sample was insufficient to perform the FLC assay, 52 subjects who were not Mayo Clinic patients, and 216 subjects who did not have a plasma cell disorder but had an abnormal FLC ratio. This resulted in a cohort of 15,630 patients who had no evidence at baseline of a clonal plasma cell disorder. We obtained the FLC results on this cohort from samples collected at baseline when the Olmsted prevalence study was conducted.

Laboratory methodology

Following approval by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, the FLC assay (FREELITE™, The Binding Site Ltd. Birmingham, UK) was measured in the 18,372 stored serum samples on a Dade Behring BNII automated nephelometer (Siemens, Newark, Delaware). In addition to reporting the κ and λ FLC concentrations, the assay reports the FLC κ/λ ratio (FLC-R), and an abnormal result was defined as an abnormal FLC-R (normal diagnostic range: 0.26–1.65). As described earlier, we excluded all patients with MGUS and all patients with an abnormal serum FLC ratio at baseline from the study cohort. We used the sum of the kappa and lambda FLC (ΣFLC) to examine the impact of polyclonal elevation of serum free light chains. We compared the risk of development of a clonal plasma cell disorder during follow-up among patients in the top decile (10th decile) of ΣFLC compared with the lower 9 deciles (1–9th deciles).

### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^1148cjkc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance:

- Definition: MGUS is a premalignant plasma-cell disorder characterized by the presence of a monoclonal (M) protein in the serum at a concentration < 3 g/dL, < 10% clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, and absence of end-organ damage attributable to plasma-cell proliferation.
- Pathophysiology: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significanc arises from antigen-driven clonal proliferation of plasma cells or memory B cells that acquire primary cytogenetic abnormalities, including trisomies or immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH) translocations. Subsequent secondary mutations, such as those involving NRAS, KRAS, MYC, or the MAPK pathway, may promote progression to malignancy. The bone marrow microenvironment and immune surveillance also play key roles in determining whether the clone remains stable or progresses. In MGCS, pathogenicity results from the M protein's direct organ-specific effects or from deposition of misfolded light chains, as seen in AL amyloidosis.
- Epidemiology: MGUS is present in approximately 5% of the general population over the age of 50 years, with prevalence increasing with age and reaching nearly double among those over 70. The condition is more common in men and is 2–3 times more prevalent among Black individuals and first-degree relatives of patients with multiple myeloma or related disorders.
- Risk factors: Risk factors include advanced age, obesity, male gender and family history of the condition, radiation exposure, pesticide exposure, chronic inflammation, and immunosuppression.
- Disease course: MGUS is typically asymptomatic and is most often discovered incidentally during evaluation for unrelated laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated ESR or anemia. Although MGUS itself does not cause end-organ damage, it carries a lifelong risk of progression to multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, or related plasma-cell malignancies at an average rate of approximately 1% per year. Additionally, some patients develop nonmalignant but clinically significant disorders, collectively termed monoclonal gammopathies of clinical significance, affecting organs such as the kidneys, peripheral nerves, or skin.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The lifetime risk of progression from MGUS to a malignant plasma-cell disorder is approximately 11% at 25 years, with no decline in risk over time. Prognosis is primarily determined by risk stratification using three variables: serum M protein concentration (≥ 1.5 g/dL), immunoglobulin subtype (IgA or IgM), and abnormal serum free light-chain ratio. Patients with all three risk factors have a 20-year progression risk of up to 58%, whereas those without any have a risk of only about 5%. Although monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significanc is generally indolent, associated monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significanc can lead to significant morbidity or mortality.

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^116Q2jXa]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary strength of this study lies in the large cohort of individuals with LC-MG identified through a population-based screening in the iStopMM study. This included analysis of BM samples, utilizing a sensitive and standardized flow cytometry assay, providing valuable insights into PC monoclonality in relation to diagnostic factors in LC-MG. Additionally, the thorough follow-up within a clinical trial framework, which included regular sampling and clinical assessments, provided robust evaluation of the clinical relevance of the FLC ratio threshold observed.

The insights of the study are somewhat constrained by the overrepresentation of individuals with kappa-involved FLC ratio in the iStopMM study, based on standard pathological FLC ratio reference values. Additionally, with the high detection of clonal PC in BM samples from individuals with lambda-involved FLC ratio (18 of 19 samples), a relationship between FLC ratio and clonal PC presence could not be established for this group. Several factors might have affected the detection of clonal PC: BM sample quality and hemodilution, uneven distribution of PC in the BM, and conventional limitations of the flow cytometry assay, such as the potential lack of phenotypical aberrancy in clonal PC not detected by the markers used. Furthermore, the dataset was not sufficiently large to thoroughly investigate the influence of age and kidney function on the relationship between FLC ratio and the presence of clonal PC. We observed that individuals without detected clonal PC were more likely to have increased age and reduced kidney function, which are associated with a more skewed kappa-involved FLC ratio. Despite this, the proposed cutoff of > 3.15 was identified as highly sensitive in predicting clonal PC. This is consistent with the revised normal FLC reference ranges, as the proposed cutoff is either above or within the upper end of these ranges for individuals with impaired kidney function (e.g. eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2: 0.54–3.30) or advanced age (≥ 70 years: 0.45–2.59), supporting its applicability in these populations.

Results

One control individual was removed as an outlier, resulting in a set of 117 at-risk relatives and 159 population controls for analysis. Summaries for the demographics for these two groups are shown in Table 2 and their Ig values are shown in Table 3.

Association of "at-risk" relatives and Ig variables

Polyclonal variables were analyzed as quantitative traits. Results are shown in Table 4. A statistically significant difference in IgM levels was found between high-risk pedigree relatives and controls (p = 0.033, after adjusting for age and sex), indicating a 16.0 mg/dL increase in relatives (95% CI 1.4–30.5). Defining elevated IgM (eIgM) to be a value beyond the 95th percentile from the control reference range (IgM(κ + λ) ≥ 19 mg/dL), 11.1% of the "at-risk" relatives had eIgM (13/117). When individuals with known MBL, hematological malignancies, or solid tumors at the time of sampling were removed, results were similar and remained significant (data not shown). No statistically significant differences were found for polyclonal variables FLC(κ + λ), IgA(κ + λ), or IgG(κ + λ).

### International myeloma working group guidelines for serum-free light chain analysis in multiple myeloma and related disorders [^113PhT6r]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

The serum immunoglobulin-free light chain (FLC) assay measures levels of free kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains. There are three major indications for the FLC assay in the evaluation and management of multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders (PCD). In the context of screening, the serum FLC assay in combination with serum protein electrophoresis (PEL) and immunofixation yields high sensitivity, and negates the need for 24-h urine studies for diagnoses other than light chain amyloidosis (AL). Second, the baseline FLC measurement is of major prognostic value in virtually every PCD. Third, the FLC assay allows for quantitative monitoring of patients with oligosecretory PCD, including AL, oligosecretory myeloma and nearly two-thirds of patients who had previously been deemed to have non-secretory myeloma. In AL patients, serial FLC measurements outperform PEL and immunofixation. In oligosecretory myeloma patients, although not formally validated, serial FLC measurements reduce the need for frequent bone marrow biopsies. In contrast, there are no data to support using FLC assay in place of 24-h urine PEL for monitoring or for serial measurements in PCD with measurable disease by serum or urine PEL. This paper provides consensus guidelines for the use of this important assay, in the diagnosis and management of clonal PCD.

### Elevated IgM and abnormal free light chain ratio are increased in relatives from high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia pedigrees [^115mYPdj]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 4
Propensity-score adjusted regression analysis results

Propensity-score adjustment with matching on sex and age was used to control imbalances and nonlinearity in sex and age distributions between relatives and controls; p -values are from the Wald's test. Polyclonal Ig variables are quantitative traits and are tested within a linear regression framework. Average differences in relatives compared with controls and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Monoclonal Ig variables are dichotomous and tested within a logistic regression framework. Fold differences for monoclonality (abnormal κ/λ ratio, free, or bound) and 95% CI are reported from the logistic model. a Abnormality for FLC ratio (κ/λ) is based on its established diagnostic range (0.26–1.65). Abnormal HLC ratios are based on the 95% reference range from controls as follows: 0.84–1.91 for IgA(κ/λ); 1.02–2.87 for IgG(κ/λ); and 1.00–2.90 for IgM(κ/λ). Table entries that are bold and italic indicate those that are statistically different between at-risk relatives and controls

Monoclonality was determined by abnormal κ/λ ratios based on the established diagnostic range for the FLC ratio or control 95% reference ranges (for IgA, IgG, and IgM). Results are shown in Table 4. No statistically significant differences were found for monoclonality of any of the HLCs. aFLC ratios were significantly increased in the pedigree relatives compared with controls (OR = 6.38, 95% CI 1.65–34.97, p = 0.0063). The result remained similar and significant when individuals with known MBL or cancers were removed. Figure 1 illustrates FLC(κ/λ) ratio by age at sampling, showing a steeper trajectory in the "at-risk" relatives than in the controls. Increasing FLC ratio with age is highly significant for relatives (increase of 0.10 per 10 years, p < 0.001), a 2.7-fold higher rate of increase than in the population controls (0.038 per 10 years, p = 0.029).

### The clinical relevance and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and related disorders: recommendations from the European Myeloma Network [^112duMU4]. Haematologica (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, EMN 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain the following laboratory tests to exclude multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, AL amyloidosis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with symptoms or laboratory abnormalities likely to be attributable to the underlying MGUS clone:

- CBC with differential

- blood chemistry (including calcium, albumin, and creatinine)

- serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation

- measurement of free light chains.

### The evolving use of serum free light chain assays in haematology [^112ekWc5]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Over the last few years new immunoassays have emerged that allow the measurement of free immunoglobulin light chains (FLCs) in serum to a level of 2–4 mg/l and provide a much greater sensitivity than older methods, such as immunofixation, which is able to detect FLCs at a minimum concentration of 100–150 mg/l. The new FLC assay has enabled the detection of monoclonal protein in some patients with non-secretory myeloma and amyloidosis that were previously undetectable. FLC measurements are quantitative, correlating with disease activity, and are an advance in monitoring light chain only multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, non-secretory and oligo-secretory multiple myeloma. Serum FLC concentrations also reflect the disease course in the majority of myeloma patients producing intact monoclonal immunoglobulin proteins and have been incorporated into the new response criteria. The rapid half life of lambda and kappa free light chains means that FLC assays may provide a more rapid indication of the response to treatment but their clinical utility in this setting needs further study. An abnormal FLC ratio has been shown to be a risk factor for progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smouldering myeloma and solitary plasmacytoma of bone and is prognostic in multiple myeloma.

### Serum free light-chain measurements for identifying and monitoring patients with nonsecretory multiple myeloma [^112fxGsM]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

Using sensitive, automated immunoassays, increased concentrations of either kappa or lambda free light chains (and abnormal kappa/lambda ratios) were detected in the sera of 19 of 28 patients with nonsecretory multiple myeloma. Four other patients had suppression of one or both light chains, and the remaining 5 sera had normal or raised free light-chain concentrations with substantially normal kappa/lambda ratios. Six of the patients with an elevated single free light chain, who were studied during follow-up, had changes in disease activity that were reflected by the changes in free light-chain concentrations. It is concluded that quantification of free light chains in serum should prove useful for the diagnosis and monitoring of many patients with nonsecretory myeloma.

### Polyclonal serum free light chain elevation is associated with increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies [^116rFevJ]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The findings of the current study have several implications. The polyclonal elevation in the immunoglobulin free light chain points toward a general activation of plasma cells or other lymphoid cells that may precede the development of the monoclonal plasma cell population. It strengthens the argument in favor of chronic antigenic stimulation, infectious or otherwise, as a possible initial trigger for the establishment of the MGUS clone. We hypothesize that the first step in the pathogenesis of MGUS is a polyclonal expansion of plasma cells in response to antigenic stimulation that manifests as higher levels of free serum kappa and lambda FLCs. These FLC elevations may be mild enough to not elevate the level of either light chain outside what is considered the normal reference range, but asseen in our study can be detected with greater likelihood of being in the highest population decile of ΣFLC. This polyclonal expansion phase persists for a prolonged period of time, increasing the odds of a plasma cell acquiring one of the two main classes of primary cytogenetic abnormalities (immunoglobulin heavy chain translocations or trisomies) that establish the premalignant MGUS clone. As we have previously described, the MGUS clone once established is at the risk of acquiring additional cytogenetic abnormalities which results in a long-term persistent risk of progression to MM or related malignancy.

From a population standpoint, the identification of biomarkers for development of monoclonal gammopathies can have potential clinical applications in the long term. There is clear evidence suggesting the early intervention in MM at the asymptomatic SMM phase may provide an opportunity to alter the natural history of the disease in a positive way. This is likely to lead to more screening approaches and identification of monoclonal gammopathies in the population, especially in high-risk populations such as first-degree relatives of patients with myeloma, and in blacks. But more importantly, the finding that polyclonal elevations precede the development of MGUS provides clues to etiologic factors. For instance, we have data from our earlier studies that polyclonal elevations of immunoglobulins, as well as MGUS are much more common in Ghana compared with age-matched population in Olmsted County. The findings of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the first step in the pathogenesis of MM in polyclonal expansion of plasma cells presumably in response to antigenic stimulation, and provides important insights for future studies to determine more specific etiologic factors for MGUS and MM.

### Extended use of serum free light chain as a biomarker in lymphoproliferative disorders: a comprehensive review [^114w3riH]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum free light chain (sFLC) assays were shown to improve detection, management, and prognostication in plasma cell disorders. Recently, sFLC assays improved detection of M proteins when combined with standard methods of protein electrophoresis/immunofixation in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL). Incidence of abnormal sFLC ratio (sFLCr) varied from 0% to 36% and 29.7% to 59% in NHL and CLL, respectively. Increased sFLC levels or abnormal sFLCr predict shorter overall survival in early-stage CLL. Furthermore, abnormal sFLCr correlated with advanced disease stage and poorer outcome. In diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, increased sFLC was demonstrated as an independent, adverse prognostic factor for overall/event-free survival. Moreover, abnormal sFLCr can be a diagnostic tool in central nervous system lymphomas. Finally, the quantitative FLC assay has the potential to become a new, easily measured biomarker for predicting prognosis and enhanced detection in NHL/CLL. It may be used serially at follow-up evaluations to provide clues to relapse.

3 Results

A total of 632 samples (of 605 individual patients) were included in the study. The κ ‐FLC index ranged between 0.5 and 971. Two hundred and thirteen samples showed a κ ‐FLC index of 3.5 or higher and were subjected to OCB testing. Of those, 180 (85%) had a positive κ ‐FLC index, and 148 (69%) were OCB positive. Agreement between κ ‐FLC index and OCB was given in 179 (84%) samples. An overview of routine CSF findings of samples with concordant κ ‐FLC index and OCB testing is provided in Table S2.

In 34 (16%) of 213 samples, discordant results on κ ‐FLC index and OCB were found. There was one patient with positive OCB but negative κ ‐FLC index (showing a κ ‐FLC index of 4.86). In this case, the serum κ ‐FLC was markedly elevated, showing a concentration of 14.2 mg/dL (Table S3).

In 33 samples, OCB was negative, but the κ ‐FLC index was positive. In four samples, an explanation was derived for this discrepancy: three patients had isolated intrathecal IgM synthesis and one patient had isolated intrathecal IgA synthesis (Table S3).

The remaining 29 OCB negative samples showed a median κ ‐FLC index of 8.7 (25th percentile: 7.1, 75th percentile: 10.3, maximum: 71.2).

Clinical diagnoses of patients with OCB negative but κ ‐FLC index positive samples (excluding those 4 samples with intrathecal Ig synthesis) were retrieved. Twenty‐two (76%) of 29 samples came from patients with IND, while 7 (24%) from patients with NIND. The most frequent clinical diagnoses among the 22 patients with IND were MS (23%) and tick‐borne encephalitis (23%) (Table S3).

### Serum immunoglobulin free light-chain measurement in primary amyloidosis: prognostic value and correlations with clinical features [^113yYSju]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) are the precursors of amyloid fibrils in primary amyloidosis (AL). We studied the relationship between FLC levels and clinical features in 730 patients with newly diagnosed AL. The plasma cell clone was λ in 72% patients, and κ in 28% patients. κ-AL had more GI tract and liver involvement, where as renal involvement was more with λ-AL. While the overall survival (OS) was similar for κ and λ-AL, the median OS for those without an identifiable serum heavy chain was significantly shorter (12.6 vs 29.9 months; p = 0.02). The OS was shorter among those with a higher dFLC (involved FLC-uninvolved FLC; κ > 29.4 mg/dL or λ > 18.2 mg/dL using median for cutoff); 10.9 vs 37.1 months; P < .001. In multivariate analysis, dFLC was independent of other prognostic factors. The type of light chain impacts the spectrum of organ involvement and the FLC burden correlates with survival in AL.

### The cumulative amount of serum-free light chain is a strong prognosticator in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115YEnqe]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of patients at risk of early disease progression is the mainstay of tailored management in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although application of established biomarkers is limited by intrinsic detection/readout complexities, abnormality of κ and λ serum-free light chain ratio [sFLC (κ/λ)] was proposed as a straightforward prognosticator in CLL. By analyzing 449 therapy-naive patients, we show that an abnormal sFLC(κ/λ), along with CD38, ZAP-70, IGHV mutations, cytogenetics and stage, independently predicts treatment-free survival (TFS) but becomes prognostically irrelevant if the cumulative amount of clonal and nonclonal FLCs [sFLC(κ + λ)], a variable associated with cytogenetic risk, exceeds the threshold of 60.6 mg/mL. Patients with sFLC(κ + λ) above cut-off displayed a poorer TFS outcome, irrespective of sFLC(κ/λ). Only ZAP-70, cytogenetics, stage, and TFS remained associated with sFLC(κ + λ) in a multivariate model. By assigning 1 point each for these variables, the 3-year probability of TFS was 94.8%, 84.5%, 61.6%, and 21.1% for patients scoring 0, 1, 2, and 3 + 4, respectively (P < .0001). These data, and the demonstration that monoclonal and polyclonal B cells concur to FLC synthesis in tumor tissues, suggest that sFLC(κ/λ) and sFLC(κ + λ) mirror distinct biologic processes in CLL. sFLC(κ + λ) assessment represents a sensitive and cost-effective tool for identifying CLL patients requiring early treatment.

### Elevated, combined serum free light chain levels and increased mortality: a 5-year follow-up, UK study [^116ydr3L]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Abnormal serum free light chain (FLC) ratios are diagnostically important in almost all plasma cell disorders. However, absolute increases in polyclonal FLC levels are often discarded as inconsequential. Here we report an association between increased combined polyclonal FLC (cFLC: FLCκ plus FLCλ) concentrations and mortality.

Methods

723 patients sent for 30 routine haematological assessments were enrolled. Patients with a confirmed monoclonal gammopathy were removed. The remaining 527 patients were followed up for up to 4.5 years. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (V.19).

Results

During follow-up, there were 99 deaths (18.8%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed 29% of these deaths occurred within the first 100 days (N = 29). Multivariate analysis identified only cFLC > 65 mg/l, albumin < 33 g/l and estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) to be independently associated with mortality within 100 days and 4.5 years with, cFLC having the highest HR of 7.1. A simple risk stratification model based only on albumin and cFLC identified 86% mortality within 100 days and 62% over 4.5 years.

Conclusions

Elevated cFLC is significantly associated with increased mortality and with albumin can be used to identify patients at risk of mortality at 4.5 years with high-risk patients detected within 100 days.

### Comparison of three different serum-free light-chain assays-implications on diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring of multiple myeloma [^115A8QZQ]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Serum-free light chains (FLC) are important biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), multiple myeloma (MM), and other plasma cell disorders, such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), light-chain amyloidosis (AL-amyloidosis), and light-chain deposition disease (LCDD) –.

In MM patients, the determination of FLC is used in the initial diagnostic assessment and during follow-up monitoring. In response evaluation, determination of stringent complete response (sCR) is defined by complete response (negative immunofixation in serum and urine, plasma cells in the bone marrow < 5%) with normalized kappa/lambda ratio (κ/λ ratio). In the absence of a measurable serum and urine M-protein, response assessment is based on the percentage decrease of difference between involved and noninvolved FLC (partial response is defined as dFLC decrease > 50%). Furthermore, in LCDD and AL-amyloidosis, response assessment relies on absolute and percentage decrease of difference between involved and noninvolved FLC (partial response is defined as dFLC decrease > 50% and very good partial response as dFLC < 40 mg/l) –.

The importance of FLC measurement was recently highlighted by introduction of a new definition of MM disease. According to the recommendation of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), the FLC ratio of involved and noninvolved FLC (iFLC/niFLC ratio) ≥ 100, with concentration of involved FLC ≥ 100 mg/l is sufficient to differentiate between SMM and MM requiring treatment. Even more recently, new criteria for high-risk SMM were defined. The 2/20/20 rule with serum M-protein level > 2 g/l, FLC ratio > 20, and bone marrow infiltration > 20% identifies SMM patients with a progression rate of 46% within 2 years and who might benefit from early treatment intervention.

Since the implementation of FLC measurement in diagnostic evaluation of MM, only a single assay method based on polyclonal antibodies (Freelite) was accessible for measurement of FLC. Subsequently, two additional assays were developed: the N Latex FLC assay, which is based on monoclonal antibodies, introduced in 2011, and the Sebia FLC assay, launched in 2018, which is an ELISA-based assay using polyclonal antibodies. To date, data and recommendations out of clinical trials were exclusively relying on the results obtained with the Freelite assay.

### Kappa free light chain index in the real world-Do we miss clinically relevant information by skipping oligoclonal banding? [^1178HAHG]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

A practical guidance on how to incorporate κ ‐FLC index in routine CSF analysis is missing. Using the κ ‐FLC index as a screening test and applying lower and upper boundaries that determine subsequent OCB testing is known as "reflex approach". Accordingly, clearly negative results are reported as negative, clearly positive results as positive, and borderline results, falling into a so‐called "gray zone" should prompt further OCB testing to provide additional evidence of whether an intrathecal immune activation is present or not. Since clear evidence for the definition of the "gray zone" has so far been lacking, we performed the present study.

Our study revealed a "gray zone" for the κ ‐FLC index between 3.5 and 20. The primary purpose of the lower κ ‐FLC index screening cut‐off is to minimize the risk of missing positive OCB. Our cut‐off of ≥ 3.5 is supported by a previous study reporting a lower κ ‐FLC index screening cut‐off of 3.61 with a high sensitivity of 97% to detect OCB. For the upper screening cut‐off, previous evidence is insufficient. Here, we have chosen a κ ‐FLC index of 20, as this upper κ ‐FLC index screening cut‐off identified more than 95% of OCB positive samples. Interestingly, the cut‐offs 3.5 and 20 roughly correspond to the range of κ ‐FLC index cut‐off values used by different prior studies, as assessed by a recent meta‐analysis.

Overall, we are confident that a "gray zone" between 3.5 and 20 provides a solid basis for the "reflex approach" (Figure 2). Considering the resource‐ and time‐intensive method of isoelectric focusing, it is reasonable to screen with κ ‐FLC index and to conduct OCB only in cases within the "gray zone" However, in certain special cases, with a κ ‐FLC index < 3.5 but high clinical suspicion of an inflammatory neurological disease such as MS, OCB testing might still be amended. In cases with a positive κ ‐FLC index, the level of the κ ‐FLC index quantifies the extent of intrathecal inflammation. In MS, the prognostic value of the κ ‐FLC index goes beyond those of OCB, as the κ ‐FLC index overcomes simple dichotomization by further stratifying patients with present intrathecal plasma cell activity.

### Kappa free light chain index as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in multiple sclerosis [^114wsvBh]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths of our study include the application of both the 2017 and the proposed 2024 McDonald criteria and the avoidance of incorporation bias through initial classification based solely on clinical and MRI findings. Limitations include the relatively small number of patients with MS (leading to wide confidence intervals in some analyses), the retrospective design and the follow-up duration (median 3–4 years) which limits inferences about long-term disability or progression. Prognostic estimates should be considered preliminary and require validation in adequately powered, prospective studies with extended follow-up.

### Elevated serum free light chains are associated with event-free and overall survival in two independent cohorts of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma… [^112a7JPw]. ASCO (2011). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose The serum free light chain assay quantitates free kappa and free lambda immunoglobulin light chains. This assay has prognostic value in plasma cell proliferative disorders. There are limited data on serum FLC in B-cell malignancies. Results Elevated FLC or abnormal κ: λ FLC ratio was present in 32% and 14% of patients, respectively. Patients with elevated FLC had an inferior OS and EFS in both cohorts compared with patients with normal FLC, but not in patients without corresponding elevated κ or λ. Elevated FLC was the strongest predictor of outcome in multivariable models with the IPI components. Conclusion Increased serum FLC is an independent, adverse prognostic factor for EFS and OS in DLBCL and warrants further evaluation as a biomarker in DLBCL.

The free light chain assay measures the concentration in the serum of immunoglobulin kappa and lambda light chains that are not attached to a heavy chain. The diagnosis of DLBCL was confirmed by the study hematopathologist in all patients. Increased serum FLC was strongly associated with an inferior outcome and remained significant after adjusting for IPI. Abnormal κ: λ FLC ratio, however, was only modestly associated with outcome across all patients, with the association only related to a concomitant elevated FLC. Patients with abnormal κ: λ FLC ratio without an elevation of either chain should be considered normal for risk. We defined elevated FLC as a concentration above the published normal range for either κ and/or λ. This definition captures patients with either a monoclonal or polyclonal FLC expansion, as outcome was similarly poor for each type of FLC expansion.

Examination of the hazard ratio across the continuous range of each light chain shows an increase in risk for high values of κ, λ, as well as total FLC.

### New definition of light chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^115zBrxX]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Given the pivotal role of serum FLC measurement in detection, risk stratification, and monitoring of lymphoproliferative disorders, ensuring the accuracy of their reference intervals is crucial. Our newly proposed reference intervals for κ and λ FLC differ significantly from the standard intervals. In our cohort, we observed markedly higher levels of κ FLC, λ FLC, and FLC ratio compared with the values reported in the original study. This finding is in line with several recent smaller studies that have consistently demonstrated a high rate of false-positive results in individuals with slightly abnormal κ FLC levels. These results, together with our current findings, emphasize the imprecision of the standard reference intervals and the need for revised reference intervals. Discrepancies between our and the original reference intervals likely stem from a combination of different baseline populations studied and a change in κ levels of the Freelite assay (The Binding Site) over time. The exact cause of this upward drift in κ levels remains unknown but could possibly be linked to incremental changes in calibration over time. Interestingly, within our revised reference interval, the lower limit of the FLC ratio has significantly increased. This shift cannot be solely attributed to an upward drift in λ FLC levels, as this was minimal compared with the substantial change in κ FLC levels. It appears that the lower limit of the standard reference interval for FLC ratio has hitherto been erroneously low, resulting in false-negative values in cases of λ plasma cell disorders, which is consistent with previous studies. This discrepancy implies that use of the standard reference interval results in overdiagnosis of κ LC disease in persons without a true monoclonal disorder and underdiagnosis of λ LC disease in individuals with an underlying monoclonal disorder.

### High sensitivity and specificity of elevated cerebrospinal fluid kappa free light chains in suspected multiple sclerosis [^113nVTe7]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is routinely used in the diagnostic work-up of multiple sclerosis (MS), by detecting CSF-specific oligoclonal bands (OCB). More recently, several studies have reported CSF free light chains (FLC) as an alternative. We show that absolute CSF κFLC concentrations were highly sensitive - more than OCB testing - and specific for clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting and primary progressive MS. Measurement of κFLC alone was sufficient. Our results suggest that CSF κFLC levels measured by nephelometry, if validated in a larger series, are a preferred test to OCB analysis in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of having MS.

### Data analytics improves the diagnostic accuracy of serum free light chain results for detecting monoclonal gammopathy [^112S87xC]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points

International guidelines for multiple myeloma management use the Binding Site Freelite serum free light chain (SFLC) assay's manufacturer-recommended reference intervals to define "abnormal".
Among 5057 patients with monoclonal-negative results by both SFLC and immunofixation assays, 25% had κ/λ ratios outside the manufacturer-defined normal reference interval of 0.26–1.65.
Manufacturer-recommended normal reference intervals for the Freelite SFLC assay warrant reevaluation and revision; a κ/λ ratio reference interval of 0.67–2.13 was most appropriate for our population tested on the Optilite platform.

Systemic light chain amyloidosis — renal assessment and free light chain interpretation: To assess organ involvement, the workup should include urinalysis with quantification of proteinuria by 24-hour urine collection and measurement of creatinine clearance (calculated or measured directly). FLCs are cleared by the kidney; therefore, renal insufficiency increases the concentrations of FLC, and in that case, the kappa/lambda ratio or the difference between involved and uninvolved FLCs should be monitored.

### Elevated serum free light chains are associated with event-free and overall survival in two independent cohorts of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^112emTXv]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The serum free light chain (FLC) assay quantitates free kappa (κ) and free lambda (λ) immunoglobulin light chains. This assay has prognostic value in plasma cell proliferative disorders. There are limited data on serum FLC in B-cell malignancies.

Patients and Methods

The association of pretreatment FLC with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was evaluated in 76 patients from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial N0489 (NCT00301821) and 219 patients from the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Specialized Program of Research Excellence Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER). Published reference ranges were used to define an elevated FLC or an abnormal κ:λ FLC ratio.

Results

Elevated FLC or abnormal κ:λ FLC ratio was present in 32% and 14% of patients, respectively. Patients with elevated FLC had an inferior OS and EFS in both cohorts compared with patients with normal FLC (N0489: EFS hazard ratio [HR], 3.06; OS HR, 3.16; both P < .02; MER: EFS HR, 2.42; OS HR, 3.40; both P < .001; combined EFS HR, 2.57; OS HR, 3.74; both P < .001). All associations remained significant for EFS and OS after adjusting for the International Prognostic Index (IPI). Abnormal κ:λ FLC ratio was modestly associated with outcome in the combined group (EFS HR, 1.61; OS HR, 1.67; both P = .07), but not in patients without corresponding elevated κ or λ. Elevated FLC was the strongest predictor of outcome in multivariable models with the IPI components.

Conclusion

Increased serum FLC is an independent, adverse prognostic factor for EFS and OS in DLBCL and warrants further evaluation as a biomarker in DLBCL.

Systemic light chain amyloidosis — laboratory evaluation for monoclonal proteins: The laboratory evaluation begins with a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, including platelet counts, and peripheral blood smear. Screening for monoclonal protein by serum and urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP) alone may not be adequate, as it does not show a monoclonal spike in nearly 50% of cases; therefore, serum immunofixation electrophoresis (SIPE) and 24-hour urine immunofixation electrophoresis (UIPE) is essential along with serum free light chain (FLC) analysis. The measurement of serum FLC is a diagnostic necessity, as the majority of patients with light chain amyloidosis will have abnormalities of the kappa or lambda chains with an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio.

The recent introduction of highly sensitive immunoassays that measure FLCs to levels below those present in normal individuals has provided a new tool for diagnosis and management in this setting. Here, we review the biology of FLC production in health and disease, and the utility of FLC immunoassays in the assessment of monoclonal gammopathies in kidney disease.

### Serum immunoglobulin free light chain assessment in rheumatoid arthritis and primary Sjögren's syndrome [^1122UUZo]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

B cell activation may result in an increased secretion of immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) in autoimmune diseases.

Objective

To analyse serum FLC levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in those with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS).

Patients and Methods

Blood samples were collected from 80 healthy blood donors, 50 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 139 patients with pSS. Serum FLC level was measured using a new quantitative immunoassay.

Results

Mean (standard error (SE)) serum kappa and lambda FLC levels were significantly higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in those with pSS than in controls (kappa: 18.9 (1.1) and 16.3 (1.4) v 10.5 (0.4) mg/l, p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively; lambda: 16.7 (1.2) and 19.3 (1.5) v 11.6 (0.6) mg/l, p < 0.001 for both). 18 (36%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 31 (22.3%) patients with pSS had abnormal serum FLC levels (increased kappa or lambda levels and abnormal ratio of kappa:lambda). Serum kappa and lambda levels were correlated with other B cell activation markers in both diseases. FLC levels increased with disease activity, because, unlike total gammaglobulin and immunoglobulin G levels, they were significantly correlated with Disease Activity Score 28 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (p = 0.004 for kappa, p = 0.05 for lambda) and with extraglandular involvement in pSS (p = 0.01 for kappa, p = 0.04 for lambda).

Conclusion

FLC levels are increased and correlate with disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in those with pSS, two diseases in which increased risk of lymphoma could result from persistent B cell activation and disease activity. Further studies are required to determine whether FLC assessment could represent a relevant biomarker for response to treatment (especially B cell depletion) and for the risk of lymphoma in autoimmune diseases.

### Elevated IgM and abnormal free light chain ratio are increased in relatives from high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia pedigrees [^1116LyGY]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

B-cells produce immunoglobulin (Ig) as part of the native and adaptive immune system. Aberrant B-cell activation and expansion may be reflected in abnormal polyclonal or monoclonal production of Ig heavy chains (e.g. IgA, IgG, and IgM) and/or light chains (κ and λ). This includes intact Igs comprising bound heavy light chains (HLC) and unbound free light chains (FLC) due to more abundant light-chain synthesis. Abnormal polyclonal (κ + λ) or monoclonal (κ/λ) FLCs in serum have been shown to be biomarkers of prognosis and survival in plasma cell disorders – and other B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including CLL –. Prospective cohorts have identified elevated polyclonal and abnormal monoclonal FLCs as early biomarkers of CLL, detectable upto 9.8 years before diagnosis. More recently, assays to quantitate serum Ig HLCs have been developed. In plasma cell disorders, HLCs have also proven to be useful biomarkers of progression, prognosis, and survival, independent of FLC markers. The role of HLC biomarkers has yet to be explored in other B-cell malignancies. Here we explore the hypothesis that inherited risk extends to early steps in CLL pathogenesis, defective immune response (polyclonal expansion), and the development of clonal populations. We investigate the potential for heritability of polyclonal and monoclonal FLCs and HLCs using "at-risk" relatives in CLL pedigrees.

### Kappa free light chain index in the real world-Do we miss clinically relevant information by skipping oligoclonal banding? [^111wEgC3]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

We emphasize that one key question remains unsolved: How should clinicians handle discordant results, for example, in cases with a positive κ ‐FLC index but a negative OCB? In our opinion, this remains an individual decision for each single patient. The interesting finding in our cohort was that in discrepant cases, the agreement of κ ‐FLC index with the clinical diagnoses was superior compared to OCB (as approximately ¾ of samples with positive κ ‐FLC index but negative OCB were from patients with IND). Nevertheless, further research is required to address clinical cases with borderline and discrepant OCB and κ ‐FLC index findings. At this point, we would like to clearly state that an elevation of κ ‐FLC index is not specific for neuroinflammatory disorders, but may also be seen in other conditions, for example, in malignant diseases.

Exposures and outcomes

Using the original and revised reference intervals, respectively, the exposure for the study was 1) abnormal FLC ratio, and 2) risk group stratification. The FLC measurement closest in time to the M protein measurement was used. Using the original and revised reference intervals, respectively, the FLC ratio (kappa/lambda) was considered abnormal if outside the reference ranges listed in Table 1.000000000000000e+00

Table 1

FLC free light chain, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate.

The primary outcomes for the study were (1) progression to MM, or (2) progression to MM (including smoldering MM), B-cell NHL (including CLL), or AL amyloidosis. These diagnoses were identified in DALY-CARE using ICD10 codes (listed in supplementary Table 2), originally registered in the Danish Lymphoma Database or in the previously mentioned databases. Patients were followed from the set MGUS diagnosis date (defined in the section above) until progression, death, or end of follow-up. As data on progression may have a delay compared to data on vital status, follow-up was terminated on December 31, 2023. For some individuals, the date of MGUS diagnosis and/or relevant laboratory data was later than or equal to the end of the follow-up date. These individuals were excluded from the study, including those diagnosed after December 31, 2023.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive analysis

The median follow-up was calculated using the reversed Kaplan–Meier. Characteristics of the MGUS cohort were presented overall and stratified into (1) normal FLC ratio using any reference interval, (2) FLC ratio reclassified from abnormal by the original reference to normal by the revised, and (3) abnormal FLC ratio according to the revised reference intervals. The descriptive analysis was generated in R using the gtsummary and tidyverse packages. Overall cumulative incidence was calculated using the Aalen–Johansson estimator, considering death as a competing risk. Additionally, overall cumulative incidences were calculated using Kaplan–Meier estimation, not accounting for death as a competing risk. This was added to enable data comparability with existing studies that did not account for death as a competing risk.

### Concentrations of serum free light chains in kappa and lambda lesions in light-chain myelomas [^111hD59Q]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Concentration of serum free light chains has been promoted as an assay in the evaluation of monoclonal gammopathic manifestations. A high false-positive rate in patients without monoclonal gammopathic manifestations and a high false-negative rate in patients with those manifestations have been reported. The false-negative rate for lambda chain-associated lesions is higher than that for kappa chain-associated lesions.

Objective

To assess the serum free light chains in light-chain myelomas.

Methods

Concentrations of involved and uninvolved serum free light chains were retrospectively reviewed in patients with light-chain myelomas.

Results

The highest recorded levels of involved light chains in kappa-chain myelomas and lambda-chain myelomas were comparable. The levels of uninvolved light chains were higher, although not statistically significantly, in lambda-chain lesions.

Conclusions

The results of serum free light chains in light-chain myelomas support the clinical usefulness of the assay in monitoring patients with light chain myeloma.

### Prognostic value of the serum free light chain ratio in newly diagnosed myeloma: proposed incorporation into the international staging system [^113tXrCM]. Leukemia (2008). Low credibility.

To determine if the serum free light chain (FLC) ratio has prognostic value in patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), baseline serum samples from a well-characterized cohort of 790 newly diagnosed MM patients were tested with the FLC assay. FLC ratio was calculated as kappa/lambda (reference range 0.26–1.65). On the basis of the distribution of values, a cutpoint kappa/lambda FLC ratio of < 0.03 or > 32 was chosen for further analysis. Overall survival was significantly inferior in patients with an abnormal FLC ratio of < 0.03 or > 32 (n = 479) compared with those with an FLC ratio between 0.03 and 32 (n = 311), with median survival of 30 versus 39 months, respectively. We incorporated abnormal FLC ratio with the International Staging System (ISS) risk factors (that is, albumin < 3.5 g/dl and serum beta(2)-microglobulin ≥ 3.5 g/l), to create a risk stratification model with improved prognostic capabilities. Patients with 0, 1, 2 or 3 adverse risk factors had significantly different overall survival, with median survival times of 51, 39, 30 and 22 months, respectively (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that the serum FLC ratio at initial diagnosis is an important predictor of prognosis in myeloma, and can be incorporated into the ISS for improved risk stratification.

For the entire cohort, accounting for death as a competing risk, the 5-year cumulative incidence of progression to MM was 2.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.4–3.2), and 3.9% (95% CI 3.4–4.3) for progression to MM, NHL, or AL amyloidosis. The 10-year cumulative incidence was 3.6% (95% CI 3.2–4.0) for progression to MM, and 5.0% (95% CI 4.5–5.5) for progression to MM, NHL, or AL amyloidosis.

Not accounting for death as a competing risk, the overall cumulative incidence of progression to MM was 4.9% (95% CI 4.2–5.6) after 5 years and 10.5% (95% CI 8.9–12.3) after 10 years. Again, not accounting for death as a competing risk, the overall cumulative incidence of progression to MM, NHL, or AL amyloidosis was 6.5% (95% CI 5.7–7.3) after 5 years and 14.4% (95% CI 12.5–16.5) after 10 years.

### Serum free light chain analysis [^114dVV6b]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

In a variety of hematologic malignancies, immunoglobulin light chains (LC) are overproduced clonally and circulate without being linked by disulphide bonds to the immunoglobulin heavy chain. The recent development of a robust assay known as κ and λ "free" LC (FLC) to quantify the levels of these unbound LC in the serum, and thereby determine their ratio, has led to an explosion of studies that demonstrate its utility in a wide range of hematologic disorders. This article summarizes laboratory testing for serum FLC, with a particular focus on clinical applications for the test.

### Relationship between elevated immunoglobulin free light chain and the presence of IgH translocations in multiple myeloma [^113dh4jv]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

Elevated immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) level and abnormal FLC ratio are commonly seen in multiple myeloma (MM) and have prognostic implications. We hypothesized that presence of immunoglobin heavy chain (IgH) translocations leads to unbalanced production of light chains and more extreme abnormalities of FLC, and may explain the prognostic value of FLC. We studied 314 patients with newly diagnosed MM enrolled in a phase III trial, in whom results of fluorescence in situ hybridization testing and data on serum FLC levels were available. Cytogenetic analyses and FLC estimates were performed on stored samples and results were correlated with clinical data. The median ratio (FLC ratio) and the absolute difference (FLC diff) between the involved and uninvolved FLC were higher among those with IgH translocations, especially t(14;16). In multivariate analysis, the prognostic value of FLC estimates on progression-free and overall survival were independent of high-risk IgH translocations t(4;14) and t(14;16). A combination of the risk factors; either abnormal FLC estimate and/or the presence of high-risk IgH translocation, achieved better prognostic stratification. We conclude that patients with IgH translocations have higher FLC levels and abnormal ratios, but the prognostic effect of FLC is only partially explained by translocation status. A system including both these risk factors allows better prediction of outcome.

Performance of Standard Reference Intervals

Standard reference intervals yielded a high rate of aberrant results in the cohort (Figure 1), with 17.5% of κ FLC, 4.0% of λ FLC, and 3.7% of the FLC ratios classified as abnormal. The distribution of abnormal results was predominantly above the upper limit of normal for all 3 parameters, with 17.5% (n = 7313) having high κ FLC and 0.01% (n = 3) low κ FLC, 3.7% (n = 1525) having high λ FLC and 0.3% (n = 143) low λ FLC, and 3.6% (n = 1505) having a high FLC ratio and 0.1% (n = 38) a low ratio. The crude rate of LC-MGUS using the standard reference intervals in this subpopulation with preserved kidney function was 2.0% (n = 850), of whom 813 had κ LC-MGUS and 37 had λ LC-MGUS. Combining the standard reference intervals for κ FLC, λ FLC, and FLC ratio in those with eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or greater with the iStopMM kidney reference intervals for individuals with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the whole-group prevalence of LC-MGUS was 1.54% (95% CI, 1.46–1.63). The prevalence of κ LC-MGUS was 1.47% (95% CI, 1.39–1.55), and the prevalence of λ LC-MGUS was 0.07% (95% CI, 0.05–0.09).

### Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies [^112DVUcW]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies — key disease and protein terms are defined as follows: Monoclonal gammopathy is "a condition in which monoclonal immunoglobulin proteins circulate in the blood", and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is "the most common category of monoclonal gammopathy, which is asymptomatic and requires no intervention in the vast majority of cases". Monoclonal immunoglobulin protein (M‑protein) are "immunoglobulin proteins produced by monoclonal plasma cells", and the M spike or M‑spike "refers to the narrow, isosceles triangle appearance of the monoclonal immunoglobulin protein seen on protein electrophoresis". Multiple myeloma is described as "a cancer of plasma cells" in which "multiple myeloma caused the plasma cells to accumulate in the bone marrow and crowd out the healthy blood cells". The free kappa/free lambda ratio is "the ratio of two types of immunoglobulin light chains (kappa and lambda) when not bound to immunoglobulin heavy chains" and "is used to assess risk of harboring a monoclonal protein and its likelihood for progression". Cross‑references indicate "M-component — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein", "Monoclonal Protein — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein", and "Paraproteins — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein". POEMS is a "rare multisystem disorder characterized by (P) polyneuropathy, (O) organomegaly, (E) endocrinopathy, (M) monoclonal gammopathy, and (S) skin abnormalities".

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^115UxBu1]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Correlation between serum free light chain (FLC) ratio and kappa-to-lambda plasma cells (PC) in bone marrow (BM).

The figure displays the relationship between the log10-transformed values of serum FLC ratio (x-axis) and the kappa-to-lambda plasma cell ratio in corresponding BM samples (y-axis) (n = 61). Individual samples are represented by points, with black indicating the presence and red indicating the absence of clonal PC detection in BM samples. A linear regression line demonstrates the trend in the data. The dashed blue lines at x = 1 and y = 1 serve as reference lines. The Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value are included in the plot.

The predictive ability of FLC ratio for a presence of clonal PC population in BM was evaluated for 42 paired serum and BM samples from individuals with kappa-involved FLC only. FLC ratio was found to be significantly predictive of clonal PC in the linear regression model (Odds ratio = 5.75 (per unit of FLC ratio); p < 0.05; n = 42). This observation was further supported by ROC curve analysis (area under the curve = 0.98; n = 42), identifying FLC ratio of 3.15 as the optimal cutoff with sensitivity of 96.7% and specificity of 91.7%. When applied to the total screened iStopMM cohort, 1748/1899 (92.0%) of individuals with kappa-involved LC-MGUS according to the standard criteria and 22/127 (17.3%) with kappa-involved LC-MGUS according to the revised criteria had FLC ratio ≤ 3.15 at screening.

Clinical significance of > 1.65 to < 3.15 free-light chain ratio: Longitudinal assessment of light-chain MGUS individuals

At screening, individuals with an FLC ratio between > 1.65 and 3.15 (n = 124) were significantly older than those with an FLC > 3.15 (n = 71), with a median age of 74 years vs 69 years (p < 0.01). They also had lower median eGFR (48.5 vs 79.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2; p < 0.001), with lower proportion of individuals with preserved kidney function (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) (40.3% vs 78.9%; p < 0.001) (Table 3).

### Kappa free light chain index in the real world-Do we miss clinically relevant information by skipping oligoclonal banding? [^115M1HQu]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

There are some limitations of the present study. First, we present a retrospective study on real‐world data with all its inherent limitations. However, this approach also represents one of the study's strengths. Rather than analyzing pre‐selected samples (e.g. comparing samples of MS patients and non‐inflammatory controls), we included all samples sent to our laboratory within a one‐year period. The MUI is a tertiary medical centre and receives CSF samples for routine analysis from a catchment area of exceeding 12,000 km 2 with a population of approximately 800,000. Despite potential selection bias from the referring physicians, we are confident that our samples represent a wide and broad spectrum of different neurological diseases encountered in clinical practice. A limitation is the use of a predefined κ ‐FLC screening cut‐off (≥ 3.5) which determined whether OCB testing was performed or not. While we cannot exclude the possibility of samples with a κ ‐FLC index < 3.5 but positive OCB, this scenario is highly unlikely based on our previously published cohort (Table S1) and the fact that also other studies have derived a similar cut‐off where missing positive OCB is improbable. It is possible, however, that the actual rate of discordance of particularly OCB positive/ κ ‐FLC negative cases has been slightly underestimated. Another limitation is the absence of clinical data from all patients, preventing us from comparing the distribution of IND and NIND between patients with clearly negative (κ ‐FLC index < 3.5), clearly positive (κ ‐FLC index > 20) results, and patients within the "gray zone" (3.5 ≤ κ ‐FLC index ≤ 20), or from addressing further research questions such as the potential impact of disease duration on discordant results.

In conclusion, we present real‐world data of κ ‐FLC and OCB testing over a one‐year period. Our findings suggest that κ ‐FLC index can serve as an effective screening test, and that further OCB testing can be performed only in case the κ ‐FLC falls into the "gray zone".

### Serum free light chain assay in monoclonal gammopathic manifestations [^112zJ4eS]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum free light chain assay is used in the diagnosis and monitoring of monoclonal gammopathic manifestations. For the kappa (κ)/lambda (λ) ratio, there is a 36% false-positive rate in patients without monoclonal gammopathic manifestations and a 30% false-negative rate in patients with monoclonal gammopathic manifestations. This study was undertaken to address the higher false-negative rate in λ chain-associated monoclonal lesions.

Methods

Results of serum protein electrophoresis, serum immunofixation electrophoresis, and serum free light chain assays were reviewed retrospectively. The results for serum free light chains in cases of intact immunoglobulin monoclonal gammopathic manifestations only were analyzed.

Results

Concentrations of involved serum free light chains were significantly higher in κ chain-associated lesions than in λ chain-associated lesions. The concentration of uninvolved light chains was significantly higher in λ chain-associated lesions.

Conclusions

κ light chains are present in significantly greater abundance than are λ chains in their respective monoclonal lesions. Moreover, κ and λ light-chain levels are not comparable for similar quantitative levels of monoclonal immunoglobulins. The findings warrant a reconsideration of the role of serum free light chain concentrations and involved to uninvolved serum free light chain ratio in designation of myeloma-defining conditions and other diagnostic criteria based on serum free light chain assay.

### Involved / uninvolved heavy / light chain index can predict progression in transplanted multiple myeloma patients [^112Cjb3d]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow microenvironment, the presence of monoclonal protein in the blood or urine and associated organ dysfunction. In recent decades, the widespread use of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and the introduction into clinical practice of the novel agents, including proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) and the immunomodulatory derivatives thalidomide and lenalidomide, have significantly contributed to major advances in MM therapy and prognosis. Nonetheless, MM remains incurable, and the majority of patients eventually relapse after a variable period of time.

Current criteria for determining progressive disease and relapse are principally based on elevations in monoclonal protein (M-protein) or free light chains (FLC). Bone marrow plasma cell percentage and imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging are used to confirm progression, particularly in the case of MM patients without measurable M-protein.

There is a need to identify biomarkers that accurately predict relapse or progression to initiate salvage therapy that prevents serious complications such as end-organ damage.

Different parameters, such as circulating and bone marrow plasma cells or the combination of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) with laboratory data are suggested to predict earlier relapse in MM but they have not been validated yet.

The aim of our study was to identify laboratory variables that could predict early MM relapse/progression in a cohort of transplanted MM patients.

We prospectively followed 44 MM-transplanted patients: 19 with IgG-kappa isotype, 11 with IgG-lambda, 9 with IgA-kappa and 5 with IgA-lambda. They were followed for 29.0 ± 3.8 months (mean ± s.e.). Serial serum samples from each of the MM patients were collected periodically after ASCT.

### Cerebrospinal fluid kappa and lambda free light chains in oligoclonal band-negative patients with suspected multiple sclerosis [^116xp5gD]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) kappa free light chains (FLCs) may be a more sensitive marker of intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig)G synthesis compared with oligoclonal bands (OCBs). Our aim was to retrospectively determine the additional value of the kappa and lambda index (CSF FLC/serum FLC)/(CSF albumin/serum albumin) in predicting a multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis in a group of OCB-negative patients with suspected MS.

Methods

The CSF and serum kappa and lambda FLCs were tested using the Freelite kit (serum) and Freelite Mx (CSF) assay (The Binding Site Group, Bimingham, UK) in 391 OCB-negative patients with suspected/possible MS and in 54 OCB-positive patients with MS.

Results

The CSF kappa FLC levels were below the detection limit (0.27 mg/L) in 61% of patients. Using quantitative data, we found the best kappa index cut-off value for the prediction of MS to be 5.8. A kappa index ≥ 5.8 was present in 25% of OCB-negative MS (23/92) and in 98% of OCB-positive patients with MS. Using a qualitative approach and a kappa index cut-off of 5.9, based on literature data, we likewise found that 24% of OCB-negative patients with MS had a kappa index ≥ 5.9, compared with 5.4% of OCB-negative patients without MS (P < 0.001). No reliable data could be obtained for the lambda index; lambda FLCs were below the detection limit (0.68 mg/L) in 90% of CSF samples.

Conclusions

The kappa index could contribute to the identification of OCB-negative patients with a high probability of an MS diagnosis. Using more sensitive techniques might even improve the diagnostic performance of the kappa index and better define the role of the lambda index.

### Long-term follow-up of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^117AQW1p]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) occurs in approximately 3% of persons 50 years of age or older.

Methods

We studied 1384 patients who were residing in southeastern Minnesota and in whom MGUS was diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic in the period from 1960 through 1994; the median follow-up was 34.1 years (range, 0.0 to 43.6). The primary end point was progression to multiple myeloma or another plasma-cell or lymphoid disorder.

Results

During 14,130 person-years of follow-up, MGUS progressed in 147 patients (11%), a rate that was 6.5 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.5 to 7.7) as high as the rate in the control population. The risk of progression without accounting for death due to competing causes was 10% at 10 years, 18% at 20 years, 28% at 30 years, 36% at 35 years, and 36% at 40 years. Among patients with IgM MGUS, the presence of two adverse risk factors - namely, an abnormal serum free light-chain ratio (ratio of kappa to lambda free light chains) and a high serum monoclonal protein (M protein) level (≥ 1.5 g per deciliter) - was associated with a risk of progression at 20 years of 55%, as compared with 41% among patients who had one adverse risk factor and 19% among patients who had neither risk factor. Among patients with non-IgM MGUS, the risk of progression at 20 years was 30% among those who had the two risk factors, 20% among those who had one risk factor, and 7% among those who had neither risk factor. Patients with MGUS had shorter survival than was expected in the control population of Minnesota residents of matched age and sex (median, 8.1 vs. 12.4 years; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Significant differences were noted in the risk of progression between patients with IgM MGUS and those with non-IgM MGUS. Overall survival was shorter among patients with MGUS than was expected in a matched control population. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute.).

### Abnormal serum free light chain ratios are associated with poor survival and may reflect biological subgroups in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^116xyb8W]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The measurement of immunoglobulin serum free light chains (sFLC) has prognostic significance in plasma cell dyscrasias but its role in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is unknown. This retrospective study from three UK hospitals analysed sFLC in 181 untreated/pre-treatment CLL patients and 78 treated CLL patients, with samples taken later in their disease. An abnormal sFLC ratio was significantly associated with poor overall survival for the 181 untreated/pre-treatment patients (P = 0.0001) and for all patients (P = 0.002), irrespective of cause of death. Using multivariate analysis (n = 194), four independent prognostic variables for overall survival were identified namely Zap-70 (P = 0.0001), beta2M (P = 0.01), IGHV mutation status (P = 0.017) and an abnormal sFLC ratio (P = 0.024). For CLL patients with unmutated IGHV genes, elevated kappa/lambda ratios were adversely prognostic. For patients with mutated IGHV genes, reduced kappa/lambda ratios were adversely prognostic and associated with the poor prognostic IGHV3–21, IGHV3–48 and IGHV3–53 subgroups, suggesting an abnormal sFLC ratio may reflect biological subgroups within CLL. Abnormal sFLC ratios need to be studied prospectively in CLL patients and the biological rationale for their abnormality investigated.

### Serum free light chains in patients with HIV infection: their association with markers of disease severity and antiretroviral use [^112asyj8]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

Serum free light chain measurements are used to follow-up and manage patients with monoclonal gammopathies, and abnormal ratios are associated with risk of progression in certain diseases. B cell dysfunction is well described in HIV and patients are at risk of developing B cell lymphomas. This study investigated whether HIV is associated with abnormal free light chain levels and the impact of antiretroviral treatment (ART) on these.

Methods

κ And λ free light chain concentrations and ratios, serum albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were measured in 366 HIV positive subjects and correlated with CD4+ counts, viral loads, IgG, albumin and ART use.

Results

66% were women and most were black Africans (66%), 26% were of mixed ethnicity and 8% were Caucasian or of unknown or other race. 89% were on ART. κ Free light chain values ranged from 5.59 to 357.0 mg/L (median 19.6 mg/L) and λ free light chain values ranged from 9.28 to 286 mg/L (median 22.3 mg/L). Both correlated positively with viral load and IgG and negatively with CD4+ counts and albumin concentrations. The ratio only correlated with IgG concentrations. Patients on ART had significantly lower free light chain concentrations, but the ratio was not significantly affected.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that free light chain concentrations were significantly correlated with markers of HIV disease severity, suggesting ongoing B cell dysfunction despite ART use. Free light chain ratio was not significantly affected.

### Polyclonal serum free light chain elevation is associated with increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies [^112L9erX]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Plasma cells, normal as well as clonal, secrete small amounts of kappa or lambda free light chains and these are quickly eliminated by the kidneys resulting in relatively low levels of circulating serum free light chains. However, in the presence of clonal plasma cells as with MGUS or MM, there is excess production of one or other light chain leading to a skewed ratio between the two light chains, as well as overall increased levels. An abnormal serum free light ratio becomes more common along the spectrum of disease progression from MGUS to SMM and finally to active MM. A polyclonal elevation of both kappa and lambda serum free light chain can be observed in many individuals, not resulting in an abnormal FLC ratio, the etiology of which is not clear. It has been observed in the context of immune activation as it can occur with chronic infections and inflammatory states.

We hypothesized that a polyclonal increase in serum free light chain may help to identify individuals at higher risk of developing a monoclonal gammopathy. We undertook this study in a population-based cohort who have been previously examined for the prevalence of MGUS to ascertain if increased polyclonal FLC levels were associated with an increase in the risk of MGUS and related disorders including smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), multiple myeloma (MM), or light chain amyloidosis.

### Immunodiagnostic capabilities of anti-free immunoglobulin light chain monoclonal antibodies [^114kuVe1]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Overproduction of plasma cell-derived monoclonal free kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chains (FLCs) is a hallmark of multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, and light chain deposition disease. Because these components serve as unique cellular and serologic biomarkers, their detection and quantitation has diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic import. In this regard, we have developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically recognize the kappa or lambda FLC products of all known human variable and constant region light chain genes. We now report the results of our studies that have demonstrated the capability of these reagents to measure, in a modified fluid-phase capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), serum kappa and lambda FLCs at concentrations as low as 5 and 15 ng/mL, respectively. The mAb-based ELISA has greater sensitivity and reproducibility than does the commercially available immunoturbidimetric assay that uses polyclonal anti-FLC antibodies. In addition, the mAbs can immunostain monoclonal FLC-producing plasma cells and pathologic light chain-related amyloid and nonfibrillar tissue deposits. Our anti-FLC mAbs, with their high degree of reactivity and versatility, may provide an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of light chain-associated disease.

### Prognostic utility of intact immunoglobulin Ig' κ / Ig' λ ratios in multiple myeloma patients [^115WgjAP]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

International guidelines recommend serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chain (FLC) immunoassays with derived kappa/lambda (κ/λ) ratios to screening for monoclonal gammopathies. Compared with the absolute FLC concentration, the use of the κ/λ ratio is a more sensitive marker of monoclonal FLC production as it incorporates suppression of the non-tumor (uninvolved) FLC in its calculation. In addition, baseline FLC κ/λ ratios have been reported to be prognostic in multiple myeloma (MM), in contrast to densitometric measurements of intact immunoglobulin (Ig) M-spike. The added utility of FLC κ/λ ratios has prompted interest in the analysis of κ/λ ratios of intact Igs, now possible due to the availability of immunoassays for the intact Ig subsets; IgGκ, IgGλ, IgAκ and IgAλ (heavy chain/light chain (HLC) immunoassays). These molecules are then measured in pairs to produce ratios of tumor-produced (involved) Ig to polyclonal (uninvolved) Ig concentrations, for example, IgGκ/IgGλ. Preliminary evaluations suggest that HLC κ/λ ratios are diagnostically sensitive in MM and AL (amyloid light chain) amyloidosis, can be used to monitor both diseases, and in some instances may be the only useful marker of disease progression. One report also proposes HLC ratios may be prognostic in monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance. Of particular interest is the ability of the HLC assays to quantify suppression of the uninvolved, polyclonal Igs of the same isotype as the tumor. To date, this has not been possible, either by immunoassays or by electrophoretic methods.

The purpose of the current study was to determine whether HLC measurements, including Ig isotype-specific suppression, had prognostic significance in patients with intact Ig MM. The relationship between HLC measurements and other prognostic indicators such as M-spike, β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 -M), albumin, FLCs and cytogenetic abnormalities was also examined.

### Revised free light chain reference intervals enhance risk stratification in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and reduce overdiagnosis [^111uet99]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The free light chain (FLC) ratio is a critical part of risk stratification for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Recently, revised FLC reference intervals developed using the iStopMM cohort, accounting for age and renal function, have reduced the rate of abnormal findings. Here, we examine the implications of the revision in an independent Danish MGUS cohort. Of 6993 MGUS individuals, 2641 had an abnormal FLC ratio by the original intervals, of whom 844 (32%) were reclassified as normal using the revised intervals. Reclassified individuals had no significantly increased risk of progression compared to those with a normal FLC ratio (hazard ratio (HR): 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74–1.57). Those with an abnormal FLC ratio by the revised reference intervals had an increased risk of progression (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.79–2.78). Using the revised reference intervals, 490 individuals (16%) were reclassified to low-risk from a higher risk group. These individuals had a similar progression risk compared to others in the low-risk group. The findings validate the revised FLC reference intervals, enhancing prognostic accuracy and improving risk stratification to accurately identify MGUS individuals at risk of progression while reducing unnecessary classifications as high-risk.

### Polyclonal immunoglobulin free light chain levels predict survival in myeloid neoplasms [^115BuMbJ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

We hypothesized that surrogate markers of host immune response may predict survival in myeloid malignancies. Because of immediate practical applicability, we chose plasma immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) concentration as the biomarker of interest.

Patients and Methods

Two independent cohorts of patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were studied. Kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) FLCs were measured by a quantitative nephelometric assay. Patients with monoclonal FLC were excluded.

Results

Values that were above the upper limit of normal for κ or λ FLC were documented in 33% of 240 patients with PMF and 46% of 74 patients with MDS. Increased FLC was significantly associated with increased creatinine, and advanced age in PMF (P < .001) and hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL in MDS (P = .005). In multivariable analysis, increased FLC predicted shortened survival in both PMF and MDS, independent of age, creatinine, and other conventional risk factors. Cutoff levels based on receiver operating characteristic analysis for κ plus λ total FLCs delineated risk groups with highly significant differences in overall survival; International Prognostic Scoring System-adjusted hazard ratio in PMF was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), and was 6.3 (95% CI, 2.7 to 16.6) in MDS. No correlations were seen with leukemia-free survival, karyotype, or JAK2, MPL, or IDH mutations. In patients with PMF who were studied by cytokine profiling, the prognostic value of an increased FLC level was independent of that from circulating interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) or IL-8 levels.

Conclusion

Increased plasma FLC concentration predicts inferior survival in both PMF and MDS. Its lack of correlation with leukemia-free survival and tumor-specific genetic markers suggests a primarily host-driven biologic phenomenon that might be more broadly applicable.

### Presence of monoclonal free light chains in the serum predicts risk of progression in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^113uFJCP]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the presence of monoclonal free light chains (FLC) in the serum of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a marker of clonal evolution and a risk factor for progression. Forty-seven patients with MGUS and documented progression to myeloma or related malignancy were compared with 50 age- and gender-matched patients with MGUS and no evidence of progression after 5 or more years of follow-up. The presence of an abnormal kappa/lambda FLC ratio in the serum was associated with a higher risk of MGUS progression (relative risk 2.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.6–4.0; P < 0.001).

The association between free light-chain ratio and presence of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow of individuals with light-chain monoclonal gammopathy

For the 61 individuals with positive screening for LC-MG evaluated for clonal PC presence by flow cytometry, FLC levels were measured in paired serum samples. The median involved/uninvolved FLC ratio increased progressively with more advanced MG diagnosis at the time of flow cytometry from 3.46 (range: 1.29–41.5; n = 28) in LC-MGUS, to 24.6 (range: 2.87–70.8; n = 24) in LC-SMM, to 163 (range: 47.2–1278) in LC-MM (p < 0.001), and was 13.3 for the single SPM individual. Of the 28 individuals with LC-MGUS, 24 had kappa-involved FLC ratio which was observed to be significantly greater for those individuals with clonal PC detected in paired BM samples, with median FLC ratio of 4.52 (range: 2.78–41.5; n = 12), compared to the median FLC ratio of 2.13 (range: 1.49–4.96; n = 12) for those where clonal PC were not detected (p < 0.001). The single LC-MGUS case with lambda-involved FLC ratio where clonal PC were not detected had less skewed FLC ratio of 0.774, compared to a median FLC ratio of 0.21 (range: 0.04–0.24; n = 3) in those with detected clonal PC (Table 2). Across the total of paired serum and BM samples, a high degree of correlation was observed between the FLC ratio and the ratio of kappa to lambda PC (Pearson R = 0.95, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2).

### Polyclonal serum free light chain elevation is associated with increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies [^11224GQG]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathies (MG) constitute a spectrum of disorders starting from a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to active disease requiring therapy such as multiple myeloma. MG are characterized by proliferation of clonal plasma cells (PC) secreting a monoclonal protein either as intact immunoglobulin or free kappa or lambda free light chains (FLC). We hypothesized that a polyclonal elevation of serum FLC may indicate an inflammatory state that precedes development of MG. We studied 15,630 individuals from Olmsted county, who did not have MGUS based on baseline screening studies. At a median follow-up of 18.1 years, 264 patients had developed a clonal PC disorder; 252 with MGUS, 1 with SMM, 8 with MM, and 3 with amyloidosis, translating to an annual incidence of development of a MG of 0.1%. We examined the baseline polyclonal ΣFLC (kappa+lambda FLC) from the initial screening and grouped them into deciles. The highest decile group had a 2.6-fold (95% CI; 1.8, 3.7) increase in the risk of developing a MG, P < 0.001. We demonstrate for the first time, the increased risk of developing MG in patients with elevated serum FLC, suggesting that an underlying inflammatory state may play an etiologic role.

### Light chain predominant intact immunoglobulin monoclonal gammopathy disorders: shorter survival in light chain predominant multiple myelomas [^115jQ3Qg]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A proportion of intact immunoglobulin (Ig)-producing multiple myelomas (MMs) was observed to secrete much higher amounts of free light chains (LCs) than usual.

Objectives

To determine the change point between usual and LC-predominant intact Ig-secreting MMs and other monoclonal gammopathic manifestations and the biological significance of the observation.

Methods

We conducted retrospective examination of laboratory findings in 386 MM, 27 smoldering MM, and 179 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) cases that secreted intact Igs. We recorded the highest levels of involved serum free LC, highest ratio of involved to uninvolved LC, highest concentration of involved LC per g of monoclonal Ig, and highest value for ratio of involved to uninvolved LCs divided by the monoclonal Ig concentration. Each data set was sorted into kappa- and lambda LC-associated lesions. Length of time, in months, between diagnosis and last contact with the patients having myeloma was recorded.

Results

Change point analysis of data revealed a subgroup of cases with distinctly higher levels of free LCs. In myelomas, including plasma cell leukemias, 16.4% of myelomas with kappa LCs and 22.3% of myelomas with lambda LCs, the LC secretion was distinctly higher than in the remaining cases, by a combination of 4 parameters, listed herein. Corresponding figures for smoldering myeloma (SMM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) were 12.5, 27.3, 3.8, and 6.8, respectively. Ten of the 13 (77%) cases of plasma cell leukemia) and all cases of IgD myeloma (n = 4) showed excess secretion of serum free LCs. Among IgG and IgA myelomas, including plasma cell leukemias, the LC-predominant lesions had shorter survival, by an average of 22.5 months.

Conclusions

In total, 18.4% of MMs, including plasma cell leukemias, secrete distinctly higher amounts of serum free LCs than other intact Ig-secreting myelomas and confer significantly lower survival. Quantification of monoclonal serum free LCs may be useful in this subgroup in monitoring progress and potentially in ascertaining minimal residual disease. The findings also stress the need for separate criteria for kappa and lambda LC associated monoclonal gammopathic manifestations. The significantly shorter survival of patients with LC-predominant myelomas warrants consideration in prospective trials of treatments.

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^112xhN8p]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, this study leveraged flow cytometry analysis to assess the presence of clonal PC in BM from individuals with LC-MGUS, establishing a correlation with the FLC ratio. We found that LC-MGUS with FLC ratio in the range of > 1.65 to 3.15 was associated with an absence of clonal PC and non-progressive disease. These insights challenge the accuracy of the standard FLC ratio intervals, suggesting that they lead to overdiagnosis of kappa-involved LC-MGUS. Consequently, our findings advocate adopting the more stringent kappa-involved FLC ratio threshold of > 3.15 as an indication of underlying PC monoclonality, for more accurate identification of individuals at increased risk of developing symptomatic PCD.

### Elevated monoclonal and polyclonal serum immunoglobulin free light chain as prognostic factors in B-and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^117KaYbw]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

The serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) assay quantitates free kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) light chains. FLC elevations in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are associated with an inferior survival. These increases in FLC can be monoclonal (as in myeloma) or polyclonal. The goal was to estimate the frequency of these elevations within distinct types of B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and whether the FLC measurements are associated with event-free survival (EFS). We studied serum for FLC abnormalities using normal laboratory reference ranges to define an elevated κ or λ FLC. Elevations were further classified as polyclonal or monoclonal. Four hundred ninety-two patients were studied: 453 B-cell and 34 T-cell NHL patients. Twenty-nine % (142/453) of patients had an elevated FLC of which 10% were monoclonal elevations. Within B-cell NHL, FLC abnormalities were most common in lymphoplasmacytic (79%), mantle cell (68%), and lymphomas of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (31%); they were least common in follicular (15%). The hazard ratio (HR) for EFS in all patients was 1.41 (95% CI; 1.11–1.81); in all B-cell NHL the HR was 1.44 (95% CI 1.11–1.96); in all T-cell NHL the HR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.55–2.49). FLC abnormalities predicted an inferior OS (HR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.93–3.90, P < 0.0001). The serum FLC assay is useful for prognosis in both B-cell and T-cell types of NHL. In B-cell NHL further discrimination between a monoclonal and polyclonal elevation may be helpful and should be analyzed in prospective clinical trials.

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^115HYRGy]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Our analysis revealed that the FLC ratio is a robust indicator of clonal PC presence specifically for individuals with kappa-involvement. We identified that a FLC ratio threshold of 3.15 effectively distinguished clonal PC presence with high sensitivity and specificity. The ability of FLC ratio to reflect the PC compartment in BM is further indicated by the high correlation with the ratio of kappa to lambda PC across all evaluated samples. Applying the threshold to the total screened iStopMM cohort revealed that 92.0% of participants who met the standard criteria for kappa-involved LC-MGUS had an FLC ratio within the FLC ratio range of > 1.65 to 3.15, found to be associated with the absence of clonal PC. These observations are in line with growing evidence which challenges the accuracy of the standard FLC reference intervals for diagnosis of LC-MGUS, suggesting that they lead to overdiagnosis of LC-MGUS with kappa-involved FLC ratio. Our recently proposed revised FLC intervals, aimed to increase the diagnostic accuracy for LC-MGUS, was found to be in high concordance with clonal PC presence. Moreover, only a minimal fraction (7.4%) of those meeting the revised definition for kappa-involved LC-MGUS had FLC ratio ≤ 3.15, suggesting its relevance in distinguishing true underlying monoclonal PCD. These results suggest that clonal PC are absent in large proportion of kappa-involved LC-MGUS individuals when defined by FLC ratio > 1.65 and that diagnostic accuracy is improved by adaptation of the revised FLC reference intervals, which seem to isolate higher proportion of individuals with true underlying malignancy related to PC monoclonality.

### National health and nutrition examination survey… [^113LvAj3]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2004). Low credibility.

Conduct serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation analyses, and kappa and lambda free light chain assays in serum, to determine the age-adjusted prevalence and monoclonal protein size distribution of MGUS by ethnic/racial group. Using our results from applied serum analyses, in combination with available information from the NHANES surveys, we will be able to dissect etiologic mechanisms involved in MGUS development and transformation to full-blown multiple myeloma. FLC levels were determined in all positive study samples using the FLC assay performed on a Dade-Behring Nephelometer. It consists of two separate measurements, one to detect free-kappa and the other to detect free-lambda light chains. In addition to measuring the absolute levels of FLC, the test also allows the assessment of clonality based on the ratio of kappa-lambda light chain levels. Subjects with a kappa-lambda FLC ratio less than 0. 26 are typically defined as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios greater than
1. 65 are defined as having a monoclonal kappa FLC. If the FLC ratio is greater than 1. 65, kappa is considered to be the "involved" FLC and lambda the "uninvolved" FLC, and vice versa if the ratio is less than 0.
26. The normal reference range of 0. 26 to
1. 65 for the free-kappa-lambda ratio in the FLC assay reflects a higher serum level of free-lambda light chains than would be expected given the usual kappa-lambda ratio of two intact immuno¬globulins.

This occurs because the renal excretion of free kappa is much faster than free lambda. Free light chains Data was received after all the laboratory testing was complete. The data were not edited.

### Serum free light chain assay and κ / λ ratio performance in patients without monoclonal gammopathies: high false-positive rate [^112nU6XA]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Serum free light chain assay is a recommended screening test for monoclonal gammopathies. Anecdotal observations indicated a high rate of false-positive abnormal κ/λ ratios. This study was undertaken to ascertain the magnitude of the false-positive rate and factors contributing to the error rate.

Methods

Results of serum protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains, and related tests, usually done for investigation of suspected monoclonal gammopathy, were reviewed retrospectively for 270 patients and 297 observations.

Results

Using the conventional κ/λ ratio, 36.4% of the ratios were abnormal, in the absence of monoclonal gammopathy. When the renal κ/λ ratio was used, the rate of abnormal κ/λ ratios was 30.1%. In patients with a γ-globulin concentration of1.6g/dL or more, the usual κ/λ ratio was abnormal in 54.8% of the patients. Urine protein electrophoresis was used in 53 (19.6%) instances, whereas bone marrow examination was done in 65 (24.1%) cases.

Conclusions

Usual κ/λ ratio was abnormal in 36.4% of the observations in patients without evidence of monoclonal gammopathy, and an abnormal κ/λ ratio should not be used as the sole indicator for diagnosis of neoplastic proliferation of the lympho-plasmacytic system. Hypergammaglobulinemia is associated with a higher rate of false-positive abnormal κ/λ ratios. Examination of urine for monoclonal immunoglobulins may be underused, and recommendations by some to use serum free light chain assay in place of, rather than as an adjunct to, urine electrophoresis are not warranted.

### The evaluation of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance: a consensus report of the international kidney and monoclonal gammopathy research group [^115cW2DQ]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Another critical test is the serum free light-chain assay, which detects unbound free light chains. This assay measures κ and λ free light chains independently and can be used to determine the κ:λ free light-chain ratio. Clonality can be inferred from an abnormal κ:λ free light-chain ratio: a high ratio indicates a κ clone whereas a low ratio indicates a λ clone. Because free light chains are cleared by the kidney, impaired renal function alters the free light-chain concentration. The 'normal' free light-chain ratio, 0.26–1.65, can rise to 0.34–3.10 in patients with severe renal impairment (CKD stage 5 or greater), but small declines in renal function can also impair free light-chain clearance. Knowing which serum free light-chain assay is being used by the laboratory is extremely important, as at least two major assays are currently on the market. Not only are the results of these assays mathematically inconvertible, but the effects of renal impairment differ between these assays; the evidence suggests that the N Latex assay is less affected than the FreeLite assay by impaired renal function. Thus, the same assay must be used to monitor a particular patient throughout their treatment. Moreover, given that the two assays have different performance characteristics, free light-chain levels might need to be checked using the other assay if the first result is negative. In addition, serum immunofixation might be more helpful than serum free light-chain assays in diseases associated with an intact monoclonal immunoglobulin (such as PGNMID). Finally, although antibodies for use in urinary light-chain assays have been developed, these assays have not been validated and should not be used to quantify the amount of light chain (Bence Jones protein) in a 24 h urine specimen (which should instead be measured by urine protein electrophoresis, as previously stated).

Identification of the culprit monoclonal immunoglobulin has important diagnostic and prognostic consequences. The monoclonal immunoglobulin detected in serum and/or urine must match that found in immunoglobulin deposits in the kidney; if the immunoglobulin found in renal deposits differs from that found in the circulation, the monoclonality of the putative culprit immunoglobulin is called into question. Although the serum M-spike concentration and serum free light-chain assay results have both diagnostic and prognostic importance, the correlation between the results of these tests and the severity or type of kidney disease is less well established.

### Serum free light chain measurement aids the diagnosis of myeloma in patients with severe renal failure [^115fkbsg]. BMC Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Recently, immunoassays which measure the concentration of FLCs in serum have been incorporated into haematological screening algorithms for myeloma. These FLC assays are automated and allow same-day analysis and reporting of results. With these assays, the presence of monoclonal FLC production is indicated when the ratio of kappa (κ) to lambda (λ) serum FLCs is outside the reference range of 0.26–1.65. The presence of an abnormal FLC ratio, suggestive of monoclonal FLCs production can occur in the settings of both intact immunoglobulin multiple myeloma and light chain only multiple myeloma. The identification of monoclonal protein production is not proof of multiple myeloma, but indicates that further investigations are required (principally a bone marrow biopsy and skeletal survey).

For patients presenting with AKI, more rapid identification of multiple myeloma may lead to earlier interventions and improved patient outcome. However, there are no reported evaluations of the diagnostic utility of FLC assays in this setting. One complicating factor is that patients with renal impairment can have κ/λ FLC ratios slightly above the reference range with no other evidence of monoclonal proteins. This reflects a change in the dynamics of serum FLC clearance in renal failure. In normal subjects, the clearance of FLC from the serum is dominated by renal removal of FLCs which is preferential to the smaller, monomeric, κ molecules. This gives a shorter serum half-life for κ and a median κ/λ FLC ratio of approximately 0.6. As the kidneys fail, however, the non-preferential reticulo-endothial route forms an increasing proportion of the FLC clearance. This results in a more similar serum half-life for the two FLCs and the FLC ratio therefore becomes increasingly influenced by the underlying production rates, by the plasma cells. There are approximately twice as many κ producing cells as there are λ cells and this results in a ratio of total κ to total λ in the serum of approximately 1.8.

### Verification of serum reference intervals for free light chains in a local South African population [^115cUycE]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Monoclonal serum free light chain measurements are used to follow up and manage patients with monoclonal gammopathies, and abnormal serum free light chain ratios are associated with risk of progression in certain diseases. We aimed to validate the reference intervals in our population. Reference intervals for κ and λ free light chains were established on 120 healthy adults. Creatinine levels were measured to exclude renal dysfunction and serum protein electrophoresis was performed. All creatinine values were within normal limits. After exclusion of subjects with abnormal serum protein electrophoreses, 113 subjects were available for analysis. The 95% reference interval was 6.3–20.6 mg/L for κ free light chains, 8.7–25.9 mg/L for λ free light chains and 0.46–1.23 for free light chain ratio. Most of the values fell within the manufacturer's recommended limits and therefore could be used for our population.

### Revised free light chain reference intervals enhance risk stratification in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and reduce overdiagnosis [^1121d7VS]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Free light chains ratio and progression risk

The incidence rate of progression to MM/NHL/AL amyloidosis was 13.5 cases per 1000 person-years for MGUS individuals overall. The rate was similar for those with normal FLC ratio (9.5 cases per 1000 person-years) and for those who reclassified from abnormal to normal FLC ratio (10.2 cases per 1000 person-years). For the individuals with abnormal FLC ratio according to the revised reference interval, the incidence rate of progression was significantly higher (21.8 cases per 1000 person-years).

Similarly, cumulative incidence of progression was similar for individuals with normal FLC ratio compared to those with reclassified FLC ratio compared after 5 years (2.7% vs. 2.4%) and after 10-years (3.4% vs. 3.8%). For individuals with abnormal FLC ratio according to the revised reference intervals, the cumulative incidence was higher after 5 years (6.8, 95% CI 5.5–7.9) and 10 years (8.7%, 95% CI 7.5–10.0).

In the Cox regression model, we found no difference in progression risk between individuals with reclassified FLC ratio (from abnormal to normal) compared to those with normal FLC ratio in the unadjusted analysis (HR: 1.07, 95% CI 0.74–1.57) or adjusted for age, sex, isotype, and M protein concentration (HR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.71–1.51). For individuals with abnormal FLC according to the revised reference intervals, we found a significantly higher risk of progression compared to those with normal FLC ratio in the unadjusted analysis (HR: 2.23, 95% CI 1.79–2.78) and adjusted (HR: 1.85, 95% CI 1.47–2.33). The results are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 3.

INTRODUCTION

Monoclonal gammopathies comprise a spectrum of disorders that range from asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The more advanced of these conditions are typically characterized by overproduction of clonal immunoglobulins that may be identified as intact immunoglobulins (immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgA, IgM, IgD, or IgE linked to κ or λ light chains), or free κ or λ light chain molecules without accompanying heavy chains. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis (PE), immunofixation, and serum free light chain (SFLC) assays are used clinically to identify and quantify disease burden, and they provide critical information for patient screening, diagnosis, and treatment response assessment.

For many years following initial US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2001, the Freelite assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was the sole method for clinical measurement of SFLC. This quantitative assay employs polyclonal antisera to detect κ and λ light chain epitopes that are exposed when light chains are not bound to heavy chains. The manufacturer-recommended normal reference intervals used data from a study published in 2002 and included 100% of the FLC results from 282 healthy donors: 0.33 to 1.94 mg/dL for κ FLC (KFLC), 0.57 to 2.63 mg/dL for λ FLC (LFLC), and 0.26 to 1.65 for the κ/λ ratio (KLR). Inclusion of all values from this healthy cohort yielded "diagnostic ranges" that were wider than typical reference intervals, which typically include only the central 95% of values from a healthy population. As the manufacturer continues to promote these diagnostic ranges as the recommended normal reference interval, we refer to them in this report as "manufacturer-recommended reference intervals". It is standard practice for these intervals to be verified in individual clinical laboratories in accordance with College of American Pathology guidelines.

### Serum free light chain ratio is an independent risk factor for progression in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^111kTuJq]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the presence of monoclonal free kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chains in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), as detected by the serum free light chain (FLC) assay increases the risk of progression to malignancy. Of 1384 patients with MGUS from Southeastern Minnesota seen at the Mayo Clinic from 1960 to 1994, baseline serum samples obtained within 30 days of diagnosis were available in 1148. At a median follow-up of 15 years, malignant progression had occurred in 87 (7.6%) patients. An abnormal FLC ratio (kappa-lambda ratio < 0.26 or > 1.65) was detected in 379 (33%) patients. The risk of progression in patients with an abnormal FLC ratio was significantly higher compared with patients with a normal ratio (hazard ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–5.5; P < .001) and was independent of the size and type of the serum monoclonal (M) protein. Patients with an abnormal serum FLC ratio, non-immunoglobulin G (non-IgG) MGUS, and a high serum M protein level (≥ 15 g/L) had a risk of progression at 20 years of 58% (high-risk MGUS) versus 37% with any 2 of these risk factors (high-intermediate risk), 21% with one risk factor (low-intermediate risk), and 5% when none of the risk factors were present (low risk).

Introduction

A better understanding of the biology and clinical behavior of multiple myeloma (MM) has translated to improvement in treatment approaches and outcomes. The treatment landscape in newly diagnosed MM has undergone a remarkable evolution with the introduction of many immunotherapies, which has led to deeper responses and better survival outcomes. Integration of monoclonal antibodies as the backbone of anti-MM therapy, increasing utilization of bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) are transforming the treatment paradigm for MM. However, with enhanced treatment efficacy, we need more sensitive tools to detect low levels of circulating monoclonal proteins for accurate response assessment and early relapse detection. Monoclonal (M) protein can be detected in the serum and/or urine of patients with MM as either intact immunoglobulins (Ig) or free light chains (FLC). The serum immunoglobulin-free light chain (sFLC) assay measures the serum levels of free kappa and lambda light chains. In MM, the elevated levels of sFLC reflect the tumor burden and, due to their shorter half-life compared to immunoglobulins, allow for an earlier assessment of the response to therapy. Serum FLC measurement is part of the new diagnostic criteria for MM and serves as a marker to monitor changes in tumor burden over time. Over 90% of patients with Immunoglobulin-secretory MM (Ig-MM) and nearly all patients with light chain MM (LCMM) have detectable or measurable sFLC at diagnosis. Advances in techniques, such as high-resolution electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, continue to improve the sensitivity of monoclonal protein detection but are still not routinely accessible in daily clinical practice.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on comprehensive multidisciplinary care for the patient With cardiac amyloidosis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111GEFTK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Serum free light chain (sFLC) kappa/lambda ratio — diagnostic use and kidney function–specific reference ranges are as follows: The ratio of kappa and lambda free light chains, rather than absolute levels, should be used for diagnostic and disease-monitoring purposes; in chronic kidney disease higher K/L ratios are common and in such cases SIFE and UIFE are normal and AL amyloidosis is uncommon, whereas a low K/L ratio is never normal and should always prompt further investigation; consider that a normal K/L ratio is 0.26 to 1.65 with normal kidney function, and chronic kidney disease–adjusted ranges are GFR 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 with sFLC K/L ratio 0.46 to 2.62, GFR 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 with ratio 0.48 to 3.38, and GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 with ratio 0.54 to 3.30; when the monoclonal protein screen is abnormal or borderline abnormal, collaboration with a hematologist is warranted to exclude AL amyloidosis, and there is a rare entity of heavy-chain amyloidosis diagnosable by immunofluorescence staining of biopsy tissue with anti-heavy-chain antibodies.

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^1122PDyy]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

We assessed the clinical significance of FLC ratio 3.15 threshold among LC-MGUS actively monitored for progressive disease as part of the iStopMM randomized trial of follow-up strategies. Those with FLC ratio > 1.65 to 3.15 at screening maintained a stable FLC ratio over time, used as indicator of progressive disease, and none progressed to a more advanced PCD (including light-chain amyloidosis), during a follow-up period over 4 years. In contrast, individuals with > 3.15 demonstrated a significant increase in FLC ratio over time, together with a relatively high incidence of advanced PCD precursor diagnoses, including 4/71 (5.6%) individuals progressing to LC-MM during follow-up. Of note, individuals identified as intermediate-risk or high-risk SMM within the iStopMM study are offered MM treatment as part of an early intervention treatment trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03815279) which may limit the incidence of MM in this cohort. These findings imply that LC-MGUS diagnosed with an FLC ratio > 1.65 to 3.15, likely represents condition with minimal clinical significance, questioning the necessity of monitoring disease progression for this subgroup. However, longer follow-up is essential to determine long-term implications in relation to these findings.

4 Discussion

Here, we present real‐world data on the performance of κ ‐FLC index and OCB collected over a period of 1 year, along with three main study results: (i) The overall agreement of κ ‐FLC index and OCB is high. (ii) Some discordant findings between the κ ‐FLC index and OCB can be explained by isolated intrathecal IgA/IgM synthesis. (iii) The remaining discordant results of κ ‐FLC index and OCB are largely confined to a "gray zone" of κ ‐FLC index ranging from 3.5 to 20.

A hallmark of chronic inflammatory neurological disorders such as MS is the presence of an intrathecal Ig synthesis. To date, different methods are used to detect an intrathecal Ig synthesis. These include the quantitative measurement of IgA, IgM and IgG in CSF and serum, followed by the calculation of a percentage IF; the qualitative detection of CSF‐restricted IgG OCB; as well as the quantitative determination of κ ‐FLC in CSF and serum followed by the calculation of the κ ‐FLC index. Despite the established diagnostic and prognostic utility of the κ ‐FLC index, no standardized strategy has yet been established for its optimal integration into routine CSF diagnostic work‐up. Several conceptual frameworks have been proposed, ranging from testing both κ ‐FLC index as well as OCB, to using κ ‐FLC index as screening test and performing OCB only in selected cases.

The κ ‐FLC index has a similar diagnostic sensitivity and specificity compared to OCB as shown by a large meta‐analysis including more than 9000 patients. Despite this overall similar diagnostic accuracy, approximately 10%–15% of individual patients show discordant results, that is, are either κ ‐FLC index positive and OCB negative, or κ ‐FLC index negative and OCB positive.

In general, several reasons have to be considered for discrepancies which include the applied cut‐offs defining positive κ ‐FLC index (e.g. ≥ 6.1) and positive OCB (e.g. ≥ 3), as well as the methods used for κ ‐FLC determination (e.g. monoclonal versus polyclonal detection antibodies, turbidimetry versus nephelometry) and OCB detection (e.g. used gel, type of immunofixation).

International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria — stringent complete response (sCR) and complete response (CR) — define sCR as CR plus normal free light chain (FLC) ratio with absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence, and define CR as negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and < 5% plasma cells in bone marrow; in patients measured only by serum FLC levels, CR requires a normal FLC ratio of 0.26–1.65 in addition to CR criteria, and presence/absence of clonal cells is based on the kappa/lambda ratio with an abnormal clone indicated by kappa/lambda of > 4.1 or < 1.2.

### Kappa free light chain index in the real world-Do we miss clinically relevant information by skipping oligoclonal banding? [^114SVwYd]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the present study, the vast majority of discordant results had negative OCB and positive κ ‐FLC index results. The only discordant finding with positive OCB and negative κ ‐FLC had markedly elevated serum κ ‐FLC concentration. It is not clear whether highly elevated κ ‐FLC in serum, for example due to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or hematological malignancies, might indeed lead to false‐negative κ ‐FLC index, or whether this observation is just a coincidence.

Of patients with negative OCB but positive κ ‐FLC index, some exhibited an isolated intrathecal IgA or IgM synthesis. While CSF‐restricted IgG OCB reflects only an intrathecal IgG synthesis, the κ ‐FLC index can be elevated in case of an intrathecal IgG, but also in case of an IgA and/or IgM synthesis, that is, the κ ‐FLC index mirrors a broader intrathecal plasma cell activity. The remaining discordant OCB negative samples showed in the majority of cases only low κ ‐FLC index values. Beyond that, one might speculate on further biological factors that could impact results. Previous studies with consecutive LP reported newly emerging OCB positivity during follow‐up. This suggests that the OCB positivity rate might increase with disease duration, that is, with ongoing chronic intrathecal inflammatory activity. It is possible that a short disease duration before LP explains discordant κ ‐FLC and OCB findings, considering the hypothesis that κ ‐FLC raises earlier in neuroinflammatory diseases. However, this has to be proven by further research.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma, a malignant tumor of plasma cells (terminally differentiated B-lymphocytes), is the second-most common hematologic malignancy in adults and accounts for approximately 2% of cancer deaths. The cancer is treatable but not curable, although the introduction of newer drugs has prolonged survival, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy targeting B-cell maturation antigen shows further promise.

More than 99% of multiple myeloma cases produce detectable amounts of monoclonal immunoglobulins (Ig) in serum. Demonstrating monoclonality is an essential part of the diagnostic workup of the lesion. Usually, the monoclonal nature of the lesion is established by detecting restricted heterogeneity or mobility of immunoglobulins or light chain moieties in serum or urine. Increased numbers of plasma cells in bone marrow is a cardinal feature of the disorder, and demonstration of a clonal population of plasma cells in bone marrow is generally required for detection of minimal residual disease. Analysis of plasma cell immunoglobulin genomic architecture to demonstrate monoclonality is not a usual requirement for diagnosis of multiple myeloma. An abnormal level and an abnormal light chain ratio of serum free light chains (SFLCs) may suggest a monoclonal lesion but is not diagnostic of monoclonality. Similarly, a normal light chain ratio does not exclude monoclonality.

During follow-up, none of the 124 individuals with FLC ratio > 1.65 to 3.15 progressed to MM and none were diagnosed with a more advanced PCD than LC-MGUS. In contrast, 4/71 (5.6%) of individuals with FLC ratio > 3.15 progressed to MM at median of 33 months (range: 17–45 months) after screening. Additionally, 16/71 (22.5%) were diagnosed with a more advanced precursor (15 with LC-SMM and 1 with smoldering Waldenström macroglobulinemia) during follow-up. Overall, 4 individuals were diagnosed with lymphoproliferative disorders, two with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and single diagnoses of B cell and T cell lymphomas (Table 3).

### Monoclonal and polyclonal serum free light chains and clinical outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^116btGiE]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Free light chains (FLCs) are the most commonly detected paraproteins in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We examined the types of FLC abnormalities and prognostic utility of the FLC assay compared with standard prognostic biomarkers in a prospective cohort of 339 patients with newly diagnosed CLL. Three types of FLC abnormalities were identified: monoclonal elevated FLC (elevated κ and/or λ with abnormal FLC ratio), polyclonal elevated FLC (elevated κ and/or λ with normal FLC ratio), and ratio-only FLC abnormality (normal range κ and λ with abnormal FLC ratio). One hundred sixty-five patients (49%) had a FLC abnormality with approximately equal distribution among monoclonal elevation, polyclonal elevation, and ratio-only abnormality. All FLC abnormalities were associated with poor time to first treatment: monoclonal FLC (hazard ratio [HR], 4.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.94–8.48), polyclonal FLC (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.24–4.64), ratio-only FLC (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.40–4.69). Monoclonal FLC and polyclonal FLC were associated with poor overall survival compared with patients with normal FLC. Results remained significant after adjusting for Rai stage. The FLC assay is a simple, widely available clinical test with similar prognostic utility as routinely used prognostic biomarkers for CLL. Among persons with FLC abnormalities, the type of abnormality affects prognostic significance.
