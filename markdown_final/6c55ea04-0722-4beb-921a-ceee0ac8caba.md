## Question

does high rf lab test mean active RA?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a high rheumatoid factor (RF) lab test means the patient has active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "high RF" actually represents and how "active RA" is defined. Then, I should verify RF's role in the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification and whether a high titer alone indicates disease activity. Next, I will review evidence for and against correlations between RF titers and inflammatory activity. After that, I need to check confounders, including false positives and isotypes, and the relative value of anti-CCP. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical framework, directly answer the question, and outline practical implications for diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and treatment decisions.

> Let me first confirm the definitions. RF is an autoantibody family (IgM most common, with IgG and IgA variants) targeting the Fc portion of IgG; "high" generally means titers above laboratory cutoffs, often substantially elevated when > 100–200 IU/mL, though thresholds vary by assay and study. By contrast, "active RA" is a clinical state of ongoing synovial inflammation quantified by validated indices such as DAS28, CDAI, or SDAI, and remission is defined by 2022 ACR/EULAR criteria incorporating tender/swollen joints, acute phase reactants, and patient global assessment. I need to ensure I distinguish serologic status from clinically measured activity because they are not interchangeable constructs [^1171XpmJ] [^113WKMss] [^113CzZyN].

> Next, I should review RF's role in classification. The 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria weight serology (RF and ACPA) alongside joint counts, acute phase reactants, and symptom duration; they apply only when at least one joint has definite clinical synovitis not better explained by another disease. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance in primary care: RF shows about 58% sensitivity and 94% specificity with a positive likelihood ratio near 9.5, helpful for ruling in RA when pretest probability is reasonable. High RF alone does not diagnose RA — it must be interpreted with joint synovitis not better explained by another disease. Hold on, I should verify that last line: it must be interpreted with clinical evidence of synovitis and the broader criteria; RF is a classifier, not a standalone diagnostic or activity measure [^115Umhze] [^112KGzP3] [^112vfWzV].

> I will now examine whether RF levels track active inflammation. Let me consider supportive evidence first: quantitative RF correlates with acute phase reactants and composite activity, and higher RF associates with more radiographic progression over time; double-positive serology (RF and ACPA) aligns with higher disease activity and inflammatory cytokines, and in vitro RF can potentiate ACPA immune complex–driven macrophage activation. These data suggest that higher RF often coexists with more active disease at a group level, but I should confirm this does not make RF a real-time activity biomarker in individuals [^115WiieT] [^1171XpmJ] [^112BLNiA].

> But wait, what if RF fluctuations do not track outcomes? I need to check longitudinal data. In early inflammatory arthritis cohorts, RF and ACPA serostatus can convert in both directions over 1–2 years, and these fluctuations did not predict remission or erosions; RF can be present years before clinical IA and thus may reflect a constitutive autoimmune milieu rather than current inflammatory activity. This argues RF is not a sensitive, dynamic marker of day-to-day or visit-to-visit activity, unlike CRP or swollen joint counts that are integral to treat-to-target monitoring [^117KiFDU] [^1174eYAP] [^113WKMss].

> Next, I should review confounders and limitations. Hold on, I should verify false positives: smoking substantially increases RF positivity even in non-RA populations; infections and other autoimmune diseases can also raise RF, and assay cross-reactivity can cause unrelated false positives. Isotype matters too: IgA-RF tends to be more specific and confers worse prognosis than low-titer IgM-RF, while ACPA is generally more specific and predictive of erosive disease than RF, especially when tests are combined. These factors mean a high RF requires careful clinical context to avoid misinterpretation [^113kifac] [^1111u6v3] [^111XWZpr] [^114Lxp8X] [^1149aB72].

> I should confirm therapeutic interactions. Anti-TNF and other therapies can reduce RF titers in responders, but changes in RF do not consistently correlate with clinical outcomes; moreover, RF may bind Fc-containing biologics and, theoretically, influence biokinetics, whereas Fc-free agents like certolizumab are unaffected. This is mechanistically interesting but still not a reason to use RF as a response biomarker, reinforcing that composite activity indices and clinical assessments should guide treatment [^112kBAjj] [^114Mfw9f] [^113WKMss].

> Let me synthesize a clinical framework. High RF strengthens the probability of RA in the right clinical context and signals worse long-term structural outcomes and mortality risk, but it does not, by itself, define current disease activity. For activity monitoring and treat-to-target care, I need to use standardized measures incorporating swollen and tender joint counts, APRs, and patient global assessments, while interpreting scores carefully in the presence of comorbidities that can inflate metrics such as obesity or fibromyalgia. Imaging can help when the clinical picture is equivocal or to detect subclinical synovitis [^113WKMss] [^114q2h7i] [^114YYnys].

> Direct answer: No, a high RF lab test does not definitively mean active RA. Hold on, let me be precise: a high RF increases the likelihood of RA when combined with clinical synovitis and other criteria, and it is associated with more aggressive disease, but activity must be confirmed by clinical examination and validated indices, not by RF alone. RF can be elevated years before disease onset and can fluctuate independently of outcomes, so it should not be used to gauge real-time activity or to adjust therapy in isolation [^115Umhze] [^112KGzP3] [^117KiFDU].

> Clinical rule I should apply: treat-to-target using DAS28, CDAI, or SDAI with regular assessments of swollen/tender joint counts, CRP or ESR, and patient-reported global health, and confirm remission with the 2022 ACR/EULAR criteria where feasible. If the bedside exam is inconclusive, ultrasound or MRI for synovitis can refine decisions. I need to ensure ACPA status is considered alongside RF because ACPA confers higher specificity and prognostic value for erosive disease, particularly when both antibodies are positive [^113WKMss] [^113CzZyN] [^115GbdTR] [^114Lxp8X].

> Practical implications: For diagnosis, use high RF as supportive evidence only in the presence of clinical synovitis and exclude mimics; for prognosis, high-titer RF — especially IgA — is a red flag for erosive progression and may justify early, aggressive DMARDs; for monitoring, do not serially track RF to judge response — use composite indices and imaging when needed; for treatment selection, be aware of the evolving data on RF, Fc biology, and biologic choice, but base adjustments on clinical activity and targets rather than RF titers alone. I should double-check for smoking and other confounders when interpreting serologies to avoid false positives [^111XWZpr] [^114Tsi6m] [^114Mfw9f] [^113kifac].

> One last consideration: I need to remember that very high RF identifies individuals at increased long-term risk of developing RA, especially smokers and certain demographic groups, but this is a risk signal rather than a marker of current activity. Therefore, I should monitor at-risk patients appropriately and not overinterpret a single high RF in the absence of synovitis or elevated APRs, maintaining vigilance but avoiding unnecessary treatment escalation without corroborating evidence [^1174eYAP] [^111GHr19] [^112vfWzV].

No, a high rheumatoid factor (RF) test **does not mean active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**. RF is a nonspecific autoantibody that may be elevated in other autoimmune diseases and infections, as well as in healthy individuals — particularly older adults and smokers [^111XWZpr] [^113kifac]. RF is a **prognostic marker** for severe disease and joint damage, but it does not reliably track disease activity or treatment response [^117KiFDU] [^111XWZpr]. Active RA is defined by clinical assessment and composite scores (DAS28, CDAI, SDAI), **not by RF alone** [^113WKMss]. RF should be interpreted alongside clinical findings, anti-CCP, CRP/ESR, and imaging to guide diagnosis and management [^111XWZpr] [^112vfWzV].

---

## Clinical significance of rheumatoid factor

RF is an autoantibody against the Fc portion of IgG — typically IgM — and is **present in about 70–90% of RA patients** [^111XWZpr]. However, RF is **nonspecific** and can be elevated in:

- Other autoimmune diseases (e.g. Sjögren's, SLE, systemic sclerosis) [^111XWZpr]
- Chronic infections (e.g. hepatitis C, tuberculosis, endocarditis)
- Healthy individuals, especially older adults or smokers [^111XWZpr] [^113kifac]

Thus, RF positivity alone is **insufficient to diagnose RA** or indicate active disease.

---

## RF and RA disease activity

RF is associated with more severe disease, joint damage, and extra-articular manifestations; however, it is not a **reliable marker** of current activity [^111XWZpr]. RF levels can remain elevated despite clinical remission or effective therapy, and fluctuations **do not consistently reflect activity** or treatment response.

---

## Clinical assessment of RA activity

Active RA is defined by clinical evaluation and validated composite measures, **not by RF alone**. Key tools include:

- **DAS28**: Combines tender/swollen joint counts, ESR/CRP, and patient global assessment [^113WKMss].
- **CDAI/SDAI**: Include joint counts, patient and physician global assessments, and CRP (SDAI) [^113WKMss].
- **ACR/EULAR remission criteria**: Stringent definitions for remission and low disease activity [^111u2B9b].

These measures guide treatment decisions and monitoring, whereas RF is primarily a **prognostic marker**.

---

## RF in RA diagnosis and prognosis

RF is part of the 2010 ACR/EULAR **classification criteria**, contributing to the serology domain [^115Umhze]. However, diagnosis **requires integration of RF with clinical findings**, anti-CCP, acute-phase reactants, and symptom duration [^115Umhze]. RF positivity, especially at high titer, is associated with more severe disease, joint damage, and extra-articular manifestations, yet **does not indicate current activity** [^111XWZpr].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors can **confound RF interpretation**:

- **Age**: RF positivity increases with age, reducing specificity.
- **Smoking**: Strongly associated with RF positivity and higher titers [^113kifac].
- **Comorbidities**: Other autoimmune diseases and chronic infections can elevate RF [^111XWZpr].

These factors underscore the need to **interpret RF within the clinical context**.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize that RF **should not be used alone** to assess activity or guide therapy. Instead, management should be guided by **composite measures** (DAS28, CDAI, SDAI) and clinical judgment [^113WKMss]. RF is most useful for prognosis and risk stratification, not for monitoring activity.

## Summary of key points

| **Aspect** | **RF positivity** | **Active RA** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | Autoantibody against IgG Fc | Clinically active inflammation |
| Specificity | Low (elevated in other conditions) | High (clinical assessment) |
| Prognostic value | High (severe disease, joint damage) | High (current inflammation) |
| Diagnostic value | Moderate (part of criteria) | High (clinical assessment) |
| Monitoring utility | Limited (does not reflect activity) | High (guides therapy) |

A high RF test **does not mean active RA**; it is a **prognostic marker** associated with severe disease and does not reflect current activity. Active RA is defined by clinical assessment and composite scores; RF should be interpreted alongside clinical findings, anti-CCP, CRP/ESR, and imaging to guide diagnosis and management.

To provide updated American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity measurements, a working group conducted a systematic literature review beginning from the time of the prior ACR recommendations literature search. The objective was to facilitate a treat-to-target approach in routine clinical care.

Properties of disease activity measures were abstracted, and study quality was assessed using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments 4-point scoring method, allowing for an overall level of evidence assessment. Measures that fulfilled a minimum standard were identified, and through a modified Delphi process, preferred measures were selected for regular use in most clinic settings.

The search identified 5,199 articles, of which 110 were included in the review. This search identified 46 RA disease activity measures that contained patient, provider, laboratory, and/or imaging data. Descriptions of the measures, properties, study quality, level of evidence, and feasibility were abstracted and scored. Following a modified Delphi process, 11 measures fulfilled a minimum standard for regular use in most clinic settings, and 5 measures were recommended: the Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints with Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate or C-Reactive Protein Level, Clinical Disease Activity Index, Simplified Disease Activity Index, Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3, and Patient Activity Scale-II.

We have updated prior ACR recommendations for preferred RA disease activity measures.

### Smoking history and serum cotinine and thiocyanate concentrations as determinants of rheumatoid factor in non-rheumatoid subjects [^113kifac]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Smoking is associated with false-positive rheumatoid factor (RF). This study explored the dose-response relationship of this association using smoking history and serum cotinine and thiocyanate concentrations as measures of tobacco exposure.

A total of 6947 men and women aged 30 years or over and free of clinical arthritis were included in the Mini-Finland Health Survey carried out between 1978 and 1980. Detailed histories of smoking and RF (sensitized sheep cell agglutination test) were obtained during the basic examination. In 2000, serum cotinine and thiocyanate were determined from serum samples collected at baseline and stored at -20 degrees Celsius. A cut-off point of 100 micrograms per liter was used for serum cotinine and 10 micromoles per liter for thiocyanate to indicate active smoking.

There was a close association between smoking and strongly positive RF. After adjustment for age, sex, coffee consumption, and region, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals in brackets) for smokers and those who had quit smoking were 3.94 (2.04–7.61) and 2.71 (1.33–5.53), respectively, compared with those who had never smoked. Among smokers, the intensity, duration or tertiles of pack-years of smoking were not related to RF. No relationship between serum cotinine or thiocyanate and RF positivity was observed within the subgroups of smokers and those who had quit. Among those who reported that they had never smoked but who nevertheless had serum cotinine levels of at least 100 micrograms per liter, the adjusted odds ratio of strongly positive RF was 4.48 (1.48–13.50).

### Autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis - rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated protein antibodies and beyond [^111XWZpr]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are a family of autoantibodies that recognize diverse antigenic determinants on the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Unlike most other autoantibodies, the major RF species is the immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype, while IgG-RF and IgA-RF occur less frequently. Low-titer IgM-RF is not specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and can be found in several rheumatic and infectious diseases, as well as in up to 10% of healthy individuals. However, chronic persistence of IgM-RF at elevated titers, along with the presence of IgG and IgA subtypes, is a characteristic feature of RA. IgM-RF can be detected in 50–60% of RA patients at disease onset, usually co-occurring with anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and related antibodies to modified citrullinated vimentin (AMPAs). The co-occurrence of IgM-RF and ACPA is a characteristic serological feature of RA that is rarely observed in other rheumatic diseases.

- **Rheumatoid factors and IgA antibodies: Diagnostic and pathogenetic aspects**: RFs of all subtypes may be present already in the earliest stages of the disease and can precede the onset of RA by several years. Among RF subtypes, IgA-RF shows the highest specificity but is less sensitive than IgM-RF, whereas the diagnostic performance of IgG-RF is inferior to the other isotypes. However, the added diagnostic value of IgA-RF is limited because it occurs almost exclusively together with IgM-RF. Nevertheless, its determination might be helpful particularly in ACPA negative patients, as double positivity for IgM- and IgA-RF has a higher specificity than either isotype alone. Importantly, IgA-RF also has some prognostic value because, similar to high-titer IgM-RF, it is associated with disease progression.

### Anticitrullinated protein antibodies and rheumatoid factor fluctuate in early inflammatory arthritis and do not predict clinical outcomes [^117KiFDU]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). High credibility.

In inflammatory arthritis, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are believed to be associated with more severe clinical outcomes. Our objective was to determine whether ACPA and RF remain stable in early inflammatory arthritis and whether their trajectories over time or baseline levels predicted clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: The study population consisted of patients enrolled in the Canadian Early Arthritis Cohort Study with baseline and at least 12-month follow-up values of RF and ACPA. Primary outcomes were Disease Activity Score (DAS) remission and the presence of erosions at 12 and 24 months. Other objectives included swollen joint count, Health Assessment Questionnaire score, and DAS.

- **Results**: At baseline, 225 out of 342 (66%) patients were ACPA-positive and 334 out of 520 (64%) were RF-positive. At 24 months, 15 out of 181 (8%) ACPA-positive patients became negative. A larger number of patients changed from ACPA-negative to positive: 13 out of 123 (11%). For RF, fluctuations were more common: 67 out of 240 (28%) reverted from positive to negative, and 21 out of 136 (18%) converted from negative to positive. RF and ACPA fluctuations did not predict disease outcomes. Patients who remained ACPA-positive throughout follow-up were more likely to have erosive disease (OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.68, 8.92).

- **Conclusion**: RF and ACPA have the potential to revert and convert during the early course of the disease. Fluctuations in RF and ACPA were not associated with clinical outcomes.

This study evaluated four different rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria by testing three groups: 82 healthy control patients, 89 Plasmodium vivax-infected patients, and 92 rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive nonmalaria patients. The false-positive rate in RF-positive patients ranged from 2.2% to 13%. There is an association between high RF levels and false positivity in malaria RDTs.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^113HKLEp]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12.1 SE software. All tests were two-sided. We used log transformation of rheumatoid factor levels to calculate geometric means for each age group. Plasma levels of rheumatoid factor were illustrated using box plots with 1%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 99% on the log scale.

Receiver operator characteristic curves of plasma levels of rheumatoid factor at baseline and all future events of rheumatoid arthritis were used to determine an optimal threshold concentration of rheumatoid factor of 25 IU/mL; this level best separates individuals into those with and without future rheumatoid arthritis. From this threshold, we chose categories of rheumatoid factor with cut-off values being doublings starting from 25 IU/mL. For trend tests across these categories, we used the logarithm of individuals' rheumatoid factor values on a continuous scale.

### Second generation automated anti-CCP test better predicts the clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis [^1149aB72]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common systemic autoimmune diseases. The presence of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) is better at discriminating RA patients and is also associated with significantly more disease activity compared to serum rheumatoid factor. In this study, we assessed two new automated second-generation tests to detect the presence of anti-CCP antibodies in 226 serum samples submitted to the Clinical Immunology Laboratory for anti-CCP antibody testing. We compared CCP antibody results on these samples obtained using the ImmunoCAP 250 (Phadia) and the Architect i2000SR (Abbott Laboratories) instruments to our currently used CCP IgG third generation manual ELISA (Inova Diagnostics).

One hundred and fifty-four samples were negative while 52 were positive by all three tests. Eighteen samples were negative by the automated tests but weakly/moderately positive by manual ELISA, yielding an overall concordance of 79%. When we compared the discordant test results to patient diagnosis, we observed a better correlation with clinical RA diagnosis for the new automated tests compared to the manual ELISA. These two new anti-CCP antibody tests have the benefit of automation and may have better positive predictive value for the diagnosis of RA than our manual ELISA.

### Anti-type II collagen antibodies, anti-CCP, IgA RF and IgM RF are associated with joint damage, assessed eight years after onset of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) [^1168X5RG]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous condition with onset before the age of 16. The diversity in clinical manifestations differs from adult arthritis, although some similarities exist between children and adults. Reliable biomarkers for predicting outcomes and choosing treatments in JIA are scarce.

JIA is currently described by the International League of Associations for Rheumatism (ILAR) classification system as a disease comprising seven categories, based on clinical characteristics, heredity, and laboratory results. While IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) is a determinant of the polyarticular categories, the occurrence of IgA RF and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), for which the most common clinical test is anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), are not included in the ILAR classification.

In population-based studies on JIA, IgM RF occurs in 2–3% of cases and defines a subset of JIA resembling rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with polyarticular disease, older age at onset, and a higher risk of joint damage. IgA RF has been studied less extensively but is also discussed as a risk factor for joint space narrowing or joint erosions.

In RA, anti-CCP can be detected several years before disease onset, has high disease specificity, and is included in the 2010 classification criteria for RA. The prognostic role of anti-CCP in JIA resembles that of IgM RF. Anti-CCP has a low prevalence (2–15%) and is particularly present in the RF-positive, polyarticular JIA category.

### Rheumatoid factors revisited in the age of biologic therapy [^114Mfw9f]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

**Rheumatology key messages**: High-titer rheumatoid factor (RF) impacts Fc-containing TNF inhibitor biokinetics, highlighting its role beyond diagnosis and prognosis. As an Fc-free TNF inhibitor, certolizumab is unaffected by RF binding and has low anti-drug antibody (ADAb) formation. Non-TNF inhibitor biologics with Fc fragments are less impacted, likely due to B-cell modulation.

### Incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of acute exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112emJBE]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Although RA-ILD was often accompanied by high titers of RF and ACPA, no studies have shown that RF and ACPA are associated with AE-RA-ILD. In patients with RA-ILD treated with tocilizumab, poorly controlled disease activity was associated with AE. However, the results of two studies suggested no significant difference between AE and non-AE groups, either at the onset of AE, at the last follow-up, or in the AE-free period. In a recent study in which patients with RA-ILD were followed annually for three years, no correlation was observed between lung function trajectory and disease activity. Overall, the correlation between disease activity and AE-RA-ILD remains unclear.

Consistent with the result of a multivariate analysis, lower baseline FVC% indicated an increased risk of AE-RA-ILD in our meta-analysis. Lower FVC% was also a risk factor for AE in patients with IPF. Our pooled analysis suggested that DLCO% was not associated with AE-RA-ILD. However, we noticed that both studies included in the analysis suggested that lower DLCO% was a risk factor for AE-RA-ILD, and considerable heterogeneity was observed between the two studies. Lower DLCO% was associated with an increased risk of AE-RA-ILD in a multivariate analysis. Therefore, this result must be viewed with caution. More research on the relationship between lung function tests, especially DLCO%, and AE-RA-ILD is needed. By pooling eight studies, we observed that the UIP pattern on high-resolution computed tomography was not associated with AE-RA-ILD. Heterogeneity was observed across the studies. We noticed that

### Imaging in rheumatology: Reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^115GbdTR]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Disease activity and response to treatment are usually assessed by clinical criteria and blood tests. For straightforward cases of rheumatoid arthritis, the rheumatologist might therefore not need much or any imaging input. Imaging is, however, required for all cases that are not straightforward. Patients presenting with fairly non-specific aches, not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory disease, might be early presentations of these disorders, and imaging can help in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disorders. As early diagnosis results in far better long-term outcomes, a wait-and-see approach is no longer acceptable.

- **Questions for radiologists**: The questions asked of the radiologist in these cases are typically some or all of these: Is there inflammation? Which joint or organ is affected? What is the anatomical pattern of involvement?

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^1114KFnN]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease affecting 0.5–2% of the population. Although modern treatments for rheumatoid arthritis can induce remission in many patients, diagnosis in the early stages of the disease is crucial for preventing irreversible damage to the synovial lining and cartilage of diseased joints, as well as for preventing progression into later disease stages. At present, there is no good clinical indicator available for the long-term development of rheumatoid arthritis.

Rheumatoid factor is an autoantibody targeting the Fc region of IgG antibodies. Testing for rheumatoid factor is the most widely used blood test in the classification of rheumatoid arthritis. In the classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis, "definite rheumatoid arthritis" is based on the confirmed presence of synovitis in at least one joint, absence of an alternate diagnosis better explaining the synovitis, and achievement of a total score of ≥ 6 (of a possible 10) on a scoring system. The score is derived from four criteria: the number and site of affected joints (range 0–5), serological abnormality (elevated levels of rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibody; range 0–3), elevated acute phase response (range 0–1), and symptom duration (< 6 vs. ≥ 6 weeks; range 0–1). It is often stated that levels of rheumatoid factor increase with age, but convincing data for this statement is difficult to find. About 80% of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis will eventually be seropositive for rheumatoid factor, while only 40% are positive at the clinical onset.

### Rheumatoid factors revisited in the age of biologic therapy [^112Psyei]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

The discovery of the rheumatoid factor (RF) marked a significant breakthrough in the diagnostic landscape of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has remained a crucial component of classification criteria over time. It has been pivotal in distinguishing between seropositive and seronegative RA and in identifying the clinical and therapeutic response differences between these two forms of RA. Until the discovery of the role of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) in RA, the concept of seropositivity was primarily based on RF alone. Over time, the prognostic significance of RF, in addition to its diagnostic utility, has become evident, making it one of the determining factors in the treatment process. In daily rheumatology practice, an important question is which biologic therapy should be the first choice for patients who do not respond adequately to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatments. RF determination has begun to offer increasingly valuable insights in addressing this question.

RF antibodies target the fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG), leading to the formation of immune complexes that are pivotal in the pathogenesis of RA. Both IgM-RF and IgA-RF are important in the context of RA and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). IgG-RF is also relevant but difficult to detect due to its nature. Previous studies have demonstrated that IgA-RF is associated with a worse prognosis and greater resistance to treatment. RF displays diverse reactivities to multiple epitopes on the IgG-Fc region, and its binding patterns exhibit significant heterogeneity. A recent study has demonstrated that IgM-RFs from healthy donors target different epitopes compared.

### Rheumatoid factors revisited in the age of biologic therapy [^112kBAjj]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Data have emerged indicating that treatments with IFX, ETN, and ADL are associated with reductions in autoantibody and RF levels, which correlate with treatment response. In a study involving patients on IFX, ETN, and ADL, anti-TNF alpha drugs were shown to decrease IgM, IgG, and IgA-RF titres in association with clinical response. Interestingly, higher pre-treatment IgA-RF levels were linked to poorer clinical response to TNF alpha inhibitors in that study. However, there are also conflicting results in the literature regarding the association of pre-treatment and post-treatment RF levels with clinical response.

A study involving patients on the same drugs found that the presence of IgM-RF antibodies did not affect response to TNF alpha inhibitors. Another cohort study with long-standing RA patients treated with IFX showed greater reductions in IgM-RF titres compared with ACPA titres, though changes in neither IgM-RF nor ACPA titres correlated with 48-week treatment response. While reductions in both ACPA and IgM-RF were linked to clinical response, IgM-RF reduction was also associated with decreases in acute-phase reactants.

In a large cohort treated with ADL, IgM-RF levels decreased more significantly (31%) compared with ACPA levels (8%), with 17% of IgM-RF-positive patients seroconverting to negative, whereas ACPA-positive patients rarely seroconverted.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^111GHr19]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 4 illustrates the risk of rheumatoid arthritis as a function of rheumatoid factor level in 9,712 participants in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. This is analyzed by the length of follow-up (full 28 years or first 10 years) and the number of hospitalizations for rheumatoid arthritis. All hazard ratios were multivariable adjusted (see text for details).

In an effort to exclude patients misclassified with rheumatoid arthritis, we examined patients with at least two hospitalizations for rheumatoid arthritis at least six weeks apart. This approach reduced the number of patients, but it strengthened the association between elevated rheumatoid factor and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (see Figure 4, right-hand panels). These results were also not influenced by the competing risk of death (see supplementary Figure 5, right-hand panels). Sensitivity analyses restricted to participants with complete information on covariates at baseline also showed similar results (see supplementary Figure 6).

- **Absolute 10-year risk of rheumatoid arthritis**: The highest absolute 10-year risk of rheumatoid arthritis, 32%, was observed for 50- to 69-year-old women who smoked and had rheumatoid factor levels > 100 IU/mL (Figure 5, far right middle panel). This means that one out of three of such women will develop rheumatoid arthritis within 10 years from blood sampling. The lowest absolute 10-year risk of rheumatoid arthritis, 0.1%, was observed for men ≥ 70 years old with rheumatoid factor levels < 25 IU/mL, irrespective of smoking status (Figure 5, bottom panels far left and inner left).

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis [^1169NEXn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-Savoie (anti-Sa), a rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-specific autoantibody, is present in the sera of about 43% of RA patients but not in many other autoimmune diseases or in healthy individuals. Moreover, 27% of rheumatoid factor (RF) negative RA patients were also positive for anti-Sa. The overall specificity of anti-Sa is 92 to 98%, whereas the sensitivity is about 40%. The high specificity is coupled with substantial prognostic value, as anti-Sa positivity is associated with more active and destructive disease. Thus, anti-Sa might have important diagnostic and prognostic relevance in RA.

Anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) have recently emerged as highly sensitive and specific serological markers of RA, providing a superior alternative to the RF test in the laboratory diagnostics of RA. The association of RA with shared epitope positive HLA-DRB1 alleles is stronger in ACPA-positive than in ACPA-negative RA. ACPA production can precede the onset of RA symptoms by years, and ACPA-positive individuals with undifferentiated arthritis have a higher risk of developing RA. ACPAs have an important prognostic role, as they are associated with pronounced radiographic progression.

ACPAs belong to a heterogeneous family of autoantibodies, including, among others, anti-perinuclear factor (APF; targeting pro-filaggrin), anti-keratin antibodies (AKA; targeting filaggrin), and other citrullinated protein antibodies, such as citrullinated fibrinogen, histone, or myelin-basic protein. Anti-Sa antibodies are, in fact, antibodies against citrullinated vimentin and represent key autoantibodies of the ACPA family, where vimentin is secreted and citrullinated.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis [^116Q3BA4]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation and joint damage, with a heterogeneous course and different pathogenic mechanisms leading to common signs and symptoms. In routine clinical practice, an early diagnosis and recognition of inflammatory arthritis of short duration that develops into established RA in the future can be challenging. While a few patients with inflammatory arthritis may undergo spontaneous remission and some may have a mild disease course with slow progression, more patients experience moderate to high disease activity, and some develop aggressive joint damage and systemic complications. Therefore, more effective laboratory biomarkers and/or imaging assessments are needed for diagnosing early disease.

Although RA is a clinical diagnosis without a specific pathognomonic test defined so far, serological tests represent the most critical parameters for diagnosis and identifying at-risk patients. Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs), especially in high levels, are associated with aggressive disease and, together with acute phase reactants, were implemented in the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for RA. Fulfillment of these criteria thus persuades clinicians to initiate appropriate therapy early to avoid irreversible damage. Despite the high diagnostic value of ACPAs and rheumatoid factors (RFs), there is still a need for novel biomarkers to further improve diagnosis.

### Estimating the diagnostic accuracy of rheumatoid factor in UK primary care: A study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink [^112KGzP3]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of rheumatoid factor (RF) as a test for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in primary care and its impact on referral times, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink was utilized.

- **Methods**: We identified all patients with a first RF test recorded in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2008 and those diagnosed with RA within two years of testing. We calculated likelihood ratios (LRs), sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of RF for a diagnosis of RA. Time to hospital referral was compared in those testing positive and negative using Kaplan-Meier failure curves and log-rank tests.

- **Results**: Of 62,436 first RF tests, 4679 (7.5%) were positive. There were 1753 incident cases of RA, of which 57.8% were seropositive. The positive LR for RF was 9.5 (95% CI 9.0, 10.0) and the negative LR was 0.5 (95% CI 0.4, 0.5). Sensitivity and specificity were 57.8% (95% CI 55.4%, 60.1%) and 93.9% (95% CI 93.7%, 94.1%), and the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 21.4% (95% CI 20.3%, 22.6%) and 98.7% (95% CI 98.6%, 98.8%), respectively. Median time to first hospital contact after the first RF test in those with seropositive vs. seronegative results was 54 days (95% CI 49, 58) vs. 150 days (95% CI 147, 152).

- **Conclusion**: Only 2.8% of patients undergoing RF testing were diagnosed with RA, suggesting that RF is used to screen patients with musculoskeletal symptoms rather than those with more specific features of RA. A positive RF test may be helpful in diagnosing RA in primary care but performs poorly in excluding RA and may delay referral.

### Elevated levels of IgM and IgA antibodies to Proteus mirabilis and IgM antibodies to Escherichia coli are associated with early rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive rheumatoid arthritis [^1142UF84]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Antibodies to Proteus mirabilis were previously detected in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined the prevalence of antibodies to P. mirabilis and their associations with RA in early synovitis patients.

Two hundred and forty-six patients with inflammatory arthritis for less than one year were prospectively evaluated for one year. Of these patients, 30% had rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive RA, 16% RF-negative RA, 17% a spondyloarthropathy, and 37% undifferentiated arthritis. Serum antibodies to P. mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and other potentially arthritogenic organisms (Chlamydia, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and parvovirus B19) and antibodies specific for immunoglobulin (Ig) G damaged with advanced glycation end-products (anti-IgG-AGE) were measured.

IgM and IgA anti-Proteus antibodies were significantly higher in patients with RF-positive RA compared with all other patient groups (P < 0.0005 and P < 0.005). Anti-P. mirabilis IgG, and IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to other potentially arthritogenic pathogens did not differ in the patient groups. IgM antibodies to E. coli were elevated in RF-positive RA patients. Anti-P. mirabilis IgM and IgA results were not explained by false-positive reactions, because after absorption of RF, there was no decrease in antibodies to Proteus in 10 of 12 patients. Proteus and E. coli antibodies were highest in patients positive for both RF and anti-IgG-AGE antibodies (P < 0.001). Patients with erosions tended to have higher IgA anti-Proteus titres.

### American College of Rheumatology/EULAR remission criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: 2022 revision [^111u2B9b]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

Since their publication, arguments have been made claiming that remission definitions may, on the one hand, be too stringent, with the risk of overtreatment if used as treatment targets, or, on the other hand, too lenient, proposing the addition of imaging confirmation of remission. A particular matter of debate was the requirement of achieving a PtGA score of ≤ 1. The stringent threshold for the PtGA has been criticized because some patients do not achieve it despite the absence of tender and swollen joints and an elevated CRP level.

Moreover, the agreement between the Boolean and index definitions was only moderate, primarily due to the PtGA threshold. However, the PtGA is the core set measure most sensitive to change in RA trials, best differentiating between patients receiving active treatment and those receiving placebo, thus making PtGA an important measure of disease activity. Consequently, the PtGA was included in the ACR core set, composite activity scores, and remission definitions. However, PtGA may also be influenced by other factors related to RA. For example, patients with pain from irreversible joint damage may have elevations in PtGA even if their RA is in clinical remission.

To circumvent the strictness of the 1.0 rule for PtGA and to increase the agreement with SDAI-defined remission, a higher PtGA threshold has been proposed. Furthermore, since the index-based criteria can be used instead of Boolean criteria, both criteria should identify the same patients as having disease in remission. However, remission rates based on SDAI are higher than those using the Boolean criteria.

### Very recent onset rheumatoid arthritis: Clinical and serological patient characteristics associated with radiographic progression over the first years of disease [^113rMUXd]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Despite early recognition and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment, a sizable proportion of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients show radiological progression. This study was performed to determine the frequency of erosive arthritis and the pace of radiological progression in an inception cohort of patients with very early RA (≤ 3 months after onset of symptoms).

In order to determine possible prognostic factors for the development of erosive disease, we linked the clinical features of these patients to radiological progression in a regression model. About 55 patients with RA, with follow-up of at least 3 years, were analyzed. All had complete series of clinical, serological, and radiographic assessments. Radiographs were scored according to the Larsen method.

Erosive disease developed in 63.6% of the patients over 3 years, with the majority (74.3%) appearing already in the first year and 97.2% by the end of the second year. Among all variables available, rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) at first presentation were the most predictive for both the development of erosions and the degree of radiological progression. None of the clinical variables at the onset was useful to discriminate between erosive and non-erosive patients. In the final regression model, however, cumulative clinical activity substantially contributed to explaining radiological progression.

Despite early treatment, substantial damage occurred in some patients and was associated with the presence of strong 'constitutive' predisposing factors.

### The predictive value of rheumatoid factor isotypes, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies for mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^114iAdQg]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

To evaluate the significance of rheumatoid factor (RF) and its isotypes (IgA RF, IgG RF, and IgM RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in predicting mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a study was conducted.

The study population comprised 604 patients with RA participating in a cross-sectional study in 1987. The presence of RF (n = 604), RF isotypes (n = 206), anti-CCP (n = 184), and ANCA (n = 200) were determined in these patients from available baseline sera. Vital status was assessed in 1999, and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to compare mortality in RA patients with or without different antibodies.

Of the 604 patients with RA, 55% were positive for RF, 66% for anti-CCP, and 14.5% for perinuclear ANCA. Twelve patients (19%) with RF were anti-CCP-negative, and 34 (40%) without RF were anti-CCP-positive. Of the total 604 patients, 160 had died by 1999. Positive RF and high IgA and IgM RF levels predicted increased mortality, while positive anti-CCP or ANCA did not. However, high anti-CCP levels were related to an increased mortality risk.

In conclusion, patients with RA with positive RF, especially IgA and IgM isotypes, carry a risk of dying earlier than patients without these serological findings.

### Diagnostic and clinical value of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies compared with rheumatoid factor isotypes in rheumatoid arthritis [^114Lxp8X]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the additional diagnostic and clinical value of the second test generation of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (CCP2) compared with rheumatoid factor isotypes (IgG-RF, IgA-RF, IgM-RF) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods involved a prospective study of 715 patients: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 295), degenerative or other inflammatory joint disease (n = 163), connective tissue disease or vasculitis (n = 103), and healthy controls (n = 154). Sera from each subject were tested for CCP2 and RF isotypes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Agreement with clinical indices such as disease activity, joint destruction, disease duration, and other laboratory tests was assessed. Sensitivity and specificity of the tests were evaluated, taking the clinical diagnosis as the gold standard.

The results indicated that the highest sensitivity was found for IgM-RF (66.4%) and CCP (64.4%). Highest specificity was achieved by CCP (97.1%) and IgG-RF (91.0%). In rheumatoid patients with high disease activity or severe joint damage, CCP was more often present (81.4% and 83.6%) than all RF isotypes. Of special diagnostic value was the detection of positive CCP in 34.5% of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis when all measured RF isotypes (IgG-RF, IgA-RF, and IgM-RF) were negative.

In conclusion, as a screening method for rheumatoid arthritis, the IgM-RF and CCP assays are superior to other RF isotypes. Positivity in the highly specific CCP ELISA supports the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. CCP proved to be a powerful diagnostic tool, especially in ambiguous cases.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^1174eYAP]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

The risk of rheumatoid arthritis during the 28 years of follow-up increased by a factor of 3.3 (95% confidence interval 2.7% to 4.0%) for each doubling of the rheumatoid factor level (see Figure 2). Similar trends were observed for other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis. However, the number of events for individual diseases was insufficient to reach statistical significance. Interestingly, none of the participants developed polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Sensitivity analyses limited to participants with complete baseline covariate information showed consistent results.

- **Figure 2 - Risk of autoimmune rheumatic diseases**: This figure depicts the risk of autoimmune rheumatic diseases as a function of the doubling of rheumatoid factor level in 9,712 participants from the Copenhagen City Heart Study followed for up to 28 years. All hazard ratios were multivariable adjusted (see text for details).

### Imaging tests as predictors of progression to rheumatoid arthritis in clinically suspect arthralgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YYnys]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that can cause progressive joint damage and deformity. Management of RA aims to control inflammation and slow disease progression with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). However, delaying treatment may result in irreversible structural damage, leading to functional disability that affects overall productivity and quality of life. Early diagnosis facilitates the earlier initiation of treatment with DMARDs, thereby improving outcomes.

In the absence of a definitive diagnostic test, RA classification criteria are often used to assist in diagnosis. The focus is shifting towards identifying individuals at higher risk of RA, before evident clinical inflammatory arthritis (IA) develops. Inflammatory arthralgia has been identified as a phase preceding the development of IA and a sensitive predictor of RA. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has defined arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA, or clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA), based on criteria including inflammatory joint symptoms, for use in patients without apparent clinical arthritis. Approximately 20% of CSA cases will progress to RA.

Starting DMARDs at the CSA phase might improve outcomes compared to initiation at more advanced phases. However, DMARDs may pose side effects, require regular monitoring with blood tests, and incur high costs, highlighting the importance of predicting which patients are at higher risk of RA. Recent trials on interventions in the preclinical phases of RA, such as CSA, have considered subclinical inflammation. Both ultrasound and MRI can detect subclinical synovitis in people with RA.

### Clinical epidemiology: Diagnostic and prognostic tests [^111db2tJ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Recent studies of diagnostic and prognostic tests have predominantly focused on serological tests and new imaging techniques. Antifilaggrin antibodies have been identified as highly specific for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, there remains uncertainty regarding the sensitivity of this test, especially in early RA. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound are continually being investigated as methods to detect synovitis and erosions in RA. Several recent studies have confirmed the association between the human leukocyte antigen DRB1 shared epitope and worse radiographic outcomes in patients with RA.

Interlaboratory variation in detecting autoantibodies continues to be a concern, as does the overuse of tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: A prospective cohort study [^1142fGhL]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The objective was to test whether an elevated concentration of rheumatoid factor is associated with the long-term development of rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Design**: A prospective cohort study, the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Blood was drawn in 1981–83, and participants were followed until 10 August 2010.

- **Setting**: Copenhagen general population.

- **Participants**: A total of 9,712 white Danish individuals from the general population aged 20–100 years without rheumatoid arthritis at study entry were included.

- **Main outcome measures**: The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis was assessed according to baseline plasma IgM rheumatoid factor level categories of 25–50, 50.1–100, and > 100 IU/mL, compared with 100 IU/mL.

The conclusion suggests that individuals in…

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^111X9Zc7]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The principal findings in this study of 9,712 individuals without rheumatoid arthritis, recruited from the general population of Copenhagen, indicate that those with elevated levels of rheumatoid factor had up to a 26-fold higher long-term risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis and up to a 32% 10-year absolute risk of developing the condition. These findings are novel. Importantly, these data do not serve as evidence that rheumatoid factor plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.

### Predictive value of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide in patients with very early inflammatory arthritis [^115GdSP4]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

To study the prognostic value of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF), alone and in combination, in patients with very early synovitis, a cross-sectional study was performed in patients with established inflammatory and non-inflammatory disease to validate the assay in our unit and confirm previously reported sensitivities and specificities of anti-CCP antibodies. Subsequently, patients with synovitis of 3 months' duration were followed for 72 weeks, and the ability of anti-CCP antibodies and RF to predict the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and persistent inflammatory arthritis was assessed.

One hundred twenty-four patients were assessed in the initial cross-sectional study. Anti-CCP antibodies and RF were detected by ELISA in only 4% of patients with non-RA inflammatory disease and in no patient with non-inflammatory disease. Ninety-six patients with very early synovitis were assessed longitudinally. In these patients with early arthritis, the combination of anti-CCP antibodies and RF had a specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and negative predictive value (NPV) for a diagnosis of RA of 100%, 100%, 58%, and 88%, respectively. The specificity, PPV, sensitivity, and NPV of this antibody combination for the development of persistent disease fulfilling classification criteria for RA were 97%, 86%, 63%, and 91%, respectively.

In conclusion, in patients with synovitis of 3 months' duration, a combination of anti-CCP antibodies and RF has a high specificity and PPV for the development of RA.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: The continuum of disease and strategies for prediction, early intervention, and prevention [^116YANLt]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to include a pre-RA stage defined by familial or genetic risk factors, biomarker abnormalities (e.g. anticitrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA]), symptoms, and even abnormal imaging findings prior to the development of clinical RA with inflammatory arthritis apparent on physical examination. There are multiple completed or ongoing retrospective case-control, as well as prospective observational studies, to identify the key biologic drivers of the disease. Building on the predictive ability of combinations of biomarkers, symptoms, and imaging for future RA, there are multiple clinical trials completed, underway, or in development to identify approaches that may prevent, delay, or ameliorate future clinical RA in at-risk individuals.

Importantly, although an effective preventive intervention has not yet been identified, at-risk individuals are increasingly being identified in clinical care; this presents a challenge of how to manage these individuals in clinical practice. This review discusses the understanding of the biology and natural history of RA development, nomenclature, and models for the prediction of future RA, as well as evaluates ongoing clinical prevention trials. The overall goal is to provide insights into the challenges and opportunities in the field of RA prevention. Moreover, this review provides up-to-date options for the clinical management of individuals at risk for RA.

### Autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis - rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated protein antibodies and beyond [^114aYAgo]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: In the study of rheumatoid arthritis, the role of autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) is crucial. These antibodies serve as significant markers for diagnosis and prognosis.

- **The role of RF and ACPAs**: Rheumatoid factor, once considered a primary marker, has been complemented by the discovery of ACPAs. Studies reveal that ACPAs provide better specificity for rheumatoid arthritis, making them a valuable tool in clinical settings.

- **Beyond RF and ACPAs**: Research is ongoing to discover additional autoantibodies that may enhance diagnosis and provide new insights into disease mechanisms. Identifying novel antibodies could lead to better management strategies for patients.

The findings underscore the dynamic and evolving nature of diagnostics in rheumatoid arthritis, as researchers continue to explore the complex interactions of these antibodies in disease progression.

### In the era of nephelometry, latex agglutination is still good enough to detect rheumatoid factor [^115YYJGo]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

To compare quantitative nephelometry to the traditional semiquantitative latex agglutination (LAT) test for rheumatoid factor (RF), we evaluated 564 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 155 controls using both techniques. A cutoff value of 40 IU/ml was established for a positive RF result.

- **Methods**: Sensitivity of LAT and nephelometry was 85.5% and 88.3%, respectively. Both techniques had a similar specificity and a positive predictive value exceeding 95%. Agreement (kappa = 0.86) and correlation (0.87) between the two methods were significant.

In conclusion, in routine practice and particularly in developing countries such as India, LAT can still be the preferred method for RF determination.

### Rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, prediction, and prevention: An emerging paradigm shift [^112Tm7nz]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is currently diagnosed and treated when an individual presents with signs and symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (IA) and other features, such as autoantibodies or imaging findings, which provide sufficient confidence that the individual has RA-like IA, warranting therapeutic intervention. It is now understood that there is a stage of seropositive RA where circulating biomarkers and other factors (e.g. joint symptoms) can predict if and when an individual without IA may develop future clinically apparent IA and classifiable RA.

The discovery of this "pre-RA" stage of seropositive disease has led to several clinical trials aiming to identify ways to delay or prevent the onset of clinically apparent IA/RA. This review emphasizes several issues integral to understanding RA prevention, including:

- **Pathogenesis of pre-RA development**: Discussion on the development of pre-RA.
- **Prediction of future classifiable RA**: Examination of the likelihood and timing of RA development.
- **Clinical trials in RA prevention**: A review of both completed and ongoing clinical trials.

Additionally, this review explores the challenges and opportunities to usher a paradigm shift in RA management. In the near future, proactive risk assessment with a focus on RA prevention may evolve into a public health strategy, akin to how cardiovascular disease is managed today.

### The need to better classify and diagnose early and very early rheumatoid arthritis [^117CZXD8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and very early RA are major targets of research and clinical practice. Remission has become a realistic goal in the management of RA, particularly in early disease. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) RA classification criteria, the EULAR treatment recommendations for RA, and the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis focus on early disease and translate the knowledge related to early RA into classification and management. Nevertheless, there is a need for further improvement and progress. Results from six recent studies are summarized, evaluating the performance of the 2010 ACR/EULAR RA classification criteria. The data show a significant risk of misclassification, highlighting that overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis may become important issues if the criteria recommend synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

Some considerations are presented on how these problems and limitations could be overcome in clinical practice and future research. A consensus is needed to better define the early phase of RA and differentiate it from other early arthritis. The possible effect of misclassification on spontaneous and drug-induced remission of early and very early RA awaits further elucidation. Such research will eventually lead to more reliable diagnostic and classification criteria for new-onset RA.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis [^1123Ye3G]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory arthritis, predominantly affecting women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease. Diagnosis criteria include having at least one joint with definite swelling that is not explained by another disease. The likelihood of a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis increases with the number of small joints involved.

In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, or elevated C-reactive protein level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, suggests a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Initial laboratory evaluation should also include a complete blood count with differential and assessment of renal and hepatic function. Patients taking biologic agents should be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis.

Earlier diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic agents. Combinations of medications are often used to control the disease. Methotrexate is typically the first-line drug for rheumatoid arthritis. Biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, are generally considered second-line agents or can be added for dual therapy.

The goals of treatment include minimization of joint pain and swelling, prevention of radiographic damage and visible deformity, and continuation of work and personal activities. Joint replacement is indicated for patients with severe joint damage whose symptoms are poorly controlled by medical management.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: Common questions about diagnosis and management [^111Gso8L]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory arthritis, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 1% worldwide. Women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are most often affected. Rheumatoid arthritis should be considered if there is at least one joint with definite swelling that is not better explained by another disease. In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid factor and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, elevated C-reactive protein level, or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is consistent with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis may impact organs other than the joints, including lungs, skin, and eyes.

Rapid diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, which is associated with better outcomes. The goal of therapy is to initiate early medical treatment to achieve disease remission or the lowest disease activity possible. Methotrexate is typically the first-line agent for rheumatoid arthritis. Additional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or biologic agents should be added if disease activity persists. Comorbid conditions, including hepatitis B or C or tuberculosis infections, must be considered when choosing medical treatments. Although rheumatoid arthritis is often a chronic disease, some patients can taper and discontinue medications and remain in long-term remission.

### Association of seropositivity and mortality in rheumatoid arthritis and the impact of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: Results from a real-world study [^112fAVcZ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Low credibility.

The production of autoantibodies, particularly anti–citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) and rheumatoid factor (RF), is characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ACPA antibody titers, directed against posttranslationally modified citrullinated proteins and primarily of the immunoglobulin G isotype, are estimated to be present in 50–70% of patients with RA. Similarly, over 60% of patients with RA have detectable RF titers, primarily of the IgM isotype, which targets the Fc portion of IgG. Both autoantibodies can be present in the patient's serum in the absence of symptoms for up to 10 years before disease onset.

- **Significance & innovations**:
	- Seropositivity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been associated with increased overall mortality, and although cause‐specific mortality rates differ by autoantibodies, the association between antibody titers and mortality is not well established. In this retrospective study, elevated anti–citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) titers were independently associated with increased mortality among patients with established RA; importantly, the associations between ACPA/RF and mortality persisted in patients treated with conventional disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) but not with biologic DMARDs. These findings warrant further investigation, particularly to confirm whether biologic DMARDs may have an impact on mortality in seropositive patients with RA.

The presence of ACPA and/or RF is indicative of poor prognosis in RA, with ACPA being a stronger prognostic indicator for rapid progression.

### Easy and accurate diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis using anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 2 antibody, swollen joint count, and C-reactive protein/rheumatoid factor [^1146G4sm]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). High credibility.

To determine an easy-to-use diagnostic criterion for early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that may be useful for general physicians, researchers utilized the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody.

We prospectively studied 435 patients who first visited the hospital with arthritic symptoms within 24 months, including 264 visitors within 6 months. The diagnosis was made on their first visit by examination and laboratory tests, including anti-CCP antibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF), and C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as radiography.

The diagnostic specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of the anti-CCP2 assay were 94.9% and 87.8%, respectively. When combined with RF, the specificity and PPV were 96.9% and 90.9% for those who visited with morning stiffness, arthralgia, and/or joint swelling within 3 months of onset (n = 165). For patients who first visited later, but within 24 months from onset (n = 260), the diagnostic specificity and PPV were extremely high, at 98.7% and 95.5%, when the anti-CCP2 assay was co-evaluated with RF, CRP, and more than three swollen joints. Respective combinations of the anti-CCP2 assay plus either two of the three other measures were also highly specific.

In conclusion, a diagnostic criterion that includes the anti-CCP2 assay in combination with RF, CRP, and/or swollen joints is less sensitive but highly specific, accurately predicting the future development of RA among those with arthritic symptoms who consulted doctors within two years of onset. It should be highly useful for general physicians without needing special techniques or devices.

### Value of biomarkers in the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis [^112rMQnT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Recent diagnostic advances allow the identification of individuals in a pre-symptomatic stage of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), paving the way for preventive therapeutic interventions, which may potentially be curative. We review and discuss existing biomarkers predictive of the future onset of RA. A responsible use of biomarkers in clinical settings will require an integration of blood-based tests, imaging techniques, clinical history, environmental risk factors, and family history.

### Poor prognostic factors and unmet needs in rheumatoid arthritis [^114Tsi6m]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Prognostic factors in rheumatoid arthritis relate to several aspects, such as the prediction of joint damage and loss of function or the prediction of response to a particular therapy. For many decades, it has been well established that high disease activity, especially exemplified by swollen joint counts and acute phase reactants, is associated with the progression of joint damage. In addition, rheumatoid factor (RF) positive patients, but not patients with anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), are particularly prone to high disease activity and joint destruction.

Newer studies have looked at molecular markers, but they have either not shown better results than those seen with the long-established ones or have not been sufficiently validated. Most recent insights suggest that high C-reactive protein levels may predict a particularly good response to IL-6 blockade but not to other therapies, and that high RF levels may be associated with better responses to Fc-free monoclonal antibodies than molecules containing an Fc-region. It is hoped, however, that with newer techniques and better insight into RA pathogenesis, research may come up with even better molecular markers than currently available to predict responses to specific drugs in the not-too-distant future.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for rheumatoid arthritis, especially in managing difficult-to-treat cases, the EULAR 2022 guidelines recommend interpreting composite indices and clinical evaluations with caution in the presence of comorbidities. Conditions such as obesity and fibromyalgia may directly heighten inflammatory activity and/or overestimate disease activity.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: A prospective cohort study [^113SdbHQ]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to test whether an elevated concentration of rheumatoid factor is associated with the long-term development of rheumatoid arthritis.

The design was a prospective cohort study known as the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Blood samples were drawn from participants between 1981 and 1983, and they were followed until 10 August 2010.

The setting of the study was the general population of Copenhagen.

Participants included 9712 white Danish individuals from the general population, aged 20–100 years, who did not have rheumatoid arthritis at the study entry.

The main outcome measures involved categorizing rheumatoid arthritis according to baseline plasma IgM rheumatoid factor levels. These levels were divided into categories of 25–50 IU/mL, 50.1–100 IU/mL, and > 100 IU/mL, and were compared with a reference level of 100 IU/mL.

### Autoantibody profiling as early diagnostic and prognostic tool for rheumatoid arthritis [^1163tkxi]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Early treatment prevents the progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but diagnosis in early disease is impeded by the lack of appropriate diagnostic criteria. The objective of this study was to evaluate the value of rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies (anti-CCP), and anti-RA33 autoantibodies for the diagnosis of RA and the prediction of outcomes in patients with very early arthritis.

The methods involved a prospective follow-up inception cohort that included 200 patients with very early arthritis. RF levels ≥ 50 U/ml and anti-CCP showed similar sensitivity and high specificity for RA, but they overlapped considerably. Anti-RA33 was less specific and did not correlate with RF or anti-CCP. Among patients with RA, 72% showed at least one of these three autoantibodies, compared with 15% of non-RA patients. RF levels ≥ 50 U/ml and anti-CCP were predictors of erosive disease, whereas anti-RA33 was associated with mild disease.

The conclusion suggests that stepwise autoantibody testing in early inflammatory joint disease should start with RF, followed by anti-CCP (in patients with RF < 50 U/ml), and finally anti-RA33.

### What is rheumatoid factor? From screening to personalized management [^1171XpmJ]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

The measurement of rheumatoid factor (RF) is simple and easy to perform even in actual clinical practice. Serum RF positivity and RF concentration are used as predictors for joint and life prognoses to establish appropriate treatment strategies. The significance of serum RF in disease management has been recognized. Serum RF is detected approximately 10 years before the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and the presence of RF in combination with genetic and environmental factors is considered to contribute to the onset of RA.

Although the methods for measuring serum RF levels are assumed to be compatible, the definition of high RF levels varies slightly among different studies. Generally, 200 IU/ml or higher may be considered elevated. High serum RF levels are associated with high disease activity and progressive joint destruction, among other issues. The association between high serum RF levels and progression of joint destruction was investigated in the Active-Controlled Study of Patients Receiving IFX for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis of Early Onset (ASPIRE) trial. This trial comprised patients with early-stage RA who were resistant to methotrexate (MTX) and were treated with either placebo or infliximab (IFX). This association was also assessed in sub-analyses conducted in the Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Trial in RA with Concomitant Therapy (ATTRACT) trial. These trials revealed a clear association between high serum RF levels and progression of joint destruction, despite the low degree of progression observed not only during treatment with MTX but also with MTX and a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, such as IFX.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis [^116kKMAR]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The assessment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involves various laboratory biomarkers and imaging techniques. Biomarkers such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) are commonly used in the diagnostic process. Imaging methods, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provide detailed visualization of joint inflammation and damage, facilitating early diagnosis and intervention. Accurate identification of RA requires a combination of these diagnostic tools to improve patient outcomes.

### Do we need to lower the cut point of the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis [^116Y9EKp]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria to identify more patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among early inflammatory arthritis patients. We included early arthritis patients from the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort with at least one joint with clinical synovitis and symptoms for less than one year, with no other explanation for their symptoms. The demographic and clinical characteristics of each patient were recorded at baseline. Patients were classified as case or non-case at the one-year follow-up by the definition used in the development of the 2010 criteria (methotrexate (MTX) initiation). To assess the diagnostic performance of the 2010 criteria, the sensitivity and specificity at each cut point were determined.

We included 557 patients in our analysis. At the one-year follow-up, 253 patients (45%) were classified as case (MTX use). In the group of patients who scored 0–5 points (n = 328), 98 patients (30%) were classified as case (MTX use). The sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria using the cut point of 6 were 61% and 76%, respectively. With the cut point of 5, the sensitivity would increase to 76% and the specificity would decrease to 68%.

By lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria from 6 to 5 points, we were able to identify 15% more RA patients at the cost of 8% more false-positive patients.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis: A review [^115jkF8m]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) occurs in about 5 per 1000 people and can lead to severe joint damage and disability. Significant progress has been made over the past two decades regarding the understanding of disease pathophysiology, optimal outcome measures, and effective treatment strategies, including the recognition of the importance of diagnosing and treating RA early.

Early diagnosis and treatment of RA can avert or substantially slow the progression of joint damage in up to 90% of patients, thereby preventing irreversible disability. The development of novel instruments to measure disease activity and identify the presence or absence of remission has facilitated new treatment strategies to arrest RA before joints are damaged irreversibly. Outcomes have improved by recognizing the benefits of early diagnosis and early therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The treatment target is remission or a state of at least low disease activity, which should be attained within six months.

Methotrexate is first-line therapy and should be prescribed at an optimal dose of 25 mg weekly and in combination with glucocorticoids. Forty to fifty percent of patients reach remission or at least low disease activity with this regimen. If this treatment fails, the sequential application of targeted therapies, such as biologic agents (e.g. tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors) or Janus kinase inhibitors in combination with methotrexate, has allowed up to 75% of these patients to reach the treatment target over time.

### Rheumatoid factor measured by fluoroimmunoassay: A responsive measure of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity that is associated with joint damage [^115WiieT]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether rheumatoid factors (RFs), measured as continuous variables by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay, reflect disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to explore the association of RFs and other disease activity parameters with radiological joint damage, particularly in individual patients.

In the methods, active early RA was assessed by regularly measuring IgM and IgA RFs, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), tender joint score, and swollen joint score. Radiographs of hands and feet were evaluated using the Sharp score (van der Heijde modification) at the study's start and at 56 and 80 weeks. Associations between RFs and disease activity parameters were studied. Additionally, non-parametric tests and multiple regression analysis were used to analyze associations between radiographic damage and disease activity parameters, both at baseline and time-integrated. The relationship between time-integrated disease activity parameters and radiological damage in individual patients was also analyzed and visualized.

Results showed that 155 patients were included in the study. RF levels were strongly associated with the disease activity parameters, specially ESR and CRP, and with each other. All disease activity parameters, both at baseline and time-integrated, were associated with the progression of radiographic damage. Furthermore, in individual patients, a linear relationship between time-integrated disease activity parameters and progression of radiological damage was observed.

In conclusion, RFs measured as continuous variables can be considered as a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis.

### Is rheumatoid arthritis an autoimmune disease [^115aTEfC]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not a homogenous disease entity but a syndrome with different causes and abnormalities with shared clinical manifestations. One major subset is anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive RA, representing the larger fraction of RA patients, where autoantibodies and HLA class II association implicate an autoimmune condition. In the past few years, much attention has been given to the specificity of the ACPA response and the possibility of subdividing patients based on ACPA subgroups, whereas the effector functions of the autoantibodies and underlying lymphocytes have not.

- **Recent findings**: The review, based on HLA, will discuss the generation of the autoreactive citrulline-specific T-cell repertoire and highlight our understanding of T-cell specificities and the effector functions of both the T cells and ACPAs.

- **Summary**: Dividing RA into subsets has influenced clinical practice to a limited degree, such as indicating a better response to therapies modulating adaptive immunity, like rituximab, in the ACPA-positive disease subset. However, a more detailed understanding of the immune reactions underlying various subsets of RA may change our perspective on RA therapeutics and prevention, with the assumption that autoimmune variants of RA should be both curable and preventable.

### Autoantibodies to joint-related peptides as predictive markers in early rheumatoid arthritis [^115LinND]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

In this study, we demonstrate that a set of JointIDs can predict remission at 6 and 12 months with very high specificity in a subset of patients. The traditional RA autoantibodies — aCCP and RF — were unable to predict remission but proved superior in predicting joint damage. However, the inclusion of JointID166 increased the specificity for joint damage at the expense of sensitivity. Taken together, the presence (or absence) of JointIDs identified distinct patient subgroups with different prognostic outcomes, with implications for individual treatment strategies.

Although remission and low disease activity have become achievable goals due to improved therapies, only 30–40% of patients respond to the first given treatment, and biomarkers for treatment responses and prognosis at the individual level are lacking. At a group level, high disease activity and positive RF and/or aCCP are considered poor prognostic signs. In our study, RF and aCCP did not correlate with SJC or remission. Other potential biomarkers such as autoantibodies to other proteins, imaging, cytokines, chemokines, disease-associated genetic variants, and immunophenotyping were reviewed elsewhere.

Precision medicine, tailoring targeted therapies to the molecular or immunological characteristics of individual patients, has remained elusive in RA. An elegant example of precision medicine recently showed that patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 who produced elevated levels of IFN-γ could be treated with a JAK-STAT inhibitor with highly beneficial patient outcomes. In RA, we and others have yet to achieve such advances.

### 14. Immunologic rheumatic disorders [^115M5sQx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

We provide the basics for the clinician who might be called on to consider the diagnosis of diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in their practice. We will emphasize clinical recognition and first-line laboratory testing. Only characteristics of the classic rheumatic inflammatory diseases, including RA, SLE, Sjögren syndrome, scleroderma, and dermatomyositis/polymyositis, will be covered.

In the past decade, RA is the only disease for which treatment has substantially improved. The treatment of RA has been revolutionized by the use of methotrexate and, more recently, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. The goal of RA treatment today is to induce a complete remission as early as possible in the disease process, with the mantra being "elimination of synovitis equals elimination of joint destruction". The hope is that if the major mediators of Sjögren syndrome, SLE, or scleroderma can be identified and then blocked, as in the example of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in RA, more specific treatments will become available. Thus, RA has become an excellent model of this evolving paradigm. Through the identification of major mediators in its pathogenesis, novel and highly efficacious therapeutic agents have been developed.

### Multifaceted immune dysregulation characterizes individuals at-risk for rheumatoid arthritis [^117UcWHN]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Studies of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) reveal that markers of autoimmunity, including antibodies to citrullinated protein/peptide antigens (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF), among others, can be present in blood many years before the clinically-apparent onset of inflammatory arthritis (IA) and classified RA. The period of autoantibody elevations prior to the onset of IA is referred to as "pre-RA" and is reasonably viewed as a distinct stage in the progression toward clinically-apparent IA and classifiable RA. Notably, ACPA(+) individuals, especially those with higher titers of the common clinically used ACPA assay, 'anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP)', have a significantly elevated risk of developing future classified RA. Therefore, these individuals can be designated as being in an "At-Risk" state, defined as such for studies.

Importantly, the identification of a pre-RA period has underpinned the development and execution of several prevention trials in RA, testing the ability of various agents to prevent or delay the progression to IA and classified RA. Despite the increasing interest in disease prevention, major knowledge gaps remain regarding the causal pathways and pathogenic processes that promote the initial break in tolerance to citrullinated self-antigens in At-Risk populations. Some data suggest that epigenetic changes occur in these individuals, but it is not yet known whether unique peripheral blood cell sub-populations exhibit distinct epigenetic changes in disease-related pathways.

### What are the dominant cytokines in early rheumatoid arthritis [^115MyVfi]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The preponderance of ACPA and/or rheumatoid factor seropositive patients with rheumatoid arthritis among populations studied in most of the clinical trials alluded to here is notable. Where it is available, accumulating data identifies seronegative rheumatoid arthritis as subject to relatively unfavorable treatment responses, irrespective of the targeted cytokine. Perhaps this is unsurprising given the etiological distinction of this subgroup, but it highlights persistent unmet needs: not only in pathophysiological understanding, but also in our ability to map therapeutic response to measurable markers of the heterogeneous disease process at an individual patient level. Pretreatment levels of circulating cytokines themselves have so far proved to be of little value for this purpose, and the ability to measure their effects at a cellular level and/or within synovial tissue holds promise for stratified treatment approaches.

### Rheumatoid factor as a potentiator of anti-citrullinated protein antibody-mediated inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis [^112BLNiA]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The co-occurrence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positivity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is well described. However, the mechanisms underlying the potential interaction between these two distinct autoantibodies have not been well defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiologic and molecular interaction of ACPAs and RF and its association with both disease activity and measures of RA-associated inflammation.

In a cohort of 1,488 US veterans with RA, measures of disease activity and serum levels of cytokines and multiplex ACPAs were compared between the following groups of patients: double-negative (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide [anti-CCP]-/RF-), anti-CCP+/RF-, anti-CCP-/RF+, or double-positive (anti-CCP+/RF+). Additional studies were performed using an in vitro immune complex (IC) stimulation assay in which macrophages were incubated with ACPA ICs in the presence or absence of monoclonal IgM-RF, and tumor necrosis factor α production was measured as a readout of macrophage activation.

Compared with the double-negative subgroup (as well as each single-positive subgroup), the double-positive subgroup exhibited higher disease activity as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines (all P < 0.001). In vitro stimulation of macrophages by ACPA ICs increased cytokine production, and the addition of monoclonal IgM-RF significantly increased macrophage tumor necrosis factor α production (P = 0.003 versus ACPA ICs alone).

The combined presence of ACPAs and IgM-RF contributes to enhanced inflammatory responses in RA.

**Rheumatology key messages**: This is the largest systematic review on diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests in people with inflammatory joint pain or clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) for predicting rheumatoid arthritis. Imaging tests can identify subclinical inflammation in people with CSA.

### 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^115Umhze]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2010). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis" was developed jointly by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). This tool is intended to classify patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints.

The ACR/EULAR criteria are applied to patients who have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling) not better explained by another disease. The criteria are based on the weighted sum of four domains: joint involvement, serology (including rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody status), acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and duration of symptoms.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in its early stages, and to differentiate it from other forms of arthritis or joint diseases. It is not intended to be used as the sole criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis, but rather as a tool to support clinical judgment.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include patients with conditions that could better explain the synovitis, such as lupus or psoriatic arthritis. The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis assist in determining whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for the condition by evaluating four main areas: joint involvement and serology.
