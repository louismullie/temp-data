## Question

27 yr female: vaginitis rapid shows positive for Candida yeast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 27-year-old woman with a positive vaginitis rapid test for Candida, including how to interpret the test, confirm the diagnosis, classify disease, select therapy, and plan follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the rapid test actually detects and its limitations. Then, I should verify whether the patient is symptomatic and correlate with exam findings. Next, I will classify uncomplicated versus complicated VVC and consider host factors. After that, I will select evidence-based treatment options and address special scenarios like non-albicans species or pregnancy. Finally, I will outline follow-up, partner management, and when to escalate diagnostics or refer, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and high-quality evidence [^117YDxta] [^113t5FRM] [^1157kAV5].

> Let me first confirm what a "vaginitis rapid test positive for Candida yeast" means in practice; most rapid assays are NAAT-based panels that detect Candida species groups and sometimes C. glabrata specifically, but they do not speciate beyond that and may not quantify burden, so a positive result supports the presence of Candida but does not by itself prove symptomatic infection or the exact species, and I should be cautious not to over-interpret colonization as disease, especially since 10–20% of asymptomatic women harbor Candida and newer molecular panels show high agreement with culture while still requiring clinical correlation [^114cHkUc] [^11355bhn] [^117YDxta] [^113sdd9D].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context before treating; I need to check for classic symptoms such as vulvar pruritus, external dysuria, dyspareunia, and thick white discharge, and on exam look for vulvar erythema, edema, excoriations, fissures, and discharge, because diagnosis of VVC requires compatible signs and symptoms plus microbiologic confirmation, and a normal vaginal pH less than 4.5 supports Candida rather than BV or trichomoniasis, whereas a positive test in the absence of symptoms should not trigger therapy [^117YDxta] [^113sdd9D] [^113t5FRM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity; I should classify the infection as uncomplicated versus complicated based on frequency, severity, species, and host factors, because this drives therapy: uncomplicated VVC is sporadic, mild-to-moderate, likely C. albicans, and in immunocompetent hosts, whereas complicated VVC includes severe inflammation, recurrent disease (≥ 4 episodes/year), non-albicans species, or immunocompromised hosts such as poorly controlled diabetes or HIV, and this classification is the backbone of guideline-directed treatment intensity [^116q8d1D] [^112Qp4CV].

> I will now examine first-line treatment for uncomplicated VVC; both oral fluconazole 150 mg once and short-course topical azoles for 3–7 days are effective, with similar clinical cure rates, so the choice should incorporate patient preference, prior response, cost, and contraindications, and I should confirm there are no drug–drug interactions before selecting fluconazole, noting that oral therapy may improve mycological cure versus topical in some analyses while clinical cure is comparable [^1157kAV5] [^112TpFPW] [^116ghHAD].

> But wait, what if this is severe VVC; I should double-check for marked erythema, edema, excoriations, or fissuring, because severe disease warrants more aggressive therapy such as fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses or 7–14 days of a topical azole, as short-course regimens underperform in this phenotype and sequential dosing improves both clinical and mycologic outcomes [^116Uyo2q] [^1127hkNY].

> Let me consider non-albicans Candida, especially C. glabrata; I need to ensure that if symptoms persist or species is suspected, I obtain culture with speciation because C. glabrata lacks pseudohyphae and is often fluconazole-resistant, and in azole-refractory cases boric acid 600 mg intravaginally daily for 14 days is a recommended option with approximately 70% response, with alternatives including nystatin suppositories or flucytosine with or without amphotericin B cream, and I should counsel that non-albicans infections can be harder to eradicate and may require longer therapy or specialist input [^114PwZrL] [^114MYugG] [^1127hkNY].

> I should confirm pregnancy status before prescribing; if pregnant, I must avoid oral fluconazole due to associations with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies and instead use topical azoles for 7 days, with clotrimazole or miconazole regimens as acceptable choices, and I should arrange appropriate obstetric follow-up if treatment fails or symptoms recur [^116nhC9u] [^112xG5oK].

> Next, I should review host factors that modify management; in women with HIV, diabetes, or other immunocompromising conditions, treatment is the same as in immunocompetent patients for uncomplicated disease, but I should extend therapy to 7–14 days for complicated presentations and consider that colonization with non-albicans species is more common with advanced immunosuppression, while suppressive therapy is not routinely recommended unless recurrences are frequent or severe and, if used, should be reassessed as immune status improves on ART [^116nhC9u] [^113QfvGL] [^112KPaJG].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of diagnostics if symptoms persist or recur; microscopy with saline and KOH, vaginal pH, and whiff testing remain useful at the bedside, but if uncertainty persists or non-albicans is suspected, yeast culture with speciation is the reference standard and can guide therapy, and in resource-limited or high-volume settings, validated molecular panels can expedite diagnosis, though I must interpret results in clinical context to avoid overtreating colonization [^114jTkgo] [^1168cCT1] [^113sdd9D].

> I need to ensure appropriate follow-up; uncomplicated cases generally do not require routine revisit, but patients should return if symptoms persist beyond about a week or recur within 2 months, at which point I should re-examine, repeat testing, and consider culture with susceptibilities, and for recurrent VVC I should initiate induction therapy for 10–14 days followed by fluconazole 150 mg weekly for 6 months, counseling that suppression controls symptoms in over 90% during therapy but recurrence after stopping is common, prompting reassessment of modifiable risks and adherence [^112TpFPW] [^112Qp4CV] [^115u7sKA].

> Let me reconsider partner management; uncomplicated VVC is not considered sexually transmitted, so routine treatment of partners is not recommended, though symptomatic male partners with balanitis may benefit from topical antifungals for symptom relief, and I should emphasize this to avoid unnecessary partner therapy and misattribution of recurrence to reinfection [^115u7sKA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost suggested treating based solely on the rapid test without confirming symptoms; I should correct that and anchor on the principle that microbiologic positivity alone is insufficient and that treatment should follow confirmation of compatible symptoms and signs, with pH assessment and microscopy supporting the diagnosis and helping distinguish VVC from BV or trichomoniasis that require different therapies [^117YDxta] [^113t5FRM].

> Putting this together for a 27-year-old with a positive rapid Candida test, my plan is to confirm she has pruritus, discharge, and vulvar irritation, perform a focused exam for erythema/edema/excoriations, check pH expecting less than 4.5, and if uncomplicated, offer fluconazole 150 mg orally once or a 3–7 day topical azole per her preference and contraindications, advising that oil-based suppositories can weaken latex and that symptoms should improve within a few days; if severe, I will use fluconazole 150 mg on days 1 and 4 or 7–14 days of a topical azole; if non-albicans is suspected or symptoms persist, I will obtain culture with speciation and consider boric acid if azole-refractory; if pregnant, I will use topical azoles for 7 days and avoid oral fluconazole; and I will arrange follow-up if symptoms persist or recur to reassess diagnosis and consider suppressive strategies for recurrent disease [^112TpFPW] [^1168cCT1] [^114PwZrL] [^116nhC9u].

A 27-year-old woman with a positive vaginitis rapid test for Candida yeast most likely has **uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis** [^116q8d1D]. Confirm the diagnosis with **symptoms and signs** (itching, discharge, erythema) and a **normal vaginal pH (< 4.5)** [^1168cCT1] [^113t5FRM]. First-line treatment is a **single 150 mg oral fluconazole dose** [^1157kAV5] or a short-course topical azole (clotrimazole, miconazole, terconazole, or butoconazole) for 3–7 days [^112TpFPW]; both are effective, so choose based on patient preference and contraindications [^116ghHAD]. If symptoms are severe or recurrent, extend therapy to 7–14 days or use fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses [^1127hkNY]. Non-albicans Candida or treatment failure may require **boric acid suppositories** or **culture-guided therapy** [^114MYugG] [^114PwZrL]. No routine partner treatment is needed [^115u7sKA], and follow-up is only necessary if symptoms persist or recur [^112TpFPW].

---

## Clinical significance of Candida detection

Candida species are common **vaginal commensals**; about 20% of asymptomatic women are colonized, rising to 30–40% during pregnancy or with recent antibiotics [^1176CAmG] [^111LdzkX]. Detection alone is not sufficient for diagnosis — **symptoms and signs must be present** [^113a5e7j]. VVC is common in reproductive-age women, with **70–75% experiencing at least one episode** and 40–45% having two or more [^116q8d1D].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Typical symptoms include vulvar pruritus, vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and vulvar erythema, edema, excoriations, or fissures [^113sdd9D]. Diagnosis relies on correlating symptoms and signs with **microscopic evidence of yeast** (budding yeast, pseudohyphae, or hyphae) or a positive test, and a **normal vaginal pH (< 4.5)** supports VVC over BV or trichomoniasis [^1168cCT1] [^117YDxta].

---

## Classification of vulvovaginal candidiasis

VVC is classified as **uncomplicated or complicated** based on frequency, severity, species, and host factors [^116q8d1D] [^112Qp4CV]:

| **Uncomplicated vvc** | **Complicated vvc** |
|-|-|
| Sporadic or infrequent | Recurrent (≥ 4 episodes/year) |
| Mild-to-moderate symptoms | Severe symptoms |
| Likely C. albicans | Non-albicans species |
| Immunocompetent host | Immunocompromised host (HIV, diabetes, immunosuppressive therapy) |

---

## Recommended treatment regimens

### Uncomplicated VVC

- **First-line therapy**: Fluconazole 150 mg orally once [^1157kAV5] or topical azoles (clotrimazole, miconazole, terconazole, butoconazole) for 3–7 days [^112TpFPW].
- **Oral vs topical**: Oral and topical azoles have similar clinical cure rates; choose based on patient preference and contraindications [^116ghHAD].
- **Alternative**: Ibrexafungerp 300 mg orally twice in one day (FDA-approved) [^1158ZSUe].

---

### Complicated VVC

- **Severe disease**: Fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses or topical azoles for 7–14 days [^1127hkNY].
- **Non-albicans species**: Boric acid 600 mg intravaginally daily for 14 days [^114MYugG] or nystatin 100,000 units intravaginally daily for 14 days [^114PwZrL].
- **Recurrent VVC**: Induction with topical or oral fluconazole for 10–14 days, then fluconazole 150 mg weekly for 6 months [^112Qp4CV].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

- **Patient preference**: Oral vs topical; convenience and comfort [^116ghHAD].
- **Severity**: Severe disease may need longer or multidose therapy [^1127hkNY].
- **Species**: Non-albicans may require boric acid or nystatin [^114PwZrL].
- **Host factors**: Immunocompromise or diabetes may require extended therapy [^116nhC9u].

---

## Potential complications of untreated candidiasis

Untreated VVC can cause significant discomfort, dyspareunia, and sleep disturbance, and may lead to chronic vulvar dermatitis or secondary bacterial infection. In immunocompromised patients, it may progress to invasive candidiasis [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and recurrence prevention

Follow-up is not routinely required after treatment of uncomplicated VVC [^112TpFPW]; patients should return if symptoms persist or recur. Recurrent VVC warrants evaluation for underlying factors and consideration of suppressive therapy [^112Qp4CV].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patients should be counseled on the nature of **VVC**, treatment options, and adherence. Sexual partners do not require treatment unless **symptomatic** [^115u7sKA]. Hygiene measures such as avoiding irritants and tight clothing may help **prevent recurrence** [^notfound].

---

A 27-year-old woman with a positive rapid test for Candida most likely has **uncomplicated VVC**. Confirm with symptoms, signs, and a normal pH, then treat with fluconazole or a topical azole; tailor therapy to severity, species, and host factors, and arrange follow-up only if symptoms persist or recur.

Vaginal complaints are one of the most common reasons women seek the advice of a health care provider. Uncomplicated infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomoniasis are easy to diagnose and treat. However, about 8% of patients will have a more complicated course with failure to respond to treatment or rapid recurrence of symptoms. Understanding the need for a methodical, diagnostic approach to help these women with recurrent or refractory cases of vaginal symptoms will aid the clinician achieve successful patient outcomes.

Diagnostic Considerations

A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH (< 4.5). Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. The majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA cleared, and providers who use these tests should be familiar with the performance characteristics of the specific test used. Yeast culture, which can identify a broad group of pathogenic yeasts, remains the reference standard for diagnosis.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — treatment recommendations specify that for uncomplicated Candida vulvovaginitis, topical antifungal agents, with no one agent superior to another, are recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence), or alternatively a single 150-mg oral dose of fluconazole is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For severe acute Candida vulvovaginitis, fluconazole 150 mg, given every 72 hours for a total of 2 or 3 doses, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^116upMax]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The results of the present study suggest that the current approach to management of vaginal discharge provides suboptimal care. Significant time burdens placed on primary care providers and the time and effort necessary to perform inexpensive point-of-care tests are likely balanced against other competing priorities. Different models of care may be warranted for women having vaginal discharge syndromes. This requires a combination of sensitive and specific laboratory testing as well as careful patient evaluation and clinical acumen to accurately diagnose women presenting with symptoms of vaginitis. One approach could be to ask women who contact a clinician's office with vaginal symptoms to provide self-collected vaginal swab samples, which have been proven to be equivalent to clinician-collected samples, for testing. Prescriptions could be written to cover the specific pathogens identified and women having no infectious etiology identified could be counseled that no antifungal or antibiotic therapy is warranted. The excess healthcare costs associated with empiric treatment deserves further study.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis [^115PEgkq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) are frequently encountered in clinical practice. Recent advances have furthered understanding of pathophysiology. Proper diagnosis, based on appropriate office and, in complicated cases, laboratory tests is the key to rational selection of therapy. For women who have routine uncomplicated episodes of VVC or BV, a variety of effective treatment options exists. Recurrent disease remains a challenge for these conditions but can often be managed successfully.

DISCUSSION

In this study, MVP demonstrated a high PPA and NPA relative to the comparator methods, providing results for all 3 causes of vaginitis/vaginosis from a single swab specimen in both laboratory-based and POC settings. Both the patient self-collected and clinician-collected vaginal swabs performed similarly for all results of the test in the hands of trained and untrained users alike.

Diagnosis of vaginitis/vaginosis is most commonly based on Amsel criteria, and less often on Nugent score and/or yeast culture. Unfortunately, these methods are highly dependent on the user performing the assessment and have low accuracy. NAATs for BV and TV diagnosis in symptomatic women are recommended for their diagnostic accuracy and ease of use. Since these tests have not previously been available in the POC setting clinicians have relied on older, less reliable, methods of diagnosis. Hillier et al. in a recent study investigating the diagnostic algorithms used by clinicians for women with vaginitis, found that CDC-recommended POC testing was infrequently performed. Microscopic examination of vaginal fluid was performed in 17% of patients, assessment of vaginal pH in 15%, and whiff test in 21%. In the real-world setting, clinicians are moving away from microscopy, and alternative diagnostic methods are needed. Forty percent of the women in that study were prescribed inappropriate treatments for their symptoms of vaginitis. Interestingly, the women who were treated empirically for vaginitis were significantly more likely to return in the next 3 months than women who were not treated, suggesting that empirical treatment in women with no infectious cause identified may result in more symptom-triggered visits. This highlights the importance of considering multiple etiologies of the disease in patients, as well as the need for precise diagnosis of all infectious vaginitis/vaginosis, to ensure appropriate diagnosis and timely treatment both for the health of the patient and antimicrobial stewardship. MVP is able to differentiate the azole-resistantandfrom each other more easily than treated Candida species. MVP also detected co-infections in 17.0% and 17.9% of CVS and SVS specimens, respectively, which is similar to rates found in other studies. Most notably, MVP performed similarly in a laboratory-based setting by trained operators and in the POC setting by untrained operators, and, consequently, has the potential to be a valuable tool in a clinic setting for providing prompt and accurate results.

### Management of persistent vaginitis [^116nKm9g]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

With vaginitis remaining a common condition that leads women to seek care, it is not surprising that some women develop chronic vulvovaginal problems that are difficult to diagnose and treat. With a differential diagnosis that encompasses vulvar disorders and infectious and noninfectious causes of vaginitis, accurate diagnosis is the cornerstone of choosing effective therapy. Evaluation should include a symptom-specific history, careful vulvar and vaginal examination, and office-based tests (vaginal pH, amine test, saline and 10% potassium hydroxide microscopy). Ancillary tests, especially yeast culture with speciation, are frequently crucial to obtaining a correct diagnosis. A heavy but normal physiologic discharge can be determined by excluding other causes. With vulvovaginal candidiasis, differentiating between Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida infection has important treatment ramifications. Most patients with C albicans infections can be successfully treated with maintenance antifungal therapy, usually with fluconazole. Although many non-albicans Candida, particularly Candida glabrata, may at times be innocent bystanders, vaginal boric acid therapy is an effective first choice for many true non-albicans Candida infections. Recurrent bacterial vaginosis, a difficult therapeutic challenge, can often be controlled with maintenance therapy. Multiple options, especially high-dose tinidazole, have been used for metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis. With the aging of the U.S. population, atrophic vaginitis and desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, both associated with hypoestrogenism, are encountered frequently in women with persistent vaginitis.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^113Qyic3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is clinically diagnosed by complaints of itching, burning, and odor accompanied by vaginal discharge. However, providing effective treatment is challenging because of limitations to accurately diagnose the cause of vaginitis at the time of a woman's visit. Conventional microscopy (Gram stain and wet mount), which is typically available in EDs, in addition to being time‐consuming, is strikingly insensitive for the diagnosis of BV, TV, and Candida, particularly with coinfections. For example, one study of 1740 women with vaginitis (BV, 783; Candida, 523; TV, 122; and mixed BV/ Candida, 185) comparing standard microscopy to nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT; using reference standards of culture for TV and Candida and Nugent criteria for BV) reported sensitivities for microscopy to detect BV, TV, and Candida were 76.8%, 68.6%, and 56.9%, respectively. For NAAT, sensitivities were 92.8%, 96.5%, and 90.2%, respectively. Specificities for both microscopy and NAAT were generally > 90%. For microscopy detection of coinfections, sensitivities dropped to 10%–20%. Considering single and multiple infections, using microscopy, as many as one‐quarter to one‐half of infections are missed overall. CDC STI guidelines currently acknowledge microscopy's very poor sensitivity, recommending NAAT TV and Candida culture testing (or empirical treatment for Candida) if microscopy is negative.

Laboratory Diagnosis of Vaginal Infections in Reference Laboratory

All samples were evaluated in a single Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratory by technologists masked to the clinical diagnosis. Technologists performing the BD MAX Vaginal Panel (MAX VP) were masked to and did not perform other laboratory-based testing (Gram stain evaluation, yeast culture identification, and TV testing). MAX VP is an automated assay that utilizes fluorogenic target-specific probes for the qualitative identification of BV-specific organisms (Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, bacterial vaginosis–associated bacteria 2 [BVAB-2], and Megasphaera- 1) and lactobacilli (Lactobacillus species [L. crispatus or L. jensenii]) and assigns a positive or negative result relative to the concentrations of organisms present. The definition of a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of BV was Nugent score ≥ 7 and a positive result for BV with the MAX VP. A laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of VVC was defined as a positive culture for yeast and a MAX VP test positive for Candida species group (C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. dubliniensis), C. glabrata, or C. krusei. Yeast culture used Sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, California) and/or HardyCHROM Candida (Hardy Diagnostics), and yeast colonies were identified using the API ID 32 C Yeast Microbial Identification Kit (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). A laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of TV was based on the detection of T. vaginalis by both the Xpert TV and the MAX VP.

Electronic Medical Record Extraction

The electronic medical records for all participants were accessed via an Honest Broker System, which collects and provides de-identified health information for research purposes when approved by the institutional review board and the UPMC Privacy Office. Health information obtained for this study included the antifungals and/or antibiotics prescribed to the women within 7 days of the index visit and any additional follow-up visits and treatments related to vaginitis based on review of the chart notes through 90 days after the index visit. Appropriateness of treatment was based on whether the treatment prescribed was an FDA-approved or CDC-recommended therapeutic agent for that condition.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^112XS5cU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there was no significant difference in the paired proportions for the vaginal panel assay compared with clinical diagnosis for vulvovaginal candidiasis, clinical diagnosis did result in 26 negative results that were vaginal panel assay-positive but did not receive treatment. Missed diagnoses can lead to recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, which can be challenging to treat effectively without an accurate diagnostic tool. Inappropriate treatment for the C glabrata species, for example, can lead to the formation of resistance and specific antifungal therapies are recommended to address this cause of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

We observed a significant difference in the paired proportions between clinical diagnosis and the vaginal panel assay for identification of T vaginalis. Clinical diagnosis agreed with the vaginal panel assay for positive identification of T vaginalis with a sensitivity of only 28%. In a previous study, clinical diagnosis detected trichomoniasis with a sensitivity of approximately 69%. The low prevalence of T vaginalis (as identified by the vaginal panel assay, the reference method) here resulted in a low group number of total T vaginalis -positive and probably restricted our ability to obtain a completely unbiased assessment of clinical diagnosis, which is reflected in the wide 95% CI (21.0–49.0%). Regardless, the real-world data shown here further highlight the low sensitivity for detection associated with T vaginalis vaginitis. Although motile trichomonads are quite easy to visualize in some instances, the lack of motility that occurs shortly after sample collection, the frequent presence of inflammatory cells that are approximately the same size as trichomonads, and the difficulty with capturing live organisms in the presence of copious discharge all combine to decrease the effectiveness of microscopy as a diagnostic tool for this pathogen.

VVC represents a spectrum of disease. Although there is a clear need for better use of diagnostic modalities and development of better treatment alternatives, most patients with VVC, even the complicated cases, at least have the perspective of achieving adequate control of their symptoms. Future advances, particularly in the area of home diagnostics, may help to optimize use of currently available medicines.

Uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis is treated with preferred therapy oral fluconazole 150 mg for one dose (AII) or topical azoles for 3–7 days (AII). Alternative therapy includes itraconazole oral solution 200 mg PO daily for 3–7 days (BII), and for azole-refractory Candida glabrata vaginitis, boric acid 600 mg vaginal suppository once daily for 14 days (BII). Severe or recurrent vaginitis should be treated with oral fluconazole (100–200 mg) or topical antifungals for ≈7 days (AII).

### Rapid testing for vaginal yeast detection: a prospective study [^111RXWyb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of rapid vaginal yeast detection assay compared with yeast cultures for the diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Study Design

This was a prospective study that involved 104 subjects, 34 asymptomatic women and 70 symptomatic women with vaginitis. Vaginal swabs were obtained from all subjects for wet mount, yeast culture, and the rapid yeast detection test. Overall, the prevalence rate was 39.4%, based on positive yeast cultures. The rapid yeast test performed by the physician was positive in 30 of 41 subjects with positive cultures and 13 of 63 subjects with negative cultures.

Results

The rapid yeast test had 73.1% sensitivity and 82.0% negative predictive value compared with the wet mount, which had 43.9% sensitivity and 70.9% negative predictive value. In symptomatic patients, the test had 77.4% sensitivity and 81% negative predictive value compared with wet mount, which had 51.6% sensitivity. Patient-performed test results were identical to the tests that were performed by the physicians. The cost of the rapid yeast test kit is estimated to be < $10, compared with a mean of $65 for the yeast culture.

Conclusion

Rapid yeast detection assay is accurate and affordable compared with the gold standard yeast culture in the diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Relative to the wet mount, it is more sensitive, cheaper, and accurate for the rapid diagnosis of vaginal yeast infection.

### Treatment of complicated Candida vaginitis: comparison of single and sequential doses of fluconazole [^112fMoGH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

An attempt was made to validate recent recommendations that women with complicated Candida vaginitis (severe or recurrent, non-albicans Candida spp or abnormal host) require longer-duration antifungal therapy to achieve clinical cure and mycologic eradication.

Study Design

A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was performed comparing a single dose of 150 mg of fluconazole with 2 sequential 150-mg doses of fluconazole given 3 days apart.

Results

Five hundred fifty-six women with severe or recurrent Candida vaginitis were enrolled, and 398 had at least one postbaseline evaluation (intent to treat) and of these 309 were fully evaluable (efficacy-valid). At baseline, 92% of vaginal isolates were Candida albicans. The 2-dose fluconazole regimen achieved significantly higher clinical cure rates in women with severe vaginitis when evaluated on day 14 (P = .015) and higher clinical and mycologic responses persisted at day 35. Women with recurrent but not severe vaginitis did not benefit clinically short term by the additional fluconazole dose. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that being infected with non-albicans Candida predicted significantly reduced clinical and mycologic response regardless of duration of therapy. Fluconazole therapy was well tolerated and free of serious adverse effects.

Conclusion

Treatment of Candida vaginitis requires individualization, and women with severe Candida vaginitis achieve superior clinical and mycologic eradication with a 2-dose fluconazole regimen.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — uncomplicated vs complicated management: Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classified as uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated, about 10% of cases. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose fluconazole or short-course fluconazole for 3 days, both of which achieve > 90% response. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires therapy administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7 days or orally with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses. Most Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral fluconazole, and Candida krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents; treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic and azole therapy, including voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful.

Vaginal symptoms are common in the general population and are one of the most frequent reasons for patient visits to obstetrician-gynecologists. Vaginitis may have important consequences in terms of discomfort and pain, days lost from school or work, and sexual functioning and self image. Vaginitis is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and other infections of the female genital tract, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as adverse reproductive outcomes in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Treatment usually is directed to the specific cause of vaginal symptoms, which most commonly include bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. The purpose of this document is to provide information about the diagnosis and treatment of vaginitis.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1173pBYj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Candida, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are the most common causes of vaginitis. These infections are associated with various untoward consequences including increased risk of acquisition of the others, transmission of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus‐2 as well as adverse reproductive and mental health outcomes, and cervical cancer risk. Vaginitis disproportionately affects ethnic minorities and those with lower formal educational attainment and/or experiencing poverty, the very groups most likely to seek episodic care in emergency departments (EDs). Current U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines for vaginitis do not provide an effective approach for many of these women, resulting in missed and delayed diagnoses and treatment. We propose an empirical, single‐dose, point‐of‐care treatment strategy, novel to the U.S. but evidence‐based and consistent with international guidelines, to address existing deficiencies in availability of inexpensive and accurate point‐of‐care diagnosis, and substantial barriers to medication adherence and follow‐up commonly faced by women from disadvantaged groups who frequently seek help in EDs.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^1111XSFv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

There was a high agreement in the present study between the reference laboratory and the FDA-cleared tests, which is consistent with previously published studies. Culture for detection of Candida species and C. glabrata appeared to be more sensitive than the MAX VP. However, the samples for testing in the reference laboratory were mailed at ambient temperature and it is likely that Candida may have replicated in the Amies medium during transport, decreasing the apparent sensitivity of MAX VP. It is unlikely that this impacted the results of the current analysis since women were categorized as having yeast present only when both the culture and MAX VP were concordant.

There are several strengths to the current study. Studies evaluating the accuracy of vaginitis diagnosis have focused on review of medical records from women referred for recurrent vaginitis symptoms or have focused on research sites where these tests are performed routinely, whereas the present study enrolled women at community practice sites employing both physicians and advanced care providers. A second strength of the study is the use of the medical record extraction, which provided prescription data and follow-up information on how many visits for symptoms of vaginitis occurred among women over the subsequent 3 months. There are significant limitations to the study, including the use of a limited numbers of sites within a single regional health system, lack of data for care outside the health system or treatments purchased over the counter, and the limited data collection from the women at the index visit. It is likely that some women received treatments based on symptom reporting by telephone or direct messaging, raising the possibility that the present study did not capture patients whose complaints were addressed without any clinical evaluation whatsoever. Published studies have documented the poor diagnostic accuracy of telephone triage.

### Candidiasis (vulvovaginal) [^114FNcZs]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated to be the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. Candida albicans accounts for 85–90% of cases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments, alternative or complementary treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner to resolve symptoms and prevent recurrence in non-pregnant women with symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of drug treatments, alternative or complementary treatments for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner in non-pregnant women with symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of treating asymptomatic non-pregnant women with a positive swab for candidiasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alternative or complementary treatments, douching, drug treatments, garlic, intravaginal preparations (boric acid, nystatin, imidazoles, tea tree oil), oral fluconazole, oral itraconazole, treating a male sexual partner, and yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (oral or vaginal).

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1122BST5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Women who seek care and can follow up at sexual health clinics and primary care offices are different than many from disadvantaged groups for whom there may be only one opportunity to address their symptoms when seen in the ED. Empirical treatment of vaginitis carries risks of overtreatment, although use of a single‐dose regimen would minimize stewardship concerns for collateral adverse antibiotic effects. Further, overall treatment effectiveness must be considered in the context of a woman's specific circumstances and needs, such as CDC‐endorsed empirical EPT treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and in the case of sexual assault, for which compliance with follow‐up visits is acknowledged to be poor.

For women with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis, particularly in EDs where point‐of‐care NAAT testing is not available, we believe empirical treatment with 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole for BV and TV and 150‐mg single‐dose fluconazole for Candida should be offered through shared decision making. Reliance on microscopy testing poses a substantial risk of underdiagnosis and undertreatment with subsequent persistent symptoms, additional health care visits, and risk of transmission. Alternatively, if the patient believes she can comply, the CDC‐recommended second‐day 2‐g tinidazole dose or 7‐day 500‐mg twice‐daily metronidazole regimen can also be prescribed empirically to treat BV and TV, and women with a history of recurrent or persistent Candida infection can be prescribed a Day 4 and 7 fluconazole dose. Whether empirical or microscopy/point‐of‐care NAAT‐directed treatment is provided, follow‐up should be recommended for patients whose symptoms persist beyond 1 week, at which time further diagnostic testing can be considered.

(.)

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection, and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) are common in women of reproductive age. The prevalence of BV and TV in the United States (US) is 29% and 3%, respectively, but can vary depending on the study population. Adverse sequelae associated with BV and TV include increased acquisition of sexually transmitted infections including human immunodeficiency virus, and pregnancy complications including preterm birth. While the prevalence of VVC cases is unknown, 20% of women are colonized by Candida species in the absence of signs and/or symptoms, and 70% are colonized over a year. Approximately 75% of women will experience at least 1 episode of VVC infection requiring treatment during their lifetimes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines describe the point-of-care tests that can be performed as an adjunct to a clinical history and physical examination to support diagnosis of vaginal discharge syndromes (those not characterized by vulvodynia and noninfectious causes of vaginal symptoms). These tests include measurement of vaginal pH, "whiff" test (addition of potassium hydroxide [KOH] to vaginal fluid for assessment of amine odor), and microscopic examination of fresh samples of the discharge to identify presence of clue cells, motile trichomonads, and/or budding yeast/pseudohyphae. The sensitivity and specificity of microscopic detection of clue cells, yeast, and trichomonads by clinicians can vary considerably. Despite these limitations, the low cost and convenience of point-of-care testing have contributed to their continued use. In a variety of studies, laboratory testing (Nugent score, yeast culture, US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]–approved and independent molecular assays) performed better than clinician-diagnosed vaginitis. CDC guidelines recommend use of alternative commercially available point-of-care tests or clinical laboratory testing in settings where pH paper, KOH, and wet prep evaluation by microscopy are not available.

The primary objective of this study was to assess how women with vaginal discharge syndromes were being evaluated in community practice settings and to assess the appropriateness of the treatments prescribed for BV, TV, and VVC. A second objective was to assess how often women returned for symptoms of vaginitis in the 90 days following treatment and to assess whether the provision of appropriate treatment was related to return office visits for vaginitis symptoms.

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

VVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can occasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. None of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and 40%–45% will have two or more episodes. On the basis of clinical presentation, microbiology, host factors, and response to therapy, VVC can be classified as either uncomplicated or complicated (Box 4). Approximately 10%–20% of women will have complicated VVC, requiring special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1168cCT1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the etiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can identify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is discussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to each condition. In the clinician's office, the cause of vaginal symptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) test, and microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated pH (i.e. > 4.5) is common with BV or trichomoniasis (although trichomoniasis can also be present with a normal vaginal pH). Because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be further examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.9% normal saline solution on one slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution (samples that emit an amine odor immediately upon application of KOH suggest BV or trichomoniasis). Coverslips are then placed on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope at low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might display motile trichomonads or clue cells (i.e. epithelial cells with borders obscured by small anaerobic bacteria), which are characteristic of BV. The KOH specimen typically is used to identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. However, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements in KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT (trichomoniasis) or culture (yeast). Presence of WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also indicate cervicitis (see Cervicitis).

In settings where pH paper, KOH, and microscopy are unavailable, a broad range of clinical laboratory tests, described in the diagnosis section for each disease, can be used. Presence of objective signs of vulvovaginal inflammation in the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing indicates the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or other noninfectious causes of vulvovaginal signs or symptoms. For women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, referral to a specialist should be considered.

Treatment

Most episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans respond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer duration of initial therapy (e.g. 7–14 days of topical therapy or a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg oral dose of fluconazole every third day for a total of 3 doses [days 1, 4, and 7]) is recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen.

Oral fluconazole (i.e. a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term. Because C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if available, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These women should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Severe VVC (i.e. extensive vulvar erythema, edema, excoriation, and fissure formation) is associated with lower clinical response rates among patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses (second dose 72 hours after initial dose) is recommended.

Non– albicans Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Because approximately 50% of women with a positive culture for non– albicans Candida might be minimally symptomatic or have no symptoms, and because successful treatment is often difficult, clinicians should make every effort to exclude other causes of vaginal symptoms for women with non– albicans yeast. The optimal treatment of non– albicans VVC remains unknown; however, a longer duration of therapy (7–14 days) with a nonfluconazole azole regimen (oral or topical) is recommended. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric acid in a gelatin capsule administered vaginally once daily for 3 weeks is indicated. This regimen has clinical and mycologic eradication rates of approximately 70%. If symptoms recur, referral to a specialist is advised.

Management of Sex Partners

No data exist to support treating sex partners of patients with complicated VVC. Therefore, no recommendation can be made.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis — definition and suppressive therapy: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as ≥ 4 episodes of symptomatic infection within one year, should begin with induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole for 10–14 days, followed by maintenance azole; for recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). The most convenient and well-tolerated regimen is 150 mg fluconazole weekly, achieving control of symptoms in > 90% of patients, but after cessation a 40%–50% recurrence rate can be anticipated; if fluconazole therapy is not feasible, topical clotrimazole cream, 200 mg twice weekly, clotrimazole vaginal suppository 500 mg once weekly, or other intermittent oral or topical antifungal treatment is recommended.

Proportion of Women Prescribed Appropriate Treatments and Repeat Visits for Vaginitis in the Subsequent 90 Days

As shown in Table 3, 60 of 290 (21%) women had laboratory-confirmed BV alone, 74 (26%) had VVC alone, 7 (2%) women had TV alone, 29 (10%) had coinfections, and 120 (41%) had no vaginal infections detected. Based on the extracted prescription data from the electronic medical records for 60 women with BV alone, 42 (70%) received appropriate treatment, which included oral metronidazole (n = 30/42 [71%]) followed by vaginal metronidazole (n = 10/42 [24%]) or vaginal clindamycin (n = 2/42 [5%]). Because some clinicians treat women having BV empirically for VVC, use of concurrent antifungal with antibiotic therapy was considered appropriate for this analysis and occurred for 6 (10%) women with BV alone. As shown in Table 3, 18 of the 60 (30%) women with BV alone did not receive appropriate treatment; 16 (27%) were provided no prescriptions and 2 (3%) were provided antifungals alone. Return visits over the subsequent 90 days occurred for 21 (35%) women and did not differ by appropriateness of treatment.

Genital infections — diagnostic testing rationale, partner management, and reporting are emphasized as follows: Clinical diagnosis or syndromic assessment alone has been shown to be neither sensitive nor specific for entities including Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), bacterial vaginitis/vaginosis (BV), Trichomonas, Candida, and genital lesions; therefore, diagnostic testing is recommended for directed appropriate treatment rather than empiric antimicrobials for eradication, reduction of transmission as well as symptomatic relief, increased therapeutic compliance by the patient, and patient more likely to comply with partner notification. Providers should recognize that despite diagnostic testing, 25%–40% of the causes of genital infections or symptoms may not be specifically identified. Referral for partners for specific testing and/or directed treatment is essential to prevent re-infection and is especially important for patients who may be pregnant or HIV positive. Because these infections are communicable and a public health concern, positive tests for many sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including CT, GC, syphilis, chancroid, mpox, HIV, acute hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) require reporting in accordance with state and local statutory requirements by the laboratory and/or the provider, and reporting of additional STIs varies by state.

ABSTRACT

In this prospective, observational, method comparison clinical study, the Xpert Xpress MVP test (MVP) was evaluated using both clinician-collected (CVS) and self-collected vaginal swabs (SVS) collected in a clinical setting. The study was conducted at 12 sites, including point-of-care (POC) settings, from geographically diverse locations in the United States. Participants were biologically female patients ≥ 14 years old with signs and/or symptoms of vaginitis/vaginosis. MVP test results for BV were compared to the BD MAX Vaginal Panel (BDVP). Results for Candida group andandtargets (species not differentiated) were assessed relative to yeast culture followed by mass spectrometry for species identification.(TV) results were compared relative to a composite method that included results from the BDVP and InPouch TV culture. The investigational test demonstrated high positive percent agreement ranging from 93.6 to 99.0%, and negative percent agreement ranging from 92.1% to 99.8% for both CVS and SVS specimens, indicating it may be a valuable tool for the diagnosis of vaginitis/vaginosis in laboratory and POC settings.

RESULTS

Study Population

For the 303 women presenting with symptoms of vaginitis who enrolled, the mean age was 29.4 ± 6.5 years; 79% of women were white, 18% were African American, and 3% were other or unreported race/ethnicity. Participants were predominately nonpregnant (n = 274 [90%]). At the time of presentation, abnormal vaginal discharge was reported by 206 (68%) women, vulvar/vaginal itching by 133 (44%) women, vaginal malodor by 138 (46%) women, and irritation or discomfort by 128 (42%) women. Many of the women (n = 194 [64%]) reported > 1 complaint consistent with vaginitis at presentation. One hundred fifteen of the 303 (38%) women reported treatment of vaginal symptoms in the prior 30 days, with 55 (18%) from the study population reporting use of antifungals and 42 (14%) women reporting the use of oral or vaginal metronidazole in the previous month.

Results of Laboratory-based Testing for Vaginitis

The results of the laboratory-based testing for the 290 evaluable samples is displayed in Table 1. Similar frequencies of BV were detected based on Nugent Gram stain score (n = 104 [36%]) vs MAX VP (n = 107 [37%]). Overall, there was 88% concordance between the 2 laboratory-based tests for a BV diagnosis; 88 (30%) women were positive for BV by both tests. Yeast cultures yielded more Candida species than the NAAT vaginitis panel, with 93 (32%) women having 1 of the Candida species group (C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. dubliniensis) by both culture and NAAT. Candida glabrata was detected by culture and MAX VP for 7 (2%) women, whereas C. krusei was not detected in any of the study participants. The level of agreement between culture and NAAT was 90% for the Candida species group and 98% for C. glabrata. Trichomonas vaginalis was detected by both NAAT tests in 19 (7%) women, with 100% concordance between the 2 test systems. Concordance/discordance between reference laboratory and MAX VP results for BV, VVC, and TV are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

Diseases Characterized by Vulvovaginal Itching, Burning, Irritation, Odor, or Discharge

The majority of women will have a vaginal infection, characterized by discharge, itching, burning, or odor, during their lifetime. With the availability of complementary and alternative therapies and over-the-counter medications for candidiasis, symptomatic women often seek these products before or in addition to an evaluation by a medical provider.

Obtaining a medical history alone has been reported to be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can lead to inappropriate administration of medication. Therefore, a careful history, examination, and laboratory testing to determine the etiology of any vaginal symptoms are warranted. Information regarding sexual behaviors and practices, sex of sex partners, menses, vaginal hygiene practices (e.g. douching), and self-treatment with oral and intravaginal medications or other products should be elicited. The infections most frequently associated with vaginal symptoms are BV (i.e. replacement of the vaginal flora by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria including G. vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, A. vaginae, Megasphaera type 1, and numerous other fastidious or uncultivated anaerobes), trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Cervicitis can also cause an abnormal vaginal discharge. Although VVC is usually not sexually transmitted, it is included in this section because it is frequently diagnosed among women who have vaginal symptoms or are being evaluated for an STI.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) — vulvo-vaginal candidiasis: For uncomplicated vulvo-vaginal candidiasis, preferred therapy is oral fluconazole 150 mg for one dose (AII) or topical azoles (clotrimazole, butoconazole, miconazole, tioconazole, or terconazole) for 3–7 days (AII). For severe or recurrent vulvo-vaginal candidiasis, preferred therapy is fluconazole 100–200 mg PO daily for ≥ 7 days (AII) or topical antifungal ≥ 7 days (AII). Alternative therapy for uncomplicated cases is itraconazole oral solution 200 mg PO daily for 3–7 days (BII). For azole-refractory Candida glabrata vaginitis, boric acid vaginal suppository 600 mg once daily for 14 days.

### Chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113kzSD8]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Frequently ignored by the medical community, chronic vulvovaginal symptoms are relatively common and can frustrating for patients and physicians. Establishing a proper diagnosis will lay the foundation for an effective therapeutic therapeutic plan. Fungal cultures are an important component of the work-up. The most common causes of chronic vaginal symptoms are recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and irritant dermatitis. In patients with RVVC caused by Candida albicans, host factors may play an important role. Long-term oral antifungal therapy will break the pattern of recurrence in many patients. Infections caused by other species of yeast may be more resistant to standard treatment approaches.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113XR548]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), more commonly known as vaginal yeast infections, is one of the most common causes of vaginitis. In 80%–95% of women, VVC is caused by Candida albicans with fewer remaining infections caused by non- albicans Candida species including Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, or other fungi. Approximately 75% of women will have ≥ 1 episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 40%–45% of women will experience ≥ 2 episodes. By the age of 25 years, an estimated 50% of all women will have experienced ≥ 1 episode of VVC after the onset of sexual activity. Current treatment options for VVC are predominantly limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents and include short courses of topical formulations of various agents or oral fluconazole given as a 150-mg single or multiple dose regimen. Limitations of available treatments include concerns of intolerance, adverse events (AEs), and with fluconazole, a potential risk of miscarriage and fetal harm. More recent VVC treatment limitations include an increasing prevalence of fluconazole resistance and intrinsic resistance or low susceptibility of non- albicans Candida species to azole antifungals.

Treatment

Short-course topical formulations (i.e. single dose and regimens of 1–3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy.

Recommended Regimens for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
Over-the-Counter Intravaginal Agents
Clotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days
or
Clotrimazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days
or
Miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days
or
Miconazole 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days
or
Miconazole 100 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 7 days
or
Miconazole 200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 3 days
or
Miconazole 1,200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 1 day
or
Tioconazole 6.5% ointment 5 g intravaginally in a single application
Prescription Intravaginal Agents

The creams and suppositories in these regimens are oil based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Patients should refer to condom product labeling for further information. Even women who have previously received a diagnosis of VVC by a clinician are not necessarily more likely to be able to diagnose themselves; therefore, any woman whose symptoms persist after using an over-the-counter preparation or who has a recurrence of symptoms < 2 months after treatment for VVC should be evaluated clinically and tested. Unnecessary or unapproved use of over-the-counter preparations is common and can lead to a delay in treatment of other vulvovaginitis etiologies, which can result in adverse outcomes. No substantial evidence exists to support using probiotics or homeopathic medications for treating VVC.

Follow-Up

Follow-up typically is not required. However, women with persistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment should be instructed to return for follow-up visits.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^116ghHAD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the relative effectiveness (clinical cure) of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the relative effectiveness in terms of mycological cure, in addition to safety, side effects, treatment preference, time to first relief of symptoms, and costs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers on 29 August 2019 together with reference checking and citation searching.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials published in any language comparing at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal in women (aged 16 years or over) with a mycological diagnosis (positive culture, microscopy for yeast, or both) of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. We excluded trials if they solely involved participants who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breast feeding or diabetic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

This review includes 26 trials (5007 participants). Eight anti-fungals are represented. All but three trials included participants with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. Trials were conducted in Europe: UK (3), Croatia (2). Finland (2), the Netherlands (2), Germany (1), Italy (1), Sweden (1) and one trial across multiple European countries, USA (7) Thailand (2), Iran (2), Japan (1) and Africa (Nigeria) (1). The duration of follow-up varied between trials. The overall risk of bias of the included trials was high. There was probably little or no difference shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short-term follow-up (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.43; 13 trials; 1859 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.50; 9 trials; 1042 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of clinical cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 77%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 75% and 83%; if the rate of clinical cure at long term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 84%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 89%. Oral treatment probably improves mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50: 19 trials; 3057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.60; 13 trials; 1661 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of mycological cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 80%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 85%; if the rate of mycological cure at long-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 66%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 67% and 76%. In terms of patient safety, there is a low risk of participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse drug effects for either treatment (23 trials; 4637 participants; high-certainty evidence). Due to the low certainty of evidence, it is undetermined whether oral treatments reduced the number of side effects compared with intra-vaginal treatments (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 16 trials; 3155 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of side effects with intra-vaginal treatment is 12%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 10% and 15%. We noted that the type of side effects differed, with intra-vaginal treatments being more often associated with local reactions, and oral treatments being more often associated with systemic effects including gastro-intestinal symptoms and headaches. Oral treatment appeared to be the favoured treatment preference over intra-vaginal treatment or no preference (12 trials; 2206 participants), however the data were poorly reported and the certainty of the evidence was low. There was little or no difference in time to first relief of symptoms between oral and intra-vaginal treatments: four trials favoured the oral treatment, four favoured intra-vaginal, one study reported no difference and one was unclear. The measurements varied between the 10 trials (1910 participants) and the certainty of the evidence was low. Costs were not reported in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral anti-fungal treatment probably improves short- and long-term mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. Oral treatment was the favoured treatment preference by participants, though the certainty of this evidence is low. The decision to prescribe or recommend an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration safety in terms of withdrawals and side effects, as well as cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of some oral anti-fungals is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

### Non-albicans Candida vulvovaginitis: treatment experience at a tertiary care vaginitis center [^11223CJ5]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study are to analyze a cohort of women with vulvovaginal symptoms and positive cultures for non-albicans Candida (NAC) to determine whether yeast was responsible for their symptoms and to evaluate the mycological effectiveness of various regimens.

Methods

This observational study was performed from retrospective chart review of patients with positive NAC cultures between April 1, 2008, and January 31, 2011, at a tertiary care vaginitis center. Patient intake demographics were entered into a database. Follow-up visits were analyzed for data about patient treatments and outcomes. Patients were considered a clinical cure if their symptoms were significantly improved and mycologic cure (MC) if later yeast cultures were negative. If clinical symptoms improved at the same time as MC, the isolate was considered the proximate cause for the symptoms.

Results

One hundred eight patients meeting entry criteria were analyzed. Boric acid was effective at obtaining MC in 32 (78%) of 41 patients with C. glabrata, 3 of 3 patients with C. tropicalis, and 3 of 3 patients with C. lusitaniae. Fluconazole was effective as initial treatment for 3 (60%) of 5 patients with C. glabrata and 13 (81%) of 16 patients with C. parapsilosis. In 52.7% of C. glabrata, 66.7% of C. parapsilosis, and 57.1% of C. tropicalis cases, effective antifungal therapy led to symptom improvement.

Conclusions

In a tertiary care vaginitis center, NAC, when isolated on culture, caused clinically significant infections in approximately half of symptomatic patients. A majority of infections can be effectively treated with boric acid or fluconazole regardless of the non-albicans Candida species.

Candidiasis

Candidiasis commonly called "yeast infection" or "thrush" is a fungal infection (mycosis) which occurs when there is overgrowth of any of the Candida species, of which Candida albicans is the most common. Candida is normally found on skin or mucous membranes including the vagina. However, if the environment becomes imbalanced, such as when the normal acidity of the mucous membrane changes or when the hormonal balance changes, Candida can multiply. When that happens, symptomatic candidiasis can occur, ranging from oral thrush and vaginitis, to systemic and potentially life-threatening diseases. Candida infections of the latter category are usually confined to severely immunocompromised persons.

Vaginal candidiasis, usually (90%) due to Candida albicans, is often harmless and causes no symptoms. However it can also cause vaginal soreness, itching and discharge. Approximately 75% of all healthy women of fertile age suffer from at least one episode of vaginal candidiasis, with associated physical and psychological morbidity and approximately half will have a recurrence. Vaginal candidiasis (referred to as 'candidiasis' in this protocol) is not traditionally classified as a sexually transmitted infection, since it occurs in celibate women, and is considered part of the normal vaginal flora. This does not mean that sexual transmission does not occur, although the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of infection is unknown. Importantly treatment of male partners has not been effective in reducing recurrence of vaginal candidiasis.

Up to 40% of pregnant women may have vaginal colonisation by Candida species, a two-fold increase from the prevalence rate in non-pregnant women. This association is believed to be driven by increased levels of circulating oestrogens and deposition of glycogen and other substrates in the vagina during pregnancy.

Candidiasis and preterm birth

The role of Candida colonisation on the pathway to preterm birth has not been pursued with the vigour ascribed to bacterial vaginosis and other vaginal organisms, possibly because it is considered a normal vaginal commensal organism. However, several factors indicate an association between vaginal candidiasis and preterm birth:

- the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in women with untreated, asymptomatic candidiasis is higher than among women with normal flora - 7.6% versus 2.8% (P = 0.009) in a low-risk obstetric population,

- in a high-risk population, there was increased rate of preterm birth among women with non-albicans Candida compared with uncolonised women (15.4% versus 11.3%, P = 0.05)

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review of the evidence for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention of sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^114CjmaX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common cause of vulvovaginal itching and discharge. This article discusses the latest CDC STI Treatment Guidelines for VVC.

Methods

A literature search of relevant topics was performed, and a team of experts was convened to discuss (1) diagnosis/testing modalities; treatment of (2) uncomplicated VVC, (3) complicated VVC, and (4) VVC caused by non-albicans yeast; (5) alternative treatment regimens; (6) susceptibility testing of yeast; Special Populations: (7) pregnancy and (8) HIV and VVC.

Results

Yeast culture remains the gold standard for diagnoses. Newer molecular assays have been developed for the diagnosis of VVC and perform well. Azole antifungals remain the treatment of choice for uncomplicated VVC. Two new drugs, TOL-463 and recently FDA-approved ibrexafungerp, appeared promising in clinical trials. For recurrent VVC, oteseconazole, not yet commercially available, may represent a new option. For non-albicans yeast infections in symptomatic patients, boric acid appears useful. No evidence supports the use of alternative treatments, including probiotics. Fluconazole during pregnancy may be associated with spontaneous abortion and craniofacial and heart defects. In women with HIV infection, lower CD4+ T-cell counts are associated with increased rates of VVC, and VVC is associated with increased viral shedding. Treatment measures in women with HIV infection are identical to those women without HIV infection.

Conclusions

There has been significant new knowledge generated about VVC since the 2015 CDC Guidelines which have led to changing recommendations.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^115p8mCR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Population

Healthy, nonpregnant female participants aged ≥ 18 years and < 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic acute VVC were enrolled in the study. Participants had a positive baseline potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount from a vaginal smear revealing filamentous hyphae/pseudohyphae or budding yeast cells, presence of ≥ 1 vulvovaginal sign, presence of ≥ 1 vulvovaginal symptom, and a composite severity score of ≥ 6. Vaginal swabs were obtained at the screening visit and at subsequent study visits. Candida species were characterized and stored frozen for susceptibility testing at study completion. Inclusion criteria required participants to present with a clinical diagnosis of acute VVC and did not differentiate between acute and recurrent VVC participants.

Participants did not have any clinically significant major organ system disease or infection (with the exception of VVC) and were not taking concomitant medications that would have interfered with study assessments.

Participants completed a review of pertinent medical history, vital signs, and body measurements; a symptom/sign evaluation; a physical examination including speculum examination of the vagina; and a KOH wet mount test from a vaginal smear.

### Treatment of vaginitis caused by Candida glabrata: use of topical boric acid and flucytosine [^115CFePf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to review the treatment outcome and safety of topical therapy with boric acid and flucytosine in women with Candida glabrata vaginitis.

Study Design

This was a retrospective review of case records of 141 women with positive vaginal cultures of C glabrata at two sites, Wayne State University School of Medicine and Ben Gurion University.

Results

The boric acid regimen, 600 mg daily for 2 to 3 weeks, achieved clinical and mycologic success in 47 of 73 symptomatic women (64%) in Detroit and 27 of 38 symptomatic women (71%) in Beer Sheba. No advantage was observed in extending therapy for 14 to 21 days. Topical flucytosine cream administered nightly for 14 days was associated with a successful outcome in 27 of 30 of women (90%) whose condition had failed to respond to boric acid and azole therapy. Local side effects were uncommon with both regimens.

Conclusions

Topical boric acid and flucytosine are useful additions to therapy for women with azole-refractory C glabrata vaginitis.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^111Nz9tQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush).

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The secondary objectives of the review were to assess the cost-effectiveness, safety and patient preference of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals.

Search Strategy

The following sources were searched: The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), MEDLINE (January 1985 to May 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000) and the Cochrane Collaboration Sexually Transmitted Disease Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed manually. The manufacturers of anti-fungals available in the UK were contacted.

Selection Criteria

~Bullet~Randomised controlled trials published in any language. ~Bullet~Trials had to compare at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal. ~Bullet~Women (aged 16 years or over) with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. ~Bullet~The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis to be made mycologically (i.e. a positive culture and / or microscopy for yeast). ~Bullet~Trials were excluded if they solely involved subjects who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding or diabetic. ~Bullet~The primary outcome measure was clinical cure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Duplicate scrutiny was performed of the titles and abstracts of the electronic search results. Full article formats of all selected abstracts were retrieved and independently assessed by two reviewers. Independent duplicate abstraction was performed by four reviewers. Disagreements regarding trial inclusion or data abstraction were resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Odds ratios were pooled using the random effects model. Chi-squared tests with a p-value of less than 0.1 indicated heterogeneity in the results.

Main Results

Seventeen trials are included in the review, reporting 19 oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungal comparisons. No statistically significant differences were shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short term (OR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.40)) and long term (OR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.49)) follow-up. No statistically significant differences for mycological cure were observed between oral and intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.20(95% CI, 0.87 to 1.65)) or long term follow-up (OR 1.30 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.71)). Two trials each reported one withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse reaction. Treatment preference data were poorly reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences exist in terms of the relative effectiveness (measured as clinical and mycological cure) of anti-fungals administered by the oral and intra-vaginal routes for the treatment of uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. No definitive conclusion can be made regarding the relative safety of oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungals for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. The oral route of administration is the preferred route for anti-fungals for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The decision to prescribe or recommend the purchase of an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration: safety, cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications: if women are purchasing their own treatment, they should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of oral anti-fungal administration is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

Management of Sex Partners

Uncomplicated VVC is not usually acquired through sexual intercourse, and data do not support treatment of sex partners. A minority of male sex partners have balanitis, characterized by erythematous areas on the glans of the penis in conjunction with pruritus or irritation. These men benefit from treatment with topical antifungal agents to relieve symptoms.

Special Considerations

Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions

Topical agents usually cause no systemic side effects, although local burning or irritation might occur. Oral azoles occasionally cause nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. Therapy with the oral azoles has rarely been associated with abnormal elevations of liver enzymes. Clinically important interactions can occur when oral azoles are administered with other drugs.

Complicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Diagnostic Considerations

Vaginal culture or PCR should be obtained from women with complicated VVC to confirm clinical diagnosis and identify non– albicans Candida. Candida glabrata does not form pseudohyphae or hyphae and is not easily recognized on microscopy. C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common in vaginal isolates, and non– albicans Candida is intrinsically resistant to azoles; therefore, culture and susceptibility testing should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic.

Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Recurrent VVC, usually defined as three or more episodes of symptomatic VVC in < 1 year, affects < 5% of women but carries a substantial economic burden. Recurrent VVC can be either idiopathic or secondary (related to frequent antibiotic use, diabetes, or other underlying host factors). The pathogenesis of recurrent VVC is poorly understood, and the majority of women with recurrent VVC have no apparent predisposing or underlying conditions. C. glabrata and other non– albicans Candida species are observed in 10%–20% of women with recurrent VVC. Conventional antimycotic therapies are not as effective against these non– albicans yeasts as against C. albicans.

Mucosal candidiasis diagnosis — adults and adolescents with HIV: Esophageal candidiasis should be suspected in people with low CD4 count who have substernal chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia, especially if oral thrush is present, and the diagnosis is often made empirically based on symptoms plus response to therapy; definitive diagnosis requires direct endoscopic visualization of lesions with histopathologic demonstration of characteristic Candida yeast forms in tissue and confirmation by fungal culture and speciation. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is usually diagnosed by clinical presentation with demonstration of characteristic blastosphere and hyphal yeast forms in vaginal secretions on potassium hydroxide preparation; culture confirmation is rarely required but may provide supportive information, and self-diagnosis of vulvovaginitis is unreliable, with microscopic and culture confirmation required to avoid unnecessary exposure to treatment and to assess for other potential pathogens including sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

### Treatment of non-albicans Candida vaginitis with amphotericin B vaginal suppositories [^111THiSd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to investigate whether amphotericin B vaginal suppositories would be effective in the treatment of non- albicans Candida vaginitis in women who failed conventional therapy.

Study Design

Thirty-two patients were identified with non- albicans Candida vaginitis. These patients were treated with conventional antifungal agents. Ten patients had persistence of the non- albicans Candida infection after treatment. Amphotericin B 50-mg vaginal suppositories were given nightly for 14 days to this subgroup of treatment failures.

Results

Of 10 women, 8 (80%) who were treated with amphotericin B vaginally initially showed no further infection. One of the treatment successes had 2 recurrences and responded to a second course of amphotericin B but failed a third course. If this patient is considered a treatment failure, then amphotericin B vaginal suppositories were successful in 70% of patients. The medication was well tolerated and local side effects were minimal.

Conclusion

Amphotericin B vaginal suppositories are a viable treatment option for refractory vaginitis caused by non- albicans Candida.

Laboratory testing

For diagnosis of BV, the reference method was comprised of a consensus Nugent score and modified Amsel criteria if necessary (described below). For each subject, a single clinician-collected vaginal swab was first smeared on a glass microscope slide to prepare the Nugent scoring slide and then used to complete Amsel evaluation. The slide was then Gram stained and assigned a Nugent score, as described previously. Each Gram-stained slide was independently reviewed by three different reviewers at a single reference laboratory, blinded to each other's interpretations. Agreement on BV interpretations (positive, negative, intermediate) by at least two reviewers constituted consensus, and the Nugent interpretation was final. Disagreement across all three reviewers was resolved via panel review of the same slide at a multi-headed microscope. Slides with a consensus Nugent interpretation of intermediate were resolved using modified Amsel criteria (≥ 20% clue cells together with either vaginal fluid pH greater than 4.5 or a positive whiff test (potassium hydroxide test on the swab) to determine BV status.

For diagnosis of VVC, the reference method was comprised of yeast culture. For each subject, a single vaginal swab was used to inoculate two different culture media at a single reference laboratory: Sabouraud Dextrose Agar and CHROMagar Candida (CHROMagar, Paris, France). The growth level on both media after 48 h was reported as follows: no colony, 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+, with n + representing the number of quadrants showing Candida growth. Subjects with a positive culture result with either medium were categorized as positive for VVC. For trichomoniasis, the reference method was comprised of the combined results of an FDA-cleared NAAT for T. vaginalis and culture, as described previously.

Clinician-collected vaginal swab specimens that had been stored at −70°C were tested for the sexually transmitted organisms Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), using FDA-cleared transcription-mediated amplification NAATs (Aptima Combo 2 and Aptima Mycoplasma genitalium, respectively) for the detection of ribosomal RNA from each organism. All NAAT testing was performed at one site on the automated Panther system instrument using assay-specific software for results interpretation.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) epidemiology in HIV indicates that oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis are common in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the vast majority are caused by Candida albicans, and occurrence is an indicator of immune suppression most often observed with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3, with esophageal disease typically occurring at lower CD4 counts than oropharyngeal disease. The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a dramatic decline in the prevalence of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis and a marked diminution in cases of refractory disease. Fluconazole (or azole) resistance is predominantly the consequence of previous exposure to fluconazole (or other azoles), particularly repeated and long-term exposure, and prior exposure to azole therapy has been associated with a gradual emergence of non-C. albicans species, particularly Candida glabrata, as a cause of refractory mucosal candidiasis in patients with advanced immunosuppression and low CD4 counts. In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis — whether a single episode or recurrent — is common in healthy, adult women and does not suggest HIV infection.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) — epidemiology and CD4 association: Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis are common in people with HIV, with the vast majority caused by Candida albicans and non–C. albicans species increasingly reported, in part due to increased selection pressure from increased use of azoles. The occurrence of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis is recognized as an indicator of immune suppression and is most often observed in people with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3, with esophageal disease typically occurring at lower CD4 counts than oropharyngeal disease. In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis — whether a single episode or recurrent — is common in healthy adults and does not suggest HIV.

### Genital Candida species detected in samples from women in melbourne, Australia, before and after treatment with antibiotics [^111LdzkX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) remains a common cause of morbidity, with three-quarters of women affected during their lifetimes. Use of antibiotics is an acknowledged trigger for VVC, which adversely affects women's physical and emotional health. Knowledge of patterns of genital Candida species-level identification is important for management, as Candida species other than Candida albicans often fail first-line treatment. A community sample of women with no vaginal symptoms, and who were prescribed antibiotics, was recruited into this study, where the incidence of genital colonization by various Candida species was documented, as well as symptoms of VVC plus relevant associations, before and after treatment with antibiotics. Self-collected low vaginal swabs were taken prior to and 8 days after completion of antibiotic treatment, and data on various potential risk factors for VVC were collected simultaneously, with complete data being available for 233 participants. Baseline Candida species colonization was present in 21% of women (95% confidence intervals [CI], 17% to 27%), rising to 37% (95% CI, 31% to 44%) after antibiotic treatment. The primary species detected for either period was C. albicans (73%), with Candida glabrata detected in around 20%. Self-assessed proneness to VVC after antibiotic treatment and baseline colonization with Candida spp. were significantly associated with symptomatic VVC after antibiotic treatment. For microbiologically proven candidiasis, VVC symptoms had a sensitivity of 57% and a specificity of 91%. When physicians prescribe antibiotics, the history of risk of VVC is one issue that physicians should discuss with women, particularly those who are self-identified as being prone to VVC. Furthermore, we recommend that definitive microbiological diagnoses be made for women with recurrent symptoms or those failing initial treatment, to guide appropriate therapy.

STI and BV testing and treatment

Molecular testing for the following STIs: Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium by multiplex PCR was performed at each visit as described. If any of these laboratory-based tests were positive, appropriate targeted therapy was prescribed and recorded. Blood was obtained for HIV rapid test and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) serology. A vulvo-vaginal swab was collected for BV testing (Gram staining and Nugent scoring; BV negative (Nugent 0–3), intermediate (Nugent 4–6), or positive (Nugent 7–10)), and microscopy for Candida hyphae and spores. Treatment for BV was only offered to participants presenting with clinical symptoms according to South African syndromic management guidelines. Vaginal pH was measured using color-fixed indicator strips (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany).

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^115eQrbL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary objective was to identify an optimal dose of oral ibrexafungerp in patients with moderate-to-severe acute VVC. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure (complete resolution of signs and symptoms; VSS = 0) at TOC; clinical failure was defined as no response to therapy or incomplete resolution of VSS or need for additional vulvovaginal or systemic antifungal therapy before the TOC visit. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of oral ibrexafungerp in patients with VVC based on mycological and clinical outcomes and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibrexafungerp. Secondary efficacy endpoints were the percentage of patients with mycological eradication (negative fungal culture) at TOC and day 25, percentage of patients with both clinical cure and mycological eradication at TOC, percentage of patients with both absence of VSS and mycological eradication at day 25, and percentage of patients with continued clinical response (ongoing absence of symptoms in patients achieving clinical cure at TOC) at day 25. Exploratory endpoints included percentage of patients at day 25 who were symptom-free (absence of symptoms regardless of clinical outcome at TOC; patients that received additional antifungal therapy were considered not being free of VSS at day 25). Post hoc analyses included VSS score ≤ 1 (clinical improvement) at TOC and day 25 and the use of antifungal rescue medications.

Statistical Analysis

As a dose-finding study with no formal sample size calculation performed, this study was not statistically powered. All analyses are descriptive in nature. Approximately 180 patients were planned to be enrolled and equally randomized to the 6 study treatment groups. Thirty patients per group was estimated to be adequate for an initial assessment of safety and potential efficacy. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized patients. The modified ITT (mITT) population included all randomized patients who had a positive KOH test and a confirmed positive mycological culture for yeast at baseline; all efficacy results will be reported using the mITT population. The safety population included all randomized patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug and had ≥ 1 postbaseline evaluation.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^116nhC9u]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Special Considerations

Compromised Host

Women with underlying immunodeficiency, those with poorly controlled diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions (e.g. HIV), and those receiving immunosuppression therapy (e.g. corticosteroid treatment) might not respond as well to short-term therapies. Efforts to correct modifiable conditions should be made, and more prolonged (i.e. 7–14 days) conventional treatment is necessary.

Pregnancy

VVC occurs frequently during pregnancy. Only topical azole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use among pregnant women. Epidemiologic studies indicate a single 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies; therefore, it should not be used.

HIV Infection

Vaginal Candida colonization rates among women with HIV infection are higher than among women without HIV with similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics, and the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of immunosuppression. Symptomatic VVC is also more frequent among women with HIV infection and similarly correlates with severity of immunodeficiency. In addition, among women with HIV, systemic azole exposure is associated with isolation of non– albicans Candida species from the vagina.

Treatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC among women with HIV infection should not differ from that for women who do not have HIV. Although long-term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and symptomatic VVC, this regimen is not recommended for women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated VVC. Although VVC is associated with increased HIV seroconversion among HIV-negative women and increased HIV cervicovaginal levels among women with HIV infection, the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.

14.1 Treatment of VVC

Two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (Trial 1, NCT03734991 and Trial 2, NCT03987620) with a similar design were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single day of BREXAFEMME 600 mg (two 150 mg tablets per dose, administered 12 hours apart) for the treatment of VVC. Non-pregnant post-menarchal females with a diagnosis of VVC were eligible. A diagnosis of VVC was defined as (a) minimum composite vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (VSS) score of ≥ 4 with at least two signs or symptoms having a score of 2 (moderate) or greater; (b) positive microscopic examination with 10% KOH in a vaginal sample revealing yeast forms (hyphae/pseudohyphae) or budding yeasts, and (c) normal vaginal pH (≤ 4.5). The total composite VSS score was based on the vulvovaginal signs (erythema, edema, excoriation) and vulvovaginal symptoms (itching, burning, or irritation) where each was scored as 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, or 3 = severe. Study visits included the test of cure (TOC, Day 8 to 14) visit and a follow-up (Day 21 to 29) visit. The modified intent to treat (MITT) population included randomized subjects with a baseline culture positive for Candida species who took at least 1 dose of study medication.

### Treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^114kDkmq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women. No comprehensive systematic review of treatments for RVVC has been published.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for RVVC. The secondary objective was to assess patient preference of treatment options.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (search date 6 October 2021). We also handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials, experts in RVVC, and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments for at least six months, in women with four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. We excluded women with immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication. We included women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women. Diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by presence of symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non-drug therapies and partner treatment, assessing the following primary outcomes:

- number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy);
- proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow-up period; and
- adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to identify eligible trials. Duplicate data extraction was completed independently by two authors. We assessed risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the fixed-effects model for pooling and expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where important statistical heterogeneity was present we either did not pool data (I 2 > 70%) or used a random-effects model (I 2 40–70%). We used the GRADE tool to assess overall certainty of the evidence for the pooled primary outcomes.

Main Results

Studies: Twenty-three studies involving 2212 women aged 17 to 67 years met the inclusion criteria. Most studies excluded pregnant women and women with diabetes or immunosuppression. The predominant species found on culture at study entry was Candida albicans. Overall, the included studies were small (< 100 participants). Six studies compared antifungal treatment with placebo (607 participants); four studies compared oral versus topical antifungals (543 participants); one study compared different oral antifungals (45 participants); two studies compared different dosing regimens for antifungals (100 participants); one study compared two different dosing regimens of the same topical agent (23 participants); one study compared short versus longer treatment duration (26 participants); two studies assessed the effect of partner treatment (98 participants); one study compared a complementary treatment (Lactobacillus vaginal tablets and probiotic oral tablets) with placebo (34 participants); three studies compared complementary medicine with antifungals (354 participants); two studies compared 'dermasilk' briefs with cotton briefs (130 participants); one study examined Lactobacillus vaccination versus heliotherapy versus ciclopyroxolamine (90 participants); one study compared CAM treatments to an antifungal treatment combined with CAM treatments (68 participants). We did not find any studies comparing different topical antifungals. Nine studies reported industry funding, three were funded by an independent source and eleven did not report their funding source. Risk of bias: Overall, the risk of bias was high or unclear due to insufficient blinding of allocation and participants and poor reporting. Primary outcomes: Meta-analyses comparing drug treatments (oral and topical) with placebo or no treatment showed there may be a clinically relevant reduction in clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.63; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 2; participants = 607; studies = 6; I² = 82%; low-certainty evidence) and 12 months (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNTB = 6; participants = 585; studies = 6; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. We are very uncertain whether oral drug treatment compared to topical treatment increases the risk of clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.31; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and reduces the risk of clinical recurrence at 12 months (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.27; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 10%; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. Adverse events were scarce across both treatment and control groups in both comparisons. The reporting of adverse events varied amongst studies, was generally of very low quality and could not be pooled. Overall the adverse event rate was low for both placebo and treatment arms and ranged from less than 5% to no side effects or complications.

Authors' Conclusions

In women with RVVC, treatment with oral or topical antifungals may reduce symptomatic clinical recurrences when compared to placebo or no treatment. We were unable to find clear differences between different treatment options (e.g. oral versus topical treatment, different doses and durations). These findings are not applicable to pregnant or immunocompromised women and women with diabetes as the studies did not include or report on them. More research is needed to determine the optimal medication, dose and frequency.

### Diagnostic performance of an automated microscopy and pH test for diagnosis of vaginitis [^1111abpa]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

An insufficient in-clinic evaluation may result from the absence of suitable equipment (i.e. microscope), lack of proper training in the preparation and interpretation of a wet mount, time constraints, and lack of awareness that these measures allow improved detection of the causes of vaginitis. As an alternative to microscope usage, providers can send vaginal samples for laboratory evaluation. Nevertheless, laboratory tests are aimed at detecting only infectious etiologies and cannot detect noninfectious conditions such as vaginal atrophy, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (DIV, also termed aerobic vaginitis, AV), and cytolytic vaginosis. In addition, these methods are not available in many clinical settings, are expensive, time-consuming, and do not provide timely results, as many of these tests require a process that lasts from several hoursto several days, thus not allowing a point-of-care diagnosis.

Laboratory methods include cultures, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel, and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Some rapid point-of-care tests are available, nevertheless, these tests are only for a subset of the related conditions, including BV and trichomoniasis. Each test can only diagnose a single cause, necessitating the conduction of multiple tests, thus increasing the turnover time and cost. Collectively, these findings suggest that current clinical practice is sub-optimal and indicate the need for a diagnostic modality that is efficient, cost-effective, allows for a wide range of diagnoses, and is usable during the clinic visit.

The investigational test evaluated in this study is the GYNI™ rapid point-of-care system (GynTools, Israel), an automated in-vitro diagnostic system, intended to aid in the diagnosis of vaginitis in symptomatic women, by qualitatively detecting the following vaginitis conditions or pathogens at the point-of-care: (1) BV, (2) Candida albicans vaginitis (CA), (3) Candida non-albicans vaginitis (NAC), (4) T. vaginalis, (5) vaginal atrophy (also referred to as atrophic vaginitis or genitourinary syndrome of menopause, GSM), (6) aerobic vaginitis/desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (AV/DIV), and (7) cytolytic vaginosis (CV).

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis-STI treatment guidelines… [^113sdd9D]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis VVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can occasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. None of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and 40%–45% will have two or more episodes. Uncomplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Diagnostic Considerations A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors.

The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. HIV Infection Vaginal Candida colonization rates among women with HIV infection are higher than among women without HIV with similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics, and the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of immunosuppression.

Symptomatic VVC is also more frequent among women with HIV infection and similarly correlates with severity of immunodeficiency. In addition, among women with HIV, systemic azole exposure is associated with isolation of non– albicans Candida species from the vagina. Treatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC among women with HIV infection should not differ from that for women who do not have HIV. Although long-term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing.

### Detection of vaginal yeast using a rapid test… [^113KLSgj]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Background: One of the most common reasons for office visits is vaginitis, with approximately 30 percent of cases caused by Candida species infection. The evaluation of women with possible vulvovaginal candidiasis consists of microscopy, saline solution wet mount, whiff test, pH determination, and Gram stain. Diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is complicated by a significant overlap in symptoms with other causes of vaginitis. It is usually determined by clinical presentation, physical examination findings, vaginal pH, and microscopic examination of discharge. In several studies, however, this approach identified only 50 to 80 percent of women who had yeast cultures positive for Candida species. Cultures do not provide a viable diagnostic test for this vaginitis because they are expensive and take up to seven days to provide definitive results. One alternative to yeast cultures is a rapid test for vaginal yeast that can be self-administered.

Chatwani evaluated the use of a rapid vaginal yeast test in the diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The Study: The authors carried out a prospective evaluation of nonpregnant adult women with or without symptoms such as vaginal discharge, itching, irritation, or odor. An examination was performed and a vaginal sample obtained for a wet mount, yeast culture, and rapid yeast test. After the examination, each participant performed a self-administered rapid yeast sampling following the manufacturer's instructions. The main outcomes measured were the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the rapid vaginal yeast test. Results: Of the 104 participants, 70 had symptoms. The sensitivity of the physician-performed rapid yeast test in women with or without symptoms was 73. 1 percent, compared with
43. 9 percent for the wet mount. The specificity for wet mount in the same group was 88. 9 percent, compared with
79. 4 percent for the rapid yeast test.

The positive predictive values for both tests were similar, but the negative predictive value was higher for the rapid yeast test. The results for the patient-obtained rapid yeast test were similar. Conclusion: The rapid yeast test can be used in the evaluation of women with symptoms of vaginitis. It may increase the accuracy of diagnosing vulvovaginitis and reduce the overuse of treatment. The authors add that the rapid yeast test is superior to microscopy in the diagnosis of vulvovaginitis.
