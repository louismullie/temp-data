## Question

What were the key efficacy outcomes for roflumilast cream versus vehicle in INTEGUMENT-2 at week 4, and were they statistically significant?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key efficacy outcomes for roflumilast cream 0.15% versus vehicle in INTEGUMENT-2 at week 4, and whether those results were statistically significant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and primary endpoint definition. Then, I should verify the exact week 4 results for the primary and key secondary outcomes. Next, I will check the statistical tests and P values to confirm significance. After that, I should review early-onset efficacy signals and subgroup findings. Finally, I will synthesize clinical relevance and note limitations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the trial framework and endpoint definitions so I don't misstate anything. INTEGUMENT-2 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial in patients aged 6 years and older with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, comparing once-daily roflumilast cream 0.15% to vehicle for 4 weeks, with the primary endpoint defined as vIGA-AD success at week 4, meaning a score of 0 or 1 plus at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline, analyzed in the intention-to-treat population using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by site and baseline vIGA-AD score [^c3f25dab] [^ba78c35f].

> Now, I should verify the primary outcome results at week 4. In INTEGUMENT-2, 28.9% of patients on roflumilast achieved vIGA-AD success versus 12.0% on vehicle, yielding an absolute difference of 16.5% and a 95% CI of 6.71% to 26.29%, with P < .001, which is statistically significant by the prespecified analysis plan [^d11a0770] [^84b907f5].

> Next, I will examine the key secondary outcomes, especially EASI-75, to ensure consistency. At week 4, 42.0% of roflumilast-treated patients achieved EASI-75 compared with 19.7% on vehicle, an absolute difference of 22.3% with a 95% CI of 9.07% to 35.53%, and again P < .001, confirming statistical significance for this clinically important threshold [^d11a0770] [^84b907f5].

> Hold on, I should verify early-onset signals and itch outcomes because clinicians often ask about speed of benefit. vIGA-AD success was significantly higher with roflumilast as early as week 2 in INTEGUMENT-2 (17.7% vs 5.3%; P < .001), and for patients with baseline WI-NRS ≥ 4, a 4-point itch reduction was achieved by 30%–34% on roflumilast versus 12%–21% on vehicle at week 4, with itch improvement detectable as early as 24 hours after the first application in both INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2, underscoring rapid onset of antipruritic benefit [^d11a0770] [^77db5237] [^1d93d28a].

> I need to ensure the statistical approach is sound and that I'm not overstating anything. The primary analysis used a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with multiple imputation for missing data, and patients who discontinued for adverse events or lack of efficacy were counted as nonresponders, which is a conservative approach that strengthens confidence in the significance of the observed differences [^ba78c35f].

> Let me consider clinical relevance and consistency. The magnitude of vIGA-AD success around 29% at 4 weeks is consistent with the sister trial INTEGUMENT-1 (32.0% vs 15.2%), and the EASI-75 response of about 42% aligns with clinically meaningful thresholds used in AD trials. Importantly, these benefits were achieved with favorable local tolerability and low discontinuation rates, supporting practical use [^d11a0770] [^5cf6acfa] [^14b94dcf].

> But wait, what about limitations that could temper interpretation. The trials were 4 weeks in duration, lacked an active comparator, and enrolled patients aged 6 years and older, so longer-term durability and comparative effectiveness remain to be fully characterized. Nonetheless, the short-term efficacy signal is robust and replicated across two identical phase 3 trials, which strengthens confidence in the findings [^3fa249a7] [^5cf6acfa].

> In summary, I should double-check that I've answered the question precisely. The key efficacy outcomes at week 4 in INTEGUMENT-2 were vIGA-AD success and EASI-75, both of which were statistically significant in favor of roflumilast cream 0.15% versus vehicle, with vIGA-AD success at 28.9% vs 12.0% (P < .001) and EASI-75 at 42.0% vs 19.7% (P < .001), accompanied by early-onset improvements in itch and global disease severity, confirming clinically meaningful benefit over vehicle at 4 weeks [^d11a0770] [^84b907f5] [^77db5237].

---

In INTEGUMENT-2, roflumilast cream 0.15% achieved **statistically significant superiority** over vehicle at week 4 on the primary endpoint (vIGA-AD success: 28.9% vs 12.0%; P < .001) [^d11a0770] and on the key secondary endpoint (EASI-75: 42.0% vs 19.7%; P < .001) [^d11a0770]. These results demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements in disease severity and pruritus, with a favorable tolerability profile [^5cf6acfa].

---

## Primary efficacy endpoint: vIGA-AD success at week 4

- **Definition**: vIGA-AD success is defined as a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) plus a ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline [^d11a0770].
- **Results**: 28.9% of patients in the roflumilast group achieved vIGA-AD success compared with 12.0% in the vehicle group (absolute difference, 16.5%; 95% CI, 6.71–26.29; P < .001) [^d11a0770] [^84b907f5].
- **Clinical significance**: This represents a 2.4-fold increase in the likelihood of achieving clear or almost clear skin with a ≥ 2-grade improvement, indicating substantial clinical benefit [^d11a0770].

---

## Key secondary efficacy endpoint: EASI-75 at week 4

- **Definition**: EASI-75 is defined as a ≥ 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index score from baseline [^d11a0770].
- **Results**: 42.0% of patients in the roflumilast group achieved EASI-75 compared with 19.7% in the vehicle group (absolute difference, 22.3%; 95% CI, 9.07–35.53; P < .001) [^d11a0770] [^84b907f5].
- **Clinical significance**: This indicates a significant reduction in disease burden, with more than twice as many patients achieving a ≥ 75% improvement in disease severity compared with vehicle [^d11a0770].

---

## Additional efficacy outcomes

- **Early improvement**: Statistically significant differences favoring roflumilast were observed as early as week 2 for vIGA-AD success (17.7% vs 5.3%; P < .001) [^d11a0770].
- **Pruritus improvement**: Significant improvements in pruritus were observed within 24 hours after the first application, with sustained benefits throughout the 4-week treatment period [^77db5237] [^1d93d28a].
- **Consistency**: The efficacy results were consistent across subgroups, including patients with moderate baseline disease severity (vIGA-AD score of 3) [^d11a0770].

---

## Statistical significance and clinical relevance

The primary and key secondary endpoints in INTEGUMENT-2 achieved **statistical significance** (P < .001), indicating robust evidence of efficacy [^d11a0770]. The magnitude of improvement (16.5% for vIGA-AD success and 22.3% for EASI-75) is clinically meaningful and aligns with the minimal clinically important difference established in atopic dermatitis trials [^notfound].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Roflumilast cream 0.15% was **well tolerated**, with low rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and minimal local irritation. The most common TEAEs were mild application-site pain, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea), which occurred at low frequencies and were generally self-limited [^14b94dcf] [^c0a79673].

---

In INTEGUMENT-2, roflumilast cream 0.15% demonstrated **statistically significant superiority** over vehicle at week 4 on both the primary (vIGA-AD success) and key secondary (EASI-75) endpoints, with early onset of benefit and a favorable tolerability profile [^d11a0770] [^5cf6acfa].

### Roflumilast cream, 0.15%, for atopic dermatitis in adults and children: INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 randomized clinical trials [^5cf6acfa]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Safe, effective, and well-tolerated topical treatment options available for long-term use in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are limited and associated with low adherence rates.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast cream, 0.15%, vs vehicle cream in patients with AD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials (Interventional Trial Evaluating Roflumilast Cream for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis 1 and 2 [INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2]), included patients from sites in the US, Canada, and Poland. Participants were 6 years or older with mild to moderate AD based on Validated Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (assessed on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 [clear] to 4 [severe]).

Intervention

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive roflumilast cream, 0.15%, or vehicle cream once daily for 4 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis success at week 4, defined as a score of 0 or 1 plus at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline. Secondary end points included Eczema Area and Severity Index and Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale. Safety and local tolerability were also evaluated.

Results

Among 1337 patients (654 patients in INTEGUMENT-1 and 683 patients in INTEGUMENT-2), the mean (SD) age was 27.7 (19.2) years, and 761 participants (56.9%) were female. The mean body surface area involved was 13.6% (SD = 11.6%; range, 3.0% to 88.0%). Significantly more patients treated with roflumilast than vehicle achieved the primary end point (INTEGUMENT-1: 32.0% vs 15.2%, respectively; P < .001; INTEGUMENT-2: 28.9% vs 12.0%, respectively; P < .001). At week 4, statistically significant differences favoring roflumilast also occurred for the achievement of at least 75% reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (INTEGUMENT-1: 43.2% vs 22.0%, respectively; P < .001; INTEGUMENT-2: 42.0% vs 19.7%, respectively; P < .001). Roflumilast was well tolerated with low rates of treatment-emergent adverse events. At each time point, investigators noted no signs of irritation at the application site in 885 patients who were treated with roflumilast (≥ 95%), and 885 patients who were treated with roflumilast (90%) reported no or mild sensation at the application site.

Conclusions and Relevance

In 2 phase 3 trials enrolling adults and children, once-daily roflumilast cream, 0.15%, improved AD relative to vehicle cream, based on multiple efficacy end points, with favorable safety and tolerability.

Efficacy Outcomes

In INTEGUMENT-1, 32.0% of patients treated with roflumilast and 15.2% of patients treated with vehicle achieved the primary end point of vIGA-AD success at week 4 (percent difference, 17.4%; P < .001; Figure 2). In INTEGUMENT-2, 28.9% of patients treated with roflumilast and 12.0% of patients treated with vehicle achieved the primary end point of vIGA-AD success at week 4 (percent difference, 16.5%; P < .001; Figure 2). At week 4, vIGA-AD success was consistently higher for patients treated with roflumilast than for patients treated with vehicle across all age groups and in those with baseline vIGA-AD of 3 (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).

Figure 2.
Percentage of Patients Achieving vIGA-AD Success and at Least 75% Improvement in EASI Score

Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) was evaluated on a 5-point scale: 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), and 4 (severe). vIGA-AD success was defined as a score of 0 or 1 plus at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline. EASI-75 indicates at least a 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index score from baseline.

a P values are nominal.

Statistically significant differences were also observed between the roflumilast and vehicle groups for vIGA-AD success at weeks 1 and 2 in INTEGUMENT-1 (week 1: 8.1% of patients vs 0.5% of patients; P < .001; week 2: 21.2% of patients vs 6.4% of patients; P < .001; Figure 2) and week 2 in INTEGUMENT-2 (17.7% of patients vs 5.3% of patients; P < .001; Figure 2). In both trials, more patients treated with roflumilast cream than patients treated with vehicle cream achieved EASI-75 (Figure 2) and vIGA-AD 0/1 (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2) at weeks 1, 2, and 4. Differences in the least squares mean percentage change from baseline in EASI also favored roflumilast cream (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2).

Statistical Analysis

A sample size of 650 participants was planned for each trial. This provided approximately 95% power to detect an overall 15% difference between the treatment groups on vIGA-AD success at week 4 at α < .05 using a 2-sided stratified (vIGA-AD at randomization and trial site) Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. The 15% treatment difference was based on the phase 2 trial results. If the primary end point was statistically significant, the hierarchy of secondary end points was inferentially tested (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).

Primary and secondary efficacy analyses used the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (defined as all randomized patients) with 2 exceptions: (1) vIGA-AD success at week 4 used the subset of patients from the ITT population with vIGA-AD score of 3 at randomization, and (2) WI-NRS success at all time points used the subset of the ITT population 12 years or older with baseline WI-NRS score of at least 4. The safety population comprised all patients who received at least 1 confirmed application of the investigational product.

The primary end point of vIGA-AD success at week 4 was analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by trial site and baseline vIGA-AD score; the multiple imputation method was used to handle missing data. Patients who discontinued treatment because of AEs or lack of efficacy were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. SAS statistical software, version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute Inc), was used to perform all statistical analyses. Statistical assessments are detailed further in the eMethods in Supplement 2.

Discussion

Once-daily, nonsteroidal roflumilast cream, 0.15%, improved mild to moderate AD in 2 phase 3 randomized clinical trials, in which the results were highly consistent. Patients treated with roflumilast cream, 0.15%, achieved the primary end point of vIGA-AD success at week 4 significantly more than patients treated with vehicle cream, with similar results observed for children, adolescents, and adults. Significant improvements were observed in vIGA-AD success by week 1 in INTEGUMENT-1 and week 2 in INTEGUMENT-2. Differences in EASI-75 at weeks 1, 2, and 4 also favored roflumilast. The achievement of primary and secondary end points at 4 weeks, with statistically significant differences observed at weeks 1 and 2, is notable given that many trials of topical treatments for AD have primary end points at 12 weeks. While the improvements at 4 weeks are clinically meaningful, longer-duration clinical studies are required to evaluate the benefit of chronic administration.

Improvement in itch is crucial as it is the most common and burdensome symptom of AD and negatively impacts the patient's quality of life. Statistically significantly more patients treated with roflumilast cream than patients treated with vehicle cream with baseline WI-NRS of 4 or more achieved at least a 4-point reduction at weeks 1, 2, and 4 in both trials. Notably, itch improved with roflumilast treatment as compared with vehicle treatment at 24 hours after the first application. Although the mechanism by which PDE4 inhibition reduces itch is unknown, it may be related to reduced proinflammatory mediators by lesional immune infiltrates, specifically type 2 cytokines that promote itch. Furthermore, PDE4 inhibition has an antipruritic effect in mouse models of dermatoses that is distinct from the anti-inflammatory effect, possibly mediated by direct suppression of C-fibers responsible for itch perception.

Key Points

Question

What is the efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast cream, 0.15%, in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD)?

Findings

In 2 phase 3 randomized clinical trials of 1337 individuals with AD, significantly more patients treated with once-daily roflumilast cream, 0.15%, achieved Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis success at 4 weeks than patients treated with vehicle cream. Roflumilast was well tolerated with low rates of adverse events in both trials.

Meaning

An effective, well-tolerated, once-daily, nonsteroidal treatment like roflumilast cream, 0.15%, may address several unmet needs and substantially improve the treatment landscape for patients with AD.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.05% in pediatric patients aged 2–5 Years with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (INTEGUMENT-PED): a phase 3 randomized controlled trial [^d63d4931]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Once‐daily roflumilast cream 0.05% significantly improved AD signs and symptoms in pediatric patients aged 2–5 years, with significant improvement in vIGA‐AD observed as early as the first timepoint (1 week after treatment initiation) and improvement in pruritus within the first 24 h. The efficacy and safety observed here (vIGA‐AD Success at Week 4, 25.4% [roflumilast] vs. 10.7% [vehicle]; EASI‐75 at Week 4, 39.4% vs. 20.6%) were consistent with previous trials of roflumilast cream 0.15% in patients aged ≥ 6 years with AD (INTEGUMENT‐1/2; vIGA‐AD Success at Week 4, 28.9%–32.0% vs. 12.0%–15.2%; EASI‐75 at Week 4, 42.0%–43.0% vs. 19.7%–21.3%).

In the current trial, greater proportions of patients treated with roflumilast versus vehicle achieved EASI‐75 and vIGA‐AD Success at Weeks 1, 2, and 4. Notably, in the INTEGUMENT‐OLE trial, roflumilast cream 0.15% demonstrated continued improvement of AD in patients aged ≥ 6 years, with 61.3% and 65.7% of patients achieving EASI‐75 and 44.6% and 49.0% of patients achieving vIGA‐AD Success after 24 and 52 weeks, respectively. Therefore, a longer duration of treatment in patients aged 2–5 years may lead to a greater EASI‐75 response, similar to that observed in patients aged ≥ 6 years who participated in the INTEGUMENT‐OLE trial.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 were identical, parallel-group, double-blind, vehicle-controlled randomized trials conducted at 65 and 88 centers, respectively, in the US, Canada, and Poland (see Supplement 1 for trial protocols and statistical analysis plans). The protocols were approved by the Advarra Institutional Review Board. The trials were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Tri-Council Policy Statement, the ethical principles in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation.

All patients provided written informed consent/assent (guardians provided consent when applicable) before initiating trial-specific procedures. Patients eligible for inclusion were 6 years or older, had a history of AD (≥ 6 months for adults and ≥ 3 months for children and adolescents), and were in otherwise good health. At baseline, patients had to have an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)score of at least 5, Validated Investigator Global Assessment for AD (vIGA-AD; eTable 1 in Supplement 2)score of 2 (mild) or 3 (moderate), and AD involving at least 3% BSA with no upper limit.

3.2 Efficacy

Patients in the roflumilast group demonstrated early and continued improvements in AD signs and symptoms compared with the vehicle group (Figure S1). A significantly greater proportion of the roflumilast group achieved vIGA‐AD Success at Week 4 (primary endpoint) versus the vehicle group (25.4% vs. 10.7%; p < 0.0001), with significant differences observed at the earliest timepoint (Week 1; Figure 2a). Greater proportions of the roflumilast group achieved Week‐4 vIGA‐AD 0/1 (35.4% vs. 14.6%; p < 0.0001; Figure 2b) and EASI‐75 (39.4% vs. 20.6%, p < 0.0001; Figure 2c), with 19.2% of patients achieving EASI‐75 by Week 1. In patients with vIGA‐AD of Moderate at baseline, a greater proportion of patients in the roflumilast group achieved vIGA‐AD Success (27.7% vs. 11.0%; p < 0.0001; Figure S2). Among patients with baseline WI‐NRS ≥ 4, 35.3% of the roflumilast group and 18.0% of the vehicle group achieved WI‐NRS Success at Week 4 (nominal p = 0.0002; Figure 2d). Starting within 24 h after initial application, the roflumilast group had a significantly greater reduction in pruritus compared with the vehicle group (nominal p ≤ 0.0014; Figure 3).

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.05% in pediatric patients aged 2–5 Years with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (INTEGUMENT-PED): a phase 3 randomized controlled trial [^1f6e6160]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background/Objectives

Efficacy and safety of roflumilast cream 0.15% were demonstrated in patients aged ≥ 6 years with atopic dermatitis (AD) in two Phase 3 trials. This Phase 3 parallel‐group, double‐blind trial (INTEGUMENT‐PED; NCT04845620) compared the efficacy and safety of roflumilast cream 0.05% and a vehicle in patients aged 2–5 years with AD.

Methods

Patients aged 2–5 years with mild‐to‐moderate AD were treated with once‐daily roflumilast cream 0.05% or vehicle for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was Validated Investigator Global Assessment for AD (vIGA‐AD) Success (0 [Clear] or 1 [Almost Clear] plus ≥ 2‐grade improvement from baseline) at Week 4. Other endpoints included ≥ 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI‐75) and Worst Itch‐Numeric Rating Score (WI‐NRS) Success (≥ 4‐point improvement in patients with baseline ≥ 4). Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

Results

Among 437 and 215 patients treated with roflumilast and vehicle, respectively, significantly greater proportions of the roflumilast group achieved Week‐4 vIGA‐AD Success (25.4% vs. 10.7%; p < 0.0001), EASI‐75 (39.4% vs. 20.6%; p < 0.0001), and WI‐NRS Success (35.3% vs. 18.0%; nominal p = 0.0002). Improvement in pruritus was observed within 24 h after the first application (nominal p = 0.0014). Treatment‐emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates were low in both groups, and 98.9% were mild or moderate. At all timepoints, stinging/burning that caused definite discomfort was reported by ≤ 0.7% of caregivers of patients in the roflumilast group.

Conclusions

In this Phase 3 trial, once‐daily roflumilast cream 0.05% improved AD signs/symptoms in patients aged 2–5 years, with early pruritus improvement, low AE rates, and local tolerability comparable with vehicle.

Topical Roflumilast Cream

Roflumilast cream completed phase III studies for plaque psoriasis, but its clinical investigation for AD is not far behind. A phase II, proof-of-concept study for roflumilast cream involved a small number of AD patients (n = 136) with 1.5–35% BSA, validated IGA (vIGA) 2–3, and EASI score ≥ 5 randomized to roflumilast 0.15%, 0.05%, or vehicle once daily for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was absolute change from baseline in EASI score at week 4. Results at EOT showed a trend towards this endpoint but did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to the small sample size. Nevertheless, other efficacy endpoints for roflumilast cream 0.15% reached statistical significance at week 4, such as 72.3% EASI improvement and > 50% of patients achieving clear or almost clear skin on vIGA-AD. This study also showed that roflumilast cream was well-tolerated, with a low rate of application site reactions. Despite the lack of statistical significance in reaching the primary endpoint, the favorable safety profile and encouraging efficacy results warranted further investigation of roflumilast cream for the treatment of AD in Arcutis's phase III trial. The "INterventional Trial EvaluatinG roflUMilast cream for the treatmENt of aTopic dermatitis", or INTEGUMENT, is a set of double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials in which roflumilast cream or vehicle is applied once daily for 4 weeks to patients with mild-to-moderate AD involving ≥ 3% BSA. The parallel INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 trials investigating roflumilast cream 0.15% in patients ≥ 6 years of age were initiated in February 2021. INTEGUMENT-PED, the clinical trial investigating the lower dose of roflumilast 0.05% in pediatric patients between the ages of 2 and 5 years old, was initiated in April 2021. In these phase III trials, participants are randomized 2:1 to roflumilast cream (0.15% for ages ≥ 6 years or 0.05% for ages < 6 years) or vehicle. The primary endpoint is defined as a vIGA-AD score of 'clear' or 'almost clear' plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline at week 4.

Trial Treatments

Roflumilast, 0.15%, was formulated as an emollient, water-based, moisturizing cream. The cream did not contain fragrances, propylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, or formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. The vehicle cream was identical to roflumilast cream excluding roflumilast. Patients received 45-gram tubes of their assigned treatment (roflumilast cream, 0.15%, or vehicle cream). Investigators used the percentage of BSA involved to determine the number of tubes to dispense to each patient. Patients and caregivers were to apply the assigned treatment to all areas identified at baseline and new lesions that developed during the trial once daily for 4 weeks, even if areas cleared. Palms and soles could be treated with the assigned treatment but were not counted toward efficacy assessments. The scalp was neither treated nor assessed. Nonmedicated emollients or moisturizers could be applied once daily but only to untreated areas of the patient's skin.

Patients were randomized via an interactive online system to roflumilast cream, 0.15%, or vehicle cream in a 2:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomization list stratified by vIGA-AD score (2 vs 3) and trial site. The sponsor, patients and caregivers, and assessors of end points were unaware of the patients' group assignments.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.05% in pediatric patients aged 2–5 Years with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (INTEGUMENT-PED): a phase 3 randomized controlled trial [^4fad835e]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Greater proportions of those treated with roflumilast also achieved WI‐NRS Success at Weeks 1, 2, and 4, with significant reductions in pruritus observed within 24 h following the first application. These results are similar to INTEGUMENT‐1/2, where 30%–34% of the roflumilast group achieved WI‐NRS Success versus 12%–21% of the vehicle group at Week 4, also with pruritus reduction by 24 h. Rapid improvement of pruritus is particularly important because of the significant impact pruritus has on quality of life. Pruritus also impairs patients' sleep, which can impact caregiver and family quality of life by disrupting sleep for other members of the household leading to reduced family function and increased stress. Caregivers' fears about topical corticosteroids may also increase stress and undertreatment of the patients' AD. Taken together, this suggests that nonsteroidal treatments may improve caregiver and family quality of life as well.

The incidence of TEAEs was low in both groups, and 98.9% of TEAEs were mild or moderate. Diarrhea and vomiting, AEs associated with oral PDE4 inhibitors, were reported for ≤ 2.5% of patients treated with roflumilast; all were mild and resolved, and none led to discontinuation. The benefit–risk and local tolerability profiles of roflumilast cream 0.05% in patients aged 2–5 years were favorable and consistent with that observed in trials of roflumilast cream 0.15% in patients aged ≥ 6 years.

A limitation of the current trial was the short duration (4 weeks); however, a long‐term trial of roflumilast cream in adults and pediatric patients with AD (INTEGUMENT‐OLE), including patients aged 2–5 years with AD, will report long‐term safety and effectiveness through an additional 52 weeks, including for twice‐weekly application to flare‐prone normal‐appearing skin to prevent flares. Other limitations include the lack of an active comparator, WI‐NRS scale not being validated in patients aged 2–5 years, and reliance on caregiver assessments of pruritus and local tolerability. Of note, both the pruritus and local tolerability data in this trial were consistent with the results seen in INTEGUMENT‐1/2.

The study INTEGUMENT-2 was published by Eric L Simpson and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Dermatol. This study is related to the following diseases: Atopic dermatitis. In the INTEGUMENT-2 study, the trial question was: what is the role of roflumilast cream in patients with atopic dermatitis? In the INTEGUMENT-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the INTEGUMENT-2 study, the population was: 683 patients (395 female, 288 male). The inclusion criteria were patients ≥ 6 years with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. The key exclusion criteria were inability to discontinue treatment with therapies for atopic dermatitis before the baseline visit and during the trial; planned excessive exposure of treated area to natural or artificial sunlight, tanning bed, or other light emitting device; previous treatment with roflumilast cream or foam; treatment with oral roflumilast in the past 4 weeks. In the INTEGUMENT-2 study, the interventions were: n = 451 roflumilast cream (0.15% cream once daily for 4 weeks) n = 232 vehicle cream (placebo cream once daily for 4 weeks). In the INTEGUMENT-2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis success at week 4 (28.9% vs. 12%; AD 16.5%, 95% CI 6.71 to 26.29). In the INTEGUMENT-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis success at week 4 in patients with baseline Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis score of 3 (32.9% vs. 13.1%; AD 19.1%, 95% CI 7.77 to 30.43) Significant increase in achievement of at least 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index at week 4 (42% vs. 19.7%; AD 22.3%, 95% CI 9.07 to 35.53) Significant increase in Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis success at week 2 (17.7% vs. 5.3%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 5.04 to 19.76). In the INTEGUMENT-2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in treatment-related adverse events, treatment-emergent adverse events. In the INTEGUMENT-2 study, the conclusion was: in patients ≥ 6 years with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, roflumilast cream was superior to vehicle cream with respect to Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis success at week 4.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.05% in pediatric patients aged 2–5 Years with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (INTEGUMENT-PED): a phase 3 randomized controlled trial [^4af0bc78]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Efficacy and safety of roflumilast cream 0.15% were demonstrated in patients aged ≥ 6years with atopic dermatitis (AD) in two Phase 3 trials. This Phase 3 parallel-group, double-blind trial (INTEGUMENT-PED; NCT04845620) compared the efficacy and safety of roflumilast cream 0.05% and a vehicle in patients aged 2-5years with AD.

Methods

Patients aged 2-5years with mild-to-moderate AD were treated with once-daily roflumilast cream 0.05% or vehicle for 4weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was Validated Investigator Global Assessment for AD (vIGA-AD) Success (0 [Clear] or 1 [Almost Clear] plus ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline) at Week 4. Other endpoints included ≥ 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) and Worst Itch-Numeric Rating Score (WI-NRS) Success (≥ 4-point improvement in patients with baseline ≥ 4). Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

Results

Among 437 and 215 patients treated with roflumilast and vehicle, respectively, significantly greater proportions of the roflumilast group achieved Week-4 vIGA-AD Success (25.4% vs. 10.7%; p < 0.0001), EASI-75 (39.4% vs. 20.6%; p < 0.0001), and WI-NRS Success (35.3% vs. 18.0%; nominal p = 0.0002). Improvement in pruritus was observed within 24h after the first application (nominal p = 0.0014). Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates were low in both groups, and 98.9% were mild or moderate. At all timepoints, stinging/burning that caused definite discomfort was reported by ≤ 0.7% of caregivers of patients in the roflumilast group.

Conclusions

In this Phase 3 trial, once-daily roflumilast cream 0.05% improved AD signs/symptoms in patients aged 2-5years, with early pruritus improvement, low AE rates, and local tolerability comparable with vehicle.

### Roflumilast cream, 0.15%, for atopic dermatitis in adults and children: INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 randomized clinical trials [^d8173304]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 phase 3 randomized clinical trials of patients with AD treated with roflumilast cream, 0.15%, demonstrated improvement across multiple efficacy end points, including reducing pruritus within 24 hours after application, with favorable safety and tolerability. This once-daily nonsteroidal cream addresses several unmet needs in the treatment of AD and thus has the potential to substantially improve treatment. Additional research, including subgroup analyses, will provide more data regarding the efficacy and safety of roflumilast cream, 0.15%, in patients with AD.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Trial Design

INTEGUMENT‐PED was a 4‐week, Phase 3, parallel‐group, double‐blind, vehicle‐controlled trial enrolling patients aged 2–5 years (at informed consent/baseline) with a history of mild‐to‐moderate AD (vIGA‐AD of 2 [Mild] or 3 [Moderate]), EASI ≥ 5, affected BSA ≥ 3%, duration of AD ≥ 6 weeks, and stable disease for the previous 4 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to once‐daily roflumilast cream 0.05% or vehicle cream. The trial was conducted between March 31, 2021 and June 1, 2023 at 109 sites in the United States, Canada, and Poland in accordance with principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation, and was registered on(NCT04845620). Before enrollment, the protocol and informed consent forms were reviewed and approved by appropriate institutional review boards or independent ethics committees. All guardians provided written informed consent before treatment initiation or any study‐related procedures. See Supporting Information for information regarding protocol amendments.

Randomization was stratified by vIGA‐AD at baseline (Mild or Moderate) and trial site. Kits containing tubes of trial medication were assigned to each patient using an internet‐based response system, with the number of kits assigned based on the affected BSA. Kits and tubes were blinded, and each kit was uniquely numbered.

Study site staff instructed caregivers to apply the trial treatment once daily to all affected areas (even if affected areas cleared) and any new areas affected by AD, except the scalp, for 28 days. AD on palms and soles was treated, but not included in efficacy evaluations. See Supporting Information and Table S1 for information about excluded medications and emollient use.

### Effect of roflumilast cream vs vehicle cream on chronic plaque psoriasis: the DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2 randomized clinical trials [^862cc84e]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Once-daily roflumilast cream, 0.3%, a potent phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated in a phase 2b trial of patients with psoriasis.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of roflumilast cream, 0.3%, applied once daily for 8 weeks in 2 trials of patients with plaque psoriasis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter trials (DERMIS-1 [trial 1; n = 439] and DERMIS-2 [trial 2; n = 442]) were conducted at 40 centers (trial 1) and 39 centers (trial 2) in the US and Canada between December 9, 2019, and November 16, 2020, and between December 9, 2019, and November 23, 2020, respectively. Patients aged 2 years or older with plaque psoriasis involving 2% to 20% of body surface area were enrolled. The dates of final follow-up were November 20, 2020, and November 23, 2020, for trial 1 and trial 2, respectively.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive roflumilast cream, 0.3% (trial 1: n = 286; trial 2: n = 290), or vehicle cream (trial 1: n = 153; trial 2: n = 152) once daily for 8 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) success (clear or almost clear status plus ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline [score range, 0–4]) at week 8, analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by site, baseline IGA score, and intertriginous involvement. There were 9 secondary outcomes, including intertriginous IGA success, 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score, and Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale score of 4 or higher at baseline achieving 4-point reduction (WI-NRS success) at week 8 (scale: 0 [no itch] to 10 [worst imaginable itch]; minimum clinically important difference, 4 points).

Results

Among 881 participants (mean age, 47.5 years; 320 [36.3%] female), mean IGA scores in trial 1 were 2.9 [SD, 0.52] for roflumilast and 2.9 [SD, 0.45] for vehicle and in trial 2 were 2.9 [SD, 0.48] for roflumilast and 2.9 [SD, 0.47]) for vehicle. Statistically significantly greater percentages of roflumilast-treated patients than vehicle-treated patients had IGA success at week 8 (trial 1: 42.4% vs 6.1%; difference, 39.6% [95% CI, 32.3%-46.9%]; trial 2: 37.5% vs 6.9%; difference, 28.9% [95% CI, 20.8%-36.9%]; P < .001 for both). Of 9 secondary end points, statistically significant differences favoring roflumilast vs vehicle were observed for 8 in trial 1 and 9 in trial 2, including intertriginous IGA success (71.2% vs 13.8%; difference, 66.5% [95% CI, 47.1%-85.8%] and 68.1% vs 18.5%; difference, 51.6% [95% CI, 29.3%-73.8%]; P < .001 for both), 75% reduction in PASI score (41.6% vs 7.6%; difference, 36.1% [95% CI, 28.5%-43.8%] and 39.0% vs 5.3%; difference, 32.4% [95% CI, 24.9%-39.8%]; P < .001 for both), WI-NRS success (67.5% vs 26.8%; difference, 42.6% [95% CI, 31.3%-53.8%] and 69.4% vs 35.6%; difference, 30.2% [95% CI, 18.2%-42.2%]; P < .001 for both). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 25.2% with roflumilast vs 23.5% with vehicle in trial 1 and 25.9% with roflumilast vs 18.4% with vehicle in trial 2. The incidence of serious adverse events was 0.7% with roflumilast vs 0.7% with vehicle in trial 1 and 0% with roflumilast vs 0.7% with vehicle in trial 2.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, treatment with roflumilast cream, 0.3%, compared with vehicle cream resulted in better clinical status at 8 weeks. Further research is needed to assess efficacy compared with other active treatments and to assess longer-term efficacy and safety.

### Roflumilast cream improves signs and symptoms of plaque psoriasis: results from a phase 1 / 2a randomized, controlled study [^61cfda3e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Roflumilast cream (ARQ-151) is a highly potent, selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor in development for once-daily topical treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.5% and 0.15% in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Methods: This phase 1/2a study enrolled a single-dose, open-label cohort (Cohort 1: 0.5% cream applied to 25 cm² psoriatic plaques), and a 28-day, double-blinded cohort (Cohort 2: 1:1:1 randomization to roflumilast cream 0.5%, 0.15%, or vehicle). Patients had chronic plaque psoriasis of > 6 months' duration with ≤ 5% body surface area involvement. Outcomes included safety (adverse events) and efficacy (percentage change in the Target Plaque Severity Score [TPSS] × Target Plaque Area [TPA]) at week 4. Results: For Cohorts 1 (n = 8) and 2 (n = 89), adverse events (all mild/moderate; none severe or serious) were similar between active arms and vehicle. Treatment-related events were confined to the application site, without differences between drug and vehicle. No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The primary efficacy endpoint was met for both roflumilast cream doses: TPSS×TPA improvement at week 4 was statistically significant for roflumilast 0.5% (P = 0.0007) and 0.15% (P = 0.0011) versus vehicle; significance was reached as early as 2 weeks. For both roflumilast cream doses, 66%-67% improvement from baseline was observed at week 4, without reaching a plateau, versus 38% improvement for vehicle. Conclusion: Roflumilast cream was safe and highly effective at doses of 0.5% and 0.15% and represents a potential novel once-daily topical therapy for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.05% in pediatric patients aged 2–5 Years with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (INTEGUMENT-PED): a phase 3 randomized controlled trial [^2b5349bf]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, once‐daily roflumilast cream 0.05% significantly improved multiple efficacy measures of AD in patients aged 2–5 years, including a reduction in pruritus within 24 h after the first application. These results were similar to the results seen in the INTEGUMENT‐1/2 trials in patients aged ≥ 6 years. In addition, roflumilast cream 0.05% was well tolerated with low rates of AEs in both groups. Furthermore, application site pain, stinging, and burning were reported for smaller proportions of patients in the roflumilast group compared with the vehicle group. These results suggest roflumilast cream 0.05% may provide a novel topical treatment option for patients aged 2–5 years with mild‐to‐moderate AD.

### Roflumilast cream, 0.15%, for atopic dermatitis in adults and children: INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 randomized clinical trials [^14b94dcf]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Safety Outcomes

Roflumilast was well tolerated with a low incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and treatment-related TEAEs in the roflumilast and vehicle groups in both trials (Table). A treatment-related TEAE was defined as any TEAE that was assessed by the investigator as likely, probably, or possibly related to the study treatment. Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. Four patients (0.9%) treated with roflumilast in each trial experienced serious TEAEs, with 1 serious AE deemed possibly related to treatment and 1 probably related to treatment (Table). Overall, TEAEs leading to discontinuation ranged from 2 patients (0.9%) to 8 patients (1.8%) across both groups and trials (Table).

Adverse Event Profiles for Roflumilast and Vehicle Groups in INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 a

Abbreviations: INTEGUMENT, Interventional Trial Evaluating Roflumilast Cream for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis; TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event.

At each time point, more than 95% of patients treated with roflumilast had a score of no signs of irritation (0) on investigator-rated local tolerability assessments, and more than 90% reported no (0) or mild (1) sensation on patient-rated local tolerability assessments (including on application day 1; eFigure 4 in Supplement 2). Across both trials, of the 98 patients with previous inadequate response, intolerance, or contraindication to crisaborole, 47 patients (34 patients treated with roflumilast; 13 patients treated with vehicle) had previously stopped crisaborole because of stinging, burning, and/or poor tolerability. None of these patients developed application-site AEs during roflumilast or vehicle treatment in these trials. Additional safety details are in the eMethods in Supplement 2.

Similar results were observed for scaling success, with statistically significant differences favoring roflumilast at all time points (week 2: 26.5% vs 14.7%; absolute difference, 11.8% [95% CI, −0.3% to 21.8%]; week 4: 41.3% vs 21.0%; absolute difference, 20.4% [95% CI, 6.8%-31.8%]; week 8: 56.0% vs 27.2%; absolute difference, 28.8% [95% CI, 14.4%-41.0%]; P ≤ .08; eFigure 3 in Supplement 3). A statistically significant increase in percentages of roflumilast-treated patients achieving a scaling score of 0 occurred at all time points (week 2: 22.5% vs 8.8%; absolute difference, 13.7% [95% CI, 2.8%-22.4%]; week 4: 37.8% vs 14.9%; absolute difference, 22.8% [95% CI, 10.0%-33.3%]; week 8: 49.6% vs 24.2%; absolute difference, 25.4% [95% CI, 11.3%-37.3%]; eFigure 3 in Supplement 3). Patients treated with roflumilast foam, 0.3%, demonstrated a greater mean (SD) change from baseline scaling score at weeks 2, 4, and 8 (−1.0 [0.77], −1.3 [0.76], and −1.5 [0.75], respectively) compared with vehicle-treated patients (−0.6 [0.78], −0.8 [0.81], and −1.0 [0.83], respectively; P < .001 for each week).

2.2 Endpoints

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving vIGA‐AD Success at Week 4. Other endpoints were proportions of patients with vIGA‐AD Success at Weeks 1 and 2; vIGA‐AD Success at Week 4 among patients with vIGA‐AD of Moderate at randomization; vIGA‐AD 0/1 at Weeks 1, 2, and 4; EASI‐75 at Week 4; and Worst Itch‐Numeric Rating Scale (WI‐NRS) Success (≥ 4‐point improvement from baseline among patients with WI‐NRS ≥ 4 at baseline) at Week 4. See Supporting Information for additional information about endpoint measures.

Safety was monitored through adverse events (AEs), local tolerability assessments, vital signs, and physical examination. Investigator‐rated application site reactions (rated from 0 [no evidence of irritation] to 7 [strong reaction spreading beyond application site]) were recorded before trial drug application on Day 1 and Weeks 1, 2, and 4. Caregiver‐rated tolerability assessments were completed 10–15 min post‐drug application on Day 1 and Weeks 1, 2, and 4 on a 0 (none) to 3 (burning / stinging that caused definite discomfort) scale.

2.3 Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4 or later (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC). A sample size of 650 patients was planned, providing > 90% power to detect a 15% difference between treatment groups in vIGA‐AD Success rates at Week 4 at α = 0.025 using a two‐sided stratified Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test.

### The safety and efficacy of roflumilast cream 0.15% and 0.05% in patients with atopic dermatitis: randomized, double-blind, phase 2 proof of concept study [^bf541036]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) need safe and effective topical treatments.

Objective

To assess safety and efficacy of roflumilast cream in patients with mild to moderate AD.

Methods

In this phase 2, proof of concept trial, patients (N = 136) aged &ge;12 years with AD were randomized to once-daily roflumilast cream 0.15%, roflumilast cream 0.05%, or vehicle cream for 4 weeks. Absolute change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score at week 4 (primary endpoint), percentage change and responder rates, Validated Investigator Global Assessment-AD (vIGA-AD), and safety were assessed.

Results

At week 4, mean absolute changes in EASI were &minus;6.4 (P = 0.097 vs vehicle), &minus;6.0 (P = 0.356), and &minus;4.8 with roflumilast 0.15%, roflumilast 0.05%, and vehicle, respectively. Significant improvements were observed for percentage change from baseline in EASI, patients reaching 75% improvement in EASI, and patients achieving vIGA-AD score of &ldquo; clear&rdquo; or &ldquo; almost clear.&rdquo; Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 2 (2.2%) patients receiving roflumilast (mild rash and moderate application site pain). Only 1 (1.1%) patient receiving roflumilast discontinued study/drug due to an AE.

Limitations

Small number of patients.

Conclusions

Results support additional larger clinical trials of roflumilast cream to assess its potential as a once-daily, nonsteroidal topical AD treatment.

Patients receiving roflumilast experienced greater improvements in WI-NRS score compared with those receiving the vehicle foam. At week 2, mean (SD) change from baseline in the roflumilast group was −3.0 (2.8), a 47.2% (51.7%) decrease, vs −1.7 (2.1) with vehicle, a 30.9% (40.1%) decrease. Change at week 4 in the roflumilast group was −3.5 (2.7), a reduction of 56.7% (44.6%), and −1.9 (2.2), a reduction of 35.7% (39.9%), for the vehicle group. At week 8, mean (SD) change was −3.7 (2.8) for the roflumilast group and −2.0 (2.4) for the vehicle group, reductions of 59.3% (52.5%) and 36.6% (42.2%), respectively (P < .001). The percentage of patients who achieved WI-NRS success was greater in the roflumilast group at weeks 2, 4, and 8 (Figure 3). At week 8, 73 (64.6%) roflumilast-treated patients achieved WI-NRS success compared with 18 (34.0%) vehicle-treated patients (absolute difference, 30.6% [95% CI, 14.4%-44.6%]).

Efficacy

For the primary end point of IGA score of 0 or 1 at week 8, a statistically significant higher number of roflumilast-treated patients (104 [73.8%]) achieved IGA success compared with vehicle-treated patients (27 [40.9%]; absolute difference, 32.8% [95% CI, 18.5%-45.7%]; P < .001; Figure 2). The small number of patients with severe disease at baseline showed similar results, with 6 of 10 roflumilast-treated patients achieving IGA score of 0 or 1 vs 0 of 3 vehicle-treated patients. At week 8, 50 (35.5%) roflumilast-treated patients achieved IGA of clear, and 54 (38.3%) achieved IGA of almost clear, compared with 10 (15.2%) and 17 patients (25.8%), respectively, in the vehicle group. Differences in percentages of patients achieving IGA score of 0 or 1 at week 2 (the first posttreatment assessment) and week 4 were statistically significant in favor of roflumilast (week 2: 33.8% vs 14.7%; absolute difference, 19.1% [95% CI, 6.6%-29.3%]; P = 0.003; week 4: 56.6% vs 28.4%; absolute difference, 28.3% [95% CI, 14.0%-40.5%]; P < .001; Figure 2).

Methods

Study Design

Full details about the methods, design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the primary efficacy and safety outcomes for this parallel-group, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial have been published previously. The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation and is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03638258). Before enrollment of patients, the study protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved by an appropriate Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee. All patients provided written informed consent before screening.

Patients were randomized to roflumilast 0.3% cream, roflumilast 0.15% cream, or vehicle in a 1:1:1 ratio via a computer-generated list. Roflumilast cream or vehicle was applied once-daily to all psoriasis lesions for 12 weeks. Palms and soles of the feet were treated but not included in any measurements of efficacy.

Patients

Eligible patients were males and females aged ≥ 18 years who had plaque psoriasis of at least mild severity affecting 2–20% body surface area (excluding the scalp, palms, and soles). At screening, patients had to have a score ≥ 2 on the IGA (a 5-point scale assessing plaque thickening, scaling, and erythema ranging from 0 [clear] to 4 [severe]) and ≥ 2 on a modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-HD, which combines severity of lesions and area affected, ranging from 0 [no disease] to 72 [maximal disease], with the actual percentage of the anatomical area involved in those patients with < 10% of anatomical area involved [e.g. 0.1 for 1% to 0.9 for 9%]).

Key exclusion criteria were excessive exposure of treated areas to natural or artificial sunlight, tanning bed, or other light emitting device; diagnosis of guttate, erythrodermic/exfoliative, palmoplantar involvement only, or pustular psoriasis; and use of oral roflumilast or other PDE-4 inhibitors within the previous 4 weeks.

### Trial of roflumilast cream for chronic plaque psoriasis [^5af05d3f]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Systemic oral phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE-4) inhibitors have been effective in the treatment of psoriasis. Roflumilast cream contains a PDE-4 inhibitor that is being investigated for the topical treatment of psoriasis.

Methods

In this phase 2b, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adults with plaque psoriasis in a 1:1:1 ratio to use roflumilast 0.3% cream, roflumilast 0.15% cream, or vehicle (placebo) cream once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the investigator's global assessment (IGA) of a status of clear or almost clear at week 6 (assessed on a 5-point scale of plaque thickening, scaling, and erythema; a score of 0 indicates clear, 1 almost clear, and 4 severe). Secondary outcomes included an IGA score indicating clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement in the IGA score for the intertriginous area and the change in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (range, 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating worse disease). Safety was also assessed.

Results

Among 331 patients who underwent randomization, 109 were assigned to roflumilast 0.3% cream, 113 to roflumilast 0.15% cream, and 109 to vehicle cream. An IGA score indicating clear or almost clear at week 6 was observed in 28% of the patients in the roflumilast 0.3% group, in 23% in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and in 8% in the vehicle group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004 vs. vehicle for roflumilast 0.3% and 0.15%, respectively). Among the approximately 15% of patients overall who had baseline intertriginous psoriasis of at least mild severity, an IGA score at week 6 indicating clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement in the intertriginous-area IGA score occurred in 73% of the patients in the roflumilast 0.3% group, 44% of those in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and 29% of those in the vehicle group. The mean baseline PASI scores were 7.7 in the roflumilast 0.3% group, 8.0 in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and 7.6 in the vehicle group; the mean change from baseline at week 6 was -50.0%, -49.0%, and -17.8%, respectively. Application-site reactions occurred with similar frequency in the roflumilast groups and the vehicle group.

Conclusions

Roflumilast cream administered once daily to affected areas of psoriasis was superior to vehicle cream in leading to a state of clear or almost clear at 6 weeks. Longer and larger trials are needed to determine the durability and safety of roflumilast in psoriasis. (Funded by Arcutis Biotherapeutics; ARQ-151 201 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03638258.).

### Roflumilast cream, 0.15%, for atopic dermatitis in adults and children: INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 randomized clinical trials [^e7f40c66]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Roflumilast cream, 0.3%, is a highly potent, once-daily topical PDE4 inhibitor approved to treat plaque psoriasis, including intertriginous psoriasis. Clinical trials have been conducted with topical roflumilast foam, 0.3%, to treat patients with plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body and seborrheic dermatitis, and roflumilast cream, 0.15%, and roflumilast cream, 0.05%, to treat patients with AD. Structural and computational biology assessments demonstrate that roflumilast more closely mimics cyclic adenosine monophosphate compared with other PDE4 inhibitors, resulting in high affinity for PDE4. Depending on the isoform tested, roflumilast demonstrated approximately 25-fold to more than 300-fold more potency than apremilast and crisaborole in vitro, the 2 other PDE4 inhibitors (oral or topical) approved for dermatologic conditions.

A phase 2 proof-of-concept trial demonstrated once-daily roflumilast cream, 0.15%, and roflumilast cream, 0.05%, had favorable safety and tolerability profiles with the potential to be effective in treating mild to moderate AD. The phase 3 randomized clinical trials presented here (Interventional Trial Evaluating Roflumilast Cream for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis 1 and 2 [INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2]) evaluated the efficacy and safety of roflumilast cream, 0.15%, applied once daily for 4 weeks in patients 6 years or older with mild to moderate AD.

Phase III DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2 PK Assessment (Studies 301 and 302)

DERMIS-1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04211363) and DERMIS-2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04211389) were identical, parallel-group, randomized (2:1), double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials of roflumilast cream 0.3% or vehicle applied once daily for 8 weeks to patients with chronic plaque psoriasis affecting 2–20% BSA. The safety and efficacy results of the DERMIS trials have been published. Male or female children (2–11 years), adolescents (12–17 years), and adults (≥ 18 years) with chronic plaque psoriasis could be enrolled.

Roflumilast cream 0.3% or vehicle was applied once daily to all lesions (excluding the scalp) as identified by the investigator, even if lesions cleared during the study. New lesions were to be treated as well. Predose (C trough) plasma samples for roflumilast and roflumilast N -oxide were obtained at Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8. C trough concentrations were assessed from observed data, and given the flat PK profile of topical roflumilast, the AUC from time zero to 24 h (AUC 24) was extrapolated by multiplying the predose concentration value by 24.

### Roflumilast cream, 0.15%, for atopic dermatitis in adults and children: INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 randomized clinical trials [^3fa249a7]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Skin barrier disruption in AD leads to penetration of irritants and allergens, skin microbiome disruption, and water loss. Topical corticosteroids, often used to treat AD, can cause skin atrophy, and thus further disrupt the skin barrier. Roflumilast, which uses a water-based vehicle cream without sensitizers or penetration enhancers, was designed to protect the skin barrier. The vehicle cream contains a mild emulsifier that does not extract lipids from the skin and is commonly used in cosmetic products but not previously used in prescription topical formulations prior to roflumilast cream and foam. As assessed by patients and investigators, this vehicle cream has demonstrated similar efficacy, tolerability, and aesthetic properties to a commonly recommended moisturizer. Thus, the novel vehicle formulation likely contributed to the favorable local tolerability of both roflumilast and its vehicle in these trials.

Adherence to topical therapies in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as AD is generally poor. Roflumilast addresses this unmet medical need by reducing the barriers to adherence. Because fear of AEs is a common reason for nonadherence, the low rates of AEs and favorable local tolerability scores observed with roflumilast may reduce this fear and thus improve adherence. Furthermore, all currently approved nonsteroidal topical therapies for AD (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, crisaborole, ruxolitinib) are indicated for twice-daily use; roflumilast's simpler, once-daily treatment regimen also may improve adherence. Lastly, given patients' preference for less greasy formulations, patients may be more likely to apply roflumilast cream as prescribed than ointments such as tacrolimus and crisaborole.

The disparities in diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic management among patients with AD identified as having skin of color underscore the importance of studying diverse patient populations. The diverse racial and ethnic profiles of the patients in the INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 trials serve to reduce these disparities.

Limitations

Limitations of the trials include their short duration, minimum age limit of 6 years, and lack of an active comparator. An ongoing open-label extension trial is studying long-term treatment with roflumilast cream in patients 2 years or older, including proactive use and maintenance therapy of previously affected areas that have since cleared. Similarly, a phase 3 trial in patients aged 2 to 5 years with AD evaluated the safety and efficacy of roflumilast in these younger patients.

### Roflumilast foam 0.3% for adolescent and adult patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled, phase 3 trial [^67e34422]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The topical phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor roflumilast has been studied in several dermatologic conditions.

Objective

Roflumilast foam 0.3% is being investigated as a topical treatment for seborrheic dermatitis (SD).

Methods

In this phase 3, double-blinded trial, patients with SD were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to once-daily roflumilast foam 0.3% or vehicle foam for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Success at week 8, defined as IGA of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) plus ≥ 2-point improvement from baseline. Safety was also assessed.

Results

79.5% of roflumilast-treated and 58.0% of vehicle-treated patients met the primary endpoint (P < .001); statistically significant differences in IGA Success also favored roflumilast at week 2 (roflumilast: 43.0%; vehicle: 25.7%; P < .001) and week 4 (roflumilast: 73.1%; vehicle: 47.1%; P < .001). Roflumilast was well-tolerated with a low rate of treatment-emergent adverse events.

Limitations

Study limitations include the 8-week treatment period for this chronic condition.

Conclusions

Once-daily roflumilast foam was superior to vehicle in leading to IGA of Clear or Almost Clear plus ≥ 2-point improvement from baseline at 8 weeks in patients with SD. Longer trials are needed to determine durability and safety of roflumilast foam in SD.

Study Assessments

The overall baseline mean PASI score was 7.8 (Table 1). The percentage reduction from baseline for PASI was greater in roflumilast-treated groups than in the vehicle-treated group from Week 2 to Week 12 (all p < 0.001). Overall baseline mean scores for WI-NRS were similar across groups at 5.9 (Table 1). Patients in both roflumilast-treated groups had similar improvements in WI-NRS score. The least squares mean decrease (improvement) from baseline was greater for patients treated with roflumilast than for those treated with vehicle beginning at Week 2 (p ≤ 0.002; Fig. 1). Among the subgroup of patients with baseline WI-NRS ≥ 6, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with roflumilast 0.3% achieved an improvement ≥ 4 points than among those treated with vehicle by the first timepoint measured, Week 2 (p ≤ 0.034; Fig. 2). For patients treated with roflumilast 0.15%, the percentage who achieved this level of improvement was greater than for those treated with vehicle at Week 6 (p = 0.012) and Week 12 (p < 0.001).

Current topical treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis are limited by efficacy and/or safety.

Objective

To assess safety and efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in adult patients with seborrheic dermatitis affecting the scalp, face, and/or trunk.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter (24 sites in the US and Canada) phase 2a, parallel group, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial was conducted between November 12, 2019, and August 21, 2020. Participants were adult (aged ≥ 18 years) patients with a clinical diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis for a 3-month or longer duration and Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 or greater (at least moderate), affecting 20% or less body surface area, including scalp, face, trunk, and/or intertriginous areas. Data analysis was performed from September to October 2020.

Interventions

Once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3% (n = 154), or vehicle foam (n = 72) for 8 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was IGA success, defined as achievement of IGA score of clear or almost clear plus 2-grade improvement from baseline, at week 8. Secondary outcomes included IGA success at weeks 2 and 4; achievement of erythema score of 0 or 1 plus 2-grade improvement from baseline at weeks 2, 4, and 8; achievement of scaling score of 0 or 1 plus 2-grade improvement from baseline at weeks 2, 4, and 8; change in Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) score from baseline; and WI-NRS success, defined as achievement of 4-point or greater WI-NRS score improvement in patients with baseline WI-NRS score of 4 or greater. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

Results

A total of 226 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.9 [16.8] years; 116 men, 110 women) were randomized to roflumilast foam (n = 154) or vehicle foam (n = 72). At week 8, 104 (73.8%) roflumilast-treated patients achieved IGA success compared with 27 (40.9%) in the vehicle group (P < .001). Roflumilast-treated patients had statistically significantly higher rates of IGA success vs vehicle at week 2, the first time point assessed. Mean (SD) reductions (improvements) on the WI-NRS at week 8 were 59.3% (52.5%) vs 36.6% (42.2%) in the roflumilast and vehicle groups, respectively (P < .001). Roflumilast was well tolerated, with the rate of adverse events similar to that of the vehicle foam.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results from this phase 2a randomized clinical trial of once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3%, demonstrated favorable efficacy, safety, and local tolerability in the treatment of erythema, scaling, and itch caused by seborrheic dermatitis, supporting further investigation as a nonsteroidal topical treatment.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^04e43a1f]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

The study Roflumilast in seborrheic dermatitis was published by Matthew J Zirwas and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA Dermatol. This study is related to the following diseases: Seborrheic dermatitis. In the Roflumilast in seborrheic dermatitis study, the trial question was: what is the effect of roflumilast 0.3% foam in patients with seborrheic dermatitis? In the Roflumilast in seborrheic dermatitis study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Roflumilast in seborrheic dermatitis study, the population was: 226 patients (110 female, 116 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis for ≥ 3 months and Investigator Global Assessment score of ≥ 3, affecting ≤ 20% of body, including scalp, face, trunk, and/or intertriginous areas. The key exclusion criteria were use of topical antifungals; corticosteroids; topical calcineurin inhibitors; sulfur-based treatments; medical devices; crisaborole; azelaic acid or metronidazole ≥ 2 weeks before randomization. In the Roflumilast in seborrheic dermatitis study, the interventions were: n = 154 roflumilast foam (once-daily topical application of 0.3% roflumilast in emollient foam) n = 72 vehicle foam (once-daily topical application of vehicle foam without active ingredient). In the Roflumilast in seborrheic dermatitis study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in Investigator Global Assessment success at week 8 (73.8% vs. 40.9%; AD 32.8%, 95% CI 18.5 to 45.7). In the Roflumilast in seborrheic dermatitis study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in Investigator Global Assessment success at week 2 (33.8% vs. 14.7%; AD 19.1%, 95% CI 6.6 to 29.3) Significant increase in erythema success at week 8 (44.7% vs. 21.2%; AD 23.5%, 95% CI 9.6 to 35) Significant increase in Worst Itch NRS success (64.6% vs. 34%; AD 30.6%, 95% CI 14.4 to 44.6). In the Roflumilast in seborrheic dermatitis study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the Roflumilast in seborrheic dermatitis study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis for ≥ 3 months and Investigator Global Assessment score of ≥ 3, affecting ≤ 20% of body, including scalp, face, trunk, and/or intertriginous areas, roflumilast foam was superior to vehicle foam with respect to Investigator Global Assessment success at week 8.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved IGA treatment success at Week 8 (Table 3). Success was defined as a score of "Clear" (0) or "Almost Clear" (1), plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline.

In Trial STRATUM, among subjects with a baseline WI-NRS score of at least 4 (67% of subjects), there was a higher percentage of subjects who achieved a reduction of at least 4 points from baseline at Week 8 in the group who received ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, compared to the group who received vehicle foam (62.8% vs. 40.6% for a treatment difference of 25.7% and 95% CI of (13.4, 38.1)).

In a Phase 2b study evaluating efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast cream (0.3% and 0.15%) for plaque psoriasis for 12 weeks, roflumilast resulted in significantly higher percentages of patients with a score on the investigator global assessment (IGA) indicating Clear or Almost Clear status at 6 weeks versus vehicle (roflumilast 0.3%: 28%; roflumilast 0.15%: 23%; vehicle: 8%; p ≤ 0.004). Safety of roflumilast was similar to vehicle with low incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, including application site pain. Here, we report results of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) related to itch from that Phase 2b study.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^833eb277]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

A sample size of 184 participants provided approximately 90% power to detect an active response of 58.5% or greater, assuming 159 participants completed the study and vehicle response of 30%, based on 2-group χ 2 test of equal proportions (without continuity correction), using a 2-sided α of.10. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized patients, while the modified ITT (mITT) population included all randomized patients except patients who missed the week-8 IGA assessment due to COVID-19 disruption. The primary efficacy end point was analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by study site and baseline disease severity. Statistical significance was concluded at the 10% significance level (2-sided). The primary efficacy analysis was based on the mITT population and repeated for the ITT population. Missing IGA scores were imputed using multiple imputation for CMH test.

Secondary end points of IGA success (weeks 2 and 4), erythema success, scaling success, and WI-NRS success were analyzed using the CMH test, similar to the primary end point. Change and percentage change from baseline in WI-NRS score were analyzed using analysis of covariance with independent variables of treatment, study site, baseline IGA, and baseline value of the respective scale. All secondary efficacy analyses were performed using the mITT and ITT populations except WI-NRS success, which was based on the subset of the ITT population with baseline WI-NRS score of 4 or greater. Percentage of patients satisfying response criteria and the treatment difference in percentage were estimated with observed data, and 95% CIs were calculated using the Wilson method. Analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^e3739097]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This phase 2a randomized clinical trial assessed efficacy of a topical PDE4 inhibitor foam in patients with seborrheic dermatitis. Once-daily treatment with roflumilast foam, 0.3%, resulted in consistent improvements from baseline for key signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. Significantly more roflumilast-treated patients than vehicle-treated patients achieved the primary end point, IGA success, at week 8, with superiority achieved by the first postbaseline assessment at week 2. It is notable that 35.5% of patients achieved an IGA status of clear.

Similar results were observed for the secondary end point of WI-NRS success, as nearly two-thirds of roflumilast-treated patients who had baseline WI-NRS score of 4 or greater achieved a 4-point or greater improvement at week 8. This success rate for improvement in itch is noteworthy considering that the baseline WI-NRS score was relatively high and because itch is a major complaint among patients with seborrheic dermatitis.

The high rate of response in vehicle-treated patients suggests the vehicle, which has a number of unique properties, has beneficial effects on seborrheic dermatitis. Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, is formulated with a water-based emollient vehicle nearly identical to the vehicle for roflumilast cream, 0.3%. This vehicle performed generally similarly to a leading ceramide-containing moisturizer across most assessments in a double-blinded, intraindividual study in patients with asteatotic eczema. Additionally, the unique emulsifier used does not act as a surfactant at skin temperature, and thus is not able to extract lipids from the skin. While the mechanism is speculative at this point, these results suggest the potential importance of the skin barrier in patients with seborrheic dermatitis.

### Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for psoriasis of the scalp and body: the ARRECTOR phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^7a631c9f]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Current topical treatments for scalp psoriasis are limited by formulation, efficacy, and/or safety.

Objective

To assess safety and efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with psoriasis of the scalp and body.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a phase 3 double-blinded, vehicle-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted between August 24, 2021, and June 3, 2022, at 49 sites in Canada and the US. Eligible participants were 12 years and older with plaque psoriasis affecting up to 25% of the scalp and body, at least 10% of the scalp, and up to 20% of nonscalp areas, with a minimum Scalp-Investigator Global Assessment (S-IGA) score of 3 (moderate), and minimum Body-IGA (B-IGA) score of 2 (mild). Data analyses were performed from September 9 to December 30, 2022.

Interventions

Once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3%, or vehicle for 8 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Coprimary end points were S-IGA and B-IGA success (clear [0] or almost clear [1] plus ≥ 2-grade improvement) at week 8. Secondary end points included S-IGA success at weeks 2 and 4, change in Scalp Itch-Numeric Rating Scale (SI-NRS), and SI-NRS and Worst Itch-NRS (WI-NRS) success (≥ 4-point improvement in patients with baseline score of ≥ 4). Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

Results

A total of 432 patients (mean [SD] age, 47.3 [14.8] years; 243 women [56.3%]) were randomized to roflumilast foam (n = 281) or vehicle (n = 151). At week 8, 66.4% of the roflumilast group achieved S-IGA success vs 27.8% of the vehicle group (P < .001); and 45.5% of the roflumilast group achieved B-IGA success compared with 20.1% of the vehicle group (P < .001). Rates for S-IGA success at week 2 and SI-NRS and WI-NRS success at weeks 2, 4, and 8 were significantly higher for roflumilast vs vehicle. Improvements in SI-NRS were greater for the roflumilast vs the vehicle group as early as the first assessment (24 hours after the first application). Both study groups had low rates of adverse events and favorable tolerability profiles.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that roflumilast foam, 0.3%, improved signs and symptoms of psoriasis on the scalp and body, including pruritus, with low rates of adverse events in patients 12 years and older. These results demonstrate the potential of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, as monotherapy for patients with psoriasis of the scalp and body.

1 Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease affecting 15%–20% of the pediatric population worldwide. Pruritus and pain associated with AD can lead to sleep deprivation, impaired quality of life, and reduced school readiness.

Crisaborole ointment is associated with application site pain and requires twice‐daily application. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are limited by application site burning, stinging, and pruritus; must be applied twice daily; and include a boxed warning in their prescribing information. Topical ruxolitinib requires twice‐daily application, is not approved for patients aged < 12 years, has boxed warnings and limitations on the percent of body surface area (BSA; ≤ 20%) to treat, and is not recommended for use with certain systemic therapies (e.g. biologics or potent immunosuppressants).

Topical roflumilast, a potent phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, is formulated as water‐based, once‐daily, novel creams and foam that do not contain ethanol, propylene glycol, or fragrances that can irritate the skin. Safety and efficacy of topical roflumilast 0.3% have been demonstrated for plaque psoriasis (cream), scalp and body psoriasis (foam), and seborrheic dermatitis (foam). In trials of patients aged ≥ 6 years with AD (INTEGUMENT‐1 and INTEGUMENT‐2), roflumilast cream 0.15% was used in consideration of differences in skin barrier dysfunction in patients with AD (who also tend to be younger) and the generally greater BSA involvement present in AD, as well as the high potency and low molecular weight of roflumilast. Patients aged 2–5 years have higher BSA to body mass ratios and often have greater AD BSA involvement than patients aged ≥ 6 years; therefore, roflumilast cream 0.05% was evaluated in this study. This was expected to result in consistent pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety profiles in patients aged 2–5 years and patients aged ≥ 6 years.

### Long-term safety and effectiveness of roflumilast cream 0.3% in adults with chronic plaque psoriasis: a 52-week, phase 2, open-label trial [^313a9984]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Efficacy and/or safety profiles limit topical psoriasis treatments.

Objective

Evaluate long-term effects of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.3% in patients with psoriasis.

Methods

In this open-label phase 2 trial, adult patients (N = 332) with psoriasis who completed the phase 2b parent trial or were newly enrolled applied roflumilast once-daily for 52 weeks. Safety and effectiveness were assessed.

Results

Overall, 244 patients (73.5%) completed the trial; 13 patients (3.9%) discontinued due to adverse events (AEs) and 3 (0.9%) due to lack of efficacy. Twelve patients (3.6%) reported treatment-related AEs; none were serious. ≥ 97% of patients had no irritation. No tachyphylaxis was observed with 44.8% of the patients achieving Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Clear or Almost Clear at Week 52.

Limitations

Intertriginous-IGA and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) were not evaluated in all patients.

Conclusions

In this long-term trial, once-daily roflumilast cream was well-tolerated and efficacious up to 64 weeks in patients in the earlier trial, suggesting it is suitable for chronic treatment, including the face and intertriginous areas.

### Roflumilast and the changing landscape of seborrheic dermatitis treatment [^c8df132f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This article reviews clinical trial data that assess the safety, efficacy, and clinical application of roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

Data Sources

A review of the literature was conducted in MEDLINE (Pubmed) and Clinicaltrials.gov from January 1, 1950 to April 13, 2025 using the search terms: "Roflumilast" and "seborrheic dermatitis".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant articles in English relating to the safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics were included.

Data Synthesis

In one phase IIa clinical trial, 73.8% of patients treated with roflumilast achieved Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) success, compared with 40.9% in the vehicle group at 8 weeks (P < 0.001). A phase III trial found 79.5% of patients in the roflumilast group achieved IGA success at week 8, compared with 58.0% in the vehicle group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, there were statistically significant reductions in erythema, scaling, and itch severity in the roflumilast group. Roflumilast was well tolerated, with adverse events comparable with vehicle foam. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice in Comparison to Existing Drugs:Roflumilast is the first phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. Based on 2 clinical trials, roflumilast has a positive safety profile, is efficacious, and is easy to apply, highlighting its utility in treating seborrheic dermatitis.

Conclusion

Roflumilast is effective in treating seborrheic dermatitis. Future trials should compare its safety and efficacy with other drugs.

### Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for psoriasis of the scalp and body: the ARRECTOR phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^2299c972]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3%, improved psoriasis across multiple efficacy end points in patients with psoriasis of the scalp and body when used as monotherapy. Investigator-reported outcomes (S-IGA, B-IGA, PASI, and PSSI) significantly improved with roflumilast compared with vehicle. Importantly, these improvements were also reflected in patient-reported outcomes (SI-NRS, WI-NRS, and PSD), suggesting clinical improvements observed in those treated with roflumilast may translate into clinically meaningful outcomes for patients. Of note, pruritus improved early, with significantly greater proportions of patients achieving SI-NRS success in the roflumilast group compared with the vehicle group. Significant improvement in pruritus with roflumilast as compared with vehicle was observed as early as 24 hours after treatment initiation. Early improvement in patient-reported outcomes is advantageous because patient satisfaction with therapy can enhance adherence to treatment, particularly when the areas affected by psoriasis are difficult to treat. In both study groups, patients experienced low rates of TEAEs, with few TEAEs leading to trial discontinuation. Roflumilast foam and vehicle had similar investigator- and patient-rated local tolerability assessments.

Results from the current trial are consistent with previous trials comparing roflumilast cream, 0.3%, with vehicle cream in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2demonstrated a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients treated with roflumilast cream achieving IGA success (clear or almost clear status plus at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline on a scale of none [0] to severe [4]) compared with vehicle. Foam formulations are intended to make application to the scalp and other hair-bearing areas easier; in the current trial, success in both investigator- and patient-reported outcomes supports the use of the foam formulation. In addition, using a single topical product suitable for both hair-bearing and non–hair-bearing regions is more convenient than using separate products for different body parts. The investigator- and patient-reported outcomes suggest that the foam formulation should help improve patient satisfaction, adherence to therapy, and quality of life.

### Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for psoriasis of the scalp and body: the ARRECTOR phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^20cdb3ec]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

The study ARRECTOR was published by Melinda J Gooderham and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Dermatol. This study is related to the following diseases: Psoriasis. In the ARRECTOR study, the trial question was: what is the role of roflumilast foam in patients with psoriasis on the scalp and body? In the ARRECTOR study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ARRECTOR study, the population was: 432 patients (243 female, 189 male). The inclusion criteria were patients, aged ≥ 12 years, with plaque psoriasis affecting up to 25% of the scalp and body. The key exclusion criteria were planned excessive exposure of treated areas to natural or artificial sunlight, tanning bed, or other LED; planned initiation or changes to concomitant medication that could affect psoriasis; current diagnosis of non-plaque forms of psoriasis or drug-induced psoriasis; discontinuation of current psoriasis treatment inadvisable. In the ARRECTOR study, the interventions were: n = 281 roflumilast foam (application of roflumilast 3% emollient foam once daily for 8 weeks) n = 151 vehicle (vehicle foam applied once daily to affected areas for 8 weeks). In the ARRECTOR study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in Scalp-Investigator Global Assessment success at week 8 (66.4% vs. 27.8%; AD 37.1%, 97.5% CI 25.7 to 48.6). In the ARRECTOR study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in Body-Investigator Global Assessment success at week 8 (45.5% vs. 20.1%; AD 24.8%, 97.5% CI 13.6 to 36) Significant increase in Scalp Itch-NRS at week 8 (65.3% vs. 30.3%; AD 35.4%, 97.5% CI 22.3 to 48.6) Significant increase in Worst Itch-NRS at week 8 (63.1% vs. 30.1%; AD 32.8%, 97.5% CI 18.6 to 46.9). In the ARRECTOR study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the ARRECTOR study, the conclusion was: in patients, aged ≥ 12 years, with plaque psoriasis affecting up to 25% of the scalp and body, roflumilast foam was superior to vehicle with respect to a Scalp-Investigator Global Assessment success at week 8.

### Once-daily roflumilast foam 0.3% for scalp and body psoriasis: a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase IIb study [^f0d63eeb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Scalp psoriasis affects most patients with psoriasis, but it can be difficult to treat.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast foam 0.3% on scalp and body psoriasis.

Methods

In a phase IIb randomized controlled trial, adults and adolescents aged ≥ 12years with scalp and body psoriasis were randomized (2: 1) to roflumilast foam 0.3% or vehicle for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was scalp Investigator Global Assessment (S-IGA) success (score of 'clear' or 'almost clear' plus ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline) at week 8. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

Results

Significantly more roflumilast-treated patients (59.1%) than vehicle-treated patients (11.4%) achieved S-IGA success at week 8 (P < 0.001); differences favoured roflumilast as early as the first postbaseline visit at week 2 (P < 0.001). Significant improvements were also seen for secondary endpoints, including body IGA success, Scalp Itch Numeric Rating Scale and the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index. The safety of roflumilast was generally similar to vehicle. Patients treated with roflumilast experienced low rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), with few discontinuations due to an AE. Few patients with skin of colour (11%) and few adolescents (0.7%) were included.

Conclusions

The results support the further development of roflumilast foam for treating scalp and body psoriasis.

### Effect of roflumilast cream (ARQ-151) on itch and itch-related sleep loss in adults with chronic plaque psoriasis: patient-reported itch outcomes of a phase 2b trial [^ef38ac58]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Itch is the most bothersome symptom reported by patients with psoriasis. Safe and effective treatments for psoriasis that also address itch are needed.

Objectives

To report effects of roflumilast cream on itch-related outcomes from a Phase 2b trial.

Methods

Adults with chronic plaque psoriasis were randomized to roflumilast 0.3%, roflumilast 0.15%, or vehicle once-daily for 12 weeks. Psoriasis severity was assessed via the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA; a 5-point scale assessing plaque thickening, scaling, and erythema ranging from 0 [clear] to 4 [severe]) and ≥ 2 on a modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-HD, which combines severity of lesions and area affected, ranging from 0 [no disease] to 72 [maximal disease], with the actual percentage of the anatomical area involved in those patients with < 10% of anatomical area involved [e.g. 0.1 for 1% to 0.9 for 9%]). Itch was evaluated via Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS), Psoriasis Symptom Diary (PSD) Items 1 (severity of itch) and 2 (bother of itch), and itch-related sleep loss NRS scores. Post hoc correlation analyses between WI-NRS and PASI, WI-NRS and itch-related sleep loss, and WI-NRS and DLQI were also performed.

Results

Roflumilast-treated patients had significantly greater improvements than vehicle-treated patients in WI-NRS and PSD Items 1 and 2 beginning at Week 2 and in itch-related sleep loss Weeks 6 through 12. Among patients with baseline WI-NRS ≥ 6, significantly more patients achieved ≥ 4-point improvement with roflumilast than with vehicle as early as Week 2. Itch severity had low correlation with PASI while WI-NRS and IGA were not always aligned.

Limitations

The first assessment was at 2 weeks, limiting the ability to assess early onset of itch response.

Conclusion

Roflumilast cream improved itch and itch-related sleep loss associated with chronic plaque psoriasis.

### A review of topical roflumilast for the treatment of plaque psoriasis [^cd2b6162]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This article reviews clinical trials to assess the efficacy, safety, and clinical application of once-daily roflumilast 0.3% cream for the treatment of plaque psoriasis.

Data Sources

A systematic review of the literature was performed using the terms roflumilast OR Zoryve OR ARQ-151 in MEDLINE (PubMed) and EMBASE databases between January 2012 and October 2022. Bibliographies and the ClinicalTrials.gov website were also searched to identify further studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies written in English and relevant to pharmacology, clinical trials, and safety were considered for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

In two 8-week phase III clinical trials, disease severity as assessed by a score of "clear" or "almost clear" and a 2-point improvement on Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) was 42.4% and 37.5% at week 8 in DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2, respectively, compared to 6.1% and 6.9% in the control groups. In the 52-week phase III trial, treatment success rates for plaque psoriasis and intertriginous psoriasis were similar to the 8-week data with 45% of patients in the treatment group were evaluated as an IGA of "clear" or "almost clear" at week 52.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice In Comparison To Existing Drugs

Roflumilast is a new US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved topical phosphodiesterase inhibitor that shows promise for the treatment of mild-severe plaque psoriasis. It is an effective and safe topical nonsteroidal alternative to currently available topical corticosteroids, but there are currently no comparative studies with other psoriasis treatments.

Conclusion

Roflumilast is effective and safe for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and intertriginous psoriasis. Future trials should compare its efficacy and tolerability with that of the older, clinically established topical corticosteroids. Prohibitive factors may include limited patient adherence to topical treatments and cost.

### Assessment of the vehicle for roflumilast cream compared to a ceramide-containing moisturizing cream in mild eczema [^b0f011fb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory dermatologic conditions suitable for topical treatments benefit from a hydrating vehicle that improves the skin barrier without irritation.

Objective

This research was designed to assess skin barrier effects and aesthetic attributes of the vehicle for topical roflumilast cream (vehicle) vs a currently marketed ceramide-containing moisturizing cream (moisturizer).

Methods

This was a single-site, randomized, intraindividual, double-blind, controlled study conducted over 17 days. Patients (aged 18 years or older) with mild, symmetric asteatotic eczema of the lower extremities were enrolled to receive lower leg applications of the vehicle on one leg and moisturizer on the other. The primary efficacy endpoint was a change in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) from baseline to day 15. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline in TEWL at other study visits, change from baseline in hydration as assessed via corneometry, and patient- and investigator-rated assessments of the products. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

Results

A total of 40 patients enrolled in the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was met for both treatments. A statistically significant difference in TEWL on day 1 favored the moisturizer, but no difference was seen between vehicle and moisturizer at any other timepoint. Both vehicle and moisturizer also met the secondary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in hydration.

Limitations

The sample size was small.

Conclusions

The vehicle for roflumilast cream performed similarly to a leading, currently marketed, dermatologist-recommended, ceramide-containing moisturizer across all patient- and investigator-rated assessments of efficacy, tolerability, and aesthetic properties in patients with mild asteatotic eczema.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of roflumilast foam 0.3% in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a phase II, open-label trial of up to 52 weeks [^fb318031]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast foam 0.3%, a potent phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, has been demonstrated in patients with seborrheic dermatitis (SD).

Objectives

To evaluate long-term effects of roflumilast foam 0.3% in patients with SD.

Methods

A phase II, open-label trial (no. NCT04445987) was conducted in patients (aged ≥ 12 years) with SD who completed a prior roflumilast foam trial or were naïve to roflumilast and vehicle. Patients applied roflumilast foam 0.3% once daily to all affected areas, including the scalp, face, trunk, and intertriginous areas, for 24 or 52 weeks (during the course of the trial, the protocol was amended to extend the duration of treatment from 24 weeks to 52 weeks). The primary endpoints were occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs); local tolerability and efficacy (via Investigator Global Assessment [IGA]) were also assessed.

Results

Overall, 400 patients participated, among whom 62 were enrolled for 52 weeks. AE rates were low, and ≤ 1.1% reported stinging sensation at the application site at each visit. Durable improvement in signs and symptoms of SD was observed at weeks 24 and 52, with 76.0% and 80.4% of patients, respectively, achieving an IGA of clear or almost clear.

Conclusions

Roflumilast foam 0.3% was well tolerated and improved and/or maintained improvements in signs and symptoms of SD for up to 52 weeks.

In Trial 204, the trial population ranged in age from 12 to 87 years, including 1% of subjects who were 12 to 17 years of age, and 9% who were 65 years of age or older. At baseline, 11% of subjects had an S-IGA score of 2 (mild), 76% of subjects had an S-IGA score of 3 (moderate), and 13% had an S-IGA score of 4 (severe); 36% of subjects had a B-IGA score of 2 (mild), 59% of subjects had a B-IGA score of 3 (moderate), and 5% had a B-IGA score of 4 (severe). At baseline, 89% of subjects had an SI-NRS score of 4 or higher on a scale of 0 to 10.

In both trials, S-IGA treatment success, a primary endpoint in ARRECTOR and Trial 204, and B-IGA treatment success, a primary endpoint in ARRECTOR, were defined as a score of "Clear" (0) or "Almost Clear" (1), plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline.

SI-NRS success and WI-NRS success were defined as a reduction of at least 4 points from baseline with a baseline score of at least 4. In Trial ARRECTOR, among subjects with a baseline SI-NRS score of at least 4 (75% of subjects), a higher percentage of subjects achieved SI-NRS success at Week 8 in the group who received ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, compared to the group who received vehicle foam (65.3% vs. 30.3% for a treatment difference of 35.4% and 95% CI of (23.9, 47.0)). In Trial ARRECTOR, among subjects with a baseline WI-NRS score of at least 4 (72% of subjects), a higher percentage of subjects achieved WI-NRS success at Week 8 in the group who received ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, compared to the group who received vehicle foam (63.1% vs. 30.1% for a treatment difference of 32.8% and 95% CI of (20.3, 45.2)).

### Pharmacokinetics of roflumilast cream in chronic plaque psoriasis: data from phase I to phase III studies [^149d5d95]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Most patients with chronic plaque psoriasis receive topical treatment; however, available options lack a balance of efficacy with long-term safety and tolerability. Roflumilast cream 0.3% is a highly potent phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved by the US FDA for treatment of psoriasis.

Objective

The aim of this study was to define the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of roflumilast delivered topically from a phase I maximal usage study and data from phase II and phase III studies.

Methods

PK data for roflumilast and the active metabolite, roflumilast N-oxide, were determined from a phase I PK and safety maximal usage study of roflumilast cream 0.3% applied once daily for 14 days in patients with plaque psoriasis affecting body surface area (BSA) ≥ 20% (N = 26). Serial plasma samples were obtained on Days 1 and 15 to determine maximum plasma concentration (C max) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Plasma concentrations were also assessed at Weeks 3, 4, and 5 for terminal half-life (t ½). Concentrations of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide in skin were assessed at Day 28 for 14 patients with psoriasis in a phase I/IIa study of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.5% and 0.15% for 28 days. Systemic exposure (C trough and AUC) of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide in two phase III trials (DERMIS-1, n = 245; DERMIS-2, n = 250) of roflumilast cream 0.3% for 8 weeks was assessed at Weeks 4 and 8.

Results

Bioavailability of roflumilast cream 0.3% after topical administration was 1.5%. Unlike after oral dosing, the plasma concentration-time curve was flat, with a peak-to-trough ratio of 1.2. Roflumilast N-oxide concentrations were eightfold higher than roflumilast concentrations. The t ½ in adult patients was 4.0 days for roflumilast and 4.6 days for roflumilast N-oxide following the last dose administered. Steady state was reached by Day 15. Concentrations of roflumilast in skin were, on average, 126- and 61.8-fold higher than corresponding mean plasma C trough following administration of roflumilast cream 0.15% and 0.5% daily for 28 days. Roflumilast N-oxide was quantifiable in only one skin sample (N = 27). Following 8 weeks of treatment in DERMIS-1, mean plasma C trough of roflumilast was 1.78 ng/mL, and 9.86 ng/mL for roflumilast N-oxide. In DERMIS-2, mean plasma C trough was 1.72 ng/mL and 10.2 ng/mL, respectively. In the maximal usage study (mean BSA: 27.5%), eight patients (30.8%) experienced adverse events (AEs) and all were mild or moderate, with no reports of diarrhea, headache, insomnia, or application-site pain; no patients discontinued treatment due to an AE.

Conclusion

Topical administration of roflumilast cream 0.3% results in concentrations in skin 126- and 61.8-fold higher relative to plasma, which are much higher than expected to be achievable with oral dosing. PDE4 inhibition in the skin is likely due to roflumilast as compared with its active metabolite, as there is no significant conversion to roflumilast N-oxide in the skin. Consistent with reservoir formation and retention of drug in the stratum corneum, roflumilast is slowly released from the skin (t ½ 4 days) and peak-to-trough ratio is 1.2.

### A phase I randomized trial to assess the effect on skin infiltrate thickness and tolerability of topical phosphodiesterase inhibitors in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris using a modified psoriasis plaque test [^c60afa4a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Oral phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 inhibitors have shown efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and psoriasis.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, local safety and tolerability, and systemic pharmacokinetics of two topical PDE4 inhibitors, roflumilast and TAK-084, in plaque psoriasis.

Methods

An intraindividual comparison of six topical products was made in 15 patients aged 18–65 years with stable chronic plaque psoriasis in an investigator-blinded, within-subject randomized study. The products evaluated were calcipotriol 0·005% cream; betamethasone valerate 0·1% (both in their marketed formulations); investigational cream formulations of roflumilast 0·5% and TAK-084 0·5% and 5%; and a vehicle cream formulation as a control. Each treatment was applied daily to different test sites located on psoriasis plaques for 3 weeks.

Results

The primary end point of (mean) change from baseline in skin infiltrate thickness after 3 weeks of treatment showed statistically significant improvements for all treatments: betamethasone valerate cream (-286·9 μm), the selective PDE4 inhibitors roflumilast 0·5% (-237·1 μm) and TAK-084 (0·5% cream, -153·6 μm; 5% cream, -216·7 μm) and calcipotriol 0·005% (-187·7 μm) when compared with vehicle cream control (all P < 0·001). Both the TAK-084 5% and roflumilast 0·5% formulations performed well overall compared with the potent corticosteroid, betamethasone, and were ranked better than the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol. All adverse events were mild or moderate and none was serious.

Conclusions

Topical treatment with cream formulations of the PDE4 inhibitors roflumilast and TAK-084 reduced inflammation, measured as a change in skin infiltrate thickness, and reduced psoriasis severity. Corticosteroid treatments have known systemic and cutaneous side-effects; PDE4 inhibitors could offer an alternative to these and deserve further study.

The PK profiles of roflumilast and roflumilast N -oxide with topical administration have distinct differences in comparison with oral dosing, which may explain the excellent safety and tolerability profile of roflumilast cream relative to the oral formulation. Roflumilast was more bioavailable with oral dosing (79%) and absorbed rapidly, with peak levels occurring in 1 h. After single topical administration, roflumilast had bioavailability of approximately 1.5% and was slowly absorbed. Under steady-state conditions in the maximal usage study (Study 107, 27.5% BSA treatment), despite the 55-fold higher dose (27.5 mg vs. 0.5 mg oral) with the topical formulation, peak roflumilast and roflumilast N -oxide concentrations were 3.72 and 30.6 ng/mL, respectively, following topical administration. These values were within twofold of the peak C max values following repeat oral roflumilast 500 µg dose administration in healthy volunteers, in which peak roflumilast and roflumilast N -oxide concentrations were 6.01 ng/mL and 21.7 ng/mL, respectively. Following 8 weeks of treatment with roflumilast cream 0.3% in the DERMIS trials, the C trough concentrations were 1.78 ng/mL and 9.9 ng/mL for roflumilast and roflumilast N -oxide, respectively, in DERMIS-1. Values in DERMIS-2 were similar to those in DERMIS-1. With oral administration, roflumilast peak-to-trough ratios were > 10, while there was minimal fluctuation following topical administration — the ratio was 1.2-fold at steady state. The relatively flat concentration-time curve with topical roflumilast, lower C max, or action of bypassing the gastrointestinal tract with topical administration likely contribute to the low rate of gastrointestinal AEs observed during clinical trials with roflumilast cream in psoriasis.

There was significant inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence for several clinically important comparisons (Table 16). For the comparison of moderate TCS versus tacrolimus 0.03%, indirect evidence suggests similar effectiveness, whereas direct evidence suggests moderate TCS was more effective. For mild TCS versus vehicle, indirect evidence suggests mild TCS was more effective, whereas direct evidence suggests similar effectiveness.

Investigator Global Assessment (binary) NMA ‐ assessment of inconsistency

CIs for effect estimates were wide for most comparisons, and confidence in evidence evaluated using CINeMA was low or moderate for most licenced interventions. The main reason for CINeMA downgrades was within‐study bias. Imprecision was a concern for roflumilast 0.15%, but not considered sufficient for a further downgrade in addition to the within‐study bias. Heterogeneity was a concern for crisaborole 2%, difamilast 0.3%, and pimecrolimus 1%, but not sufficient to justify an additional downgrade for difamilast 0.3% and pimecrolimus 1%. Mild TCS had concerns in several CINeMA domains (within‐study bias, imprecision, heterogeneity, and incoherence) which, when taken together, resulted in low confidence. A funnel plot of studies with placebo comparators showed no evidence of publication bias (Figure 19).

8.4 Pediatric Use

Seborrheic Dermatitis

The safety and effectiveness of ZORYVE topical foam, 0.3%, for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis have been established in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older. Use of ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, in this age group is supported by data from two 8-week, vehicle-controlled trials which included 32 subjects 9 to 17 years of age, of whom 17 received ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, and from open-label trials of up to 52 weeks which included 23 pediatric subjects treated with ZORYVE foam, 0.3% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14)].

The safety and effectiveness of ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years have not been established.

Plaque Psoriasis

The safety and effectiveness of ZORYVE topical foam, 0.3%, for the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, in this age group is supported by data from two 8-week, vehicle-controlled trials which included 12 subjects 12 to 17 years of age, of whom 8 received ZORYVE foam, 0.3%. Use of ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is also supported by data from an open-label trial of 8 weeks duration which included 7 subjects 12 to 17 years of age treated with ZORYVE foam, 0.3%.

Assessment of Roflumilast and Roflumilast N-Oxide Concentrations in Skin from a Phase I/IIa Study (Study 101)

Skin punch biopsy samples for assessment of roflumilast and roflumilast N -oxide concentrations were obtained from 14 patients receiving roflumilast cream 0.15% and 13 patients receiving roflumilast cream 0.5%. All but one sample (patient receiving roflumilast cream 0.5%) had measurable levels of roflumilast, whereas only one sample (patient receiving roflumilast cream 0.15%) had a measurable level for roflumilast N -oxide. In patients receiving roflumilast cream 0.15%, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) concentration of roflumilast in the skin was 120 (185) ng/g and the concentration of measurable roflumilast N -oxide was 0.216 ng/g (one patient), near the LLOQ. In patients receiving roflumilast cream 0.5%, the mean (SD) concentration of roflumilast in the skin was 56.1 (43.1) ng/g. No patients receiving the 0.5% dose had measurable concentrations of roflumilast N -oxide.

The mean (SD) roflumilast plasma concentrations with roflumilast cream 0.15% (n = 21) and roflumilast cream 0.5% (n = 20) were 1.03 (0.903) ng/mL and 1.15 (0.736) ng/mL, respectively, while the skin concentrations of roflumilast N -oxide were at least 30-fold lower (skin LLOQ of 0.2 ng/g) than the circulating plasma concentrations (6.52 [4.04] ng/mL and 5.44 [4.95] ng/mL following 0.5% and 0.15%, respectively). The data suggest that there is no significant conversion of roflumilast to the N -oxide metabolite in the skin, and that efficacy in the skin is due to the higher skin roflumilast concentrations following topical administration.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Seborrheic Dermatitis

In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials (Trial 203 and STRATUM), 683 adult and pediatric subjects 9 years of age or older with seborrheic dermatitis were treated with ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, or vehicle foam once daily for 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Table 1 presents adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of subjects treated with ZORYVE foam, 0.3%.

The following additional adverse reactions were reported in fewer than 1% of subjects treated with ZORYVE foam, 0.3%: diarrhea and insomnia.

The adverse reaction profile in pediatric subjects was consistent with that observed in adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In 408 subjects who continued treatment with ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, for up to 24 to 52 weeks in an open-label, long-term trial, the adverse reaction profile was consistent with that observed in vehicle-controlled trials.

### Roflumilast [^72a36b6d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients enrolled in the two 6-month efficacy trials had moderate to severe COPD (FEV140 to 70% predicted); median age of 65 years, 68% male, and 97% Caucasian. COPD exacerbations and lung function (FEV1) were co-primary efficacy outcome measures in the four 1-year trials. In the two 6-month supportive efficacy trials, lung function (FEV1) alone was the primary efficacy outcome measure.

The two 6-month dose-selection efficacy trials (Trials 1 and 2) explored doses of 250 mcg and 500 mcg once daily in a total of 1929 patients (751 and 724 on roflumilast 250 and 500 mcg, respectively). The selection of the 500 mcg dose was primarily based on nominal improvements in lung function (FEV1) over the 250 mcg dose. The once-daily dosing regimen was primarily based on the determination of a plasma half-life of 17 hours for roflumilast and 30 hours for its active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

An additional placebo-controlled 1-year trial (Trial 9) evaluated the effect of roflumilast 500 mcg on COPD exacerbations when added to a fixed-dose combination (FDC) product containing an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA). At screening, patients were required to have two or more exacerbations in the previous year. This trial randomized a total of 2354 patients (1178 randomized to roflumilast, 1176 to placebo). Approximately 60% of the patients enrolled had severe COPD (postbronchodilator FEV1 30% to 50% of predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis and 39% had very severe COPD (postbronchodilator FEV1 ≤ 30% of predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis; mean age of 64 years, 69% male, and 80% Caucasian. The use of long-acting muscarinic antagonists was allowed.

### Two phase 3, randomized, controlled trials of ruxolitinib cream for vitiligo [^0272c3b4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study TRuE-V2 was published by David Rosmarin and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Vitiligo. In the TRuE-V2 study, the trial question was: what is the role of ruxolitinib cream in patients with vitiligo? In the TRuE-V2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TRuE-V2 study, the population was: 343 patients (172 female, 171 male). The inclusion criteria were patients ≥ 12 years of age who had non-segmental vitiligo with depigmentation covering ≤ 10% of total body-surface area. The key exclusion criteria were complete leukotrichia within any facial lesions; any biologic or experimental therapy within 12 weeks; phototherapy within 8 weeks; immunomodulating treatments within 4 weeks, or topical treatments within 1 week. In the TRuE-V2 study, the interventions were: n = 228 ruxolitinib (application of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID for 24 weeks with treatment extension through week 52) n = 115 placebo (vehicle cream applied BID for 24 weeks with treatment extension and use of 1.5% ruxolitinib cream through week 52). In the TRuE-V2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving depigmentation of ≥ 75% in the facial vitiligo area scoring index at week 24 (30.9% vs. 11.4%; RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.9). In the TRuE-V2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving depigmentation of ≥ 50% in the facial vitiligo area scoring index at week 24 (51.4% vs. 20.9%; RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.7) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving depigmentation of ≥ 90% in the facial vitiligo area scoring index at week 24 (16.3% vs. 1.3%; RR 13.1, 95% CI 1.9 to 90.2) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving depigmentation of ≥ 50% in the total body vitiligo area scoring index at week 24 (23.9% vs. 6.8%; RR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.5). In the TRuE-V2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in any adverse event. In the TRuE-V2 study, the conclusion was: in patients ≥ 12 years of age who had non-segmental vitiligo with depigmentation covering ≤ 10% of total body-surface area, ruxolitinib was superior to placebo with respect to the percentage of patients achieving depigmentation of ≥ 75% in the facial vitiligo area scoring index at week 24.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^a40621a7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Topical JAK inhibitors — ruxolitinib cream efficacy, safety, and recommendation. The mean percent improvement from baseline in Skindex-16 overall scores in patients treated with ruxolitinib 1.5% cream twice daily was 63.5% at week 2 (vehicle = 10.5%; P = 0.001) and 73.2% at week 8 (vehicle = 19.7%; P < .001). Serious and emergent adverse events are rare and occur at similar rates to vehicle, and application site burning, pain, and pruritus may occur at a rate similar to or even lower than vehicle. Based on moderate certainty evidence, there are enough data to strongly recommend topical JAK inhibitors in AD, while acknowledging that this recommendation is based on the currently available short-term efficacy and safety data and may require updating as long-term safety data become available.

### Efficacy and safety of topical OPA-15406, a new phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, in Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis for 8 weeks: a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^0a3f6f3e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The efficacy and safety datasets included all patients who received any IMP at least once. For the primary end‐point, patients with missing data for the IGA score at scheduled visits were considered as non‐responders for that visit.

For the primary end‐point of the incidence of success in the IGA score at week 4, a comparison between the OPA‐15406 1% group and the vehicle group was first performed. If a significant effect was found for the OPA‐15406 1% group with a two‐sided significance level of 0.05, a comparison between the OPA‐15406 0.3% group and the vehicle group was then performed. The Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test was performed using the baseline IGA score as a stratification factor. The difference in the incidence of success in the IGA score and its two‐sided 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined. For the revised responder analysis, patients who achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 without at least a 2‐grade reduction from baseline at week 4 were counted as responders. The analysis method for the secondary end‐point of the incidence of success in the IGA score at weeks 1 and 8 was the same as that used for the primary end‐point.

For the change from baseline in the IGA score as the secondary end‐point, a mixed‐model repeated measures analysis with an unstructured error covariance matrix was performed. The standard error was calculated by the Kenward–Roger method. The least square (LS) mean was calculated by treatment group and by time point. The difference in the LS means between each OPA‐15406 group and the vehicle group, the two‐sided 95% CI and the P ‐value were calculated. The other secondary end‐points were analyzed by the same method as that used for the change from baseline in the IGA score. For reference data, the incidence of success in the IGA score, and the changes from baseline in the IGA score, in the EASI score and the subscale scores, in the VAS pruritus score, in the POEM score, in the DLQI score and in the percentage of affected BSA were analyzed at weeks 2 and 6 by using the same methods as those used at weeks 1, 4 and 8.

### A phase 2b, randomized clinical trial of tapinarof cream for the treatment of plaque psoriasis: secondary efficacy and patient-reported outcomes [^d1ce305c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tapinarof cream is a topical therapeutic aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulating agent under investigation for treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

Methods

In a phase 2b, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study, adults with plaque psoriasis were randomized to tapinarof cream 0.5% or 1% once or twice daily or vehicle once or twice daily for 12 weeks with 4-week follow-up. Efficacy outcomes included Physician Global Assessment (PGA) scores, change in PGA and total target lesion grading scores, and proportion of patients achieving ≥ 50%, ≥ 75%, and ≥ 90% reductions in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores from baseline (PASI50, PASI75, and PASI90).

Results

At week 12, improvements were observed in all tapinarof groups vs vehicle in PGA response, change in PGA and total target lesion grading scores, PASI50 (71%-92% vs 10%-32%), PASI75 (46%-65% vs 5%-16%), and PASI90 (18%-40% vs 0%); all differences were statistically significant with tapinarof 1% once daily. Tapinarof responses were apparent from week 2, with significant efficacy at week 8 maintained through week 16. Most adverse events were mild or moderate.

Limitations

The analyses reported require confirmation in larger prospective studies.

Conclusions

Tapinarof may represent an important advance in the development of topical medicines for treatment of psoriasis.

### Efficacy and safety of topical brepocitinib for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis: a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, dose-ranging and parallel-group study [^a9242497]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatments

Participants were randomized equally to eight treatment arms to receive either once (QD) or twice daily (BID) application for 6 weeks: QD doses of vehicle, brepocitinib 0·1% (1 mg g –1), 0·3% (3 mg g –1), 1·0% (10 mg g –1) or 3·0% (30 mg g –1), and BID doses of vehicle, brepocitinib 0·3% or 1%. Participants and investigators were blinded to treatment but not to frequency of dosing. Randomization was performed at each investigative site using interactive response technology, which provided a randomization number and dispensable unit of treatment for each participant. Prior to baseline, participants and caregivers were instructed how and where to apply the treatment, and treatment was self‐administered or given by a caregiver to all areas affected by AD, except those on hair‐bearing scalp.

Endpoints

The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in EASI total score at week 6 (EASI total score did not include scalp scoring), and the key secondary endpoint was the proportion of participants who achieved a composite of an IGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) and a reduction of ≥ 2 points from baseline at week 6. Additional secondary endpoints, exploratory endpoints and post hoc analyses included percentage change from baseline in EASI score at all visits; EASI total score over time; the proportion of participants achieving 75% and 90% improvement in EASI (EASI75 and EASI90, respectively) at week 6; the proportion of participants having ≥ 4‐grade reduction in weekly averages of PP‐NRS and percentage change from baseline in affected BSA at all scheduled visits; change from baseline in Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) at weeks 1, 2 and 6; the proportion of participants with a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) response of ≥ 4‐point improvement from baseline at weeks 1, 2 and 6 among adult participants with a baseline DLQI score ≥ 4. Safety and tolerability were assessed by measuring the incidence of treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and significant changes in vital signs, laboratory assessments and electrocardiograms.

Pharmacokinetics

Blood samples were collected pre‐dose at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 to assess plasma concentrations of brepocitinib. To ensure measurement consistency, blood samples were collected at the same time interval after treatment administration.

### Halobetasol propionate (Bryhali) [^3e14ccfd]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

BRYHALI Lotion was evaluated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in two prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials (Trial 1 [NCT02514577] and Trial 2 [NCT02515097]). These trials were conducted in 430 subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis that covered a body surface area (BSA) between 3% and 12% excluding the face, scalp, palms, soles, axillae, and intertriginous areas. Disease severity was determined by a 5-grade Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA). Subjects applied BRYHALI Lotion or vehicle to all affected areas once daily for up to 8 weeks. Subjects had a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the end of treatment (Week 12) where safety and efficacy were evaluated.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with treatment success at Week 8, where treatment success was defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in IGA score and an IGA score equating to "clear" or "almost clear". Table 2 lists the primary efficacy results for Trials 1 and 2. The secondary efficacy endpoints evaluated treatment success sequentially at Weeks 12, 6, 4, and 2. Figure 1 shows the primary and secondary efficacy results over time.

*The treatment difference at Week 2 in Trial 2 was not statistically significant.

### Efficacy and safety of topical brepocitinib for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis: a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, dose-ranging and parallel-group study [^5d7c861d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent inflammatory, pruritic skin disease. The Janus kinase (JAK) pathway is a treatment target.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of topical cream brepocitinib, a small‐molecule tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)/JAK1 inhibitor, in participants with mild‐to‐moderate AD.

Methods

In this phase IIb, double‐blind, dose‐ranging study, participants were randomized to receive one of eight treatments for 6 weeks: brepocitinib 0·1% once daily (QD), 0·3% QD or twice daily (BID), 1·0% QD or BID, 3·0% QD, or vehicle QD or BID. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) total score at week 6. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored.

Results

Overall, 292 participants were enrolled and randomized. The brepocitinib 1% QD and 1% BID groups achieved statistically significantly greater (with multiplicity‐adjusted P < 0·05 due to Hochberg's step‐up method) percentage reductions from baseline in EASI total score at week 6 [least squares mean (90% confidence interval, CI): QD: –70·1 (–82·1 to –58·0); BID: –75·0 (–83·8 to –66·2)] compared with respective vehicle [QD: –44·4 (–57·3 to –31·6); BID: –47·6 (–57·5 to –37·7)]. There was not a dose‐dependent trend in AE frequency, and there were no serious AEs or deaths.

Conclusions

Topical brepocitinib is effective and well tolerated in participants with mild‐to‐moderate AD.

What is already known about this topic?
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are in development for treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD).
The tyrosine kinase 2 and JAK 1 inhibition by brepocitinib may bring a new profile for topical JAK inhibitors for treatment of mild‐to‐moderate AD.

What does this study add?
Topical brepocitinib can provide rapid, effective symptom reduction, and could offer a novel alternative to current topical treatments for mild‐to‐moderate AD.
