## Question

Can you give acetaminophen to patients before getting an egd?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether acetaminophen can be given before an EGD and, if so, how to structure timing, dosing, and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the rationale for preemptive analgesia and whether it aligns with EGD physiology and sedation practices. Then, I should verify fasting requirements and how oral acetaminophen fits within those constraints. Next, I will review pharmacokinetics to determine the optimal timing window. After that, I need to check safety considerations, including hepatic disease, drug interactions, and aspiration risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and confirm any exceptions or special populations that might alter the plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale. EGD can cause discomfort from oropharyngeal instrumentation, gagging, and anxiety. Preemptive analgesia is reasonable in procedural medicine, and acetaminophen is commonly used preemptively in perioperative pathways to reduce opioid requirements and improve recovery metrics, which supports the concept of giving it before a procedure when appropriate [^116KPyGq] [^115LTH27]. Hold on, I should verify whether any endoscopy guidelines explicitly endorse preemptive acetaminophen. I don't see a specific EGD guideline mandating it, but the principle of preemptive multimodal analgesia is consistent with ERAS and pain-control strategies, and acetaminophen's favorable safety profile makes it a reasonable choice when analgesia is desired before EGD [^116KPyGq] [^111nT54K].

> Next, I should review fasting requirements because oral acetaminophen must be timed around aspiration precautions. The ASA-aligned endoscopy guidance supports clear liquids up to 2 hours before sedation and a minimum 6-hour fast after a light meal; this means oral acetaminophen can be given as a clear liquid solution if administered at least 2 hours before the planned sedation, which fits standard pre-EGD preparation [^1124g94P] [^114W1MDg]. Wait, let me verify the liquid volume concern; small-volume oral medications are generally acceptable within the 2-hour clear-liquid window, and acetaminophen liquid volumes are modest, so this should not meaningfully increase gastric residual or aspiration risk when the 2-hour rule is observed [^1173CFF3] [^116XLLhA].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetics to set timing. Oral acetaminophen reaches peak plasma concentration in roughly 45–60 minutes, with onset of analgesia typically within 30 minutes. Therefore, administering a standard adult dose about 60–90 minutes before the procedure should provide therapeutic levels by the time of scope insertion, aligning with the 2-hour clear-liquid rule and maximizing preemptive benefit [^111nT54K] [^1119a2Nb]. Hold on, I should verify onset claims; multiple sources support clinically meaningful analgesia within 30 minutes, which supports a 60–90 minute pre-procedure window for oral dosing [^1119a2Nb] [^111nT54K].

> Now, dosing and formulation. For a typical adult without hepatic disease, a standard preemptive dose is 650–1000 mg orally. This is within FDA-labeled dosing for mild-to-moderate pain and aligns with perioperative practice patterns for preemptive analgesia, while remaining below the 4 g/day maximum in otherwise healthy adults [^112ampah] [^116KPyGq]. I should double-check that this dose does not conflict with any EGD-specific restrictions; I find no guideline prohibiting this preemptive approach, and the volume of a standard liquid acetaminophen dose is small enough to respect the 2-hour clear-liquid rule [^1173CFF3] [^116XLLhA].

> But wait, what about safety and contraindications. Acetaminophen does not increase bleeding risk like NSAIDs, which is advantageous in endoscopy, and it lacks the sedative or respiratory depressant effects of opioids, making it attractive when minimizing sedation-related risk is a priority [^111nT54K]. I need to ensure hepatic considerations are addressed; in patients with chronic liver disease or heavy alcohol use, limit total daily acetaminophen to 2 g or less and consider dose reduction or avoidance if hepatic impairment is significant, given dose-dependent hepatotoxicity risk and altered metabolism in cirrhosis [^116tuJdq]. Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interactions; enzyme inducers and concurrent hepatotoxic agents can increase risk, so a careful medication reconciliation is prudent before preemptive dosing in high-risk patients [^1141Fgfb].

> Aspiration risk deserves explicit attention. The key is timing the oral dose at least 2 hours before sedation and ensuring the patient adheres to fasting instructions; this minimizes gastric residual and aligns with ASA-endorsed fasting guidance for procedural sedation in endoscopy, which permits clear liquids up to 2 hours pre-procedure [^1124g94P] [^114W1MDg]. Hmm, wait a minute, could delayed gastric emptying change this calculus; in patients with known gastroparesis or other motility disorders, extending the fasting interval or avoiding oral premedication may be prudent, but for most elective EGD patients, the 2-hour clear-liquid rule with a small-volume oral dose is acceptable [^114W1MDg] [^1124g94P].

> Let me consider alternatives and special populations. If the patient cannot adhere to the 2-hour clear-liquid window or has significant aspiration risk, IV acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative, with rapid onset and predictable pharmacokinetics, though it requires IV access and adds cost; dosing is typically 1000 mg IV over 15 minutes, and it can be given closer to the procedure time without violating fasting constraints [^1157AYGH] [^111nT54K]. For pediatric patients, weight-based dosing with 10–15 mg/kg orally (or rectally if oral is not feasible) is standard, and preemptive strategies are commonly used in pediatric perioperative care; timing should still respect age-appropriate fasting rules and local sedation protocols [^116NNTF5] [^111nT54K].

> I should confirm that preemptive acetaminophen does not replace procedural analgesia or sedation planning. Sedation decisions should be individualized based on patient comorbidity, anxiety, and procedure complexity, with benzodiazepine–opioid combinations or propofol-based regimens commonly used when sedation is indicated; preemptive acetaminophen can be layered into a multimodal approach to reduce opioid requirements and improve comfort without interfering with sedation pharmacology [^1124g94P] [^115TxxFg]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; preemptive acetaminophen is adjunctive and should be documented in the pre-procedural plan alongside fasting instructions and sedation consent [^1124g94P].

> Putting this together, my practical recommendation is as follows: for a typical adult undergoing elective EGD with planned procedural sedation, administer 650–1000 mg of oral acetaminophen approximately 60–90 minutes before the procedure, ensuring it is taken at least 2 hours prior to sedation to comply with clear-liquid fasting guidance. Confirm no contraindications such as significant hepatic disease or interacting hepatotoxins, and adjust the total daily dose accordingly in those with liver disease or alcohol use disorder [^1124g94P] [^114W1MDg] [^116tuJdq]. If oral administration is not feasible or timing cannot be honored, consider IV acetaminophen 1000 mg as an alternative, recognizing the need for IV access and institutional protocols [^1157AYGH]. I should double-check that this plan aligns with the evidence and guidelines cited; yes, it respects fasting rules, leverages preemptive analgesia principles, and uses standard, safe dosing within labeled parameters [^1124g94P] [^116KPyGq] [^112ampah].

Patients can receive **acetaminophen before EGD** for mild pain or fever, as it does not increase bleeding risk or interact with sedation [^111nT54K]. It should be given **≥ 2 hours pre-procedure** to meet fasting guidelines and avoid aspiration risk [^1124g94P] [^114W1MDg]. Use standard adult dosing (650–1,000 mg PO/IV) and avoid exceeding 3,000–4,000 mg/day; reduce dose in liver disease or chronic alcohol use [^1157AYGH] [^116tuJdq]. Acetaminophen is preferred over NSAIDs pre-EGD because it does not increase gastrointestinal bleeding risk [^111nT54K].

---

## Clinical considerations for acetaminophen administration before EGD

### Pharmacological properties relevant to EGD

- **Analgesic and antipyretic effects**: Acetaminophen is effective for mild-to-moderate pain and fever, common pre-EGD complaints [^113pMYfc].

- **Lack of anti-inflammatory activity**: Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not significantly affect platelet function or gastrointestinal mucosa, reducing bleeding risk [^111nT54K].

- **Hepatic metabolism**: Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver; caution is needed in patients with hepatic impairment or chronic alcohol use [^112WnnZb].

---

### Potential benefits of acetaminophen administration before EGD

Pre-procedural acetaminophen can **reduce mild pain or fever**, improving patient comfort and cooperation during EGD. Compared with NSAIDs, it has minimal gastrointestinal and bleeding risks, making it a safer pre-EGD option [^111nT54K].

---

### Potential risks and contraindications

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Risk increases with overdose, chronic alcohol use, or hepatic impairment; keep total daily dose ≤ 3,000–4,000 mg [^1134x8QL].

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare hypersensitivity can occur; assess allergy history before administration.

- **Drug interactions**: Minimal, but review all medications for potential interactions.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Although no guideline specifically addresses pre-EGD acetaminophen, **general endoscopy sedation and pre-procedural guidelines support its safe use**:

- **Fasting guidelines**: Patients should fast ≥ 2 hours after clear liquids and ≥ 6 hours after solids before sedation; acetaminophen can be given ≥ 2 hours pre-procedure if oral [^1124g94P] [^114W1MDg].

- **Sedation guidelines**: Acetaminophen does not interact with sedatives and can be used in multimodal regimens [^116KPyGq].

- **Liver disease considerations**: Use caution and reduce dose in hepatic impairment or chronic alcohol use [^116tuJdq].

---

## Clinical scenarios where acetaminophen may be beneficial

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for acetaminophen use** |
|-|-|
| Mild pre-procedural pain or discomfort | Effective analgesia without gastrointestinal bleeding risk [^111nT54K] |
| Fever or mild inflammation | Antipyretic effect improves comfort and cooperation [^113pMYfc] |
| Patients with NSAID contraindications | Safe alternative for mild pain control [^111nT54K] |
| Patients with bleeding disorders or anticoagulant use | Minimal effect on platelet function and bleeding risk [^111nT54K] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where acetaminophen should be avoided or used with caution

- **Severe hepatic impairment**: Increased risk of hepatotoxicity; use reduced dose or avoid [^116tuJdq].

- **Chronic alcohol use**: Increased risk of hepatotoxicity; use reduced dose [^112cs1eu].

- **Allergy to acetaminophen**: Contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity.

- **High risk of aspiration**: Use caution with oral administration close to sedation [^1124g94P].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

- **Standard adult dose**: 650–1,000 mg orally or intravenously, administered ≥ 2 hours before the procedure if given orally [^1157AYGH].

- **Maximum daily dose**: 3,000–4,000 mg/day, depending on clinical context and patient factors [^notfound].

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Reduce dose and monitor liver function tests [^116tuJdq].

---

## Alternative analgesic options

NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) are effective for pain but **increase gastrointestinal bleeding risk** and should generally be avoided pre-EGD [^116tuJdq]. Opioids are effective for moderate-to-severe pain but carry risks of sedation, respiratory depression, and nausea, making them less suitable pre-EGD unless specifically indicated [^111sPiDy].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Patients can receive **acetaminophen before EGD** for mild pain or fever, as it does not increase bleeding risk or interact with sedation [^113pMYfc] [^111nT54K]. Give **oral acetaminophen ≥ 2 hours pre-procedure** to meet fasting guidelines and reduce aspiration risk [^1124g94P] [^114W1MDg]. Use standard adult dosing (650–1,000 mg PO/IV) and avoid exceeding 3,000–4,000 mg/day; reduce dose in liver disease or chronic alcohol use [^1157AYGH] [^112ampah] [^116tuJdq]. Acetaminophen is preferred over NSAIDs pre-EGD because it does not increase gastrointestinal bleeding risk [^111nT54K].

Endoscopy in pregnancy — safety, timing, and anesthesia considerations are specified: EGD appears safe in pregnancy, with 95% of patients undergoing EGD delivering healthy infants. If possible, all endoscopic procedures should be deferred until the second trimester of pregnancy. For endoscopic procedures, midazolam, meperidine, fentanyl, and propofol are acceptable for use in pregnancy, but the FDA warned in 2017 about possible fetal brain damage and subsequent impairment of neurocognitive function after prolonged (> 3 hours) or frequent exposure to general anesthetics and sedatives, including midazolam and propofol, during the third trimester; minimizing fetal exposure to anesthetic agents during pregnancy should be the goal, and preoperative evaluation by a MFM specialist is recommended.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, repeat-dose study of two intravenous acetaminophen dosing regimens for the treatment of pain after abdominal laparoscopic surgery [^1157AYGH]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous acetaminophen has been approved in Europe and elsewhere for the treatment of acute pain and fever, and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of mild to moderate pain, the management of moderate to severe pain with adjunctive opioid analgesics, and the reduction of fever.

Objective

The aim of this work was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of repeated doses of 2 dosing regimens of intravenous acetaminophen compared with placebo over 24 hours in subjects with moderate to severe pain after abdominal laparoscopic surgery.

Methods

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted at 17 sites in the United States and enrolled adult subjects (aged 18–80 years) who were randomized to 4 groups (IV acetaminophen 1000 mg [100 mL] q6h; IV acetaminophen 650 mg [65 mL] q4h; IV placebo 100 mL q6h; or IV placebo 65 mL q4h), each given as a 15-minute infusion after surgery for 24 hours. An open-label extension was offered to all subjects who remained in the hospital beyond the study period. Two subjects (1 in the placebo 100 mL q6h group and 1 in the IV acetaminophen 1000 mg q6h group) were enrolled in the open-label extension and were eligible to receive unblinded IV acetaminophen 1000 mg. Before randomization, the choice of opioid for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) rescue was left to the investigator; however, acetaminophen-containing products, NSAIDs, and aspirin were not allowed. The morning after abdominal laparoscopic surgery procedure, subjects' PCA was withheld until pain intensity (PI) was moderate (2) or severe (3) on a categorical scale (range, 0–3) and between 40 and 70 mm, inclusive, on a 100-mm visual analog scale, at which point they were randomized. After the first dose of study medication, intravenous rescue was restricted to morphine or hydromorphone, and oral rescue was restricted to morphine or oxycodone immediate-release tablets. Efficacy analyses were performed using the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, defined as all randomized subjects who received ≥ 1 complete dose of study medication before requesting rescue medication, and who had ≥ 1 completed PI/pain relief (PR) assessment after baseline. The primary efficacy end point was the weighted sum of PI differences over 24 hours (SPID24) using an ANCOVA model. Time to meaningful PR was documented after the first dose of study medication using a double-stopwatch method: at T0, 2 stopwatches were started, and subjects were instructed to stop the first stopwatch when they felt perceptible PR and the second when it became meaningful. Safety was assessed via spontaneous adverse event (AE) reporting and laboratory tests.

Results

A total of 349 subjects were screened before elective surgery for eligibility. Of these, 244 subjects were randomized to a study arm (IV acetaminophen 1000 mg [n = 92]; IV acetaminophen 650 mg [n = 42]; IV placebo 100 mL [n = 43]; or IV placebo 65 mL [n = 67]) and included in the ITT population, of whom 81.1% (198/244) were women and 87.3% (213/244) were white; the mean (SD) age was 46.2 (12.51) years (range, 18–78 years), and the mean weight was 174.3 (35.7) lb (range, 103–284 lb). There was an allocation error in the contract research organization's program linking group assignment and kit randomization; therefore, the original randomization procedure was replaced with a modified randomization schedule created by an independent biostatistician under the supervision of the FDA. The mITT population included 241 subjects; of these, 227 completed 24 hours of treatment. Four subjects withdrew before completing treatment because of AEs (1 subject in the placebo group because of fever and 3 in the IV acetaminophen 1000 mg q6h group because of infusion-site pain [n = 1] or infiltration [n = 2]), 8 because of withdrawal of consent, 2 because of early discharge from the hospital, and 2 for other reasons. Only 2 subjects participated in the elective open-label extension. Both intravenous acetaminophen dosing regimens were associated with significantly reduced SPID24 compared with placebo (1000 mg q6h, P < 0.007; 650 mg q4h, P < 0.019). Among the mITT population, SPID24 (using nonimputed data after first rescue: 1000 mg q6h, P < 0.001; 650 mg q4h, P = 0.020), sum of PR scores over 24 hours (1000 mg q6h, P < 0.001; 650 mg q4h, P = 0.003) and 12 hours (1000 mg q6h, P < 0.001; 650 mg q4h, P = 0.001), and subjects' global evaluations at 24 hours (1000 mg q6h, P < 0.001; 650 mg q4h, P = 0.005) were statistically significant in favor of both acetaminophen dosing regimens compared with the combined placebo group. Time to meaningful PR (by double stopwatch method) after the first dose was significantly shorter among subjects who received IV acetaminophen 1000 mg compared with subjects in the placebo 100 mL group (median of 24.9 vs 53.9 minutes, respectively). The most common overall AEs (ie, those that occurred in > 10% of any group) were constipation, flatulence, nausea, and headache. The frequency of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) across the treatment groups was not statistically significant. Most TEAEs were deemed to be unrelated to study medication. There were 6 subjects with serious TEAEs (1 [0.9%] in the IV acetaminophen 1000 mg group, 3 [7.0%] in the IV acetaminophen 650 mg group, and 2 [1.8%] in the placebo group). There was 1 (2.3%) related hepatic TEAE (transaminase increased) in the placebo group.

Conclusion

Both regimens of intravenous acetaminophen (1000 mg q6h and 650 mg q4h) were associated with statistically significant analgesic efficacy compared with placebo and were well tolerated in these adults after abdominal laparoscopic surgery. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00564486.

LIMITATIONS

We are aware that this study has its limitations. First, we included patients presenting with pain of different origin, location, and quality. It is possible that acetaminophen may have morphine‐sparing potential in certain subgroups, as has been shown in postoperative patients. However, our group size was too small to perform subgroup analyses. Second, we only included patients at two sites, both in academic EDs in cities with a similar population. External validity is therefore limited. Third, we did not include patients with mild to moderate pain, but rather with severe pain (around 8/10 NRS) and administered about 12 mg (or 0.15 mg/kg) of morphine for pain relief. Totally administered doses of about 16 mg (or 0.2 mg/kg) within 4 h could be considered high. However, a dose of 0.1 mg/kg has been shown to lack an effect in most ED patients. Doses of 0.15 mg/kg have been shown to be statistically — but not clinically — superior. We can only speculate whether results might be similar in patients with less pain or in other locations (about half of our patients suffered from abdominal or flank pain). Fourth, we had a number of exclusion criteria, particularly previous analgesia, and were therefore only able to recruit about 5% of all patients presenting at daytime, in spite of extensive screening. We did not screen at night, which could also be cause to an inclusion bias, as patients presenting at night could be different. Fifth, despite a nonsignificant difference in the two groups, the lower CI in the acetaminophen group in the time‐to‐pain‐relief analysis could theoretically indicate a shorter time to pain relief. Finally, we did not assess other patient‐related outcomes besides pain, realizing that pain is not all that matters to patients.

Preprocedure quality standards

Patients should be assessed for fitness to undergo a diagnostic OGD.

Level of agreement: 100%

Grade of evidence: weak

Strength of recommendation: strong

An assessment of pre-existing conditions and medications should be made before performing an OGD. This can be integrated into the booking-in process or within a preprocedure checklist to avoid duplication. Where changes to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy are indicated in accordance with existing guidelines, the management strategy should be both documented and communicated to the patient.

Patients should receive appropriate information about the procedure, before undergoing an OGD.

Level of agreement: 100%

Grade of evidence: weak

Strength of recommendation: s trong

In order to be able to give informed consent, information about the proposed procedure and its associated risks must be explained. As the majority of OGDs are performed on an elective basis, information should be provided before the procedure date, with an opportunity to ask questions. There is evidence that information can improve patient experience. Combined written and oral information appears to be better understood than oral information alone, with little evidence for the use of videotaped information. Evidence suggests that patients prefer more information rather than less. However, it is noted that anxiety correlates with age and gender and may influence the way in which information is delivered. There is little to suggest who is best suited to delivering patient information, but in most cases it would be expected to be the referrer proposing or arranging investigations.

An appropriate time slot should be allocated dependent on procedure indications and patient characteristics.

Level of agreement: 100%

Grade of evidence: weak

Strength of recommendation: strong

It is recognised that the time taken to perform an OGD varies depending on indication, pathology and patient factors. Certain clinical indications — for example, the surveillance of premalignant conditions, require careful inspection and possibly the use of advanced imaging and are therefore expected to take longer.

In Barrett's surveillance there is some evidence that a 'Barrett's inspection time' of > 1 min/cm is associated with a significantly greater detection of high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. We would recommend that a standard diagnostic endoscopy is allocated a slot of a minimum of 20 min, increasing as appropriate for surveillance or high-risk conditions.

Pre-procedure quality indicators

Preparation

All individuals undergoing endoscopy should be accurately informed about the procedure, indications for it, the risks it will entail, and the management of potential complications. Preparation of the patient includes proper fasting instructions – a key performance measure according to the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). Based on available data, ESGE defines the adequate time of fasting as at least 2 h for liquids and 6 h for solids. Although not included in the guidelines, patients with known delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) may benefit from a longer duration of fasting (e.g. overnight fasting) on a case-by-case basis. Before EGD, patients should receive an easily understandable take-home information sheet about the procedure, and, unless it is an emergency procedure, informed signed consent should always be obtained.

Preparation for the procedure also includes an assessment of the patient's health status. The most common clinical issues requiring attention before endoscopy include management of diabetes, anticoagulation treatment, the need for prophylactic antibiotics, and sedation requirements. The American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) score is the most commonly used scoring system to categorize patients by their physiological status to predict the operative risk. ASA scores classify patients into six categories (ASA 1–6), ranging from a normal healthy patient, through a patient with mild and severe systemic disease, up to moribund and brain-dead patient, as presented in Table 2.

There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that surgical safety checklists can prevent errors and thus impact positively on patient morbidity and mortality. Although there is no standardized checklist for the use of endoscopy, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) defined basal domains that should be included in such a document: patient identifiers (name/hospital number/date of birth); allergies; medications and conditions that may preclude any interventions, such as use of anticoagulation or significant comorbidities; patient understanding of proposed test; completion of a consent form.

### Acetaminophen pharmacokinetics in severely obese adolescents and young adults [^111RnTMi]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous acetaminophen is commonly administered as an adjunctive to opioids during major surgical procedures, but neither the correct pharmacokinetic size descriptor nor the dose is certain in severely obese adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery.

Methods

Adolescents, 14–20 years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex or BMI ≥ 40 kg·m⁻², presenting for laparoscopic or robotic assisted or vertical sleeve gastrectomy were administered intravenous acetaminophen (1000 mg) following completion of the surgical procedure. Venous blood was drawn for acetaminophen assay at eight time points, starting 15 minutes after completion of the infusion and up to 12 hours afterward. Time-concentration data profiles were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects models. Parameter estimates were scaled to a 70-kg person using allometry. Normal fat mass was used to assess the impact of obesity on pharmacokinetic parameters.

Results

The study cohort comprised 11 female patients, age 17 SD 2 years with a weight of 125 SD 19 kg and a mean BMI of 46 SD 5 kg·m -2. The plasma acetaminophen serum concentration was 17 (SD 4) μg·mL⁻¹ at 10–20 minutes after completion of the infusion and 5 (SD 6) μg·mL⁻¹ at 80–100 minutes. A two-compartment model, used to investigate pharmacokinetics, estimated clearance 10.6 (CV 72%) L·h·70 kg⁻¹, intercompartment clearance 37.3 (CV 63%) L·h·70 kg⁻¹, central volume of distribution 20.4 (CV 46%) L·70 kg⁻¹, and peripheral volume of distribution 16.8 (CV 42%) L·70 kg⁻¹. Clearance was best described using total body weight. Normal fat mass with a parameter that accounts for fat mass contribution (Ffat) of 0.88 best described volumes.

Conclusion

Current recommendations of acetaminophen to a maximum dose of 1000 mg resulted in serum concentrations below detection limits in all patients within 2 hours after administration. Dose is better predicted using total body mass with allometric scaling.

### Effect of maximal daily doses of acetaminophen on the liver of alcoholic patients… [^1141Fgfb]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine if hepatic injury was associated with maximal therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen to chronic alcohol abuse patients immediately following cessation of alcohol intake. Methods. ACETAMINOPHEN is a safe and effective analgesic and antipyretic when used appropriately. When taken in overdose, particularly large intentional overdose, acetaminophen can cause fulminant hepatic failure and death. In recent years, retrospective case reports and case series have suggested that alcoholic patients may be at risk of acetaminophen-induced hepatic injury and even death following the ingestion of recommended therapeutic doses of acetaminophen. 1 Since the prevalence of alcoholism in the United States is 5% to 10%, 2 a potentially fatal drug-drug interaction could have far-reaching public health consequences.

For example, long-term alcohol use has been shown in animals to induce the activity of CYP2E1, increase the amount of NAPQI produced, and increase the hepatic injury caused by a single, large dose of acetaminophen. 6 Case reports and retrospective case series have described alcoholic patients who developed fulminant hepatic failure in association with doses of acetaminophen reportedly within the recommended 4 g/d. 1, 7 However, data from human studies are conflicting and the preponderance of data do not indicate that the amount of reactive intermediate produced is increased in the alcoholic patient. 3, 8–10. It seems likely that patients will seek alternative over-the-counter pain medications. Nearly all of these products are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Since nonsteroidal medications can produce gastric ulcers and increase the risk of death, 11 their use in alcoholic patients can be dangerous.

12 Because of the serious implications, the magnitude of over-the-counter analgesic and alcohol use and the lack of prospective data, we performed a randomized controlled trial to determine if hepatic injury was associated with maximal therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen to chronic alcohol abuse patients immediately following cessation of alcohol intake. A comparison between subjects who participated in the study and those who failed screening or withdrew before treatment showed that the experimental and excluded groups did not differ significantly for sex, race, BMI, or baseline AST, ALT, and INR values. Excluded subjects were about 3 years younger than included subjects, had higher GGT values, and had fewer self-reported alcoholic subjects.

### Providing safe sedation / analgesia: an anesthesiologist's perspective [^113AouTB]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Over the past several years office-based procedures with sedation have become increasingly more common. It must be appreciated that not all procedures are well suited for this type of environment. Unacceptable ones would include those associated with significant fluid shifts, post-operative pain, bleeding or procedures of long duration. Since esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy are relatively non-invasive, of short duration, and not associated with either fluid shifts or significant post-procedure discomfort. In appropriate patients, these procedures are well-suited to office-based practice.

### Effect of preemptive acetaminophen on opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^115LTH27]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Strategies for reducing postoperative opioid consumption have been explored in many recent studies, due in large part to the recent opioid epidemic. Preemptive analgesia has been proposed as a potential method, but its use is still controversial.

Objectives

This review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of acetaminophen as preemptive analgesia for patients undergoing general anesthesia.

Study Design

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Setting

The electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science were searched. The protocol was previously registered in the PROSPERO database under the registration number CRD 42020165634.

Methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. RCTs that compared preemptive acetaminophen with placebo in surgical patients receiving general anesthesia were included. The risk of bias for each included study was independently assessed using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Results

Six studies with 563 patients were included. Overall, the studies showed a reduction in 24-hour opioid consumption (standardized mean difference [SMD], -1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.36 to -0.55; P = 0.002), pain scores at 12 hours postoperatively (SMD, -0.86; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.48; P < 0.0001), and a lower incidence of postoperative nausea (risk ratio [RR] 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34–0.58; P < 0.001) and vomiting (RR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22–0.72; P = 0.002).

Limitations

The major limitation of this meta-analysis relates to the risk of bias in the limited number of included studies.

Conclusions

Preemptive acetaminophen administration significantly reduces opioid consumption within the initial 24 hours following general anesthesia, with lower pain scores at 12 hours after surgery, and less nausea and vomiting. However, well-conducted RCTs are still needed.

### Clinical outcomes and safety of upper endoscopy while on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^1142vqLy]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucose-like peptide-1-receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have become integral to the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. GLP-1RAs work in part through delaying gastric emptying, raising concerns about retained gastric contents (RGC) during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). 1 The American Society of Anesthesiologists currently recommends holding GLP-1RAs for 1 dosing cycle before elective procedures, however, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) advocates proceeding with endoscopy in asymptomatic patients adhering to standard perioperative protocols without medication withholding and suggests implementing a liquid diet the day before endoscopy in lieu of stopping the medication. 2,3 This variability in recommendations stems largely from a lack of GLP-1RA outcomes data from which to draw evidence-based conclusions.

### Acetaminophen for analgesia following pyloromyotomy: does the route of administration make a difference? [^111nT54K]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen is a commonly used non-opioid analgesic with a well-established safety and tolerability profile. Hepatotoxicity is rare when used at therapeutic doses. It does not have the negative adverse effect profile that is associated with opioids (sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, and abuse potential). In addition, unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not compromise renal function or increase the risk of bleeding. Acetaminophen is commercially available in many formulations. Rectal acetaminophen is a common route of administration. Although standard dosing of rectal acetaminophen is similar to oral dosing (10–15 mg/kg), more recent pharmacokinetic studies suggest that a larger initial loading dose (40 mg/kg) is required to achieve the desired plasma concentration. The preemptive administration of rectal acetaminophen has been shown to lower pain scores and decrease the need for rescue analgesia in patients, ranging from 7 years to 15 years of age, in various surgical procedures. However, due to its unpredictable systemic absorption, rectal acetaminophen's efficacy has been debated in medical literature. IV acetaminophen was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in November 2010 for the management of mild-to-moderate pain, as an adjunct to opioids for the management of moderate-to-severe pain, and the reduction in fever. As compared with peak acetaminophen plasma concentrations following oral (45–60 minutes) and rectal administration (4 hours), IV acetaminophen results in rapid peak plasma concentrations at 15 minutes following infusion and an analgesic effect as quickly as 5 minutes with a duration of action up to 4 hours. Information regarding IV acetaminophen use and dosing strategies for neonates and infants is limited. Acetaminophen clearance reaches 84% of mature values by 1 year of age; however, clearance is decreased in neonates when compared with adults. The opioid-sparing effect of IV acetaminophen remains controversial. Sinatra et al reported a decreased need for rescue opioid therapy and a reduction in 24-hour total opioid consumption in adults undergoing major orthopedic surgery. Dashti et al and Korpela et al reported opioid-sparing effects with either rectal or IV administration. However, Hiller et al noted no effect on total opioid needs with IV acetaminophen after major spine surgery in children and adolescents.

### Premedication with sublingual or oral alprazolam in adults undergoing diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy [^113CRs2w]. Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aim

Diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is uncomfortable for most patients. We determined the efficacy of alprazolam, administered orally or sublingually, as premedication for sedation during EGD.

Patients and Methods

Adult EGD candidates were randomly allocated to four groups (n = 55, each group) and received alprazolam (0.5mg) sublingually or orally, placebo sublingually or orally at 30 minutes before EGD. Main outcome measures included procedure-related anxiety and pain/discomfort (assessed using 11-point numeric scales), patient overall tolerance (assessed using a 4-point Likert scale), need for intravenous sedation, and willingness to repeat the EGD if necessary.

Results

Patients experienced greater reduction in anxiety score after medication with sublingual alprazolam (mean 2.25, standard deviation [SD] 1.73) compared with sublingual placebo (mean 0.10, standard error [SE] 0.15]; P < 0.001) and oral alprazolam (0.63, SE 0.14; P < 0.001). Also, pain/discomfort scores were lower with sublingual alprazolam compared with sublingual placebo (3.29, SE 0.29 vs. 4.16, SD 1.86; P = 0.024), and with oral alprazolam compared with oral placebo (3.48, SD 1.69 vs. 5.13, SD 2.39; P < 0.001). Patient overall tolerance was better with sublingual alprazolam than with sublingual placebo (P = 0.005) or with oral alprazolam (P = 0.009). Regarding intravenous sedation, there was no difference between sublingual alprazolam and sublingual placebo (10.9% vs. 10.9%; P = 0.619) or between oral alprazolam and oral placebo (9.0% vs. 12.7%; P = 0.381). Willingness to repeat the procedure was greater with sublingual alprazolam than with sublingual placebo (50.9% vs. 30.9%; P = 0.026).

Conclusions

Sublingual alprazolam is an effective premedication for sedation during EGD. It reduces anxiety and pain/discomfort related to EGD and increases patient tolerance and willingness to repeat the EGD if necessary.

### Acute medication poisoning [^115tSTi2]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for acetaminophen overdose, more specifically with respect to gastrointestinal decontamination, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering a single dose of activated charcoal PO or by nasogastric tube if the ingestion of a potentially toxic amount of medication occurred within 1 hour of presentation. Do not administer activated charcoal in patients without an intact or protected airway.

### Consensus-based recommendations on management of acetaminophen poisoning… [^111MhsX3]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

When there is a strong clinical concern of acute overdose, acetylcysteine should be administered before the acetaminophen concentration is available, if waiting for testing will result in treatment starting more than 8 hours after ingestion. A prior anaphylactoid reaction is not a contraindication for administration of NAC during a subsequent overdose. Objective To develop consensus guidelines for the management of acetaminophen poisoning in the US and Canada. Evidence Review. When acetaminophen is coingested with anticholinergic or opioid agonist medications, the clinical concern is that acetaminophen absorption may be delayed or prolonged. Management is the same as with other acetaminophen products except that if the first acetaminophen concentration measured at 4 to 24 hours after ingestion is 10 μg/mL or less, another measurement need not be taken and acetylcysteine treatment is not needed.

If any concentration is above the treatment line, acetylcysteine is needed. Enhanced elimination is recommended when a very large ingestion has occurred. The consensus panel concurred with the extracorporeal treatment of poisoning. 14 Hemodialysis is recommended in addition to treatment with acetylcysteine in a patient with an acetaminophen concentration of 900 μg/mL or greater with acidosis or altered consciousness due to acetaminophen toxic effects. If the intravenous route is used, the rate of acetylcysteine infusion should be at least 12. 5 mg/kg per hour during hemodialysis. The oral acetylcysteine regimen does not require adjustment during hemodialysis. This mistake is potentially fatal; thus, it is recommended that if there is any doubt about the history, the patient receive acetylcysteine.

This approach may result in some patients receiving acetylcysteine unnecessarily, but because acetylcysteine is a relatively safe and inexpensive drug, the trade-off of overtreatment with potentially unneeded acetylcysteine is acceptable. The introduction of extended-release acetaminophen formulations has caused consternation because of concerns it could prolong absorption and result in high blood concentrations of acetaminophen later than expected in the course. Clinical experience has not supported this concern, although there have been case outliers. The panel concluded that management of extended-release preparations is the same as that of other acetaminophen products, with the exception of obtaining a second acetaminophen blood concentration in some cases.

### Acetaminophen for analgesia following pyloromyotomy: does the route of administration make a difference? [^115ZapLr]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

During the perioperative care of infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, an opioid-sparing technique is often advocated due to concerns such as postoperative hypoventilation and apnea. Although the rectal administration of acetaminophen is commonly employed, an intravenous (IV) preparation is also currently available, but only limited data are available regarding IV acetaminophen use for infants undergoing pyloromyotomy. The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy of IV and rectal acetaminophen for postoperative analgesia in infants undergoing laparoscopic pyloromyotomy.

Methods

A retrospective review of the use of IV and rectal acetaminophen in infants undergoing laparoscopic pyloromyotomy was performed. The efficacy was assessed by evaluating the perioperative need for supplemental analgesic agents, postoperative pain scores, tracheal extubation time, time in the postanesthesia care unit, time to oral feeding, and time to hospital discharge.

Results

The study cohort included 68 patients, of whom 34 patients received IV acetaminophen and 34 received rectal acetaminophen. All patients also received local infiltration of the surgical site with 0.25% bupivacaine. No intraoperative opioids were administered. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to postoperative pain scores, need for supplemental analgesic agents, time in the postanesthesia care unit, or time in the hospital. There was no difference in the number of children who tolerated oral feeds on the day of surgery or in postoperative complications.

Conclusion

Our preliminary data suggest that there is no clinical difference or advantage with the use of IV versus rectal acetaminophen in infants undergoing laparoscopic pyloromyotomy.

However, not all anesthesiologists consider purgatives for bowel preparation to be clear liquids and therefore may prefer longer intervals before initiating sedation. Observational studies of patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) before colonoscopy have demonstrated no excess gastric volumes when comparing split-dose with day prior preparations.

### Lidocaine lollipop as single-agent anesthesia in upper GI endoscopy [^112SxT2K]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Conscious sedation is usually achieved during EGD by a combination of intravenous benzodiazepines and opiates; however, these have potential serious adverse effects. The addition of topical oropharyngeal anesthetics such as lidocaine may be useful. Recent data suggest that the administration of topical lidocaine by means of a lollipop is effective for endotracheal intubation and bronchoscopy.

Objective

Our purpose was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a lidocaine lollipop as single-agent anesthesia for EGD and to determine whether its use reduces the need for intravenous sedatives and analgesics.

Design

Single-blinded, randomized, prospective study.

Setting

University hospital.

Patients

50 patients undergoing diagnostic EGD.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to either lidocaine lollipop or lidocaine spray. Intravenous meperidine and midazolam were administered during the procedure as needed.

Main Outcome Measurements

The success and safety of local anesthesia by lidocaine lollipop in addition to the need for intravenous sedation.

Results

Patients were equally randomized between the lollipop and the spray groups. The lollipop group had less gag reflex, accommodated scope introduction more, and tolerated the procedure better. Thirty-two percent of patients receiving the lollipop required sedation compared with 96% of patients in the spray group (P < .001). The majority in the lollipop group were satisfied with their mode of anesthesia compared with the spray group.

Conclusions

Lidocaine lollipop is a promising form of local oropharyngeal anesthesia for EGD. Its use resulted in sparing the use of intravenous sedation. It is well tolerated and safe and may be particularly important in the elderly, patients with comorbidities, and office-based endoscopy.

Sedation

Sedation practices in endoscopy are highly diverse. There is no consensus on which procedures warrant sedation, who should administer it, and which sedatives should be used. These variations have a different source of origin, but relate mostly to different health care policies, cultural norms, and endoscopic training.

In recent years, the impact of sedation on the safety and quality of endoscopy has been increasingly discussed. Although no studies have directly analyzed the influence of sedation on EGD diagnostic performance, several reports have shown that sedation can significantly increase patient cooperation, satisfaction, and willingness to repeat the procedure. The recent Asian consensus recommends the use of sedation to enhance the detection rate of superficial neoplasm of the esophagus and stomach. In practical terms, the use of sedation should always be encouraged in high-risk patients who require longer and more complex examinations (e.g. a long segment of BE, premalignant stomach, genetic cancer syndromes). In general, there are three different levels of sedation, which, broadly, can vary from "light" through "deep" sedation, up to general anesthesia. The endoscopist should target the level of sedation accordingly to the planned procedure taking into consideration its complexity, invasiveness, and estimated time of the procedure. Light to moderate sedation ("conscious sedation") is sufficient for most endoscopic procedures. Conscious sedation can usually be achieved with a combination of benzodiazepines and opioids or, propofol with or without adjunct of benzodiazepines.

Selected patients may be able to undergo endoscopic procedures without sedation. This decision should be carefully balanced, taking into consideration patient characteristics and local health care policies. A previous study analyzing patients' attitudes towards diagnostic EGDs has shown that male gender and younger age were associated with a lower rate of sedation preference. Moreover, previous exposure to endoscopy reduced the level of discomfort during subsequent examinations.

To standardize the practice of sedation in endoscopy, ASGE released guidelines on sedation in endoscopy for non-anesthesiologists. In general, light and moderate sedation can be delivered safely by endoscopists to patients who are ASA Class I, II, or III. Minimal patient monitoring includes an electronic assessment of blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry, and the visual assessment of ventilatory activity, level of consciousness, and discomfort. The American quality recommendations also advise that before administrating sedation and inserting the scope, a team pause should be made (and documented), during which the team makes clear that they have the correct patient and are performing the appropriate procedure.

Management of APAP overdose

After a single‐time‐point APAP overdose, symptoms of nausea and vomiting ensue within 12–24 h, peaking at about 72 h, and resolving rapidly thereafter. The severity of necrosis is linked to the extent of excess dosing and can lead to hyperacute ALF because of its rapid onset. Administration of oral or intravenous NAC is an effective antidote, given as a loading dose followed by maintenance doses over several days. If NAC is administered within 12 h of ingestion, it virtually assures that the liver damage will be minimal. The characteristic laboratory profile of APAP hepatotoxicity includes very high aminotransferase levels with low bilirubin. The coagulopathy can be severe, and a prolonged INR is a bad prognostic sign.

Management in the early hours after an APAP overdose includes activated charcoal by ingestion or gavage, and certainly NAC, even if given more than 12 h after APAP ingestion. For unintentional cases, NAC is also given, although its efficacy may be limited. Development of signs and symptoms of liver failure (encephalopathy, primarily) are concerning, and once they are present, nearly one‐third of patients either die or require a liver transplant. The remaining patients make a full and complete recovery within 7 days.

Prognosis

Several prognostic scores have been developed and evaluated including the King's College Hospital score, Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score, and the Acute Liver Failure Study Group prognostic index. In countries in which the over‐the‐counter sale of APAP has been restricted, the incidence of serious APAP toxicity has fallen. Outcomes have also generally improved over the past two decades, likely because of improvements in intensive care, with only 8% of patients undergoing transplantation.

Guidance statements

45 APAP is a dose‐dependent hepatotoxin that leads to acute pericentral liver injury when doses exceeding 4 g are ingested within a 24‐h period or excessive doses over several days.
46 APAP overdose is the leading cause of ALF among adults in the United States.
47 A diagnosis of APAP hepatotoxicity relies on a history of excessive APAP ingestion, detection of an elevated serum APAP level following single‐time‐point ingestion, and exclusion of competing causes of acute hepatocellular liver injury.
48 Gastric lavage and activated charcoal should be given to all patients presenting within 4 h of a single‐time‐point APAP overdose.
49 Intravenous or orally administered NAC can prevent liver injury nearly completely if given within 12 h of ingestion, but is also recommended for patients presenting later.
50 The prognosis in APAP‐related ALF is related to the degree of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis.

### Guidelines for sedation and anesthesia in GI endoscopy [^1124g94P]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2018). Medium credibility.

Pre-procedural preparation and assessment for sedation in GI endoscopy — Patients "should provide informed consent for administration of sedation through a process that involves a discussion of benefits, risks, and limitations as well as possible alternatives to the sedation plan". "As much as possible, the level of sedation targeted should be commensurate with the patient's expectation of sedation depth as well as that necessary to perform the procedure safely and effectively". Because of aspiration risk, "patients undergoing sedation should be asked to fast for a specific time period". The ASA guidelines indicate that patients "should not drink fluids or eat solid foods for a sufficient period of time to allow for gastric emptying before the procedure", and specifically, patients "should fast a minimum of 2 hours after ingestion of clear liquids and 6 hours after ingestion of light meals before sedation is administered". The document also notes "There are no data to support a direct relationship between duration of fasting and the risk of pulmonary aspiration" and "There is no practice standard for pre-procedural fasting that has been universally accepted".

### The effect of pre-procedural anxiety level on the quality of upper GI endoscopy in non-sedated patients: "can the need for sedation be predicted? " [^111KvUeL]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, the findings of this study, which examined the effect of patients' anxiety levels before EGD on procedure quality using reliable scales such as STAI and was conducted with one of the largest patient populations, suggest that routine assessment of anxiety levels before endoscopy in non-sedated patients may contribute to the development of more effective and personalized management strategies. In particular, patients with elevated anxiety levels can be readily identified through the administration of the STAI score assessment prior to the procedure. The cutoff value derived from the ROC analysis in this study may serve as a reliable indicator for predicting the necessity of sedation. It is recommended that routine STAI score assessment prior to endoscopy be more integrated into clinical decision-making processes. Consequently, patients exhibiting elevated anxiety levels can be effectively sedated in a proactive manner, thereby enhancing the quality of the procedure and patient satisfaction. This strategy also offers a cost-effective approach, to reduce the additional costs associated with unnecessary sedation and potential complications related to sedation. Therefore, a more precise identification of the necessity for sedation may enhance the safety and efficacy of clinical practice. Nevertheless, multicenter, prospective studies with greater enrollment are essential to substantiate this recommendation in a broader population. Such studies are crucial to ascertain the generalizability of the findings across diverse patient groups and to gain a deeper insight into the utilization of anxiety-based management strategies in routine clinical settings.

Introduction

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is an essential procedure for diagnosing and treating many gastrointestinal conditions. Despite its benefits, EGD often causes significant anxiety in patients.

Anxiety can lead to various adverse outcomes during medical procedures by altering physiological responses and affecting patient comfort. For instance, increased sympathetic nervous activity can elevate heart rate and reduce heart rate variability, increasing the risk of sudden cardiac events. Furthermore, elevated anxiety levels result in a notable elevation in respiratory rate. Anxiety affects respiratory patterns by reducing respiratory time and increasing the rate, leading to prolonged expiration and shortened post-expiratory pauses. In addition, it can heighten pain perception and muscle tension, making cooperation difficult and often necessitating higher sedative doses. These hemodynamic and respiratory changes can lead to complications during EGD. Anxiety-induced tachycardia and hypertension may hinder esophageal and stomach navigation, complicating the procedure. Elevated respiratory rates can cause excessive movement, impairing image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Anxiety-induced hyperventilation, with rapid and shallow breathing, may cause respiratory alkalosis, complicating patient management. Anxiety also increases discomfort and pain perception, making the procedure harder to tolerate.

Sedation practices vary significantly between countries and clinical settings. While some countries routinely use sedation during gastroscopy, others limit its use due to cost, safety concerns, and healthcare policies. These differences create international variability in endoscopy practice, emphasizing the need for individualized sedation strategies based on patient-specific factors. While sedation is common in endoscopy, non-sedated procedures are frequent in some countries due to the cost and potential side effects of sedation, such as respiratory depression and cardiovascular complications. This raises the question of whether pre-procedural anxiety affects both patient experience and endoscopic quality.

The quality of EGD depends on factors like clear mucosal visualization, accurate lesion identification, adequate biopsy sampling, and efficient procedure time. Increased movement, hyperventilation, and discomfort in anxious patients may interfere with the thoroughness of the examination. Lack of patient cooperation may prolong the procedure, increasing the risk of complications or incomplete assessments.

Additionally, we recommend in favor of either PO NSAIDs or PO APAP for the initial management of pain in the prehospital setting if an oral analgesic is considered (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In supporting data, one study found higher pain severity scores at 15 minutes with IV APAP compared to IV NSAIDs, with no significant differences at 30 or 60 minutes, or in partial or complete relief of pain, and oral NSAIDs were found to have more gastrointestinal adverse events; contextual ED delays included a mean time-to-analgesia of 129 minutes decreased to 100 minutes after interventions and a baseline median time to analgesia of 64 minutes that increased to 80 minutes after policy changes, and feasibility and cost effectiveness favored IV NSAIDs.

### An international multidisciplinary consensus statement on fasting before procedural sedation in adults and children [^116wdyum]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the evidence that fasting before general anaesthesia or procedural sedation improves outcomes?

The longstanding tradition of fasting before elective surgery and procedural sedation has minimal scientific support and was instead prompted by early reports of aspiration 62 and the logical presumption that regurgitation of gastric contents cannot physically occur if the stomach is empty 7, 12, 13, 63. There are no prospective, controlled trials to guide decision making concerning the impact of fasting intervals on aspiration; therefore, conclusions regarding association or causal relationships rely on observational series and indirect evidence as outlined below. There is no conclusive evidence to support assertions about safe fasting intervals and thus current fasting recommendations from prominent specialty societies 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (see also Supporting Information, Table S4) are largely consensus driven.

We recommend that the combination of an opioid and benzodiazepine is a safe and effective regimen for achieving minimal to moderate sedation for upper endoscopy and colonoscopy in patients without risk factors for sedation-related adverse events. We suggest using an appropriate adjunctive agent (eg, diphenhydramine, promethazine, or droperidol) in combination with conventional sedative drugs in select clinical circumstances. We recommend that providers undergo specific training in the administration of endoscopic sedation and possess the skills necessary for the diagnosis and management of sedation-related adverse events, including rescue from a level of sedation deeper than that intended. We recommend the routine monitoring of blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate in addition to clinical observation for changes in cardiopulmonary status during all endoscopic procedures using sedation.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate [^111sPiDy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings].

### Consensus guidelines for perioperative care in neonatal intestinal surgery: enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations [^116NNTF5]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen

Acetaminophen is an important part of a multimodal regime to limit opioid exposure after neonatal surgery. Multiple high-quality studies indicate that IV acetaminophen reduces postoperative morphine consumption in neonates when compared with other regimens. When IV acetaminophen is not available, rectal acetaminophen should be given, although it may be less effective. Despite concerns about the hepatic effects of IV acetaminophen, low doses are well tolerated in term neonates and have a good safety profile when used for limited periods. Although current evidence suggests that the short-term use of acetaminophen is safe, longer-term safety is less clear. Acetaminophen should be given regularly (not prn) in postoperative neonates with strict adherence to the recommended dose, dosing interval, and maximum allowable daily dose.

Opioid use

Morphine is effective in treating postoperative pain following neonatal surgery. However, pharmacokinetic differences lead to less predictable clinical effects in neonates as compared to older children with an increased variability in plasma concentrations of morphine and its metabolites. Reduced doses and increased dosing intervals are necessary to avoid accumulation and the risk of sedation and respiratory depression.

With neonatal morphine use, the therapeutic window between analgesia and respiratory depression is narrow. Other important adverse effects include hypotension and decreased gastrointestinal motility.

Moderate evidence supports the use of an opioid sparing, multimodal analgesia strategy in postoperative neonates. The lowest dose of opioid should be given for the shortest possible time. All neonates receiving opioids should be managed with continuous pulse oximetry, monitoring of other vital signs, and regular assessment of pain scores.

Standard analgesia protocol

High-quality evidence demonstrates that ultrasound-guided regional anesthetic techniques and regular acetaminophen reduces the exposure of infants to opioids and other anesthetic agents. Epidural analgesia, when combined with general anesthesia, decreases respiratory complications and shortens the time to bowel function. Regional blocks avoid some of the risks of epidurals while achieving good pain control. In appropriate neonates, the use of regional anesthesia and regular (not prn) acetaminophen is recommended and may reduce the need for perioperative narcotics.

Lingual sucrose/dextrose

Many high-quality studies have demonstrated the efficacy of lingual sucrose/dextrose as an analgesic in neonates. A large systematic review demonstrated the benefits of oral sucrose in neonates undergoing heel lance, venipuncture, and intramuscular injections. A smaller number of studies showed sucrose to be of benefit for other interventions such as naso/orogastric tube insertion, with lower pain scores when compared with placebo. Due to the low morbidity and high feasibility, we recommend lingual sucrose/dextrose to reduce pain during naso/orogastric tube placement and other minor painful procedures.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, parallel-group clinical trial to assess the effects of teduglutide on gastric emptying of liquids in healthy subjects [^113zaKoF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Gastric emptying

Compared with placebo, teduglutide treatment for 10 days had no appreciable effect on gastric emptying of liquids as determined by acetaminophen PK parameters. Although acetaminophen absorption appears to be somewhat higher in the teduglutide group compared with the placebo group on both Day 0 and Day 10, the absorption curves for the teduglutide group and the placebo group on Day 10 were not significantly different from the corresponding curves on Day 0 (Figure 2 A and B). The Day 10 absorption curves also did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. At Day 10, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in AUC 0–last, AUC 0–inf, C max, or t max (Table 3). Within the teduglutide group, acetaminophen PK parameters were similar at Day 0 and Day 10 (AUC 0–last, 60,105 ± 13,028 vs 60,984 ± 15,710 ng∙hour/mL, respectively; AUC 0–inf, 63,693 ± 14,187 vs 65,279 ± 17,039 ng∙hour/mL; C max, 13,319 ± 3155 vs 12,677 ± 3821 ng/mL; t max, 1.6 vs 1.7 hour). Similarly, the placebo group showed no apparent differences in PK parameters at Day 0 versus Day 10 (AUC 0–last, 47,551 ± 9483 vs 47,652 ± 9377 ng∙hour/mL, respectively; AUC 0–inf, 50,360 ± 10,001 vs 50,036 ± 9706 ng∙hour/mL; C max, 11,124 ± 2939 vs 10,679 ± 2246 ng/mL; t max, 1.5 vs 1.5 hour).

### Guidelines for sedation and anesthesia in GI endoscopy [^116cJC18]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2018). Medium credibility.

Unsedated gastrointestinal endoscopy — patient selection and techniques — can be approached as follows: Select patients may be able to undergo endoscopic procedures without sedation, and provider education may increase willingness to consider this option, and small-diameter endoscopes (< 6 mm) can improve tolerability of upper endoscopy when sedation is not used. In general, topical anesthesia is used during unsedated upper endoscopy, and successful colonoscopy is possible in selected patients who receive no sedation or sedation only if needed. Older patients, men, patients that are not anxious, and those without a history of abdominal pain may be more willing to undergo endoscopy with little or no sedation. Standard pre-procedural preparation for sedation and monitoring, including intravenous insertion, should be followed in case a patient cannot tolerate the procedure or has an unplanned cardiopulmonary event. The use of water-assisted or carbon dioxide insufflation may reduce pain during and after colonoscopy, topical anesthesia may decrease discomfort in unsedated or non-propofol mediated sedation, but in randomized controlled trials using propofol mediated sedation for EGD, topical anesthesia did not affect endoscopist satisfaction, total propofol dose, or patient responsiveness.

### Opioid-sparing anesthetic technique for pediatric patients undergoing adenoidectomy: a pilot study [^116XLLhA]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a first-line antipyretic and analgesic for mild and moderate pain. Anti-nociceptive effects result from the central inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme leading to decreased production of prostaglandins, which in turn diminishes the release of excitatory transmitters involved in nociceptive transmission. It remains a mainstay for the treatment of pain both as a primary agent and as an adjunct in pediatric patient undergoing otolaryngological procedures. Given cost concerns and lack of proven data to demonstrate a difference in efficacy, we chose to use the oral route for administration. Acetaminophen was then administered postoperatively as needed to provide ongoing analgesia with additional ibuprofen available for break-through pain.

One concern with the preoperative administration of oral medications may be the volume of fluid required in the digestive tract to absorb the medication in a patient who is being kept nil per os (NPO). The 3 medications used in the current study require a small amount of liquid to be administered. In a 10 kg patient, the 3 medications are administered in a total of 7.9 mL including 1.5 mL of the 2 mg/mL midazolam solution (0.3 mg/kg), 1.7 mL of the 30 mg/5 mL dextromethorphan solution (1 mg/kg), and 4.7 mL of the 160 mg/5 mL acetaminophen solution. However, the preoperative administration of oral acetaminophen (the largest volume component of our preoperative regarding) has not been shown to increase gastric volume at the time of anesthetic induction. In this study, the authors administered 40 mg/kg of acetaminophen using a solution with a concentration of 50 mg/mL. This would deliver a volume of 8 mL to a 10 kg patient, which is similar to the volume administered to our patients when considering the cumulative volume of the 3 medications. Although all study patients were able to ingest the volume of preoperative medications without difficulty, we concede ingestion of higher volumes may be problematic in other patient populations who are older, have oral aversions or higher dosing weight. However, further studies are needed to determine whether this opioid-sparing technique can be adapted to different patient populations in whom ingestion of larger volumes would be a concern through modifications such as earlier staggered medication administration prior to scheduled surgery.

### Intravenous acetaminophen does not reduce morphine use for pain relief in emergency department patients: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111gKYYF]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Characteristics of study subjects

A total of 4580 patients were screened for eligibility between May 2019 and October 2020. After the exclusion criteria were applied, 202 patients were included for the primary intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis (102 patients in the acetaminophen group, 100 in the placebo group). For the per‐protocol (PP) analysis, three patients were excluded (two patients in the acetaminophen group, one in the placebo group), leaving 100 patients in the acetaminophen group and 99 patients in the placebo group (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Study flow chart. AE, adverse event; ITT = intention to treat; NRS, numeric rating scale; OR, operating room; PP = per protocol. Pain relief = pain < 4 NRS

Of the 202 patients included, 177 (87 in the acetaminophen group, 90 in the placebo group) were monitored for the planned 4 h after the first treatment (acetaminophen and morphine or placebo and morphine). Secondary outcomes were analyzed for 212 (AEs) to 177 patients (total dose of morphine). Each subgroup is shown in Table S1 and Figure S2, respectively.

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in the acetaminophen and placebo groups. The median age was 46 years (range 18–89 years), and 62% were male. The median initial pain score was 8 (range 4–10). Abdominal pain was the most common pain location (75 patients, 34.1%) and "dull" the most common pain quality (85 patients, 38.6%) (Table 1). The mean ± SD time from randomization to the first dose of medication was 17.7 ± 11.8 min in the acetaminophen group, and 16.2 ± 11.1 min in the placebo group.

Periprocedural management

Preprocedure assessment and management

Preprocedural assessment and management is an important part of endoscopic training. Determination of an appropriate clinical indication for EGD and knowledge of potential risks are critical before the endoscopist or trainee proceeds with both the informed consent process and the examination. The trainee should be able to educate the patient in culturally appropriate laypersons' terms regarding indications for the procedure, how the procedure will be performed, the alternatives to the procedure, the risks of the procedure, and what to expect after the procedure. Supervising faculty should oversee the informed consent process and emphasize patient education and thorough documentation in the medical record. Trainees should have a thorough understanding of the patient's medical history, including presenting symptoms, comorbidities, surgical history, and medications. This clinical information in conjunction with physical examination findings (including body habitus, airway assessment, and vital signs) and American Society of Anesthesiologists classificationshould be used in determining the timing of EGD, the site of service (ambulatory endoscopy unit, hospital-based endoscopy unit, intensive care unit, or operating room), and choice of sedation to be used. Routine laboratory studies are generally unnecessary, although they may be required in certain scenarios. Trainees should be familiar with guidelines regarding the management of anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and antithrombotic agents, and they should formulate a clear management plan in collaboration with other disciplines involved in the care of the patient. Finally, trainees should understand the proper indications for prophylactic antibiotic agents, proton pump inhibitors, prokinetic agents, or vasoactive drugs before the performance of EGD.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous acetaminophen on hospital length of stay in obese individuals undergoing sleeve gastrectomy [^112ckuQR]. Obesity Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Retrospective studies indicate that acetaminophen iv administration reduces hospital length of stay (LoS) and opiate consumption in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

Objective

This study sought to determine whether using acetaminophen iv in morbidly obese subjects undergoing sleeve gastrectomy decreased LoS and total hospital charges as compared to patients receiving saline placebo.

Setting

Single-center university hospital METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, subjects were assigned to receive either acetaminophen iv (group A) or saline placebo iv (group P). Data were collected between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2016. Group A received acetaminophen every 6 h for a total of four doses. The first dose was administered following the induction of general anesthesia; group P received saline iv on the same schedule. Anesthetic management and prophylactic antiemetic regimen were standardized in all subjects. Postoperative pain management consisted of hydromorphone via patient-controlled infusion pump. Primary outcomes include hospital LoS and associated hospital costs. Secondary outcomes include patient satisfaction and postoperative nausea and pain scores.

Results

Subject demographics (n = 127) and intraoperative management were similar in the two groups. Across all subjects, median hospital LoS in group A (n = 63) was 1.87 vs. 1.97 days in group P (n = 64) (p = 0.03, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Postoperatively, daily quality-of-recovery (QoR-15) scores, narcotic consumption, and the use of rescue antiemetics were not significantly different between groups. Median hospital costs were as follows: group A, $12,885 vs. group P, $12,977 (n = 64).

Conclusions

Acetaminophen iv may reduce hospital LoS in subjects undergoing sleeve gastrectomy.

For osteoarthritis, "one medication was not superior to others", and "the chronic administration of NSAIDs is linked to gastrointestinal (eg, bleeding), renal, and other systemic side effects… and so require continual monitoring", while "Coprescribing of proton pump inhibitors or H2-antagonists reduced the risk of endoscopically detected gastroduodenal ulcers compared to placebo". For acetaminophen, "Studies with acetaminophen typically used 4 g/day", yet in the Veterans Aging Cohort "31% of 14885 patients with HIV disease received at least 1 prescription for acetaminophen of more than 2 g/day", with use common in "HIV (31%) and HIV/hepatitis C virus coinfected (32%)" patients; "Current recommendations limit the dose of acetaminophen to no more than 2 g/day in patients with liver disease".

### Acetaminophen for analgesia following pyloromyotomy: does the route of administration make a difference? [^117Qqsxv]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 80 patients were identified who had undergone a pyloromyotomy for PS, of which 12 patients were excluded from the study as they received intraoperative opioids. This resulted in a final study cohort of 68 infants. All the patients had a laparoscopic approach for pyloromyotomy. There were 34 patients who received IV acetaminophen and 34 who received rectal acetaminophen. The demographics of the two groups are listed in Table 1. The dose of IV acetaminophen was 8.6 ± 3.9 mg/kg, while the dose of rectal acetaminophen was 30.7 ± 6.3 mg/kg. All the patients also received local infiltration of the surgical site with 0.25% bupivacaine at the completion of the procedure. No patients received intra-operative opioids or other analgesic agents in the OR. Two patients received opioids during the postoperative course. Both were in the rectal acetaminophen group. One received a dose of fentanyl in the PACU, and another received a dose of morphine in the inpatient ward. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to pain scores, time spent in the PACU, or time spent in the hospital (Table 2). PACU pain scores, final PACU pain score, and average postoperative pain scores were similar in both groups (Table 1). As per our clinical practice, depending on their emergence from anesthesia, the trachea of patients is either extubated in the OR or in the PACU. There was no difference in the site of tracheal extubation between the two groups. Twenty-four of 34 patients who received IV acetaminophen had their tracheas extubated in the OR compared with 21 of 34 who received rectal acetaminophen. There was no difference in the number of children who tolerated oral feeds on the day of surgery or in the incidence of postoperative complications, including oxygen desaturation requiring supplemental oxygen, apnea, postoperative wound infection, persistent vomiting, and the need for surgical reexploration (Table 2). The majority of patients in both groups received postoperative acetaminophen supplementation (27 and 31 in the rectal and IV acetaminophen groups, respectively). Seven patients in the rectal group and three patients in the IV group did not require additional acetaminophen supplementation. No patient received IV acetaminophen postoperatively. The majority of postoperative acetaminophen was administered via the oral route although rectal acetaminophen was administered postoperatively in addition to oral acetaminophen in three patients in the IV group and two patients in the rectal group. There was no significant difference in the average number of supplemental acetaminophen doses between the two groups. During the postoperative course, the IV acetaminophen group averaged a total of 4.4 doses of supplemental acetaminophen versus 3.5 doses in the rectal acetaminophen group.

Sedation, patient management, and physician behavior during EGD

Before the initiation of all EGD examinations, trainees should actively participate in the "time out" or patient identification process, which includes verification of the correct patient and procedure to be performed. Trainees should receive training in sedation, which includes understanding the pharmacology of sedation and reversal agents used in the endoscopy setting, monitoring of the patient (including level of sedation), airway management, and the appropriate use of the anesthesia service. Trainees are expected to be able to provide safe and effective sedation and analgesia for patients undergoing EGD (and all endoscopies) by the end of their training.

During the EGD, maintenance of the patient's comfort, dignity, and privacy is essential. Faculty members are expected to maintain a professional, distraction-free, and positive environment that promotes learning and patient safety. Throughout the procedure, there should be clear and professional communication between the trainee, assisting staff, and faculty members to ensure the patient's safety and comfort. Feedback to the trainee on procedure performance should be constructive and given privately when possible. The standards for performance of EGD that trainees need to master are described in detail below.

Postprocedure management

Trainees should be aware of appropriate patient monitoring for adverse events related to the procedure or sedation in the postprocedure period. Again, familiarity with both sedation and reversal agents, including pharmacology, duration of action, and possible adverse events is important. An understanding of the identification and management of endoscopic adverse events from interventions performed during EGD must be an integral part of endoscopy training, and faculty must emphasize the importance of timely recognition, management, communication with patient and family, and appropriate documentation.

After the procedure, trainees should be able to promptly and effectively communicate the procedure findings, therapeutic outcomes, and follow-up management plans with the patient and referring health care provider(s). Emphasis should also be placed on writing clear and concise procedure reports with detailed and accurate descriptions of findings, pertinent negatives, and endoscopic interventions, using accepted standard terminology and accepted grading or classification systems and including appropriate photo documentation. A differential diagnosis should be formulated that helps inform discussions with surgeons or other consultants and may have a direct impact on clinical management. Recommendations regarding postprocedure monitoring, patient treatment, and follow-up care should be clear and specific.

### Association of intravenous acetaminophen administration with the duration of intravenous opioid use among hospitalized pediatric patients [^111kT7yK]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Patient Characteristics

IV opioid duration was evaluated in 104 579 pediatric inpatients from 274 hospitals with a median (IQR) age of 1.3 years (0–14.7 years); a total of 104 579 patients (57.2%) were female, 21 485 (21.5%) were African American and 56 309 (53.8%) were White. The post–propensity score sample included 1678 pediatric inpatients from 53 hospitals with a mean (SD) age of 13.9 (6.8) years, which included 796 (47.4%) female patients (Figure). A total of 893 293 pediatric inpatients were evaluated, of which 287 504 (34.0%) received IV opioids and 18 197 (2.0%) received IV acetaminophen. After excluding patients who did not receive IV opioids, patients without diagnostic information, and patients without hospital information, 118 908 pediatric inpatients received IV opioids, with 16 068 (13.5%) receiving IV acetaminophen. Among patients who received IV acetaminophen, 1739 (10.8%) received IV acetaminophen prior to IV opioids with a median (IQR) of 1.7 hours (0.03–8.4 hours) between IV acetaminophen administration and first dose of IV opioid. The 16 458 patients (89.2%) who received IV acetaminophen after their first dose of IV opioids were excluded from the final population of 104 579 pediatric inpatients who received IV opioids used for further analyses. When compared with those receiving IV opioids only in the univariate model, patients receiving IV acetaminophen followed by IV opioids were older (eg, ages 13 to 22 years: 59.1% [1027 patients] vs 56.4% [58 021 patients]; P < .001) and not mechanically ventilated (97.4% [1693 patients] vs 95.2% [97 858 patients]; P < .001); and were more likely to have a body temperature above 38° C (3.1% [54 patients] vs 1.7% [1706 patients]; P < .001); diagnoses in the musculoskeletal (7.5% [130 patients] vs 4.2% [4316 patients]; P < .001), digestive (19.8% [344 patients] vs 15.9% [16 334 patients]; P < .001), nervous (9.4% [163 patients] vs 6.7% [6582 patients]; P < .001), and endocrine systems (5.6% [198 patients] vs 4.1% [4250 patients]; p = 0.002); and musculoskeletal operations (7.5% [130 patients] vs 4.2% [4316 patients]; P < .001) (Table 1).

### Acetaminophen poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^112cs1eu]. Clinical Toxicology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with suspected ingestions of acetaminophen. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create this guideline. This guideline applies to ingestion of acetaminophen alone and is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care. The panel's recommendations follow. These recommendations are provided in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is provided in parentheses. 1) The initial history obtained by the specialist in poison information should include the patient's age and intent (Grade B), the specific formulation and dose of acetaminophen, the ingestion pattern (single or multiple), duration of ingestion (Grade B), and concomitant medications that might have been ingested (Grade D). 2) Any patient with stated or suspected self-harm or who is the recipient of a potentially malicious administration of acetaminophen should be referred to an emergency department immediately regardless of the amount ingested. This referral should be guided by local poison center procedures (Grade D). 3) Activated charcoal can be considered if local poison center policies support its prehospital use, a toxic dose of acetaminophen has been taken, and fewer than 2 hours have elapsed since the ingestion (Grade A). Gastrointestinal decontamination could be particularly important if acetylcysteine cannot be administered within 8 hours of ingestion. Acute, single, unintentional ingestion of acetaminophen: 1) Any patient with signs consistent with acetaminophen poisoning (e.g., repeated vomiting, abdominal tenderness in the right upper quadrant or mental status changes) should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade D). 2) Patients less than 6 years of age should be referred to an emergency department if the estimated acute ingestion amount is unknown or is 200 mg/kg or more. Patients can be observed at home if the dose ingested is less than 200 mg/kg (Grade B). 3) Patients 6 years of age or older should be referred to an emergency department if they have ingested at least 10 g or 200 mg/kg (whichever is lower) or when the amount ingested is unknown (Grade D). 4) Patients referred to an emergency department should arrive in time to have a stat serum acetaminophen concentration determined at 4 hours after ingestion or as soon as possible thereafter. If the time of ingestion is unknown, the patient should be referred to an emergency department immediately (Grade D). 5) If the initial contact with the poison center occurs more than 36 hours after the ingestion and the patient is well, the patient does not require further evaluation for acetaminophen toxicity (Grade D). Repeated supratherapeutic ingestion of acetaminophen (RSTI): 1) Patients under 6 years of age should be referred to an emergency department immediately if they have ingested: a) 200 mg/kg or more over a single 24-hour period, or b) 150 mg/kg or more per 24-hour period for the preceding 48 hours, or c) 100 mg/kg or more per 24-hour period for the preceding 72 hours or longer (Grade C). 2) Patients 6 years of age or older should be referred to an emergency department if they have ingested: a) at least 10 g or 200 mg/kg (whichever is less) over a single 24-hour period, or b) at least 6 g or 150 mg/kg (whichever is less) per 24-hour period for the preceding 48 hours or longer. In patients with conditions purported to increase susceptibility to acetaminophen toxicity (alcoholism, isoniazid use, prolonged fasting), the dose of acetaminophen considered as RSTI should be greater than 4 g or 100 mg/kg (whichever is less) per day (Grade D). 3) Gastrointestinal decontamination is not needed (Grade D). Other recommendations: 1) The out-of-hospital management of extended-release acetaminophen or multi-drug combination products containing acetaminophen is the same as an ingestion of acetaminophen alone (Grade D). However, the effects of other drugs might require referral to an emergency department in accordance with the poison center's normal triage criteria. 2) The use of cimetidine as an antidote is not recommended (Grade A).

### Ibuprofen plus acetaminophen equals opioid plus… [^116zb4mg]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Bottom Line In adults presenting to the emergency department with acute extremity pain severe enough to warrant radiologic investigation, ibuprofen plus acetaminophen was equally effective in reducing pain intensity at two hours compared with three different opioid and acetaminophen combination analgesics. In a similar study included those with an injury severe enough to require radiologic imaging according to the judgment of the attending physician.

After baseline pain measurement, patients randomly received identical capsules containing ibuprofen plus acetaminophen; oxycodone plus acetaminophen; hydrocodone plus acetaminophen; or codeine plus acetaminophen. Patients masked to their treatment group assignment self-assessed pain intensity using a verbal numerical rating scale from 0 to 10. The minimum clinically important difference was predefined as a mean pain scale score of 1.
3. Complete follow-up occurred for 100% of patients at two hours. Using intention-to-treat analysis, pain intensity significantly declined by 3. 5 to
4. 4 points at two hours compared with baseline in all treatment groups, but was not significantly different among the four groups.

Pain intensity was also similarly reduced in all treatment groups at one hour, and there were no group differences in the use of rescue analgesia. Even with post hoc analysis, no statistical difference was present for those with a pain score of 10 and those with acute fractures.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of patients presenting to the emergency department with acetaminophen overdose [^113GDWeH]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen overdose without Rumack-Matthew nomogram applicability — indications for N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are stated as follows: Level A recommendations. None specified. Level B recommendations. Administer NAC to patients with hepatic failure thought to be due to acetaminophen. Level C recommendations. Administer NAC to patients who have hepatotoxicity thought to be due to acetaminophen and have a suspected or known acetaminophen overdose, including repeated supratherapeutic ingestions. This applies when the Rumack-Matthew nomogram allows risk stratification only for patients who present with a single known time of an acetaminophen overdose within 24 hours of ingestion, and there are no clear strategies for patients presenting greater than 24 hours postingestion, with an unknown or unreliable ingestion history, or with extended-release or repeated supratherapeutic ingestions of acetaminophen.

### The effect of pre-procedural anxiety level on the quality of upper GI endoscopy in non-sedated patients: "can the need for sedation be predicted? " [^114nn5Qr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Pre-procedural anxiety is known to impact the quality of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD), particularly in non-sedated patients. Elevated anxiety levels can cause discomfort and reduce procedural success.

Objectives:

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pre-procedural anxiety, measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), on the quality of EGD and to determine whether anxiety levels can predict the need for sedation.

Design:

This was a prospective, cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care hospital.

Methods:

This study included 1344 non-sedated patients aged 18–90 years undergoing EGD at Ankara Etlik City Hospital (September 2023–March 2024). Anxiety levels were assessed using STAI before the procedure. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis determined the optimal STAI-I cutoff for predicting sedation needs. EGD quality was evaluated by examination thoroughness and biopsy adequacy. Logistic regression identified predictors of unsuccessful procedures.

Results:

The mean participant age was 50.6 years; 47.8% were male. The average STAI-I score was 42.14. ROC analysis identified an STAI-I cutoff of 36, above which unsuccessful procedures were more likely (area under the curve = 0.720, p < 0.001). Higher STAI-I and STAI-II scores were independent predictors of unsuccessful endoscopy, with each unit increase in STAI-I raising the odds by 3.8%.

Conclusion:

Pre-procedural anxiety, as measured by STAI, significantly affects non-sedated EGD quality. An STAI-I cutoff of 36 predicts the need for sedation. Routine anxiety assessment could enhance sedation strategies, patient satisfaction, and procedure quality.

Trial registration: Not applicable.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112FDnTP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Naltrexone and pain management — patients on naltrexone may not respond to opioid analgesics in the usual manner; mild pain may be treated with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and high potency NSAIDs such as Ketorolac may be prescribed for moderate to severe pain, with NSAID use time-limited due to adverse effects including gastritis. Emergency pain management options, which may optimally be used in combination when appropriate, include regional anesthesia, conscious sedation with benzodiazepines or ketamine, nonopioid options in general anesthesia, and over-riding the naltrexone blockade with high-potency opioids. Higher doses are typically needed to override the opioid receptor blockade so this should occur in an inpatient setting with monitoring of vitals, and use of high potency opioids, with high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor, administered intravenously is recommended in these cases.
