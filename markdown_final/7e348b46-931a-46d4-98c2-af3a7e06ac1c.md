## Question

Pyroxidine dose for morning aickness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dosing recommendations for pyridoxine (vitamin B6) in the treatment of morning sickness, including monotherapy and combination therapy with doxylamine, and how to titrate safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and guideline positioning of pyridoxine for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Then, I should verify the exact dosing for the FDA-approved fixed-dose combination products and their titration schedules. Next, I will consider pyridoxine monotherapy dosing ranges and safety limits. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetic and clinical efficacy data to justify timing and titration. Finally, I should review safety, drug interactions, and monitoring, and then synthesize a practical dosing recommendation with caveats for special situations like hyperemesis gravidarum and breastfeeding considerations.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory and guideline context so I don't jump to conclusions. Pyridoxine, alone or combined with doxylamine, is recommended as first-line pharmacologic therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy by major guidelines, and the doxylamine–pyridoxine combination is FDA-approved for this indication, which anchors the dosing framework I should use [^111MTBTi] [^112yingN] [^115h63sq].

> I will now examine the fixed-dose combination products to pin down exact dosing. Diclegis is 10 mg doxylamine/10 mg pyridoxine per delayed-release tablet, with a starting dose of two tablets at bedtime; if symptoms persist into the afternoon, increase to three tablets on Day 3 (one in the morning, two at bedtime); if still not controlled, increase to four tablets on Day 4 (one in the morning, one mid-afternoon, two at bedtime), with a maximum of four tablets daily, taken on an empty stomach with water and swallowed whole, not chewed or crushed [^117RTViL] [^1147n2vu]. Wait, let me verify the timing rationale: the delayed-release design is intended to align peak effect with morning symptom burden, which supports bedtime-first dosing and subsequent daytime additions as needed [^111zxTHH].

> Hold on, I should verify the higher-strength formulation. Bonjesta is 20 mg doxylamine/20 mg pyridoxine per extended-release tablet, with a simpler titration: start with one tablet at bedtime, and if symptoms persist, increase to one tablet in the morning and one at bedtime, for a maximum of two tablets daily; pharmacokinetic data show that one Bonjesta tablet provides exposure approximately equivalent to two Diclegis tablets, which explains the lower tablet count at maximum dose [^111uDwpD] [^1167b9Zq].

> Next, I should review pyridoxine monotherapy dosing, since some patients may prefer or require B6 alone. Let me think about the range: typical monotherapy dosing is 10–25 mg orally three times daily, with some sources allowing escalation up to about 200 mg/day, though I need to ensure I don't exceed safety thresholds; importantly, the FDA label notes that pyridoxine up to 40 mg/day in combination with doxylamine is FDA-approved for NVP, which helps anchor a reasonable upper bound for routine use, while acknowledging that higher monotherapy doses have been described in some contexts without clear neuropathy signals at short-term durations [^114nF2ax] [^114xQwYP]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "up to 200 mg/day is fine", but I should double-check neuropathy risk; the best evidence suggests peripheral neuropathy risk rises with chronic high-dose exposure, generally above 500–900 mg/day, so short-term use of 25–75 mg/day is well within the safety envelope for pregnancy-related nausea management [^117AhFqG] [^11625TEf].

> I need to ensure the titration logic aligns with clinical response and pharmacokinetics. The delayed-release combination achieves meaningful symptom improvement as early as Days 3–5, which supports a stepwise titration every few days based on afternoon/evening control; in the pivotal trial, most patients ultimately required four Diclegis tablets daily, consistent with real-world titration patterns, and Bonjesta's two-tablet regimen offers a lower pill burden with comparable exposure when titrated appropriately [^113fsv7S] [^116d34T5] [^1167b9Zq].

> Let me consider safety and monitoring so I don't overlook important cautions. Common adverse effects include somnolence and dizziness due to doxylamine; patients should avoid driving or hazardous activities until they know how they respond, and concurrent CNS depressants or alcohol increase risk of falls and impairment; clinically significant maternal adverse events were not increased versus placebo in randomized trials, supporting the safety of the labeled dosing range in pregnancy [^111pLA8a] [^1136ufj9]. I should confirm drug–drug interactions: pyridoxine can antagonize levodopa, so patients on levodopa monotherapy should avoid pyridoxine-containing supplements above about 5 mg/day; this is less of a concern with carbidopa/levodopa combinations, but counseling is prudent [^116AbuPH]. Regarding lactation, doxylamine passes into breast milk and may cause infant sedation, so breastfeeding is not recommended during therapy; pyridoxine itself is excreted into milk but has not been associated with infant adverse events in reports [^116qDRn5].

> But wait, what if the patient has hyperemesis gravidarum or fails first-line therapy? I should confirm limitations: the fixed-dose combination is indicated for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy after conservative measures and has not been studied in hyperemesis gravidarum; in refractory cases, guidelines support escalation to agents such as metoclopramide, promethazine, or ondansetron, with corticosteroids reserved for severe, refractory disease, ideally alongside thiamine to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy and careful fluid/electrolyte management [^115h63sq] [^114NQmtw] [^1122WsJU].

> I should double-check practical administration details so counseling is precise. Take delayed-release tablets on an empty stomach with water, swallow whole, and avoid crushing or chewing; reassess the need for continued therapy as pregnancy progresses, and if using Bonjesta, remember that one morning and one bedtime tablet provide exposure roughly equivalent to the three- to four-tablet Diclegis regimen, which can simplify adherence for some patients [^1147n2vu] [^1167b9Zq].

> Putting this together, my final dosing recommendation is as follows: for combination therapy, start with Diclegis two tablets at bedtime; if afternoon symptoms persist, increase to three tablets on Day 3 (one morning, two bedtime); if still not controlled, increase to four tablets on Day 4 (one morning, one mid-afternoon, two bedtime), not to exceed four tablets daily; alternatively, use Bonjesta one tablet at bedtime, increasing to one tablet in the morning and one at bedtime if needed, not to exceed two tablets daily; for pyridoxine monotherapy, use 10–25 mg orally three times daily, generally not exceeding about 40–75 mg/day in routine practice, recognizing that short-term use up to 200 mg/day has been described but should be approached cautiously and individualized, with attention to neuropathy risk only at much higher chronic doses [^117RTViL] [^111uDwpD] [^114nF2ax] [^114xQwYP].

The recommended pyridoxine (vitamin B6) dose for morning sickness is **25 mg orally every 8 hours** (total 75 mg/day) [^114nF2ax]. If symptoms persist, the dose may be increased to **50 mg every 8 hours** (total 150 mg/day) [^notfound]. For severe symptoms, pyridoxine can be combined with doxylamine (Diclegis/Bonjesta) [^117RTViL] [^111uDwpD], with a typical total pyridoxine dose of 40–80 mg/day [^notfound]. Do not exceed **200 mg/day** due to the risk of neuropathy [^112Lqtun].

## Recommended pyridoxine dosing regimens

| **Regimen** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Total daily dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Standard regimen | 25 mg | Every 8 hours | 75 mg/day |
| Escalated regimen (if needed) | 50 mg | Every 8 hours | 150 mg/day |
| Maximum recommended dose | 200 mg | Divided doses | 200 mg/day |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting pyridoxine use

- **RCT evidence**: Pyridoxine 25–50 mg every 8 hours significantly reduces nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^1122WsJU].
- **Combination therapy**: Adding doxylamine improves efficacy; Diclegis (10 mg doxylamine/10 mg pyridoxine) is FDA-approved for NVP [^111ionza].
- **Safety**: No increase in major malformations or adverse fetal outcomes with standard doses [^116qDRn5].

---

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

- **Neuropathy risk**: Prolonged high-dose (> 200 mg/day) pyridoxine can cause sensory neuropathy [^112Lqtun].
- **Common side effects**: Mild gastrointestinal upset, headache, and drowsiness [^111pLA8a].
- **Drug interactions**: Pyridoxine can antagonize levodopa; use caution in Parkinson's disease [^116AbuPH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACOG recommends pyridoxine as **first-line therapy** for NVP, alone or with doxylamine [^111MTBTi]. RCOG recommends **doxylamine-pyridoxine** as first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate NVP [^112yingN]. SOGC recommends pyridoxine monotherapy or doxylamine-pyridoxine as **first-line therapy** for NVP [^114Croxk].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dosing

Severity of symptoms guides dose escalation to a **maximum of 200 mg/day**. Maternal weight and age do not require routine dose adjustment, but monitor for adverse effects. Comorbidities warrant caution with high-dose pyridoxine, especially in patients with neuropathy risk or Parkinson's disease [^116AbuPH].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Assess symptom control and **adverse effects** within a few days of initiation or dose change. Monitor for **neuropathy** with prolonged high-dose use. Continue to reassess the need for ongoing therapy as **pregnancy** progresses [^117RTViL].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: 25 mg every 8 hours (75 mg/day) [^114nF2ax].
- **Escalation**: Increase to 50 mg every 8 hours (150 mg/day) if needed [^notfound].
- **Maximum dose**: Do not exceed 200 mg/day [^114nF2ax].
- **Combination therapy**: Consider doxylamine-pyridoxine for persistent symptoms [^117RTViL].
- **Safety**: Monitor for neuropathy and adverse effects, especially with prolonged high-dose use [^117AhFqG].

Pyridoxine is effective and safe for morning sickness at **25–50 mg every 8 hours**, with a hard cap of 200 mg/day; consider combination therapy if symptoms persist.

### Treating morning sickness in the United States – changes in prescribing are needed [^1168D1QG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Presently, 97.7% of prescriptions for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy in the United States are with medications not labeled for use in pregnancy, not indicated for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, and not classified as safe in pregnancy by the Food and Drug Administration. The use of ondansetron for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy has increased from 50,000 monthly prescriptions in 2008 to 110,000 at the end of 2013, despite unresolved issues regarding fetal safety and Food and Drug Administration warnings about serious dysrhythmias. In April 2013, the Food and Drug Administration approved the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine, specifically for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy symptoms. Now that a safe and effective drug is available in the United States, there is no reason for women to be exposed to a drug of unproven maternal and fetal safety.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride or placebo. Two tablets of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (± 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily.

Over the treatment period, 19% of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride-treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily.

### Maternal safety of the delayed-release doxylamine and pyridoxine combination for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy; a randomized placebo controlled trial [^113mtEEE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

It may be puzzling, however, how symptoms of CNS depression, so typical of the sedating antihistamines, were more prevalent in the active arm of the study. The answer may lie in the demographics of the study population as presented in Table 1.

The mean weight of the women in the study was 75 kg (165 lb), rendering 24% of them overweight and 42% obese. When the original Bendectin® studies were conducted the mean weight of participating women was 20 kg lower on average. As a result we might hypothesize that the relatively lower weight-adjusted dose given to our mostly overweight and obese study participants could have mitigated adverse drug effects.

A previous study determined the incidence of adverse maternal effects among 225 women taking Diclectin® at the recommended (n = 123) or higher than recommended (n = 102) doses. One-third (33.6%) of those women reported having adverse CNS effects (sleepiness, tiredness, and/or drowsiness) temporally related to the medication, a rate very similar to the present study (28.3%). In that study there was no association between the dose per kg and rates of reported maternal adverse effects with doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 2.0 mg/kg (1–12 tablets). In addition, the higher than standard dose of Diclectin®, when calculated per kg of body weight, did not affect either the incidence or severity of maternal adverse effects. Similarly, no excess was recorded for other typical adverse effects of antihistamine, such as those involved in low gastrointestinal motility or anticholinergic effects (e.g. dry mouth, dysrhythmia).

In a recent population- based Canadian study, pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy, when NVP and the use of Diclegis® is at its peak, did not have a higher risk of car crushes, whereas there was a 46% increased risk in the second trimester, when most morning sickness has subsided and the drug is not used. This may serve as a population-based corroboration of the present results, showing that Diclegis® is not associated with measurable CNS depression.

### Demonstration of early efficacy results of the delayed-release combination of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^111zxTHH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects up to 80% of expecting mothers, and for many women, pharmacotherapy is necessary to control their symptoms. The delayed — release combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been extensively studied with publications in the peer-reviewed medical literature corroborating the safe and effective use of this agent.

The delayed-release characteristic of this combination allows for the starting dose of two tablets at bedtime to be effective five to seven hours later, in the morning hours when NVP symptoms tend to be most prevalent. In 2013, the FDA approved the sale of Diclegis®, based, in part, on results from a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, pregnant women between 7 and 14 weeks' gestation received study drug, Diclegis® or placebo, for 14 days. The NVP-specific and validated Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score was collected daily; however, the a priori primary effectiveness endpoint was determined to be the change in NVP symptoms as measured by the PUQE score from baseline to Day 15. This period of study drug dosing for two weeks is substantially longer than other therapeutic studies in NVP which rarely continue beyond five days. For ethical reasons, denying women suffering from NVP a safe and effective treatment, and randomizing them to placebo should be for as limited duration as possible. As such, the present secondary analysis was conducted to determine whether shorter drug dosing days would yield similar efficacy results.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

There have been no efficacy and safety trials conducted with BONJESTA.

A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets (a different formulation and dosage strength than BONJESTA) in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets or placebo. Two tablets of 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (± 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily.

Over the treatment period, 19% of 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablet-treated women remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe).

At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9.0 in the 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm. There was a 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2 with p-value 0.006) mean decrease (improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets compared to placebo (see Table 6).

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^116fkzDy]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, commonly known as "morning sickness", affects approximately 80 percent of pregnant women. Although several theories have been proposed, the exact cause remains unclear. Recent research has implicated Helicobacter pylori as one possible cause. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is generally a mild, self-limited condition that may be controlled with conservative measures. A small percentage of pregnant women have a more profound course, with the most severe form being hyperemesis gravidarum. Unlike morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum may have negative implications for maternal and fetal health. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients with nonresolving or worsening symptoms to rule out the most common pregnancy-related and nonpregnancy-related causes of severe vomiting. Once pathologic causes have been ruled out, treatment is individualized. Initial treatment should be conservative and should involve dietary changes, emotional support, and perhaps alternative therapy such as ginger or acupressure. Women with more complicated nausea and vomiting of pregnancy also may need pharmacologic therapy. Several medications, including pyridoxine and doxylamine, have been shown to be safe and effective treatments. Pregnant women who have severe vomiting may require hospitalization, orally or intravenously administered corticosteroid therapy, and total parenteral nutrition.

### Leg cramps [^111cwxc1]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Involuntary, localised leg cramps are common and typically affect the calf muscles at night.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for idiopathic leg cramps? What are the effects of treatments for leg cramps in pregnancy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 16 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics; anti-epileptic drugs; calcium salts; diltiazem; magnesium salts; multivitamin and mineral supplements; quinine; sodium chloride; stretching exercises; verapamil; vitamin B6 (pyridoxine); and vitamin E.

### What do we know about micronutrients in critically ill patients? A narrative review [^112sEfvz]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Implementation in clinical practice

The ESPEN guidelines suggest considering a repletion dose of 50–100 mg pyridoxine in patients with chronic poor intake in addition to the recommended daily dose of 1.5 mg per day in enteral nutrition and 4–6 mg per day in PN. High‐dose pyridoxine may be needed in isoniazid overdose: 1 g of pyridoxine for each gram of isoniazid ingested with a maximum of 5 g. There is no evidence of beneficial effects of high‐dose pyridoxine, and symptoms of toxicity may be observed with dosages > 500 mg/day.

Folate

Main form and functions

Folate, a water‐soluble vitamin also known as vitamin B 9, is the generic term for a family of compounds including folic acid and its derivatives (5‐methyltetrahydrofolate, 5‐formyltetrahydrofolate or folinic acid, 10‐formyltetrahydrofolate and 5,10‐methylenetetrahydrofolate).

### Maternal safety of the delayed-release doxylamine and pyridoxine combination for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy; a randomized placebo controlled trial [^111bPoXm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affect up to 80% of expecting mothers, and while lifestyle changes may be helpful, many women need medications to control their symptoms.

The delayed-release combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride (Bendectin®) was commonly used for NVP and was the only drug approved by the FDA until the manufacturer's voluntary removal of it from the market in 1983. In 1983 and 1999, the FDA determined that this drug combination was not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety and effectiveness. In fact, its removal from the American market was temporally associated with a 2-fold increase in rates of hospitalization of pregnant women for the most severe form of NVP, hyperemesis gravidarum. Over the last 3 decades a large body of evidence corroborated the fetal safety of this drug combination.

The rationale for the delayed-release characteristics of this combination is to allow women to take it before bedtime, when symptoms of NVP tend to be minimal, in order to counteract the increased symptoms more commonly experienced in the morning hours. In April 2013, the FDA approved the sale of Diclegis®, an identical combination to the original Bendectin® and its Canadian equivalent Diclectin®, after a randomized blinded placebo- controlled trial. The fetal safety of this medication has been proven by numerous studies. However, since it is the only FDA-approved medication for NVP, it is likely to be used by a large number of pregnant women, confirming maternal safety is an important public health question.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the maternal safety of Diclegis® in treating NVP compared to placebo.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled study of the delayed-release combination of doxylamine succinate (10 mg) and pyridoxine hydrochloride (10 mg) (Diclegis®) in the treatment of NVP. The study was approved by the IRB of the University of Texas, Galveston, University of Pittsburg and Georgetown University. The subjects were pregnant, at least 18 years of age, in the gestational age range of 7–14 weeks, suffering from NVP, had a PUQE score ≥ 6), and had not responded to conservative management consisting of dietary/lifestyle advice. Women treated by other antiemetics, suffering from chronic medical conditions, or those who could not communicate in either English or Spanish, were excluded. After physical examination and laboratory tests (hemoglobin and blood count, liver function tests, electrolytes, amylase), and after confirming in utero singleton pregnancies by ultrasound, women were randomized, using a computerized program, to receive Diclegis® (doxylamine succinate 10 mg and pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg) or placebo of similar look. Two tablets of study drug (Diclegis® or placebo) were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2 (i.e. PUQE Score above 3), the subject was directed to take her usual dose of 2 tablets at bedtime and an additional tablet the next morning on Day 3. Based upon assessment in the clinic on Day 4 (+/−1 day), the subject might have been directed to take an additional 4th tablet mid-afternoon to control evening symptoms. The minimum assigned study medication was 2 tablets daily at bedtime, increasing when indicated to the maximal dosage of 4 tablets per day according to the timing, duration, severity, and frequency of the symptoms experienced by the subject. The study had a 15 day period consisting of 14 dosing days. Telephone contact was made on day 2, 6, 12, and 14 in order to assess subject diary information, adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and compliance with the study medication. Patients returned to the clinic in the morning prior to their morning dose on Day 4 (+/− 1 day), Day 8 (+/− 1 day), and on Day 15 (+/− 1 day; end of study visit) to collect diary report and complete all study related data.

### Pyridoxine hydrochloride [^114xQwYP]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of pyridoxine hydrochloride IV in pregnant patients for all trimesters: generally acceptable for use. Animal studies have not been performed. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. Vitamin B6 deficiency is a common problem in pregnant women and is common in those not on supplementation. Appropriate maternal pyridoxine (vitamin B6) intake is encouraged during pregnancy, and the requirement for pyridoxine appears to be increased during pregnancy. Pyridoxine (up to 40 mg/day) in combination with doxylamine is FDA-approved for the treatment of pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Pyridoxine is a first-line pharmacologic agent in the ACOG treatment algorithm for nausea and vomiting due to pregnancy and may be used with or without doxylamine.

### Pyridoxine hydrochloride [^116AbuPH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS:

General

Single deficiency, as of pyridoxine alone, is rare. Multiple vitamin deficiency is to be expected in any inadequate diet. Patients treated with levodopa should avoid supplemental vitamins that contain more than 5 mg pyridoxine in the daily dose.

Women taking oral contraceptives may exhibit increased pyridoxine requirements.

Drug Interactions

Pyridoxine supplements should not be given to patients receiving levodopa, because the action of the latter drug is antagonized by pyridoxine. However, this vitamin may be used concurrently in patients receiving a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category A — The requirement for pyridoxine appears to be increased during pregnancy. Pyridoxine is sometimes of value in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Nursing Mothers

The need for pyridoxine is increased during lactation. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when pyridoxine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman.

Usage in Children

Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

Adverse effects of pyridoxine (statement #17: grade of recommendation D)

Peripheral neuropathy is the most important adverse effect of pyridoxine. It has been reported in a number of patients treated with long-term high doses of pyridoxine > 900 mg / day.

There is a high risk of peripheral neuropathy following long-term treatment with pyridoxine doses above 900 mg/day (Schaumburg et al; Ludolph et al,), but it has not been found in patients treated with less than 500 mg/day (Cohen and Bendich; Mpofu et al; Yap et al). Reports of peripheral neuropathy with doses below 500 mg/day are unreliable (Parry and Bredesen). Withdrawal of pyridoxine has led to improvement of the neuropathy in some patients (Schaumburg et al).

Periods of apnoea and unresponsiveness have been reported in a few neonates following large oral doses of pyridoxine (500 mg/d) (Mudd et al), as well as after intravenous doses for pyridoxine dependent epilepsy. Rhabdomyolysis has also been reported (Shoji et al).

Recommended pyridoxine doses (statement #18: grade of recommendation D)

For long-term treatment, the pyridoxine dose should be the lowest that achieves the biochemical targets (plasma total homocysteine < 50 μmol / L). We recommend using doses up to 10 mg / kg / day and avoiding doses above 500 mg / day.

Pyridoxine doses of 10–40 mg can achieve biochemical targets in some patients with the p.P49L and p. I278T mutations (Stabler et al). Pyridoxine doses of 200 mg/day or less can achieve the biochemical targets in many other patients. Partially pyridoxine-responsive patients need higher doses and additional treatment (betaine and/or diet). The risk of peripheral neuropathy appears to be low in adults with pyridoxine doses below 500 mg/day (see Adverse effects of pyridoxine (statement #17: grade of recommendation D)). In children, the safe dose is likely to depend on body weight; there are few data but we suggest using doses up to 10 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 500 mg/day.

### Maternal safety of the delayed-release doxylamine and pyridoxine combination for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy; a randomized placebo controlled trial [^1136ufj9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is the most common medical condition in pregnancy, affecting up to 80% of expecting mothers. In April 2013 the FDA approved the delayed release combination of doxylamine succinate and -pyridoxine hydrochloride (Diclegis®) for NVP, following a phase 3 randomized trial in pregnant women. The fetal safety of this medication has been proven by numerous studies. However, because it is the only FDA-approved medication for NVP that is likely to be used by a large number of pregnant women, its maternal safety is an important public health question. The Objective is to evaluate the maternal safety of doxylamine succinate -pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release preparation (Diclegis® as compared to placebo.

Methods

We randomized women suffering from NVP to receive Diclegis® (n = 131) or placebo (n = 125) for 14 days at doses ranging from 2–4 tablets a day, based on a pre-specified titration protocol response to symptoms. Adverse events were collected through patient diaries, clinical examination and laboratory testing.

Results

Doxylamine succinate 10 mg and pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg use was not associated with an increased rate of any adverse event over placebo, including CNS depression, gastrointestinal or cardiovascular involvement.

Conclusions

Doxylamine succinate–pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed release combination is safe and well tolerated by pregnant women when used in the recommended dose of up to 4 tablets daily in treating nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### Pyridoxine prevents postoperative nausea and vomiting in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112ZpbVx]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor's Perspective

Postoperative nausea and vomiting are common adverse events in the nearly 313 million surgical procedures performed worldwide each year, with incidence rates of around 30% in the general population and 80% in high-risk cohorts including patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. However, the underlying mechanisms of postoperative nausea and vomiting remain unclear. Previous studies indicated that substance P release and systemic inflammation (e.g. interleukin-6 release) during and after surgery may be responsible. Postoperative nausea and vomiting occur frequently in young female adults with a history of these symptoms and/or motion sickness and nonsmoking status, which can be linked to certain types of surgery including gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are distressing symptoms associated with an increased risk of aspiration, suture dehiscence, postanesthesia care unit stay, unanticipated hospital admission, and healthcare costs.

Current approaches for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting include the use of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, and antidopaminergic agents, as well as various nonpharmacologic strategies. In the fourth postoperative nausea and vomiting guideline, multimodal prophylaxis was recommended, such as a combination of dexamethasone and ondansetron. However, the incidence rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting is still around 20% in high-risk patients treated with a combination of dexamethasone and ondansetron. Moreover, the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting has been reported even with a combination of five different types of antiemetic prophylactic drugs.

Pyridoxine (vitamin B 6), which is a necessary coenzyme and important cofactor for body metabolism, is involved in the synthesis of various neurotransmitters such as γ-aminobutyric acid, which negatively regulates the nausea and vomiting reflex. – Pyridoxine was first documented in 1942 to prevent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, and it was reported to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting in 1947. Systematic reviews suggest that pyridoxine can effectively prevent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, and several obstetrics and gynecology guidelines recommend it as a first-line drug to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. However, its effectiveness in the perioperative setting for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting remains unclear.

Therefore, this double-blind randomized controlled trial was designed to investigate the effect of the addition of pyridoxine to dexamethasone and ondansetron on the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting within 24 h after surgery in female patients undergoing elective gynecologic laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia.

### Impact of the increased recommended dosage of isoniazid on pyridoxine levels in children and adolescents [^111Yu73r]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Isoniazid exposure causes dose-dependent pyridoxine deficiency. Recently, the recommended dosage of isoniazid in children was increased from 5 (4–6) to 10 (10–15) mg/kg/day. We aimed to analyze longitudinally pyridoxine levels in a cohort of previously healthy children and adolescents treated with isoniazid. Mild symptom-free pyridoxine deficiency was observed in 4/75 (5.6%) and 3/40 (7.5%) at baseline and at 3-month follow-up, respectively. Classical age-related risk factors identified patients at risk of pyridoxine deficiency. Our preliminary results support current recommendations regarding pyridoxine supplementation in healthy children.

### Premenstrual syndrome [^1118WEvK]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Premenstrual symptoms occur in 95% of women of reproductive age. Severe, debilitating symptoms (PMS) occur in about 5% of those women. There is no consensus on how symptom severity should be assessed, which has led to a wide variety of symptoms scales, making it difficult to synthesise data on treatment efficacy. The cyclical nature of the condition also makes it difficult to conduct RCTs.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments; hormonal treatments; psychological interventions; physical therapies; dietary supplements; and surgical treatments in women with premenstrual syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 52 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, alprazolam, bright light therapy, buspirone, chiropractic manipulation, clomipramine, cognitive behavioural therapy, danazol, endometrial ablation, evening primrose oil, exercise, gonadorelin analogues, hysterectomy, laparoscopic bilateral oophorectomy, magnesium supplements, metolazone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oestrogens, oral contraceptives, progesterone, progestogens, pyridoxine, reflexology, relaxation, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, spironolactone, tibolone.

Subsequently, a mixed model for repeated measures was used to analyse PUQE scores on days 3, 4, 5, and 15, using the ITT-E population. The change from baseline in PUQE score was the dependent variable, and treatment, study day, and treatment by study day interaction were included as categorical fixed effects, and the baseline score was included as a continuous fixed effect. The correlation between measures on different days within the same subject was modeled with an unstructured covariance matrix. Least squares means for the change from baseline at each treatment and timepoint were calculated from the model, along with the estimated treatment effect (Diclegis minus placebo) at each timepoint and its 95% confidence interval and P value.

### Ondansetron compared with doxylamine and pyridoxine for treatment of nausea in pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^1119gszu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether ondansetron or the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine was superior for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in which women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were assigned to 4 mg of ondansetron plus a placebo tablet or 25 mg pyridoxine plus 12.5 mg of doxylamine for 5 days. The primary outcome was an improvement in nausea as reported on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were a reduction in vomiting on the VAS and the proportion of patients reporting sedation or constipation while using either study regimen.

Results

Thirty-six women (18 in each group) were randomized to either ondansetron or pyridoxine and doxylamine, of whom 13 (72%) and 17 (94%) completed follow-up, respectively. There were no differences among the groups with regard to demographic characteristics or baseline nausea. Patients randomized to ondansetron were more likely to have an improvement in their baseline nausea as compared with those using pyridoxine and doxylamine over the course of 5 days of treatment (median VAS score decreased 51 mm [interquartile range 37–64] compared with 20 mm [8–51]; p = 0.019). Furthermore, women using ondansetron reported less vomiting (median VAS decreased 41 [interquartile range 17–57] compared with 17 [-4 to 38]; p = 0.049). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding sedation or constipation.

Conclusion

Our investigation showed ondansetron to be superior to the combination of pyridoxine and doxylamine in the treatment of nausea and emesis in pregnancy.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^114nF2ax]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Medication

If symptoms cannot be managed by dietary and lifestyle changes alone, low dose antiemetics may be administered. All pharmacologic interventions should be based upon known safety, proven efficacy and cost effectiveness.

In a metaanalysis of 28 randomized trials of medications for the treatment of HG, antiemetics diminished nausea in early pregnancy and were superior to placebo. Ondansetron is one of the more commonly used and effective drugs and has relatively few side effects.

Other recommended options are the use of metoclopramide to improve gastrointestinal motility and administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Pyridoxine is given three times daily at a dose of 10–25 mg starting with a low dose that may reduce symptoms and has been proven to be more effective than placebo. The daily dose can be increased up to 200 mg without side effects. However, a more recent placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that a combination of oral pyridoxine and metoclopramide did not improve the vomiting frequency or the nausea score.

Antihistamines and anticholinergics such as meclizine, dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine have also been shown to be superior to placebo and can be used safely for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (see Table 2).

Table 2
Antiemetic agents and supposed dosage in hyperemesis gravidarum, adapted from references

However, the side effect profiles vary between the different medications: While nearly all of the above mentioned medicaments may cause dizziness, drowsiness, constipation or dry mouth, more severe adverse effects comprise convulsions, decreased alertness, heartbeat alterations and hallucinations (doxylamine, metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine). Headache, muscle pain or tremor and fever (prednisolone, procholrperazine, promethazine, dimenhydrinate, doxylamine, metoclopramide) may also occur.

Interestingly, diazepam also has positive effects on HG, probably due to its sedative properties. A prospective randomized clinical trial in 74 patients showed that a combination of antiemetic therapy and diazepam reduced the need for hospitalization and improved patient satisfaction. Frequent use of diazepam, however, might lead to dependency. Another risk factor that must be taken into consideration is the possibility of fetal side effects. Antidepressants such as mirtazapine have also been used with some success in ameliorating the symptoms of HG.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^1169nkQt]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) dosing — adult data and recommendations are as follows. Pyridoxine hydrochloride, 2.4 mg/d, was insufficient to maintain normal serum PLP in adults requiring prolonged PN, whereas three milligrams of daily intravenous pyridoxine hydrochloride was sufficient to maintain plasma PLP concentrations; whole-blood pyridoxine concentrations were elevated in some patients who received 4 mg daily, and 4.5 mg maintained somewhat elevated vitamin B6 concentration in children on home PN after a week of therapy. Based on these results, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendation to increase vitamin B6 supply to 6 mg/d during PN seems to lack experimental support, although such an intake will not be harmful; conclusions state the current recommended dose of 6 mg daily for adults appears adequate and appropriate.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cystathionine β-synthase deficiency [^117PpL23]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Management of intercurrent illness (statement #37: grade of recommendation D)

During intercurrent illness, patients should continue their regular treatment (such as pyridoxine, betaine, their L-AA mixture and adequate energy). Dehydration and immobilization should be avoided to reduce the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Venous thrombosis is the main acute concern and the risk of this should be minimised by avoiding dehydration or immobilisation. Intractable vomiting may necessitate intravenous fluids.

None of the treatments for homocystinuria need to be stopped during intercurrent illnesses. Some increase in Hcy during illness is to be expected due to catabolism and should not be a concern for isolated, short illnesses. More frequent nutritional monitoring may be needed in patients on dietary treatment who have prolonged or recurrent illnesses.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cystathionine β-synthase deficiency [^117Mprmm]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Pyridoxine in non-responsive patients (statement #19: grade of recommendation D)

There is no evidence that long-term pyridoxine is beneficial if there is no biochemical response in a properly conducted test.

There is no evidence that pyridoxine has beneficial effects independent of lowering Hcy concentrations. Though there can be a delay in seeing the full response, some response (i.e. > 20% decrease) should be seen within two weeks in patients who are not deficient in vitamin B 12 or folate.

Role of vitamin B 12 and folate supplementation (statement #20: grade of recommendation D)

All patients should receive adequate folate supplementation. Vitamin B 12 should be monitored and supplemented if deficient.

There are several reports of vitamin B 12 and folate deficiencies in patients with CBS deficiency (Smolin et al; Ishida et al). This may be due to increased flux through the remethylation pathway and use of the cofactors, or inadequate intake of the vitamins in patients on restricted diets. We recommend giving all patients low-dose folate supplements and monitoring their vitamin B 12 levels. High dose folate therapy may lead to an additional benefit through enhancing the remethylation pathway but may have side effects (Wang et al). Though it is clear that folate deficiency must be avoided, there is little evidence concerning the optimal dose of folate supplementation. In patients on dietary treatment, folate and vitamin B 12 supplements are generally included in the Met-free L-AA supplement, and it is not clear whether additional supplements are routinely required.

Dietary management

Approaches to dietary treatment (statement #21: grade of recommendation C-D)

Dietary treatment should be considered for all patients with CBS deficiency unless target Hcy levels are achieved entirely by pyridoxine supplementation. Diet may be used either as a sole treatment or adjunctive therapy along with pyridoxine and / or betaine. Most pyridoxine-unresponsive patients require a diet that is very low in natural protein, with supplements of a Met-free L-AA mixture. Lifelong treatment is required.

Dietary management of CBS deficiency can be highly successful. It should be considered for all pyridoxine unresponsive patients and as additional treatment in individuals who are partially pyridoxine responsive (Komrower et al; Perry et al; Mudd et al; Pullon; Walter et al; Yap and Naughten; Lutteri et al; Kabra; Keating et al; Schiff and Blom; Adam et al; de Lonlay et al).

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is intended for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management. Maternal risks are discussed throughout the labeling. No increased risk for congenital malformations has been reported in epidemiologic studies in pregnant women.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

The combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been the subject of many epidemiological studies (cohort, case control and meta-analyses) designed to detect possible teratogenicity. A meta-analysis of 16 cohort and 11 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1991 reported no increased risk for malformations from first trimester exposures to doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. A second meta-analysis of 12 cohort and 5 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1985 reported no statistically significant relationships between fetal abnormalities and the first trimester use of the combination doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride.

8.3 Lactation

Women should not breastfeed while using doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride.

The molecular weight of doxylamine succinate is low enough that passage into breast milk can be expected. Excitement, irritability and sedation have been reported in nursing infants presumably exposed to doxylamine succinate through breast milk. Infants with apnea or other respiratory syndromes may be particularly vulnerable to the sedative effects of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride resulting in worsening of their apnea or respiratory conditions.

Pyridoxine hydrochloride is excreted into breast milk. There have been no reports of adverse events in infants presumably exposed to pyridoxine hydrochloride through breast milk.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride in children under 18 years of age have not been established.

Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose in children. The overdose cases have been characterized by coma, grand mal seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3 year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. However, there is no correlation between the amount of doxylamine ingested, the doxylamine plasma level and clinical symptomatology.

### Demonstration of early efficacy results of the delayed-release combination of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^116ho5RA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects up to 80% of expecting mothers. In April 2013 the FDA approved the delayed-release combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride (Diclegis®) for NVP, based in part, on the results of a phase III randomized trial demonstrating the efficacy of this drug combination [study drug marketed under the trade name Diclectin® in Canada and Diclegis® in the United States] compared to placebo in pregnant women. Study drug dosing occurred for 14 days, which is substantially longer than what has been performed in similar studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate, through secondary analysis, whether the primary measure of efficacy can be demonstrated after five days of treatment.

Methods

Women suffering from NVP were randomized to receive Diclegis® (n = 131) or placebo (n = 125) for 14 days at doses ranging from two to four tablets a day, based on a pre-specified titration protocol. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the validated Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score at baseline versus Day 15 between Diclegis®-treated and placebo-treated women. For the present study, the change in PUQE score between baseline and Day 15 (end of the study) was compared to the changes observed for Days 3, 4, and 5.

Results

The use of delayed-release doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets show improved NVP symptom control as compared to placebo on Days 3,4 and 5, with sustained efficacy until the end of the trial.

Conclusion

A four day study drug dosing trial with Diclegis® is sufficient to document efficacy, as the results are similar to those achieved after 14 study drug dosing days. The benefit seen at the earlier time validates drug efficacy and minimizes the natural course of improvement.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^115jXL5z]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the 4th week and disappears by the 16th week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterised by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 30 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure; acupuncture; antihistamines; corticosteroids; corticotrophins; diazepam; dietary interventions other than ginger; domperidone; ginger; metoclopramide; ondansetron; phenothiazines; and pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy: current perspectives and questions for future research [^114VSzSz]. Annals of the Child Neurology Society (2023). Medium credibility.

Pyridoxine supplementation

PDE is historically defined based on the resolution of seizures following treatment with pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine, and treatment with pyridoxine remains central to the treatment of the epilepsy that has defined this disorder. The importance of vitamin B 6 supplementation is highlighted by the recurrence of seizures following pyridoxine withdrawal – and case reports that describe patients who died before pyridoxine was administered. As noted above, patients with PDE- ALDH7A1 have a secondary deficiency of PLP most likely due to a Knoevenagel reaction between the accumulating Δ 1 -P6C and PLP. Treatment with pyridoxine, as opposed to PLP, is recommended for several reasons. There is an association between PLP supplementation and cirrhosis, including at doses usually required for successful treatment of seizures. It is also worth considering that commercial pyridoxine preparations are relatively easy to obtain and stable, whereas PLP degrades quickly when exposed to light. The International PDE Consortium consensus guideline for pyridoxine supplementation by age is listed in Table 2. Note that these pharmacologic doses are substantially higher than the recommended dietary allowance (physiologic doses), which ranges from 0.1 mg for infants to 2 mg for lactating females. While there is a risk of peripheral neuropathy when the dose of pyridoxine exceeds 500 mg/day, the vast majority of patients with PDE- ALDH7A1 do not require such large doses for seizure control. Some patients may require one or more anti-seizure medications, in addition to the maximum recommended dose of pyridoxine, to achieve control of their seizures.

There have been many reports of presumed intrauterine fetal seizures in newborns subsequently diagnosed with PDE- ALDH7A1. As there is a 25% recurrence risk for a couple having another affected child, maternal pyridoxine supplementation during gestation has been proposed for these at-risk pregnancies, specifically to help control intrauterine seizures and improve developmental outcome. Ideally, plans should be made for the fetus to be delivered at an institution that is equipped to care for a newborn at risk of developing an epileptic encephalopathy, and the baby should receive pyridoxine supplementation until the results of confirmatory biochemical studies and/or gene testing have been obtained.

4.3 Risks of Treatment: Pyridoxine

The main concern about treatment with pyridoxine is that prolonged high doses can cause peripheral neuropathy. The risk is high with doses above 900 mg/day, but there are no reliable reports of neuropathy on doses below 500 mg/day. In line with this, the 2017 guidelines recommended using the lowest pyridoxine dose that achieves the biochemical target, up to a maximum of 500 mg/day. Data on the safe pyridoxine dose in children are scarce, but it must be related to size, so we recommended a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg/day.

Doses above 10 mg/kg/day were prescribed in the long term for 33 patients in the E‐HOD registry and doses above 500 mg/day for 35 patients. The risk of peripheral neuropathy is low for doses slightly above these values but it is worrying that doses above 900 mg/day were prescribed for 10 patients; if they remain on such doses, they are at high risk of developing neuropathy.

In the past, many NRs were treated with pyridoxine in case they responded in the long term, but there is no evidence that pyridoxine is beneficial in patients who show no biochemical response within 6 weeks. Pyridoxine was prescribed for most NRs in the E‐HOD registry (whether detected clinically or by NBS). This is not a concern if the pyridoxine dose is low, but many NRs were on high doses (Figure 2). Eight of the 10 patients prescribed doses above 900 mg/day were NRs. The pyridoxine will not help these patients but may well cause harm.

### Demonstration of early efficacy results of the delayed-release combination of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^112WScWL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The randomized trial described herein has previously shown the superiority of Diclegis® over placebo in treating symptoms of NVP in American women as well as its maternal safety. The study had a placebo arm, as symptoms of NVP may subside spontaneously in women by the end of the first trimester, and without a placebo arm the improvement may be erroneously and solely attributed to the active drug. However, in clinical practice it is important to note that over 20% of women experience symptoms beyond the first trimester of pregnancy.

In the present analysis, the greatest difference in the change in PUQE score between Diclegis®-treated and placebo-treated women remained stable on Days 3,4,5; by Day 15, some efficacy attributed to placebo may have been the result of spontaneous resolution of symptoms, causing the effect to loose its statistical significance. The results of the present analysis demonstrate that having a shorter duration trial of four or five days to determine the efficacy of Diclegis® may be favourable as compared to longer duration trials.

Continuation of a trial for 14 days when women with NVP are randomized to placebo may result in a substantial decreased quality of life; therefore, shorter duration trials are ideal when possible. This is especially true for a special population such as pregnant women. Additionally, a longer trial necessitates careful follow up of patients' adherence, as there is a tendency toward less compliance over time as well as loss to follow-up.

In this study, a secondary analysis was conducted on Diclegis® efficacy as compared to placebo after three, four or five days of study drug dosing, as compared to the original study that conducted data analysis to assess efficacy after 14 dosing days. Most studies conducted to-date on efficacy of antiemetics for NVP were much shorter, typically three to five days long but no standardized duration of measurement is in place. A standardized duration of measurement would also allow for a more accurate comparison of results across studies. Based on this secondary analysis of results from the 14 day long Phase III double-blind placebo controlled trial, the therapeutic response could be established earlier.

The benefit seen at the earlier time validates drug efficacy and minimizes the natural course of improvement. These results can guide the design of future studies comparing the effectiveness of the doxylamine and pyridoxine combination, and in turn, improving the quality of life of study participants.

### Epilepsy due to PNPO mutations: genotype, environment and treatment affect presentation and outcome [^112Lqtun]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Patient 12 in Group (iii), at the age of 19 years, found that a regular morning aura could be prevented by taking a multivitamin preparation in addition to pyridoxine. The tablet contains 100 mg riboflavin (precursor of FMN, the cofactor for PNPO) and it is possible that this boosted residual PNPO activity. Patients 12 and 14 in Group (iii) had autistic features.

Patient 10, being treated with pyridoxine, developed a severe neuropathy with persistent loss of ankle jerks. This is the first patient with PNPO deficiency that we have encountered to develop a severe neuropathy. Neuropathy is well recognized in normal adults taking doses > 200 mg/day of pyridoxine and we see it in some patients with antiquitin deficiency on similar doses. Analysis of plasma B 6 vitamer levels in two antiquitin-deficient patients treated with pyridoxine and showing mild peripheral neuropathy, revealed that plasma PLP remained low whereas pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, PMP and pyridoxine were increased. Animal experiments have suggested that pyridoxine may be more toxic to the PNS than other B 6 vitamers.

Two patients in this series that are treated with PLP have persistently deranged liver function tests. Similar findings have been documented in a child with PNPO deficiency receiving a high dose (100 mg/kg/day) PLP treatment. A liver biopsy showed early cirrhosis, which was attributed to the PLP therapy. The PLP dose has now been reduced to 60 mg/kg/day and although the liver function tests have improved, they have not normalized and there is persistent evidence of hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension. Liver toxicity secondary to high dose PLP (1000 mg/day) has also been reported for a child with homocystinuria. It is uncertain whether the cause of this toxicity is directly due to the high dose PLP or to degradation products of PLP that may form by photochemical reactions. Liver function should be monitored in all children treated with high doses of PLP.

### Demonstration of early efficacy results of the delayed-release combination of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^114osjR7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled study of the delayed-release combination of doxylamine succinate (10 mg) and pyridoxine hydrochloride (10 mg) (Diclegis®) for the treatment of NVP]. The full details of the study have been previously published. Briefly, the subjects were at least 18 years of age, pregnant in the gestational age range of 7–14 weeks, suffered from NVP, and had a PUQE score ≥ 6. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily retching, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe). Score of 1 on each of the 3 symptoms-nausea, vomiting and retching, denotes "no symptoms", and goes as high as 15 (5, or maximum for each symptom). Scores of 4–6 denote mild NVP. Scores of 7–11 denote moderate NVP, and scores of 12–15 denote severe NVP.

Between 2–4 tablets of study drug (Diclegis® or placebo) were administered, based on severity of symptoms. The study had a 15 day period consisting of 14 dosing days. Subjects completed the PUQE score and the study diary once daily.

The primary therapeutic effect of Diclegis® or placebo was calculated by subtracting the PUQE score at baseline (ie. before receiving study drug) from the PUQE score at Day 15 (or at early termination). The difference in the change in PUQE between Diclegis®-treated and placebo-treated women was used as the primary efficacy endpoint.

For the purpose of this secondary analysis, the same calculations were conducted, but this time comparing the change in PUQE score from baseline to Day 3, from baseline to Day 4, and from baseline to Day 5 between Diclegis®-treated and placebo-treated women. Student's t test for pair data was used for these comparisons.

### Maternal safety of the delayed-release doxylamine and pyridoxine combination for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy; a randomized placebo controlled trial [^116p7WtS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The randomized trial described herein has previously shown the superiority of Diclegis® over placebo in treating the symptoms of NVP in American women managed in 3 academic centers.

In Canada, the doxylamine succinate-pyridoxine hydrochloride combination (Diclectin®) has been available since 1979, with a large number of studies corroborating the initial FDA evaluation of its efficacy and safety. The present study had a placebo arm, as symptoms of NVP tend to subside spontaneously in most women by the end of the first trimester. In addition, when considering maternal safety associated with the first trimester of pregnancy, symptoms such as fatigue, tendency to sleep and dehydration, may be erroneously attributed to the drug, rather than to both pregnancy and NVP.

The use of Diclegis® was not associated with an increased risk of any adverse effects when compared to placebo, lending important reassurance to its use by large numbers of pregnant women.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^114vo1ry]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the 16th week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterised by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure; acupuncture; corticosteroids; ginger; metoclopramide; ondansetron; prochlorperazine; promethazine; and pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### Emergency management of intoxication-type inherited metabolic disorders [^116PGhGA]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Pyridox(am)ine 5′‐phosphate oxidase (PNPO) is responsible for the synthesis of PLP from pyridoxine and for its recycling. PNPO deficiency is clinically indistinguishable from antiquitin deficiency, except that most patients are born prematurely. Some respond to pyridoxine, but a trial of PLP should be considered if neonatal epileptic encephalopathy does not respond to pyridoxine or shows a partial response. Pyridoxine‐responsive seizures have also been reported in hyperprolinaemia type II. Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate accumulates and inactivates PLP by a similar reaction to that in antiquitin deficiency. Long‐term treatment with pyridoxine is recommended, though there was little evidence of benefit in one small series.

Seizures may also be a presenting feature for biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) deficiencies. Severe biotinidase deficiency has predominantly neurological features and typically presents between 1 and 4 months of age. In contrast, patients with HCS deficiency can present at any age from a few hours to mid‐childhood, usually with acidosis, which may be accompanied by hyperammonaemia. Alopecia and rashes occur in both conditions. All patients with biotinidase deficiency respond to biotin, as do most with HCS deficiency, though higher doses may be needed. Deafness and neurodevelopmental problems are very common in patients with biotinidase deficiency presenting clinically but can be prevented by newborn screening. Most patients need no special treatment during acute illness if biotin is continued, but some with HCS deficiency require a high caloric intake to prevent decompensation, and insulin is reported to have helped one patient.

Non‐ketotic hyperglycinaemia (NKH) is caused by a deficiency of the glycine cleavage system. Most patients present within hours or days of birth with poor feeding, hypotonia and lethargy, progressing to coma and, usually, apnoea. If ventilatory support is provided, spontaneous respiration resumes after about 10 days, but most patients have intractable epilepsy and make little developmental progress. A smaller number of patients present after 2 weeks of age with developmental delay and seizures. Treatment is primarily with sodium benzoate, which lowers glycine levels and is sometimes combined with dietary restriction of glycine and serine. Glycine is an activator of NMDA glutamate receptors, and treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonists Dextromethorphan or Ketamine can also help. Patients often require multiple anticonvulsants. The ketogenic diet can improve seizure control, as in other epilepsies, and has the additional benefit of lowering glycine levels by reducing its synthesis.

### Toxin-related seizures [^111QypM4]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Toxin-related seizures result from an imbalance in the brain's equilibrium of excitation-inhibition. Fortunately, most toxin-related seizures respond to standard therapy using benzodiazepines. However, a few alterations in the standard approach are recommended to ensure optimal care and expedient termination of seizure activity. If 2 doses of a benzodiazepine do not terminate the seizure activity, a therapeutic dose of pyridoxine (5 g intravenously in an adult and 70 mg/kg intravenously in a child) should be considered. Phenytoin should be avoided because it is ineffective for many toxin-induced seizures and is potentially harmful when used to treat seizures induced by theophylline or cyclic antidepressants.

Table 2.
Secondary Outcomes

Numeric rating scale scores assessed at rest (0 [0 to 2] vs. 1 [0 to 2]; median difference = 0 [95% CI, −2 to 2]; P = 0.68) and during movement (2 [1 to 3] vs. 3 [1.25 to 4]; median difference = −1 [95% CI, −3 to 2]; P = 0.20) and morphine consumption (0 [0] vs. 0 [0 to 4]; median difference = −2.82 [95% CI, −11.78 to 6.14]; P = 0.47) at 24 h postoperatively were comparable in both groups (table 2).

After adjustment for preoperative values as covariates, there were no statistically significant differences in the white blood cells, absolute count, and percentage of neutrophils between the two groups (table 2). The level of substance P at 0 h after surgery did not exhibit any statistically significant difference; however, it was significantly decreased at 24 h after surgery in both groups. The interleukin-6 level demonstrated an increase immediately after surgery but returned to a level with no statistical difference compared with the preoperative level in both groups (fig. 3).

Fig. 3.
Preoperative and postoperative plasma concentrations of substance P (n = 15; A and B) and interleukin (IL)-6 (n = 15; C and D). A and C, blood samples were collected before induction and immediately after surgery. B and D, blood samples were collected before induction and at 24 h after surgery.

Adverse Events

There were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of intraoperative hypertension, postinduction hypotension, intraoperative tachycardia, and intraoperative bradycardia. However, the incidence of intraoperative hypotension was lower in the pyridoxine group (30.8% [37 of 120] vs. 52.5% [63 of 120]; relative risk = 0.59 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.81], P = 0.001). No patient had an allergic reaction during the perioperative period. The patients did not report any incidence of abnormal tactile or thermal sensations in their limbs or loss of balance after surgery (table 3).

### Effect of combined diclofenac and B vitamins (thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin) for low back pain management: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fR8bh]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We compiled all available published and unpublished evidence and used premature discontinuation of medication due to complete pain relief as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included decreased pain intensity according to a visual analog scale (VAS) measure, the occurrence of adverse events (i.e.g.astrointestinal events), and participant satisfaction, based on the number of patients who described subjective improvement at the end of the study. We assessed the quality of the obtained results using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.

Data Sources and Search Strategy

We conducted this systematic review of RCTs in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses declaration criteria and the current recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. We carried out searches up to June 2018 using the search terms "pain", "thiamine", "vitamin B1", "pyridoxine", "vitamin B6", "cyanocobalamin", "vitamin B12", "vitamin B complex", "Neurobion", and "diclofenac" in the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE (Ovid SP), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Registry (ISRCTN), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). No language, date of publication, or completion status filters were used. In addition, we carried out a search of the references for review articles, relevant clinical trials, textbooks, and conference summaries to identify more RCTs. In all cases, we read the full-text versions of these articles. We systematically contacted the corresponding authors by e-mail if the publication contained incomplete data (i.e. data on adverse events). Although the focus of this review is LBP, we searched for pain in general, with the intention of increasing the sensitivity of the search strategy, considering that there are a lot of terms with the same meaning (i.e. back pain, lumbago, spine pain, sciatica, and dorsalgia, among others).

The search equation is found in Appendix 1. Likewise, we made additional efforts to identify RCTs that were potentially relevant to the topic using the following data sources: 1) gray literature (theses, internal reports, non-peer-reviewed journals) and 2) other unpublished sources known to experts in the specialty (obtained via personal communication).

### The impact and management of hyperemesis gravidarum: current and future perspectives [^1165AxLN]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2024 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG) guideline, the most appropriate rehydration regime for HG patients is normal saline. Additional potassium chloride in each bag is recommended by the RCOG and is often pragmatically chosen based on a daily need of 60 mmol. A frequently used regimen is 3 L of 0.9% NaCl with 20 mmol of potassium chloride administered IV over the course of 4 h. The use of dextrose infusions as fluid replacement could be an acceptable form of partial parental nutrition, as long as electrolytes are carefully monitored before and after infusion to prohibit the risk of dextrose solutions exacerbating hypokalemia, triggering refeeding syndrome, or triggering WE in thiamine‐deficient states. As hypovolemic HG patients can be hyponatremic, hypochloremic, and hypokalemic, monitoring of electrolytes is recommended during rehydration treatment in such cases. Renal function monitoring should also be considered in severe cases of HG as acute kidney failure induced by HG has been described. Furthermore, in cases of severe hypokalemia, ECG analysis should be considered to rule out arrythmia.

Antiemetic treatment is the current cornerstone of treatment of HG (Table 1), although many drugs are not registered for use in pregnancy and data on effectiveness and safety are limited. First‐line antiemetic treatment for HG consists of antihistamines or phenothiazines, so‐called H1 receptor antagonists, as their safety profiles are well established during the first trimester of pregnancy. These medications have not been demonstrated to be effective in people with HG. However, another first‐line antiemetic, the delayed‐release combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) has shown an improvement in PUQE score when compared with placebo in the treatment of mild‐to‐moderate NVP. Delayed‐release doxylamine and pyridoxine is the only licensed treatment of NVP and the RCOG guideline recommends it as a first‐line option.

### Managing hepatic complications of pregnancy: practical strategies for clinicians [^114NQmtw]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Management

Treatment of HG is supportive with intravenous rehydration, electrolyte replacement and antiemetics. There is varying guidance on antiemetic therapy and a Cochrane meta-analysis has found that no single antiemetic is superior to others. Specific medications for first-line to fourth-line therapy recommended for use are demonstrated in table 3. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommend pyridoxine alone or in combination with doxylamine as first-line therapy. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) does not recommend use of pyridoxine based on a lack of evidence on efficacy. Corticosteroids should only be used after standard treatment has failed and are recommend by ACOG, RCOG, EASL and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), although the evidence for their effectiveness is conflicting. Thiamine supplementation is required to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is recommended by AASLD, RCOG, ACOG and EASL.

Table 3
Medications recommended for treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum by major authoritative bodies

Ongoing vomiting, despite medical therapies, should prompt consideration of enteral or parenteral nutrition. There are no established criteria for enteral or parenteral feeding. Enteral feeding with nasogastric, nasoduodenal or nasojejunal tubes is safer, leaving total parenteral nutrition as a last resort.

Serum urea and electrolytes should be checked daily and maternal body weight should be monitored. The Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis score is a validated system based on three parameters including (1) duration of nausea, (2) number of vomiting episodes and (3) number of dry heaves (in the preceding 12 hours) which can be used to monitor progress.

Prognosis

Poor weight gain in HG is associated with fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, small for gestational age babies and low Apgar scores. Maternal complications are uncommon and include Wernicke's encephalopathy, which presents with confusion and nystagmus. HG typically resolves by 20 weeks gestation but may in rare cases persist throughout the pregnancy. There are no long-term consequences on liver function. Recurrence of HG in subsequent pregnancies is common.

### Effectiveness of delayed-release doxylamine and pyridoxine for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a randomized placebo controlled trial [^116jf3zb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of Diclectin (doxylamine succinate 10 mg-pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg, delayed-release preparation) as compared with placebo for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind, multicenter placebo controlled trial studying pregnant women suffering from nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, analyzed by intention to treat. Women received Diclectin (n = 131) or placebo (n = 125) for 14 days. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy symptoms were evaluated daily using the pregnancy unique quantification of emesis scale.

Results

Diclectin use resulted in a significantly larger improvement in symptoms of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy compared with placebo based on both the pregnancy unique quantification of emesis score (-4.8 ± 2.7 vs -3.9 ± 2.6; p = 0.006) and quality of life. After the trial, 64 (48.9%) women receiving Diclectin asked to continue compassionate use of their medication, as compared with 41 (32.8%) of placebo-treated women (P = .009).

Conclusion

Diclectin delayed release formulation of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is effective and well tolerated in treating nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### A randomized controlled trial of ginger to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^116ubNYR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate whether the use of ginger to treat nausea or vomiting in pregnancy is equivalent to pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6).

Methods

A randomized, controlled equivalence trial involving 291 women less than 16 weeks pregnant was undertaken at a teaching hospital in Australia. Women took 1.05 g of ginger or 75 mg of vitamin B6 daily for 3 weeks. Differences from baseline in nausea and vomiting scores were estimated for both groups at days 7, 14, and 21.

Results

Ginger was equivalent to vitamin B6 in reducing nausea (mean difference 0.2, 90% confidence interval [CI] -0.3, 0.8), retching (mean difference 0.3; 90% CI -0.0, 0.6) and vomiting (mean difference 0.5; 90% CI 0.0, 0.9), averaged over time, with no evidence of different effects at the 3 time points.

Conclusion

For women looking for relief from their nausea, dry retching, and vomiting, the use of ginger in early pregnancy will reduce their symptoms to an equivalent extent as vitamin B6.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy — antiemetic therapy recommendations specify that H1-receptor antagonists, such as doxylamine, promethazine, and dimenhydrinate, are considered safe first-line pharmacologic antiemetic therapies, if needed. Doxylamine is US Food and Drug Administration–approved and recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for persistent NVP refractory to nonpharmacologic therapy. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are available in 10 mg/10 mg and 20 mg/20 mg combinations and are safe and well tolerated. Early intervention and treatment of NVP may help prevent progression to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG).

### Over-the-counter medications in pregnancy [^111NGFuu]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

High-quality research on the safety and effectiveness of over-the-counter medications in pregnancy is limited. Physicians should explore nonpharmacologic treatments before recommending medication. For nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), H1 antihistamines, and ginger are safe and effective. Physicians can recommend calcium carbonate, H2 antihistamines, and proton pump inhibitors for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Osmotic laxatives, fiber preparations, and probiotics are safe and effective treatments for constipation. Many over-the-counter topical medications are safe in pregnancy due to low systemic absorption, but topical retinoids, such as adapalene, should be avoided. Hypertonic saline nasal rinse and antihistamines are safe, beneficial options for treating pregnancy-induced rhinitis, and intranasal corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit for chronic allergic rhinitis. The safety of acetaminophen for the treatment of headaches and low back pain during pregnancy has come into question with recent studies; therefore, judicious use is advised. Physicians should screen all pregnant patients for their risk of developing preeclampsia and initiate low-dose aspirin from 12 weeks' gestation until delivery for those at increased risk. Data are limited on the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements during pregnancy.

### Treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting in pregnancy: a systematic review [^1122WsJU]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Nausea and vomiting affects approximately 85% of pregnant women. The most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum, affects up to 3% of women and can have significant adverse physical and psychological sequelae.

Objective

To summarize current evidence on effective treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum.

Evidence Review

Databases were searched to June 8, 2016. Relevant websites and bibliographies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by 2 reviewers. Results were narratively synthesized; planned meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity and incomplete reporting of findings.

Findings

Seventy-eight studies (n = 8930 participants) were included: 67 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 11 nonrandomized studies. Evidence from 35 RCTs at low risk of bias indicated that ginger, vitamin B6, antihistamines, metoclopramide (for mild symptoms), pyridoxine-doxylamine, and ondansetron (for moderate symptoms) were associated with improved symptoms compared with placebo. One RCT (n = 86) reported greater improvements in moderate symptoms following psychotherapy (change in Rhodes score [range, 0 {no symptoms} to 40 {worst possible symptoms}], 18.76 [SD, 5.48] to 7.06 [SD, 5.79] for intervention vs 19.18 [SD, 5.63] to 12.81 [SD, 6.88] for comparator [P < .001]). For moderate-severe symptoms, 1 RCT (n = 60) suggested that pyridoxine-doxylamine combination taken preemptively reduced risk of recurrence of moderate-severe symptoms compared with treatment once symptoms begin (15.4% vs 39.1% [P < .04]). One RCT (n = 83) found that ondansetron was associated with lower nausea scores on day 4 than metoclopramide (mean visual analog scale [VAS] score, 4.1 [SD, 2.9] for ondansetron vs 5.7 [SD, 2.3] for metoclopramide [P = .023]) but not episodes of emesis (5.0 [SD, 3.1] vs 3.3 [SD, 3], respectively [P = .013]). Although there was no difference in trend in nausea scores over the 14-day study period, trend in vomiting scores was better in the ondansetron group (P = .042). One RCT (n = 159) found no difference between metoclopramide and promethazine after 24 hours (episodes of vomiting, 1 [IQR, 0–5] for metoclopramide vs 2 [IQR, 0–3] for promethazine [P = .81], VAS [0–10 scale] for nausea, 2 [IQR, 1–5] vs 2 [IQR, 1–4], respectively [P = .99]). Three RCTs compared corticosteroids with placebo or promethazine or metoclopramide in women with severe symptoms. Improvements were seen in all corticosteroid groups, but only a significant difference between corticosteroids vs metoclopramide was reported (emesis reduction, 40.9% vs 16.5% at day 2; 71.6% vs 51.2% at day 3; 95.8% vs 76.6% at day 7 [n = 40, P < .001]). For other interventions, evidence was limited.

Conclusions and Relevance

For mild symptoms of nausea and emesis of pregnancy, ginger, pyridoxine, antihistamines, and metoclopramide were associated with greater benefit than placebo. For moderate symptoms, pyridoxine-doxylamine, promethazine, and metoclopramide were associated with greater benefit than placebo. Ondansetron was associated with improvement for a range of symptom severity. Corticosteroids may be associated with benefit in severe cases. Overall the quality of evidence was low.

### Pyridoxine prevents postoperative nausea and vomiting in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112LQGmK]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary Outcomes

Patients assigned to the pyridoxine group had a lower incidence of postoperative nausea (12.5% [15 of 120] vs. 35% [42 of 120]; relative risk = 0.36 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.61]; absolute risk reduction = 0.23 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.33]; P < 0.001); however, the incidence of postoperative vomiting was not statistically different (9.2% [11 of 120] vs. 15.8% [19 of 120]; relative risk = 0.58 [95% CI, 0.29 to 1.16]; absolute risk reduction = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.07]; P = 0.118; fig. 2). In the comparison of patients in the pyridoxine group with those in the control group according to the severity of postoperative nausea and postoperative vomiting, it was found that pyridoxine reduced the occurrence of moderate (relative risk = 0.09 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.70]; P = 0.01) and severe (relative risk = 0.10 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.41]; P < 0.001) postoperative nausea, as well as severe postoperative vomiting (relative risk = 0.20 [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.89]; P = 0.02). There was no difference in the frequency of vomiting between the two groups within 24 h after surgery. The time to the first postoperative nausea and vomiting occurrence was 6 (2 to 13.8) h in the pyridoxine group and 5 (0.5 to 10) h in the control group (median difference = 1.14 [95% CI, −2.80 to 5.07]; P = 0.40). A total of 4 patients in the pyridoxine group and 10 patients in the control group required rescue antiemetic drugs in the ward; however, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (table 2).

### Demonstration of early efficacy results of the delayed-release combination of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^113fsv7S]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 131 women in the Diclegis®-treated group and 125 receiving placebo were available for analysis. The two groups did not differ in any demographic or medical characteristics.

As previously published, the use of Diclegis® for 14 days resulted in a significantly lower PUQE score by 0.9 PUQE units when compared to placebo (p = 0.006). At Day 3, the mean difference in NVP symptoms between Diclegis®-treated and placebo-treated women was also significantly lower by 1.0 PUQE units (p = 0.002). At Day 4, the mean difference in NVP symptoms between Diclegis®-treated and placebo-treated women was 1.1 PUQE units (p < 0.001). At Day 5, the mean difference was 1.0 PUQE units (p = 0.006) (Table 1).

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^1164cbRP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to nausea and vomiting entails the exclusion of other causes, especially if these symptoms persist during the second and third trimesters. Most women do not require pharmacological treatment and can be managed with alternative options and dietary modifications. Diet recommendations include fractionized meals and avoidance of fatty foods and fresh vegetables that can delay gastric emptying. Daily consumption of 1.5 L of water or drinks containing glucose, salt and potassium are recommended. Both thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) have proven their efficacy and are indicated as routine supplements in patients with protracted vomiting. A 2010 Cochrane review evaluated nine randomized trials involving ginger. Based on expert experience, ginger can be considered a non-pharmacologic option during pregnancy.

Concerning the pharmacological treatment, antiemetics can be an option for women with persistent nausea and vomiting. Histamine receptor blockers (anti-H1), such as promethazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, doxylamine and dimenhydrinate, are considered first-line treatment, because no adverse fetal effects have been described. Doxylamine has the advantage of being safe when symptoms begin (6–7 weeks). In a cohort of 608,385 pregnancies, Pasternak et al evaluated ondansetron, an H3 receptor blocker, and concluded that it was not associated with a significant increase in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defects, preterm delivery or small born infants for gestational age. However, there are studies documenting congenital heart defects, especially when ondansetron was taken in the first trimester. Consequently, it is recommended as second-line therapy. Phenothiazines are another first-line treatment option, including prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and perphenazine. Studies have not shown increased risk for major malformations. Finally, metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, can also be safely prescribed. However, it crosses the placenta and is considered a second-line treatment option, given its potential extrapyramidal effects on both the fetus (third trimester) and the mother (first trimester).

Pyridox(am)ine 5′‐phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency is an ultrarare inherited neurometabolic disease, characterized by primarily neonatal‐onset B6‐responsive epileptic encephalopathies. Treatment often requires sustainable access to high‐quality pyridoxal‐5′‐phosphate (PLP, i.e. active vitamin B6), although some patients (also) respond to pyridoxine (PN). While PN is authorized as a medicinal product, PLP is not, and this forces reliance on lesser‐regulated food supplements, which risks dosing inaccuracies. This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness and safety of PLP in PNPO deficiency (PROSPERO, CRD42024542199). A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and, with risk of bias assessed and observational evidence summarized using a narrative synthesis approach. A total of 30 studies were included reporting on 49 patients treated with PLP. Clinical seizure responsiveness following PLP therapy was observed in the majority of patients (n = 38, 77.6%) and PLP treatment significantly improved survival (p < 0.001) compared with untreated siblings with a similar phenotype. The majority of PLP‐responsive patients responded exclusively to PLP, with PN being attempted but ineffective in most of them (n = 30/33, 90.9%) Liver toxicity was the most frequently observed adverse event (n = 10, 20.4%) and although the underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear, it may be associated with high‐dose PLP. Therefore, regular liver disease screening is recommended during PLP therapy. This means that PLP remains the only effective therapy for achieving and maintaining seizure control in the majority of PNPO deficient patients, but the therapeutic window for optimal management is narrow. Thus, it is essential to ensure patient access to high‐quality and appropriate forms of PLP.

### Comparison of three outpatient regimens in the management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^115zw7WZ]. Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study compares pyridoxine-metoclopramide combination therapy to prochlorperazine and promethazine monotherapies in the outpatient treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

Study Design

In total, 174 first trimester, singleton pregnancies were evaluated for nausea and vomiting. Patients were prospectively randomized into three treatment groups: pyridoxine-metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, or promethazine. Prior to, and on the third day, patients recorded their subjective responses to the given treatment and their number of emesis episodes. The three treatment groups were compared for therapy response.

Results

There were no differences in the number of emesis episodes prior to treatment. Both subjective and objective responses to treatment differed among the three groups when comparing the combination therapy to the monotherapies (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Combination therapy with pyridoxine and metoclopramide appears to be superior to either monotherapy in the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

### Pyridoxine prevents postoperative nausea and vomiting in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^117F56fE]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Postoperative nausea and vomiting are common complications after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. Pyridoxine has been recommended as a first-line drug to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy; however, its efficacy in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting remains unclear.

Methods:

Patients of 18 to 65 yr old who received elective gynecologic laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia were randomized into either the pyridoxine group or the control group. The pyridoxine group received 0.2 g of vitamin B 6 before anesthesia induction, and the control group received normal saline intravenously. Both groups received a similar regimen of combined intravenous and inhalation general anesthesia. All patients received dexamethasone (intravenous) after anesthesia induction and ondansetron (intravenous) before surgery completion. Postoperative nausea and vomiting occurrence was recorded according to the patients' self-reported data. Other clinical data were collected from hospital system, and concentrations of blood interleukin-6 and substance P were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results:

A total of 442 patients were screened, and 240 patients were equally randomized to the pyridoxine or control group. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was statistically significant lower in the pyridoxine group than in the control group (16.7% [20 of 120] vs. 35.8% [43 of 120]; relative risk = 0.47 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.74]; absolute risk reduction = 0.20 [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.30]; P = 0.001), and pyridoxine decreased the incidence of postoperative nausea (12.5% [15 of 120] vs. 35% [42 of 120]; relative risk = 0.36 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.61]; absolute risk reduction = 0.23 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.33]; P < 0.001). There were no statistical differences in postoperative vomiting, time to the first postoperative nausea and vomiting occurrence, pain, serum interleukin-6 and substance P, and leukocyte and neutrophil counts.

Conclusions:

In this single-center randomized trial, pyridoxine plus dexamethasone and ondansetron reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing elective gynecologic laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. These findings need to be validated in multicenter studies in diverse populations to ensure generalizability.

### Use of prescription antiemetics among US commercially insured pregnant patients, 2005–2019 [^114u7LCF]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

According to the 2004 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guideline, pyridoxine or a combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine is recommended as first-line therapy, whereas ondansetron should be reserved as a last-line therapy to control nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP). The 2018 ACOG guideline recommends use of ondansetron as third-line therapy. Given the treatment guidelines' updates, little is known regarding how antiemetics have been used. We aimed to address this evidence gap by describing prescription antiemetic treatment patterns considering monotherapy, switching, and combination therapy during the first trimester. We also evaluated factors associated with ondansetron use, the most commonly used prescription antiemetic during the study period.

### Pyridoxine-dependent seizures responding to extremely low-dose pyridoxine [^116iYn4Q]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

We report on a male infant with pyridoxine dependency and seizures from birth, controlled with pharmacological doses of pyridoxine at 4 months of age. Seizures stopped between 30 and 80 days of age when very-low doses of pyridoxine were given in a multivitamin supplement. Daily dose was 0.5 mg that corresponded to 0.08 to 0.16 mg/kg/day when weight gain is considered. In previous reports doses have ranged from 0.2 to 30 mg/kg/day. Another distinctive feature was that this infant went into a coma and developed hypotonia and irregular breathing when pyridoxine was given by enteral tube which has usually been reported when the vitamin is given intravenously. Use of low doses of pyridoxine in multivitamin supplements could be a confounding factor for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of pyridoxine-dependent seizures.

### Consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy due to α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency [^117Xg994]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE-ALDH7A1) is an autosomal recessive condition due to a deficiency of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, which is a key enzyme in lysine oxidation. PDE-ALDH7A1 is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy that was historically and empirically treated with pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine. Despite adequate seizure control, most patients with PDE-ALDH7A1 were reported to have developmental delay and intellectual disability. To improve outcome, a lysine-restricted diet and competitive inhibition of lysine transport through the use of pharmacologic doses of arginine have been recommended as an adjunct therapy. These lysine-reduction therapies have resulted in improved biochemical parameters and cognitive development in many but not all patients. The goal of these consensus guidelines is to re-evaluate and update the two previously published recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with PDE-ALDH7A1. Members of the International PDE Consortium initiated evidence and consensus-based process to review previous recommendations, new research findings, and relevant clinical aspects of PDE-ALDH7A1. The guideline development group included pediatric neurologists, biochemical geneticists, clinical geneticists, laboratory scientists, and metabolic dieticians representing 29 institutions from 16 countries. Consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with PDE-ALDH7A1 are provided.

### Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride tablet,… [^113JuPY5]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

analog, indicated for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Take two tablets daily at bedtime. If symptoms are not adequately controlled, the dose can be increased to a maximum recommended dose of four tablets daily. If this dose adequately controls symptoms the next day, continue taking two tablets daily at bedtime. However, if symptoms persist into the afternoon of Day 2, take the usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night then take three tablets starting on Day 3. If. these three tablets adequately control symptoms on Day 4, continue taking three tablets daily. Otherwise take four tablets starting on Day 4.

The maximum recommended dose is four tablets, the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets were taken daily. Over the treatment period, 19% of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets-treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily.
