## Question

What are the treatment options for euvolemic hyponatremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for euvolemic hyponatremia, with explicit step-by-step thinking and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the hyponatremia correctly. Then, I should assess symptom severity and acuity to determine urgency. Next, I will outline first-line therapy for chronic, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic euvolemic hyponatremia, followed by second-line options for refractory cases. After that, I need to address acute, severely symptomatic presentations and the role of hypertonic saline. Finally, I should integrate safety monitoring, correction limits, and special populations, and close with a concise algorithm that ties these elements together.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and classification, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. I need to verify hypotonicity with a measured serum osmolality less than about 275 mOsm/kg, then determine volume status clinically and with urine studies, and finally identify the likely etiology, with SIADH being the most common cause of euvolemic hyponatremia, while remembering to exclude hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and thiazide-induced hyponatremia before labeling SIADH definitively [^1169CfKA] [^116Zh6gJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before I stratify by symptom severity and chronicity. I should confirm whether the patient has severe symptoms such as seizures, coma, or respiratory compromise, which mandate emergent therapy, versus moderate or mild symptoms, versus asymptomatic cases where a more measured approach is appropriate, and I should also distinguish acute onset under 48 hours from chronic presentations, as this affects correction targets and the risk of osmotic demyelination [^1169CfKA] [^1117skm3].

> For chronic, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic euvolemic hyponatremia, I will now examine first-line therapy. Fluid restriction is the cornerstone, but wait, let me verify the magnitude of restriction and predictors of response. A practical starting point is 500 to 1000 mL per day, with tighter restriction when the urine-to-serum electrolyte ratio exceeds 1, indicating high antidiuretic activity and poor response to modest restriction, and I should set expectations that roughly half of SIADH patients will not respond adequately to fluid restriction alone [^113PdLtM] [^113jQ15H] [^113rohyY].

> Next, I should review second-line options for fluid-restriction–resistant cases, and I need to ensure I weigh efficacy against safety and availability. Urea at 0.25 to 0.5 g per kg per day is recommended by European guidance and is effective and inexpensive, though palatability can be a barrier, while tolvaptan is highly efficacious but carries a risk of overly rapid correction and is costly; I should also note that loop diuretics plus salt tablets have weak evidence and may provoke hypokalemia or AKI, so I should be cautious there [^112MGZPb] [^116syrTq] [^117CHGVN].

> Wait, I should double-check the regulatory status and dosing of tolvaptan before recommending it. In the United States, tolvaptan is indicated for clinically significant hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia, typically serum sodium less than 125 mEq/L or symptomatic cases unresponsive to fluid restriction, with a starting dose of 15 mg orally once daily and titration to 30 to 60 mg daily for up to 30 days, but it is not appropriate for urgent correction of severe neurologic symptoms, where hypertonic saline is preferred [^1133HjXE] [^111wraH8].

> I will now examine the acute, severely symptomatic scenario, because missing this window risks cerebral edema and death. For life-threatening hyponatremic encephalopathy, I should administer 3 percent hypertonic saline as a 100 to 150 mL bolus, repeated up to two additional times at 10 minute intervals if needed, targeting a 4 to 6 mEq per liter rise in serum sodium within the first 1 to 2 hours, while checking sodium 20 minutes after each bolus and avoiding exceeding about 10 mEq per liter in the first 24 hours to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk [^1169CfKA] [^115WbE1C] [^111Fe3u4].

> But wait, what if the sodium rises too fast after the initial boluses. I need to ensure a plan for overcorrection, because a sudden aquaresis can accelerate the rise beyond intent. If the sodium increase approaches or exceeds guideline limits, I should promptly administer desmopressin and give electrolyte-free water, such as 10 mL per kg of dextrose in water over about an hour, under close monitoring, to safely relower sodium and prevent demyelination [^113PyTGH] [^1117skm3].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and safety thresholds, and I need to ensure I am consistent with major guidelines. Frequent sodium checks are essential in the first 24 to 48 hours, typically every 4 to 6 hours initially, with a general target of no more than 8 to 12 mEq per liter in 24 hours and no more than 18 mEq per liter in 48 hours, and in high-risk patients such as those with alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, or severe hypokalemia, I should adopt a stricter limit of under 8 mEq per liter in 24 hours [^1117skm3] [^1169CfKA].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts, because management nuances matter. In cancer-associated SIADH, tolvaptan may be particularly useful to achieve timely correction and facilitate oncologic therapy, but I should confirm that monitoring for overcorrection is stringent given the higher observed rates with active therapies, and in thiazide-associated hyponatremia, immediate thiazide withdrawal is critical and often sufficient, with hypertonic saline reserved for severe cases due to its higher risk of overcorrection [^116jKxH9] [^115zTKGG].

> I should double-check the role of isotonic saline in euvolemic hyponatremia, because it is frequently misused. Isotonic saline can transiently raise sodium in SIADH but is generally ineffective for sustained correction and may worsen hyponatremia via salt excretion and AVP stimulation, so it should not be used as primary therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia, though a diagnostic trial can occasionally help distinguish SIADH from hypovolemia when the diagnosis is uncertain [^113bNPST] [^1116ARCm] [^1135qAvS].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. First, confirm hypotonic euvolemic hyponatremia and identify the cause, then stratify by symptom severity and acuity, initiate fluid restriction for chronic mild cases, escalate to urea or tolvaptan if restriction fails or is infeasible, treat severe symptomatic cases urgently with hypertonic saline boluses, and throughout apply strict correction limits with frequent sodium checks and a desmopressin and free water rescue plan for overcorrection, all while addressing the underlying etiology whenever possible [^1169CfKA] [^114Mg1Pm] [^113PdLtM].

---

Euvolemic hyponatremia is most often due to SIADH, and management should be tailored to symptom severity and chronicity [^1169CfKA]. For **severe symptoms**, treat with 3% hypertonic saline to raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L rapidly, then slow correction to ≤ 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours to avoid osmotic demyelination [^113SHKnQ]. For **chronic/asymptomatic cases**, use fluid restriction (800–1,000 mL/day) as first-line; if ineffective, add oral urea (30–60 g/day) or consider vasopressin antagonists (tolvaptan, conivaptan) [^112MGZPb] [^1133HjXE]. Always treat the underlying cause, monitor sodium every 4–6 hours initially, and avoid rapid correction; use desmopressin and free water if overcorrection occurs [^113PyTGH].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and classification are essential for management; confirm hypotonicity and **exclude pseudohyponatremia** [^111duo5q].

- **Confirm hypotonicity**: Serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg [^116Zh6gJ].
- **Exclude pseudohyponatremia**: Normal osmolality suggests pseudohyponatremia [^111duo5q].
- **Assess volume status**: Clinical exam and urine sodium/osmolality distinguish euvolemic from hypo/hypervolemic states [^116Zh6gJ].
- **Identify underlying causes**: SIADH, medications, endocrine disorders, or malignancy [^111duo5q].

---

## General principles of management

- **Treat underlying cause**: Address the precipitating condition (e.g. stop offending drugs, treat malignancy, correct endocrine disorders) [^112n6Umk].
- **Monitor closely**: Frequent sodium checks (every 4–6 hours initially) to avoid rapid correction and osmotic demyelination [^notfound].
- **Avoid rapid correction**: Limit to ≤ 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours; use desmopressin and free water if exceeded [^114zYH9K] [^1117skm3] [^113PyTGH].

---

## Treatment strategies based on symptom severity

### Severe symptomatic hyponatremia (e.g. seizures, coma)

In severe symptomatic hyponatremia, **hypertonic saline (3%)** is given as 100 mL boluses over 10 minutes, repeated up to three times to raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L, then slowed to ≤ 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours [^114hmeK4]. Close monitoring with frequent sodium checks and neurologic assessments is essential, and if overcorrection occurs, administer desmopressin and free water to relower sodium safely [^1117skm3].

---

### Chronic or mildly symptomatic hyponatremia

#### Fluid restriction

Fluid restriction to **800–1,000 mL/day** is first-line and should be adjusted to urine output and sodium response; adherence is often limited by thirst and practicality [^113jQ15H].

---

#### Pharmacological therapies

- **Urea**: 30–60 g/day orally; effective, safe, and inexpensive; monitor for GI upset [^114hmeK4].
- **Vasopressin antagonists (vaptans)**: Tolvaptan (oral) or conivaptan (IV) for refractory cases or when fluid restriction is not feasible; monitor for rapid correction and liver injury with tolvaptan [^1133HjXE] [^111BruNX].
- **Demeclocycline**: 600–1,200 mg/day; second-line due to nephrotoxicity risk [^111bC6Vc].

---

## Special considerations

- **SIADH**: Fluid restriction is first-line; urea or vaptans if refractory [^111Fe3u4].
- **Medication-induced hyponatremia**: Stop offending agents (e.g. thiazides, SSRIs, antiepileptics) [^115WQo6s].
- **Endocrine disorders**: Treat hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency [^111duo5q].

---

## Monitoring and prevention of complications

- **Frequent sodium monitoring**: Every 4–6 hours initially, then daily once stable [^notfound].
- **Neurologic monitoring**: Watch for osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [^1169CfKA].
- **Prevent overcorrection**: Use desmopressin and free water if sodium rises too quickly [^1117skm3].

## Summary of treatment options

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hypertonic saline | Severe symptoms | 100 mL bolus ×3 | Sodium every 2–4 h |
| Fluid restriction | Chronic/mild | 800–1,000 mL/day | Sodium daily |
| Urea | Refractory cases | 30–60 g/day | Sodium daily |
| Tolvaptan | Refractory cases | 7.5–15 mg/day | Sodium every 6–8 h |
| Demeclocycline | Second-line | 600–1,200 mg/day | Renal function |
| Desmopressin | Overcorrection | 1–2 µg IV | Sodium every 2–4 h |

---

Euvolemic hyponatremia management centers on **treating the cause**, restricting fluids, and using targeted therapies (urea, vaptans) for refractory cases, with hypertonic saline reserved for severe symptoms. Close monitoring prevents rapid correction and osmotic demyelination [^1169CfKA].

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^112GCSuE]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (HN), defined as a serum sodium concentration ([Na +]) below the lower limit of normal, is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients, with a prevalence as high as 30–42%. HN is independently associated with mortality in congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, and hospitalized patients in general, and with increased hospital costs and readmission rates. Chronic HN has been linked to impaired gait and balance, increased falls and fracture rates, and osteoporosis. However, a causal role of HN for these associations is largely unproven.

Correction of severe HN of sudden onset can be genuinely lifesaving, and treatment of chronic HN associated with neurological symptoms is undeniably beneficial. Despite the widespread clinical impression that correction of less severe chronic HN is also worthwhile, evidence-based data demonstrating clinical benefit are limited.,

Hypovolemic HN responds readily to volume repletion. Until recently, treatment of hypervolemic HN has been limited to fluid restriction (FR) and correction of the underlying disorder. Treatment modalities for euvolemic HN have included FR, hypertonic saline (HS), loop diuretics, demeclocycline, and urea. With the approval of the vasopressin-receptor antagonists conivaptan and tolvaptan, more targeted treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic HN became available. It remains uncertain how treatment options are employed, and how correction magnitude and incidence of adverse outcomes are affected by the type of therapy. With this background, the multinational HN Registry was initiated to assess the current state of treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic HN in diverse, real-world hospital settings. Its specific purpose was to determine which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently employed, how effective they are, and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in [Na +]. An additional goal was to determine which treatments posed the greatest risk of overly rapid correction and osmotic demyelination.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116fNs9z]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In the "real world", the non-expert doctor who initially recognises and responds to severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 120 mmol/L) in a critically ill patient will often be a junior trainee working "out of routine office hours". In this emergency setting, the doctor may have limited immediate access to important additional diagnostic tests, e.g. serum and urine osmolality and urine electrolytes. Urgent treatment decisions may need to be taken to manage symptoms such as confusion and seizures, with incomplete patient history and diagnostic information. There is a general consensus that hypertonic saline is effective in the immediate management of acute symptomatic hyponatraemia but available guidelines differ on the volumes and rates of saline infusion. Ultimately, it is clinical judgement rather than adherence to a particular guideline that will determine an individual patient's treatment. Intuitive clinical algorithms, with proven efficacy, would help to encourage "best practice" in the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia.

### Therapy for SIAD: what does the future hold? [^113rohyY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia, the most frequent electrolyte abnormality, is defined as serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/l and is associated with significant morbidity and excess mortality, with its commonest cause being SIAD (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis). Except for patients with severe symptoms requiring treatment with hypertonic saline, the vast majority of patients with SIAD experience mild to moderate symptoms and receive fluid restriction as first-line therapy. The last major international guidelines, published in 2014, agreed on the limited evidence base of therapeutic approach, while they led to diverging recommendations with regard to the suggested second-line therapies. A US consensus statement suggests the use of tolvaptan as second-line agentin contrast to the European guidelines which do not recommend its use, suggesting oral urea instead. In the era of evidence-based medicine, there has been surprising sparsity of high-quality data for the treatment of SIAD until 2020, with the exception for placebo-controlled trials of vasopressin receptor antagonists.

Fluid restriction, the mainstay treatment for SIAD in the last decades, had not been prospectively evaluated until recently. Real-world data have recorded its limited efficacy, with a response rate estimated at around 50%. Fluid restriction is also unlikely to achieve significant sodium correction in cases of limited free water excretion, such as when urine osmolality exceeds 500 mOsm/kg or the serum to urine electrolyte ratio is greater than 1. In 2020, the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of fluid restriction for SIAD was published, showing significant, but modest, efficacy, as evidenced by a median sodium rise of 3 mmol/l over a 72-h period, with one third of patients being non-responders. These data highlight the need for additional therapies in a substantial proportion of patients. The choice of second-line therapy has been a subject to great debate with options including tolvaptan, urea, combination of furosemide and sodium chloride, demeclocycline, and, recently, empagliflozin.

### Hyponatremia: current treatment strategies and the role of vasopressin antagonists [^114dCs4r]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyponatremia is a complex electrolyte disorder that results mainly from dysregulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by osmotic and nonosmotic mechanisms. Several populations, including the elderly, are at risk for the development of hyponatremia, and awareness of such risk factors can lead to an overall improvement in patient care. AVP receptor antagonists are promising new therapeutic options whose safety and efficacy have been clinically established for some forms of hyponatremia.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1967-March 2007) was conducted, using the search terms aquaporins, AVP, AVP receptor antagonists, conivaptan, hyponatremia, lixivaptan, and tolvaptan. Additionally, data were obtained from manufacturers' prescribing information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles identified from the reference search and data sources were evaluated. Material was included in this review if it was relevant to the pathophysiology and management of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients.

Data Synthesis

A large percentage of hospitalized patients are found to have symptomatic or asymptomatic hyponatremia. One study reported that 24.5% of intensive care patients admitted over a 3 month period experienced hyponatremia at some time during their hospitalization. Conventional management techniques include water restriction, demeclocycline, lithium, and urea, which have demonstrated variable efficacy and toxicity. AVP receptor antagonists, whose safety and efficacy have been established in clinical trials, are providing new therapeutic options.

Conclusions

AVP receptor antagonists appear to be safe and effective for the treatment of patients with hyponatremia. With conivaptan recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in treating euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients and lixivaptan and tolvaptan in the late stages of development, prudent use of these agents requires a thorough understanding of the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia to optimize therapeutic outcomes.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116syrTq]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), the commonest cause of hyponatraemia, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Tolvaptan, an oral vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, leads through aquaresis to an increase in serum sodium concentration and is the only medication licenced in Europe for the treatment of euvolaemic hyponatraemia. Randomised controlled trials have shown that tolvaptan is highly efficacious in correcting SIAD-related hyponatraemia. Real-world data have confirmed the marked efficacy of tolvaptan, but they have also reported a high risk of overly rapid sodium increase in patients with a very low baseline serum sodium. The lower the baseline serum sodium, the higher the tolvaptan-induced correction rate occurs. Therefore, a lower starting tolvaptan dose of 7.5 mg has been evaluated in small cohort studies, demonstrating its efficacy, but it still remains unclear as to whether it can reduce the risk of overcorrection. Most international guidelines, except for the European ones, recommend tolvaptan as second-line treatment for SIAD after fluid restriction. However, the risk of unduly rapid sodium correction in combination with its high cost have limited its routine use. Prospective controlled studies are warranted to evaluate whether tolvaptan-related sodium increase can improve patient-related clinical outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay in the acute setting or neurocognitive symptoms and quality of life in the chronic setting. In addition, the potential role of a low tolvaptan starting dose needs to be further explored. Until then, tolvaptan should mainly be used as second-line treatment for SIAD, especially when there is a clinical need for prompt restoration of normonatraemia. Tolvaptan should be used with specialist input according to a structured clinical pathway, including rigorous monitoring of electrolyte and fluid balance and, if needed, implementation of appropriate measures to prevent, or when necessary reverse, overly rapid hyponatraemia correction.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^113zdkPK]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — scope and prevention/treatment focus — notes it is beyond the scope of this guideline to provide an in-depth discussion of fluid hydration to prevent EAH and minimize the occurrence of ≥ 2% total body water loss, and states there is no single recommendation (drinking to thirst or preplanned scheduled drinking) that fits all individuals. The intent is to provide evidence to mitigate morbidity and mortality, recommend safe hydration guidance for preventing overhydration during exertional activities, and present evidence for the most effective treatment protocols when overhydration leads to mild to severe EAH.

### Assessment of the efficacy and safety of intravenous conivaptan in euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia [^111BruNX]. American Journal of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Most cases of hyponatremia — serum sodium concentration ([Na+]) < 135 mEq/l (< 135 mM) — are associated with an elevated plasma arginine vasopressin level. This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of intravenous conivaptan (YM087), a vasopressin V1A/V2-receptor antagonist, in treating euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Methods

Eighty-four hospitalized patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum [Na+] 115 to < 130 mEq/l) were randomly assigned to receive intravenous placebo or conivaptan administered as a 30-min, 20-mg loading dose followed by a 96-hour infusion of either 40 or 80 mg/day. The primary efficacy measure was change in serum [Na+], measured by the baseline-adjusted area under the [Na+]-time curve. The secondary measures included time from first dose to a confirmed ≥ 4 mEq/l serum [Na+] increase, total time patients had serum [Na+] ≥ 4 mEq/l higher than baseline, change in serum [Na+] from baseline to the end of treatment, and number of patients with a confirmed ≥ 6 mEq/l increase in serum [Na+] or normal [Na+] (≥ 135 mEq/l).

Results

Both conivaptan doses increased area under the [Na+]-time curve during the 4-day treatment (p < 0.0001 vs. placebo). From baseline to the end of treatment, the least-squares mean ± standard error serum [Na+] increase associated with placebo was 0.8 ± 0.8 mEq/l; with conivaptan 40 mg/day, 6.3 ± 0.7 mEq/l; and with conivaptan 80 mg/day, 9.4 ± 0.8 mEq/l. Conivaptan significantly improved all secondary efficacy measures (p < 0.001 vs. placebo, both doses). Conivaptan was generally well tolerated, although infusion-site reactions led to the withdrawal of 1 (3%) and 4 (15%) of patients given conivaptan 40 and 80 mg/day, respectively.

Conclusion

Among patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia, 4-day intravenous infusion of conivaptan 40 mg/day significantly increased serum [Na+] and was well tolerated.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^115LCotc]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) management principles and heat illness definition — For this guideline, heat illness is defined "as any total body water deficit (> 2% of body weight) that can occur from sweat loss during physical activity in high environmental temperatures". When EAH is confirmed or strongly suspected, "empiric treatment of symptomatic EAH is an acceptable option", and "treatment options should be predicated on the presence (or absence) of neurologic impairment to differentiate mild EAH from severe EAH and guide resuscitative choices". The page notes this algorithmic empiric approach "can be lifesaving and is unlikely (but unconfirmed) to induce harm", and emphasizes that "individuals can rapidly progress from mild to severe EAH", so "initial resuscitation and symptomatic care to minimize morbidity and progression of disease are of paramount importance".

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^1174Gy8M]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### Oral lixivaptan effectively increases serum sodium concentrations in outpatients with euvolemic hyponatremia [^1167qqN4]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical practice. Its incidence increases with age and it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Recently, the vaptans, antagonists of the arginine vasopressin pathway, have shown promise for safe treatment of hyponatremia. Here we evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral lixivaptan, a selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, for treatment of nonhospitalized individuals with euvolemic hyponatremia (sodium less than 135 mmol/l) in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study. About half of the 206 patients were elderly in a chronic care setting. Of these patients, 52 were given a placebo and 154 were given 25–100 mg per day lixivaptan, titrated based on the daily serum sodium measurements. Compared with placebo (0.8 mmol/l), the serum sodium concentration significantly increased by 3.2 mmol/l from baseline to day 7 (primary efficacy endpoint) with lixivaptan treatment. A significantly greater proportion of patients that received lixivaptan achieved normal serum sodium (39.4%) by day 7 relative to placebo (12.2%). Overall, lixivaptan was considered safe and well-tolerated. Thus, oral lixivaptan can be safely initiated in the outpatient setting and effectively increases serum sodium concentrations in outpatients with euvolemic hyponatremia.

Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status. For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects. Severely symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency.

US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4. 5% to 28% of people.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan for euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia [^1133ZyHC]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Tolvaptan is clinically effective in increasing serum sodium concentrations for patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Appropriate treatment of hyponatremia may reduce the risk of death, hospital resource utilization, and economic burden. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan treatment in patients who need to be hospitalized for treatment and monitoring of euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Methods

A decision-analytic model was constructed to assess the clinical and economic impact of tolvaptan compared with placebo during a 1-month treatment period. The probabilities, utility weights, resource utilization, and costs in the model were derived from clinical trials, survey research, and the Korean National Health Insurance database. Cost analysis was performed from the perspective of the South Korean health care setting in 2012 Korean won (KRW). The model outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In addition, subgroup analysis was performed to identify the cost-effectiveness in case of tolvaptan treatment only for patients with marked hyponatremia. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed on key model parameters and assumptions.

Findings

The total cost per patient was KRW 1,826,771 for tolvaptan treatment and KRW 2,281,926 for placebo. The quality-adjusted life-years for treatment with and without tolvaptan were 0.0481 and 0.0446, respectively. The base-case analysis revealed that tolvaptan was a more effective and less expensive strategy compared with placebo. In the subgroup analysis, this trend was more apparent in case of tolvaptan treatment only for patients with marked hyponatremia. The robustness of the results was confirmed by using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

Implications

This cost-effectiveness analysis found that the use of tolvaptan was less expensive and more effective than treatment without tolvaptan in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^112xVMrb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The approach for the management of hyponatremia depends on the patient's volume status. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is typically attributed to an excess of total body water due to conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or heart, liver, and kidney failure. Euvolemic hyponatremia is caused by various conditions including Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), polydipsia, or hypothyroidism as there is a stable total body sodium level alongside an increase in total body water. Various risk factors for SIADH include central nervous system disturbances, lower respiratory tract infections, drugs, and certain malignancies. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is due to a depletion of total body sodium, often caused by gastrointestinal losses, the use of diuretics, and mineralocorticoid insufficiencies. Patients experiencing hypovolemic hyponatremia with shock require fluid resuscitation using 0.9% saline, Ringers, Plasmalyte, or other isotonic solutions to restore hemodynamic stability. Treatment for hypervolemic hyponatremia varies depending on the etiology. For example, heart failure may be treated with diuretics whereas dialysis can be used to treat patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Patients presenting with euvolemic hyponatremia, such as in the instance of SIADH or psychogenic polydipsia must undergo fluid restriction. However, in cases of hypothyroidism, the underlying condition should be addressed for treatment. Iatrogenic hyponatremia is another concern in pediatric patients undergoing treatment with intravenous fluids. The 2018 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommend using isotonic fluids, such as 0.9% saline or Ringer's lactate, to maintain proper sodium levels and prevent the development of iatrogenic hyponatremia.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^116SGPFK]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hyponatremia secondary to SIADH is frequent in cancer patients and potentially deleterious. The aim of this sub-analysis of the Hyponatremia Registry database is to analyze current diagnostic and therapeutic management practices in cancer patients with SIADH.

Methods

We analyzed 358 cancer patients who had serum sodium concentration ([Na +]) ≤ 130 mEq/L and a clinical diagnosis of SIADH from 225 sites in the USA and EU.

Results

Precise diagnostic testing was performed in only 46%. Almost 12% of all patients did not receive any hyponatremia treatment. The most frequent therapies were fluid restriction (20%), isotonic saline (14%), fluid restriction/isotonic saline (7%), tolvaptan (8%), and salt tablets (7%). Hypertonic saline was used in less than 3%. Tolvaptan produced the greatest median rate of [Na +] change (IQR) (3.0 (4.7) mEq/L/day), followed by hypertonic saline (2.0(7.0) mEq/L/day), and fluid restriction/isotonic saline (1.9(3.2) mEq/L/day). Both fluid restriction and isotonic saline monotherapies were significantly less effective (0.8(2.0) mEq/L/day and 1.3(3.0) mEq/L/day, respectively) and were associated with clinically relevant rates of treatment failure. Only 46% of patients were discharged with [Na +] ≥ 130 mEq/L. Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia occurred in 11.7%.

Conclusions

Although essential for successful hyponatremia management, appropriate diagnostic testing is not routinely performed in current practice. The most frequently employed monotherapies were often ineffective and sometimes even aggravated hyponatremia. Tolvaptan was used less often but showed significantly greater effectiveness. Despite clear evidence that hyponatremia is associated with poor outcome in oncology patients, most patients were discharged still hyponatremic. Further studies are needed to assess the beneficial impact of hyponatremia correction with effective therapies.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^117EnX8q]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

While almost all cancer patients with severe hyponatremia (99.1%) received active hyponatremia treatment, only 91 and 79% of patients with moderate or mild hyponatremia, respectively, were treated. The five most common active therapies in the cancer-related SIADH group were fluid restriction (FR, 20.1%), isotonic saline (NS, 13.5%), tolvaptan (7.9%), salt tablets (ST, 6.5%), and FR + NS (6.5%). Sixty percent of all treatment episodes and 74% of all initial episodes consisted of a monotherapy. Hypertonic saline (HS) was used in only 2.2% overall and in 2.7% of cancer patients with severe hyponatremia. Demeclocycline was prescribed in 2.3%, 0.3% (2) were prescribed conivaptan, and 0.5% (4) patients received urea, 3 of which received it in combination with another therapy. Stopping a medication that may induce SIADH could also be considered an active treatment; of the patients who received no other active hyponatremia therapy, 44% were receiving a potentially hyponatremia-inducing medication (opiates 77%, antidepressants 16%, antiepileptics 2%), which was discontinued in 21%. Tolvaptan was chosen relatively more often in lung cancer (7.9%) and in particular SCLC patients (10.3%) than in the non-cancer group (6.2%) while FR was used less often in cancer patients than in non-cancer patients (Fig. 1).

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

Approaches to treatment for hyponatremia

Table 3 shows the recommendations for the medical management of hyponatremia. Guidance documents distinguished treatment scenarios based on whether patients had severe symptoms or whether the hyponatremia was acute (48 h) or chronic. All but one discussed treatment in the setting of severe symptoms and recommended infusion of hypertonic saline, usually specified as having a concentration of 3%. One suggested using a formula to guide the infusion speed of a continuous infusion, five others recommended giving a fixed dose, or a dose adjusted to body weight with repeated serum sodium concentration measurements to check progression.

Table 3
Summary of recommendations for approaches to treatments for hyponatremia by included guidance documents

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Patients without symptoms of hyponatremia were assumed to have chronic onset hyponatremia, and treatment suggestions were mostly dependent on the classification hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Only three guidance documents specifically advised treating the underlying condition. Seven suggested 0.9% saline in hypovolemia, with infusion speeds calculated with Adrogué-Madias, until restoration of blood pressure or until nasogastric rehydration could start.

For euvolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, the majority recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Five guidance documents proposed a number of other interventions as second-line treatments including loop diuretics, demeclocycline, urea, vasopressin receptor antagonists, or lithium. One guideline specifically recommended against vasopressin receptor antagonists in case of a serum sodium concentration < 125 mmol/L.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study plan

The study design has been described previously in detail. Briefly, patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic HN were enrolled from 146 US sites and patients with euvolemic HN were enrolled from 79 EU sites. We excluded patients with hypovolemic HN because this disorder should respond readily and completely to treatment of volume deficits, and it therefore poses no therapeutic dilemma. We excluded patient with hypervolemic HN from the EU study centers because tolvaptan is only approved in the EU for euvolemic patients. Inclusion of hypervolemic patients treated with tolvaptan would have created a regulatory burden for the sponsor. At each site, approval was sought from the appropriate research ethics review boards as required. After informed consent, absent a waiver, investigators prospectively recorded patient data. To ascertain patients, some centers systematically reviewed hospital laboratory-generated lists of patients with HN. Others enrolled only patients referred to or managed by the investigator personally. The study was exclusively observational; no standardized diagnostic or treatment protocols were imposed. Investigators simply recorded the choices made by the physicians responsible for the patient's hospital care.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

To assure that HN was clinically significant, the study required an entry [Na +] ≤ 130 mEq/l. Patients were excluded if < 18 years old, hypovolemic, hypervolemic (EU only), using an investigational agent or device, or if hyperglycemic enough to interfere with assessment of [Na +] or receiving renal replacement therapy while hyponatremic. As indicated in Supplementary Table S3 online, euvolemia was defined as the absence of clinical and historical evidence of extracellular fluid volume depletion or sequestration, and the absence of edema and ascites, or on the basis of the treating physician's diagnosis of SIADH. Hypervolemia was defined as excess extracellular fluid volume manifesting as dependent edema or ascites. Although not a specified exclusion criterion originally, we subsequently decided to exclude any patient who was receiving a thiazide at the time the treating physician made a diagnosis of SIADH. It would be difficult to assure that such patients were not in fact hypovolemic, and diuretic use is generally considered to be an exclusion to the proper diagnosis of SIADH. This decision was made prior to data analysis. A complete listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria, as published previously, is provided as Supplementary Table S3 online.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Hyponatraemia-treatment standard 2024 [^111Fe3u4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospital patients associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital stay and financial burden. The speed of a correction with 3% sodium chloride as a 100- to 150-ml intravenous bolus or continuous infusion depends on the severity and persistence of the symptoms and needs frequent biochemical monitoring. The rapid intermittent administration of hypertonic saline is preferred for treatment of symptomatic hyponatraemia. In asymptomatic mild hyponatraemia, an adequate solute intake with an initial fluid restriction (FR) of 500 ml/day adjusted according to the serum sodium (sNa) levels is preferred. Almost half of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) patients do not respond to FR as first-line therapy. At present, urea and tolvaptan are considered the most effective second-line therapies in SIADH. However, the evidence for guidance on the choice of second-line therapy of hypotonic hyponatraemia is lacking. Oral urea is considered to be a very effective and safe treatment. Mild and asymptomatic hyponatraemia is treated with adequate solute intake (salt and protein) and initial FR with adjustments based on sNa levels. Specific treatment with vaptans may be considered in either euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients with high ADH activity. In order to ensure optimal patient outcome, close monitoring and readiness for administration of either hypotonic fluids or desmopressin may be crucial in the decision-making process for specific treatment and eventual overcorrection consequences. According to the guidelines, gradual correction and clinical evaluation is preferable over rapid normalization of sNa towards the laboratory reference ranges.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia, report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^115zTKGG]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a frequent and potentially life-threatening adverse side effect of thiazide diuretics. This sub-analysis of the Hyponatremia Registry database focuses on current management practices of thiazide-associated hyponatremia (TAH) and compares differences between TAH and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

Methods

We analyzed 477 patients from 225 US and EU sites with euvolemic hyponatremia ([Na+] ≤ 130 mEq/L) who were receiving a thiazide diuretic. Of these, 118 met criteria for true thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH).

Results

Thiazide was withdrawn immediately after hyponatremia was diagnosed only in 57% of TAH; in these patients, the median rate of [Na+] change (Δdaily[Na+]) was significantly higher than those with continued thiazide treatment (3.8 [interquartile range: 4.0] vs. 1.7 [3.8] mEq/L/day). The most frequently employed therapies were isotonic saline (29.6%), fluid restriction (19.9%), the combination of these two (8.2%), and hypertonic saline (5.2%). Hypertonic saline produced the greatest Δdaily[Na+] (8.0[6.4] mEq/L/day) followed by a combination of fluid restriction and normal saline (4.5 [3.8] mEq/L/day) and normal saline alone (3.6 [3.5] mEq/L/day). Fluid restriction was markedly less effective (2.7 [2.7] mEq/L/day). Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia occurred in 3.1% overall, but in up to 21.4% given hypertonic saline. Although there are highly significant differences in the biochemical profiles between TIH and SIADH, no predictive diagnostic test could be derived.

Conclusions

Despite its high incidence and potential risks, the management of TAH is often poor. Immediate withdrawal of the thiazide is crucial for treatment success. Hypertonic saline is most effective in correcting hyponatremia but associated with a high rate of overly rapid correction. We could not establish a diagnostic laboratory-based test to differentiate TIH from SIADH.

### Current management of hyponatremia in acute heart failure: a report from the hyponatremia registry for patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia (HN registry) [^117NNtPS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Data collected on hospital admission included date of hospitalization, admitting diagnosis, demographics (age, sex, and race), details on HF condition (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] and New York Heart Association classification), and history of HN (including number of hospitalizations in the past year and acuity of onset of HN, when available). Additional data points collected are described in the methods paper. 20 Creatinine clearance was used as a measure of renal function in order to standardize data collection across international sites. "No specific treatment" was used to describe patients who received no specific therapy for HN.

Patients were excluded from analysis if [Na +] was ≤ 130 mEq/L for a duration < 24 hours to avoid individuals with spurious laboratory values, and if the diagnosis of HF was accompanied by a diagnosis of euvolemia. The prespecified definitions of correction (ie, "clinically meaningful") included: achievement of [Na +] ≥ 130 or ≥ 135 mEq/L, or an increase ≥ 5 mEq/L. Therapy periods were defined as the time interval during which a patient received only the single therapy (monotherapy) or specified combination. Initial therapy refers to the first treatment given specifically for HN.

For purposes of categorizing initial [Na +] within the context of the HN Registry, HN was analyzed according to 3 ranges of [Na +]: > 125–130, between 120 and 125, and < 120 mEq/L. Overly rapid correction of [Na +] was defined as an increase > 12 mEq/L in any 24‐hour interval or > 18 mEq/L in any 48‐hour interval consistent with current guidelines. 22 For each HN treatment received by patients, LOS was calculated from the day HN was first treated to better understand the impact of treatment for HN, and was not calculated for patients receiving no specific therapy for HN. Data analyses included comparisons for age, race, HF with preserved LVEF (HFpEF) versus reduced LVEF (HFrEF; defined as LVEF ≤ 45%), rate of [Na +] change, and HN on admission versus HN developed in the hospital. Creatinine clearance comparisons were made at the start and end of an episode, and at both admission and discharge as long as values were available for weights and creatinine values at both time points. The database recorded an age of 90 years for all patients > 89. No data were collected postdischarge.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1141Futk]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, adequate response to initial management, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to maintain IV access open by infusing the smallest feasible volume of 0.9% saline until cause-specific treatment is started.

### Current management of hyponatremia in acute heart failure: a report from the hyponatremia registry for patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia (HN registry) [^115Srzk5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In addressing fluid intake for patients with advanced HF, the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines state that "Fluid restriction (1.5–2 L/d) is reasonable in stage D, especially in patients with HN, to reduce congestive symptoms (Class IIa, Level of Evidence: C)". 23 The low level of evidence underscores the lack of studies available to inform this recommendation. Data from the present study call into question these recommendations for fluid restriction as initial therapy for HN, given that the efficacy of this approach was poor, with most of these patients not reaching any measure of clinically meaningful response in [Na +].

Isotonic saline, hypertonic saline, and tolvaptan were the other monotherapies used initially to treat HN, although only 11% of patients in the HN Registry received any of these treatments. Each of these therapies resulted in a more‐rapid rate of change in [Na +] than either fluid restriction or no specific treatment. In addition, [Na +] increased by ≥ 5 mEq/L in a majority of patients treated with any of these 3 therapies compared with only a minority treated with fluid restriction or no specific treatment. This held true even though the duration of therapy was shorter with each of the active treatments. Of note, a recent report suggested that concomitant administration of intravenous fluids and intravenous diuretics during the first 2 days of hospitalization in patients with acute decompensated HF is associated with worse outcomes, such as higher rates of subsequent critical care admission, intubation, renal replacement therapy, and hospital death compared with those who received only diuretics. 24 The EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study with Tolvaptan) study showed that tolvaptan led to rapid and safe correction of HN in the subset of patients with HN and acute HF, though the impact on outcomes could not be definitively determined in a post‐hoc analysis of a small cohort. 25 Because of these uncertainties and cautionary notes, greater consensus is needed regarding best practices in the management of patients with HF, HN, and volume overload.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^114Kd17F]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains.

The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in the intensive care unit by urea [^111RLE29]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the intensive care unit, hyponatremia occurs frequently and is associated with an increased mortality. It is mostly related to the presence of inappropriate antidiuresis due to an excess of ADH. Management of this condition usually implies water restriction. This is of poor applicability in patients requiring multiple intravenous medications and/or nutritional support. Recently a new class of drugs antagonizing the V2 receptor (V2RA) has been developed: the vaptans.

Two of them are already available on the market: Conivaptan for the intravenous route and Tolvaptan for the oral route. The present data recall that urea is an effective and easy therapeutic choice to correct hyponatremia related to SIADH with special attention for patients in the intensive care unit. The main criticism to the use of urea orally is its taste; this is not a problem in the intensive care unit as it is usually administered by gastric tube or intravenously. No prospective data comparing V2 antagonists to urea are available. We present a large retrospective series of patients with moderate or severe hyponatremia treated with urea and shows that its use is a easy, save and inexpensive treatment.

### Cerebral correlates of hyponatremia [^112MJJXr]. Neurocritical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium concentration ([Na+]) less than 135 mEq/L, is commonly caused by elevated levels of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), which causes water retention. The principal organ affected by disease-related morbidity is the brain. The neurologic complications associated with hyponatremia are attributable to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, caused by the osmotically driven movement of water from the extracellular compartment into brain cells. Although neurologic symptoms induced by hyponatremia are limited by an adaptive brain mechanism known as "regulatory volume decrease", an overly rapid correction of serum [Na+] before the reversal of this adaptive response can also produce neurologic damage. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hyponatremia related to central nervous system disorders, neurosurgery, or the use of psychoactive drugs. Fluid restriction is the standard of care for patients with SIADH who are asymptomatic or who have only mild symptoms, but patients with severe or symptomatic hyponatremia require more aggressive therapy. Infusion of hypertonic saline is the usual approach to the treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia, but patients require frequent monitoring. Pharmacologic agents such as demeclocycline and lithium may be effective in some patients but are associated with undesirable adverse events. The AVPreceptor antagonists are a new therapeutic class for the treatment of hyponatremia. The first agent in this class approved for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients is conivaptan. Two other agents, tolvaptan and lixivaptan, are being evaluated in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The AVP-receptor antagonists block the effects of elevated AVP and promote aquaresis, the electrolyte-sparing excretion of water, resulting in the correction of serum [Na+]. These agents may also have intrinsic neuroprotective effects.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^113ex8gX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Current guidelines on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia often fail to meet methodological criteria for development and reporting as described by AGREE II. Despite many similarities, recommendations are sometimes inconsistent, but to what extent this is attributable to the underlying development process remains unclear.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^1135qAvS]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Current management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for eu- or hypervolemic HN. To better understand current practices, we analyzed data from 3087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130 mEq/l or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union. Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent. Median (interquartile range) mEq/l serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0); fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0); isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0); hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0); and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0). Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5 mEq/l or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan. At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135 mEq/l in 78% of patients and 130 mEq/l or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9%. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from hospital still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^117RWnJQ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Treatment of hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia associated with heart failure, cirrhosis, or the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone with tolvaptan: a clinical review [^113rJ7Gr]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Tolvaptan is an oral nonpeptide selective vasopressin V(2)-receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of clinically relevant hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia associated with heart failure, cirrhosis, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.

Objective

The objective of this article was to review the pharmacology, efficacy, and tolerability of tolvaptan in the treatment of hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia, heart failure, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

Methods

Articles were identified using MEDLINE (1966-February 28, 2010) and EMBASE (1947-February 28, 2010). Abstracts and proceedings from the annual meetings (2007–2009) of the American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology, and the American Society of Nephrology were searched to identify additional relevant publications. Searches were conducted using the terms tolvaptan, vasopressin antagonist, heart failure, polycystic kidney disease, hyponatremia, drug interaction, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology. The reference lists of the identified publications were reviewed for additional references. All clinical trials that assessed the use of tolvaptan in the management of hypervolemic/euvolemic hyponatremia or heart failure in humans were included, regardless of study design.

Results

A total of 9 trials were identified. For the treatment of hyponatremia, tolvaptan was associated with significantly increased serum sodium concentrations compared with placebo on treatment days 4 (3.62 [2.68] vs 0.25 [2.08] mmol/L, respectively; P < 0.001) and 30 (6.22 [4.10] vs 1.66 [3.59] mmol/L; P < 0.001). In the clinical trials in patients with heart failure, tolvaptan at doses of 30, 60, and 90 mg/d was associated with mean weight changes of -1.80, -2.10, and -2.05 kg, respectively, versus -0.60 kg with placebo (P = 0.002, P = 0.002, and P = 0.009). Trials of tolvaptan in humans with ADPKD are ongoing. Overall, mortality rates were not significantly altered with tolvaptan compared with placebo (25.9% vs 26.3%). The most commonly reported adverse events associated with tolvaptan in clinical trials were dry mouth (4.2%-23.0%), thirst (7.7%-40.3%), and polyuria (0.6%-31.7%), all consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug.

Conclusion

Based on findings from clinical trials to date, tolvaptan is effective for the correction of hyponatremia but has not been associated with significant improvements in mortality in patients with heart failure compared with placebo, and its utility in the treatment of ADPKD in humans remains to be determined.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^116jKxH9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The price of high effectiveness is an increased rate of overcorrection with the highly active therapies, tolvaptan (14%) and HS (16%). Although there were no cases of osmotic demyelination reported in the registry, this clearly indicates that these therapies must be used with caution. In most cases of overcorrection that occurred with tolvaptan, other therapies had been employed concomitantly. Although it is contraindicated to combine either tolvaptan or HS with other therapies, results from the present study indicate that combination therapies containing these compounds are chosen frequently by clinicians.

Two vaptans, tolvaptan and conivaptan, have received approval for treatment of SIADH. In this Registry, only two SIADH patients were treated with conivaptan. Due to differences in route of administration and dosing schedule, we did not pool the data for these two compounds. However, it appears likely that the effectiveness of both vaptans is similar. No safety issues were reported with the use of vaptans in this registry.

### Recognition and treatment of hyponatremia in acutely ill hospitalized patients [^116nDHcR]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this paper was to discuss the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of hyponatremia among critically ill, hospitalized patients (eg, after surgery or in the intensive care unit).

Methods

English-language literature published between 1967 and 2006 was searched using several key words (AVP receptor antagonists, hyponatremia, SIADH, conivaptan, tolvaptan, and lixivaptan) and by accessing MEDLINE and ScienceDirect. Meeting abstracts from scientific sessions (American Society of Nephrology Renal Week 2004 and the Endocrine Society's 87th Annual Meeting [2005]) were reviewed. The package insert for conivaptan hydrochloride injection was referenced from. Clinical trials included in this review were randomized and placebo controlled.

Results

Based on the literature we researched, hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in critical care and is associated with a variety of conditions, including congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Because hyponatremia can arise in hypervolemic, euvolemic, and hypovolemic states, clinicians may not recognize its presence and cause. Incorrect management can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians need to recognize risk factors and symptoms and use appropriate treatment guidelines for hyponatremia. Traditionally, therapy for hyponatremia has been limited by efficacy and safety concerns. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonists, therapeutic agents that promote aquaresis in patients with hyponatremia by targeting V(1a) receptors in the vascular smooth muscle, V(2) receptors in the kidney, or both, are under development. A dual-receptor antagonist targeting both V(1a) and V(2) receptors is now approved for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients.

Conclusions

Hyponatremia, an electrolyte abnormality found in critically ill patients, can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. AVP receptor antagonists show promise as effective and tolerable treatments for patients with hyponatremia.

### Role of vaptans in the management of hyponatremia [^115ctTFR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most commonly encountered electrolyte abnormality, affects as many as 30% of hospitalized patients. It is a powerful predictor of poor outcomes, especially in patients with congestive heart failure or cirrhosis. The failure to excrete electrolyte-free water that results from persistent secretion of antidiuretic hormone despite low serum osmolality usually underlies the development of hyponatremia. Treatment depends on several factors, including the cause, overall volume status of the patient, severity of hyponatremic symptoms, and duration of hyponatremia at presentation. This review focuses on the role of the vasopressin receptor antagonists, or vaptans, in the treatment of hyponatremia. These recently introduced agents have the unique ability to induce an aquaresis, the excretion of electrolyte-free water without accompanying solutes. After a brief historical perspective and discussion of pharmacologic characteristics of vaptans, we review the accumulated experience with vaptans for the treatment of hyponatremia. Vaptans have been shown to increase serum sodium concentrations in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia in a reproducible manner, but their safe use requires full understanding of their indications and contraindications.

Approaches to diagnostic strategies for hyponatremia

Seven guidance documents covered diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hyponatremia. Table 2 shows the key recommendations. The key areas addressed included the threshold for initiating diagnostic workup, confirmation and classification of hypotonic hyponatremia, and identification of the underlying disorder.

Table 2
Summary of recommendations for approaches to diagnosis of hyponatremia by included guidance documents

[Na], Serum sodium concentration; +, always; +/–, If clinically indicated/sometimes useful.

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Guidance documents differed somewhat in their recommended threshold for starting diagnostic assessment. Six recommended starting diagnostic assessment when the serum sodium concentration dropped below 135 mmol/L and to confirm hypotonicity through a measured serum or plasma osmolality < 275 to 285 mOsm/kg. Two others set lower thresholds of serum sodium concentration at < 131 mmol/L and < 130 mmol/L. Six guidance documents advised classifying hypotonic hyponatremia into categories of hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia to aid differential diagnosis and guide treatment. Most guidance documents recommended a clinical assessment of hydration status and a urinary sodium concentration as well as a urinary osmolality measurement, although specific criteria, thresholds, and algorithms differed.

Most guidance documents proposed additional laboratory tests that could be of value to identify the underlying disorder, but they varied substantially regarding which tests to use in what situation and which reference values to use. Only two explicitly recommended taking a history of drug intake and symptoms as part of the assessment. Four presented an algorithm to guide differential diagnosis.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^113bNPST]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

If the decision was made to treat hyponatremia (which was not the case in 11.5%), the most frequently chosen therapies were FR and NS, even in severe cases. Both therapies led to only a modest [Na +] rise. However, although considered ineffective and thus not recommended for the treatment of SIADH, NS (1.3 (3.0) mEq/L/day) was significantly more effective than FR (0.8 (2.0) mEq/L/day), the recommended first-line SIADH therapy. Of note, the combination of both therapies worked considerably better than either component alone with a median [Na +] rise of 1.9 (3.2) mEq/L/day. Tolvaptan increased [Na +] more rapidly (3.0 (4.7) mEq/L/day) than any other therapy (P < 0.05). Two other popular treatment options, salt tablets and demeclocycline, were virtually non-effective or even deleterious. Surprisingly, HS, the classic treatment of severe hyponatremia, was administered in less than 5% of initial treatments of such cases. However, in that latter group, HS outperformed all other therapies (median [Na +] rise of 8.0 (6.4) mEq/L/day). Success rates for reaching one of the three effectiveness benchmarks were at least 1.9-fold higher with tolvaptan than with any other therapy (P < 0.02). Consistently, the rate for reaching the combined benchmark ineffectiveness or aggravation was more than 50% lower with tolvaptan than with any other treatment. Of note, the recommended first-line therapy, FR, led to a relevant [Na +] decrease in 12%. Unacceptably high rates of hyponatremia aggravation were also observed with NS (8%), ST (14%), and demeclocycline (30%). In line with current clinical practice, in which HS is used only as initial treatment but replaced by other therapies once a reasonable [Na +] increment has been achieved, the rate of reaching a [Na +] of above 130 or even 135 mEq/L was low.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^114jmrgW]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^114EsrDx]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^113jQ15H]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic asymptomatic hyponatraemia

Apart from hypovolemic hyponatraemia, which can be treated with isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solution, the treatment of chronic hyponatraemia relies on reducing free water intake and increasing renal free water excretion (Figure 2). Fluid restriction (< 1 l/d) remains the cornerstone therapy for chronic hyponatraemia. The urine to serum electrolyte ratio [(UNa + + UK +) / serum Na +] indicates if the patient is in an antidiuretic or aquaretic phase and can also help estimate the degree of fluid restriction required to increase serum Na + concentration. In case of a ratio > 1, a stricter fluid restriction is recommended (< 500 ml/d), which is difficult to adhere to, and pharmacologic therapy is often required to increase renal free water excretion. Current guidelines unanimously recommend increasing solute intake with 0.25–0.50 g/kg per day of urea or a combination of low-dose loop diuretics and oral sodium chloride in moderate or profound chronic hyponatraemia owing to SIADH (Figure 2). Although there is controversial evidence regarding the efficacy in improving clinical outcomes and safety of vaptans, lithium and demeclocycline, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been recently proposed as a potential treatment option for hospitalized patients with SIADH-induced hyponatraemia.

Vaptans are competitive antagonists of vasopressin receptors without detectable agonist activity. Until now, two of them (intravenous conivaptan and oral tolvaptan) have been approved for the treatment of clinically significant euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that they have been related to overcorrection of hyponatraemia, and they are contra-indicated in severe symptomatic hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 120 mmol/l), in hypovolemic hyponatraemia or in patients with impaired thirst mechanisms, which is common in patients with stroke. Moreover, considering the fact that statin therapy is commonly used in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, physicians should keep in mind that vaptans inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and such a co-administration is contra-indicated.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^117CHGVN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Loop Diuretics

Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, increase urinary salt and water excretion via inhibition of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter in the Henle loop to reduce reabsorption of these solutes. They are listed in the European guidelines as a second-line therapy for SIAD in combination with salt tablets (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), but are not endorsed in the international expert panel recommendations. The guideline recommendation was made on the strength of several case series, though only 1 of these included patients with SIAD rather than patients with heart failure and cirrhosis, and that report from 1973 included only 5 patients.

Loop diuretics are useful in the treatment of hypervolemia; however, in the absence of volume excess, natriuresis may cause volume depletion, which stimulates AVP release, thereby worsening hyponatremia. The randomized trial discussed earlier that evaluated FR with and without furosemide and salt tablets to prevent hypovolemia in SIAD found no significant benefit to the addition of frusemide 20 to 40 mg daily compared with FR alone, but in fact observed increased rates of acute kidney injury and hypokalemia. Furosemide increases urinary potassium excretion, which can be potentiated by increased sodium in the distal nephron. Because of this recent evidence, we do not recommend loop diuretics for euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Critical care management of patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: recommendations from the Neurocritical Care Society's multidisciplinary consensus conference [^112JHuzX]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Medium credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — hyponatremia epidemiology, mechanisms, and therapies: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte imbalance in patients with aneurysmal SAH, occurring in 30–50% of cases. More recent work emphasizes that the diagnosis of CSW requires hypovolemia, whereas SIADH usually results in euvolemia or modest hypervolemia, and it appears that in SAH both entities may coexist in the same patient. Older studies reported an association between hyponatremia and higher risk of cerebral infarctions, especially with fluid restriction, but subsequent studies during aggressive fluid administration found no conclusive evidence that hyponatremia influences prognosis. Controlled studies of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone to prevent hyponatremia found both consistently effective when started early, but use was associated with increased hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and significantly increased infection. Data suggest that 3% saline may be safe but are too scant to assess its value. Vasopressin-receptor antagonists, such as conivaptan, are effective in euvolemic or hypervolemic conditions and in hyponatremic SAH patients, but they can produce a significant rise in urine output raising concern about intravascular volume contraction, especially in the setting of DCI.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^111BrHrr]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The applicability of guidelines remains a major issue. The target audience are the clinicians who may infrequently encounter an ill patient with either acute symptomatic hyponatraemia requiring urgent correction or a patient with profound chronic hyponatraemia and additional risk factors (malnourished, hypokalaemia, history of alcoholism) for the osmotic demyelination syndrome. It is improbable that clinicians would always be able to quickly access or indeed assimilate the comprehensive advice in scholarly recent publications on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia. For instance, Spasovski et al. (European Guideline Development Group) produced a 39 page clinical practice guideline and Verbalis et al. (Expert Panel Recommendations) published an extensive narrative review running to 42 pages. These guidelines are freely available but have several important differences, particularly in relation to the drug treatment of chronic hyponatraemia, which may lead to some confusion for clinicians. If appropriate, fluid restriction is used in the management of chronic hyponatraemia but this is frequently of limited efficacy. Additional pharmacological agents have been used, including demeclocycline, lithium, urea, loop diuretics, and vaptan drugs (conivaptan and tolvaptan). Tolvaptan has been used more extensively in the USA for the treatment of hypervolaemic and euvolaemic hyponatraemia compared to Europe, where tolvaptan's licence is restricted to hyponatraemia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone. The European clinical practice guideline has been widely endorsed by European specialist societies for nephrologists, endocrinologists, and intensive care medicine clinicians.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice, but current management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the current state of management of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings, specifically which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

Methods

The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

Results

The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for all active therapies than no active treatment. Hypertonic saline and tolvaptan produced the greatest mean rate of [Na(+)] change (interquartile range, both 3.0 [6.0] mEq/L/d) compared with lower interquartile range rates of [Na(+)] change for isotonic saline (1.5 [3.0] mEq/L/d) and fluid restriction (1.0 [2.3] mEq/L/d). The general pattern of responses was similar in both the US and EU cohorts. At discharge, [Na(+)] was < 135 mEq/L in 75% of patients and ≤ 130 mEq/L in 43% of patients. Overly rapid correction occurred in 10.2% of patients.

Conclusions

Current treatment of hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion often uses therapies with limited efficacy; the most commonly chosen monotherapy treatments, fluid restriction and isotonic saline, failed to increase the serum [Na(+)] by ≥ 5 mEq/L in 55% and 64% of monotherapy treatment episodes, respectively. Appropriate laboratory tests to diagnose syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were obtained in < 50% of patients; success rates in correcting hyponatremia were significantly higher when such tests were obtained. Few outcome differences were found between the United States and the European Union. A notable exception was hospital length of stay; use of tolvaptan was associated with significantly shorter length of stay in the European Union but not in the United States. Despite the availability of effective therapies, most patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were discharged from the hospital still hyponatremic.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115TyEPt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Current role of tolvaptan in the management of SIAD

With the exception of the European guidelines, all other published recommendations and consensus statements,– recommend tolvaptan as a second-line treatment option for SIAD in patients who do not respond to fluid restriction. Tolvaptan may also be used as a first-line agent in SIAD patients who are unlikely to respond to fluid restriction due to very limited renal excretion of solute-free water. Current data do not support the use of tolvaptan in patients with severe symptoms of hyponatraemia. Mechanistically, tolvaptan offers an elegant and attractive treatment option for euvolaemic hyponatraemia since it specifically reverses its pathophysiologic derangement. However, for now, clinicians must rely on good judgement rather than unequivocal evidence to decide which patients with hyponatraemia should be given tolvaptan. The reason for this is that the landmark SALTand SALTWATERstudies have provided high-quality evidence that tolvaptan is effective in correcting hyponatraemia, but they were not designed or powered enough to assess improvement in symptoms or survival, raising the key unanswered question whether treatment of hyponatraemia can improve hard endpoints. Since the key question whether tolvaptan can improve patient-related clinical outcomes has not been answered as yet, tolvaptan cannot comprise the mainstay of therapy for SIAD. There is also considerable uncertainty as to which symptoms and what degree of severity of hyponatraemia should be considered indications for tolvaptan treatment. The current place of tolvaptan in the therapeutic armamentarium for treating SIAD is indeed heavily influenced by 'expert opinions'. In total, despite its well-known efficacy in hyponatraemia correction, the risk of overly rapid sodium correction in combination with the high cost of tolvaptan have prohibited its widespread use. Thus, in most European countries, tolvaptan is sparingly used in highly selected cases and for a limited duration. The extent to which tolvaptan might replace fluid restriction as first-line therapy will be predicated upon additional data about the cost-benefit ratio of these therapies.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^113SHKnQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline, and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^116DDwPZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia is frequently observed in cancer patients and can be explained by malignant disease itself, concomitant comorbidities, physical stress (e.g. pain), or medication. In hospitalized cancer patients, hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality and length of hospital stay, and higher costs. It is widely accepted that the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) due to ectopic release of vasopressin accounts for the majority of cases. However, drugs including chemotherapies as well as targeted therapies, hypo- or hypervolemia, as well as other less frequent disorders such as adrenal insufficiency, myxedema, etc. must be ruled out as possible alternative causes. Diagnostic work-up is often viewed as complex, and treatment is considered cumbersome and potentially dangerous. However, despite the urgent need for better education on how to approach the hyponatremic patient, no evidence-based guideline for hyponatremia management specific to cancer patients is available. Current management strategies are not well characterized.

The multinational Hyponatremia Registry (NCT01240668) assessed the current state of treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in real-world hospital settings. This report focuses on the subgroup of patients with cancer and SIADH with the aim to determine which diagnostic and treatment modalities are employed, how effective they are, and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum [Na +].

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Clinical review: the use of vaptans in clinical endocrinology [^113w7XmM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice and represents a clinical, social, and economic burden. Conventional treatments of hyponatremia present some pitfalls, such as suboptimal efficacy, risk of overly rapid correction, and adverse effects. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, known as vaptans, represent a new and interesting class of drugs for the treatment of the euvolemic and hypervolemic forms of hyponatremia.

Evidence Acquisition

This review is based on a PubMed search with the following terms: "vaptans", "vasopressin receptor antagonists", "tolvaptan", "conivaptan", "vasopressin receptor antagonists and SIADH", "vasopressin receptor antagonists and congestive heart failure", "vasopressin receptor antagonists and cirrhosis", and "vasopressin receptor antagonists and polycystic kidney disease".

Evidence Synthesis

Overall, the studies reported in this review indicate that vaptans effectively correct hyponatremia in euvolemic and hypervolemic patients. In the latter group, vaptans generally had favorable effects on fluid balance also. To date two vaptans, ie, conivaptan and tolvaptan, have been marketed in the United States for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, whereas tolvaptan has been marketed in Europe with the limitation of euvolemic hyponatremia. Although these drugs have a good safety profile, caution should be used, and treatment should be initiated in a hospital setting in order to closely monitor patients and avoid overly rapid correction or overcorrection.

Conclusions

Vaptans can be considered a new effective tool for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Nevertheless, more comparative research of vaptans vs other therapies on clinical grounds is needed to more accurately assess the value of these drugs in the treatment of hyponatremia.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^113ho7wX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

### A rapid and efficient way to manage hyponatremia in patients with SIADH and small cell lung cancer: treatment with tolvaptan [^115pZw32]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death for cancer-related mortality worldwide. In 2007 1.3 million people were diagnosed with lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is found in up to 15–20% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer cases. The highly malignant SCLC tumor consists of primitive cells derived from the neuroendocrine lung and is associated with paracrine and paraneoplastic syndromes. Smoking, sex, initial tumor burden and LDH levels have been found to play a role in the outcome and prognosis of the patients. As recently demonstrated, persistent hyponatremia also appears to be a negative prognostic marker for overall survival in SCLC patients.

Hyponatremia is common in patients with lung cancer. Clinical symptoms such as dizziness, tremor, agitation and other neuropsychiatric symptoms have to be taken into consideration for the diagnosis of clinically relevant hyponatremia. Mild symptoms such as fatigue occur in mild (plasma sodium = 130–134 mmol/l) and in moderate hyponatremia (plasma sodium = 125–129 mmol/l). Clinical symptoms can aggravate in hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 125 mmol/l). The SIADH is a common finding in SCLC patients with euvolemic hyponatremia.

SIADH as a hallmark of SCLC can be found in 10–15% of all SCLC patients, but only in 2–4% of all non-small cell lung (NSLC) cancer patients, as recent retrospective series demonstrated. In SCLC patients SIADH is diagnosed predominantly in advanced stages and may induce a significant reduction in plasma sodium levels. Retrospective data point out that hyponatremia and the lack of correction of sodium can lead to a poor outcome in SCLC patients. Furthermore, these data suggest that the correction of hyponatremia may affect the prognosis of the patients. Correction and stabilisation of the sodium levels are required to initiate chemotherapy treatment and finally for the successful treatment of the underlying disease.

At the time of diagnosis SCLC patients in advanced stages of disease are often in a very limited performance status. In addition, comorbidities such as hyponatraemia or cardiovascular disease may delay the initiation of systemic chemotherapy and increase early mortality. Historical cohorts have shown that up to 40% of patients will not receive an effective primary chemotherapy due to a low Karnofsky-Index. New, supportive therapeutic options such as the rapid stabilization of the sodium metabolism could be helpful in this context.

### Vaptans are not the mainstay of treatment in hyponatremia: perhaps not yet [^111pdJne]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Two vasopressin antagonists ('vaptans') are now in the market for the treatment of euvolemic (Europe) or euvolemic and hypervolemic (United States) hyponatremia: conivaptan for intravenous use and tolvaptan for oral application. Although their specificity and effectiveness are considered established, their indications are not. At present, we do not know which symptoms of hyponatremia and which degree of hyponatremia should serve as indications for vaptans. Other areas of uncertainty relate to the following unanswered questions: do vaptans shorten the duration of hospitalization? Is it justifiable to use them to prevent relapse of hyponatremia in (chronic) SIAD(H)? (In this text we use the abbreviation SIAD(H) instead of the recently proposed abbreviation SIAD to emphasize that vaptans will work only in the presence of ADH ('SIADH') but not in the syndrome of nephrogenic antidiuresis.) Do they decrease the high mortality associated with hyponatremia? How do we justify the cost of chronic vaptan therapy? The optimal vaptan regimen (dose, timing of controls) to treat SIAD(H) is currently not established, as is the procedure to be recommended in a too rapid correction rate of (chronic) hyponatremia. Until these requirements shall be met by additional studies, we are hesitant to consider vaptans a treatment of choice for the appropriate hyponatremias.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^112PSdTi]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Study plan

The study design has been described previously in detail. In brief, patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia were enrolled from 146 US sites and 79 EU sites. For the present publication, only patients initially assessed as clinically euvolemic were analyzed. The study was exclusively observational; no standardized diagnostic or treatment protocols were imposed.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Only patients with clinically meaningful hyponatremia ([Na +] ≤ 130 mEq/L) and physician-diagnosed euvolemia were enrolled. In a pre-specified adjudication process, individuals whose medical file reports were inconsistent with the diagnosis of euvolemia were excluded.

Statistical methods

Mild hyponatremia was defined as 130mEq/ L ≥ [Na +] > 125 mEq/L, moderate hyponatremia as 125 mEq/L ≥ [Na +] ≥ 120 mEq/L, and severe hyponatremia as [Na +] < 120 mEq/L. Overly rapid correction of [Na +] was defined as an increase > 12 mEq/L in any 24-h interval or > 18 mEq/L in any 48-h interval. Rate of change of [Na +] was calculated as the total increment in [Na +] during the treatment divided by the number of treatment days.

Categorical variables were compared using a chi-square test. In the case of more than two comparison groups, an overall chi-square test was done before performing individual pairwise chi-square tests

Nonparametric analysis was performed for continuous variables. In case of more than two comparison groups, a Kruskal-Wallis test was done to generate an overall test for equality of medians followed by pairwise group comparisons. For comparisons of only two groups, medians were compared using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1117skm3]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

For hypervolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, seven guidance documents recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment (Table 3). Three guidance documents advocated concomitant salt restriction, without clear dose recommendations, and one to avoid hypotonic infusion solution. Three additionally proposed loop diuretics and three others generally stated to treat the underlying disease, whereas one advised to consider stopping diuretics. One guideline additionally proposed demeclocycline and two proposed vasopressin receptor antagonists as a second-line treatment for refractory hyponatremia, whereas one guideline specifically recommended against both demeclocycline and vasopressin receptor antagonists.

Targets and limits of speed of correction

Table 4 shows the key recommendations. The key areas include targets and limits for increase in serum sodium concentration.

Summary of recommendations for targets and limits for speed of correction of hyponatremia by included guidance documents

[Na] – Serum sodium concentration.

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Seven guidance documents provided targets or aims for the increase in serum sodium concentration in case of symptomatic and/or acute hyponatremia. Seven guidance documents provided limits for the increase in serum sodium concentration that should not be surpassed. Five did so independent of symptoms. Limits usually varied between 8 to 12 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and 18 mmol/L during the first 48 hours, irrespective of whether hyponatremia was acute or chronic. Three guidance documents set a stricter limit of < 8 mmol/L during the first 24 hours in cases where the patient was believed to be high risk for developing osmotic demyelination syndrome. Four discussed what to do in case of overcorrection, i.e. to stop current treatment and to consider re-lowering serum sodium concentration by starting hypotonic infusion and administering 1 to 4 μg desmopressin every 6 to 8 hours.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^1116ARCm]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The HN Registry has a number of limitations, most of which derive from its observational design. Patients with hypovolemic HN were excluded, as were those with hypervolemic HN in the EU cohort. A large number of patients were excluded at the time of adjudication. Sensitivity analysis showed no difference in the major outcomes when patients with suspected hypovolemia were restored to the analysis. We believe that the exclusion of these patients represents a conservative approach. Ascertainment varied from center to center; enrollment of consecutive cases was not required. Consequently, the study provides no information about relative prevalence of different etiologies of HN. Accurate determination of clinical volume status is difficult under the best of circumstances. The selection of diagnostic studies and treatments was left up to the clinicians responsible for patients, and the study relied on treating clinicians to make a diagnosis. Neither a fluid challenge nor a urine sodium determination was required as an entry criterion for putatively euvolemic patients. This limited our ability to exclude hypovolemia and independently confirm the presence of SIADH with precision. Because the study's intent was to capture 'real-world' practice, this limitation did not detract from observing how clinician-diagnosed SIADH is treated. Indeed, a principal conclusion is that diagnostic rigor in the case of SIADH is severely lacking, even in a study situation where some treating physicians were aware that their diagnostic choices were being observed. Some therapies were used too infrequently to assess. For example, urea, a treatment shown to be effective in SIADH, and recommended in recent EU guidelines, was used in only 10 patients. Because of the large number of combinations used at low frequency, analysis focused on monotherapy and initial therapy episodes. The study did not specify, much less randomize, treatment choices. We were unable to determine the rationale for choosing a particular treatment. In particular, we could not determine how often NS was used initially in a diagnostic trial to exclude volume depletion in patients suspected of SIADH, a reasonable strategy for its use. Choice of treatments was likely confounded by indication, and the study cannot accurately assess whether any particular treatment shortened hospital stay. We were not able to fully assess how maneuvers such as discontinuation of a HN-inducing medication or treatment of CHF affected [Na +] changes or the decision to add another treatment maneuver. As a result, even the limited comparisons showing superiority or inferiority of particular treatments that were feasible must be interpreted with much circumspection.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^113fEaVG]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is a common cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized children. SIAD refers to euvolemic hyponatremia due to nonphysiologic stimuli for arginine vasopressin production in the absence of renal or endocrine dysfunction. SIAD can be broadly classified as a result of tumors, pulmonary or central nervous system disorders, medications, or other causes such as infection, inflammation, and the postoperative state. The presence of hypouricemia with an elevated fractional excretion of urate can aid in the diagnosis. Treatment options include fluid restriction, intravenous saline solutions, oral sodium supplements, loop diuretics, oral urea, and vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans).

### Lixivaptan: a vasopressin receptor antagonist for the treatment of hyponatremia [^116kb9Rg]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The introduction of medications that specifically antagonize the vasopressin V2 receptor (vaptans) has provided a safe and effective means of therapy. Lixivaptan is the newest of these agents that reliably increase serum sodium levels in patients with euvolemic hyponatremia. However, significant questions remain regarding the specific indications for vaptans, and their potential impact on morbidity and mortality associated with hyponatremia.
