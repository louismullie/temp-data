## Question

explain this" CTA with demonstrates diffusely atheromatous thoracic aorta with note made of a focal ectasia involving the distal thoracic aorta, and advanced emphysematous lung disease"

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of a CTA report describing diffuse atheromatous change of the thoracic aorta, a focal ectasia of the distal thoracic aorta, and advanced emphysematous lung disease, with implications for diagnosis, risk, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the imaging modality and why CTA was chosen. Then, I should verify the terminology and definitions for atheromatous disease, ectasia versus aneurysm, and emphysema. Next, I will correlate these findings with pathophysiology and risk stratification. After that, I should outline immediate and longitudinal management steps, including surveillance, risk factor modification, and when to consider intervention. Finally, I will double-check measurement variability and documentation requirements to ensure the plan is reproducible and aligned with guidelines [^115eGqdL] [^116wouoh].

> Let me first confirm the imaging modality and its role. CTA is the first-line cross-sectional study for thoracic aortic disease because it rapidly depicts the entire aorta and branch vessels with high spatial resolution, supports accurate diameter measurements, and is preferred in acute and chronic settings alike; it has largely supplanted invasive angiography for diagnosis and planning, though it requires iodinated contrast and involves ionizing radiation, which we mitigate with ECG-gating and dose-reduction strategies when appropriate [^115eGqdL] [^112HgwsJ] [^1163nXTJ].

> Now, I need to check the terminology for "diffusely atheromatous thoracic aorta". Atheromatous change reflects generalized atherosclerotic plaque within the aortic wall, often with calcification, and is particularly common in the descending thoracic aorta; importantly, thoracic aortic atheroma is a recognized marker of systemic atherosclerotic burden and carries prognostic implications for embolic risk and coronary artery disease, so I should not dismiss it as merely incidental [^113ff2BN] [^111V5cDN].

> Hold on, I should verify the meaning of "focal ectasia involving the distal thoracic aorta". Ectasia generally denotes enlargement less than 1.5 times the expected normal diameter for age, sex, and body size, whereas an aneurysm is defined as a focal, permanent dilatation of at least 1.5 times expected; however, some radiology practices use "ectasia" loosely for diameters in the 4.5–5.4 cm range, which overlaps with what many experts call an aneurysm, so I need to ensure the actual diameter is measured and reported precisely to avoid misclassification and unnecessary alarm or undertreatment [^114rZpq2] [^113H89nX] [^116wouoh].

> Wait, let me verify the emphysema component. "Advanced emphysematous lung disease" indicates severe destruction of alveolar walls with airspace enlargement, typically due to cigarette smoking; this is clinically relevant because COPD is a known risk factor for thoracic aortic enlargement and rupture, and emphysema burden on CT correlates with exacerbation frequency and worse outcomes, so I should factor this into both aortic risk and overall prognosis [^112Rc7iu] [^116TwoHb].

> I will now examine the pathophysiologic correlation. Diffuse atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta signals chronic, degenerative aortopathy driven by hypertension, smoking, and age; focal ectasia in this context most often reflects atherosclerotic medial degeneration with focal wall weakening, and the coexistence of advanced emphysema reinforces a systemic pro-inflammatory, matrix-degrading milieu that accelerates aortic remodeling and enlargement, increasing the risk of complications over time [^114avjnw] [^116TwoHb].

> Next, I should review risk stratification. I need to confirm the exact maximal diameter of the distal thoracic aorta and compare it to nomogram-based expected size; if the ratio is less than 1.5, ectasia is appropriate, but if it is 1.5 or greater, this meets aneurysm criteria and shifts surveillance intervals and thresholds for intervention. I should also assess for high-risk atheroma features (ulceration, mobile thrombus) and consider the patient's age, sex, hypertension control, smoking status, and COPD severity, all of which influence growth rates and rupture risk [^114rZpq2] [^113ff2BN] [^116TwoHb].

> Let me think about immediate next steps. I should double-check that the CTA report includes orthogonal diameter measurements perpendicular to the aortic axis, document the precise location relative to the diaphragm, and note any mural thrombus, calcification, or ulcer-like projections; if these are missing, I need to request addendum or supplemental reconstructions. Concurrently, I should obtain a comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment, optimize blood pressure to less than 140/90 mmHg if tolerated, institute smoking cessation, and arrange pulmonary evaluation for COPD optimization, as these steps reduce aortic growth and event risk [^1119pzen] [^111fVsMB].

> For surveillance, I should confirm the imaging cadence based on size. If the distal thoracic aorta measures less than 4.0 cm, repeat CTA or MRI in 12–24 months is reasonable; if 4.0–4.4 cm, consider 6–12 months; if 4.5–4.9 cm, consider 6 months; and if 5.0 cm or larger, consider 3–6 months and early surgical consultation. I need to ensure the same modality is used for serial comparisons and remain cautious about small apparent changes, as measurement variability on non-gated CT can be up to 5 mm, so changes of 3–5 mm may reflect noise rather than true growth [^112EvkFf] [^111CW53z] [^116U45ft].

> Hold on, I should verify intervention thresholds. For degenerative descending thoracic aortic aneurysm, elective repair is generally considered at 5.5 cm in average-risk patients, with earlier consideration at 5.0–5.4 cm in high-risk scenarios such as rapid growth, chronic pain, connective tissue disease, or difficult blood pressure control; endovascular repair (TEVAR) is often favored when anatomy is suitable, and preoperative CTA from the thoracic inlet to the femoral arteries is recommended for sizing and planning [^113ppuJw].

> But wait, what if the ectasia is actually aneurysmal and harbors complex atheroma or penetrating ulcer? I should screen the CTA carefully for penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer or intramural hematoma, especially in the distal descending aorta, because PAU carries a nontrivial risk of progression to dissection, pseudoaneurysm, or rupture and may warrant earlier intervention even at smaller diameters depending on symptoms and morphology [^115A27ri] [^116KCXJv].

> I need to ensure documentation and communication are precise. The report should explicitly state the maximal orthogonal diameter, the normal expected diameter for the patient's age, sex, and body size, the calculated size ratio, and whether the lesion meets ectasia versus aneurysm criteria; this reduces misdiagnosis and facilitates appropriate counseling and follow-up aligned with contemporary definitions and nomogram-based standards [^114rZpq2] [^113H89nX].

> Let me reconsider the COPD piece one more time. Advanced emphysema not only worsens cardiopulmonary reserve but also tracks with increased aortic growth and rupture risk in thoracic aortic disease; therefore, aggressive bronchodilator therapy, vaccination, and pulmonary rehabilitation should be integrated into the care plan, and any elective aortic intervention should be coordinated with optimized pulmonary status to mitigate perioperative complications [^112Rc7iu] [^116TwoHb].

> In summary, the CTA demonstrates degenerative thoracic aortic disease with diffuse atheroma and a focal enlargement of the distal thoracic aorta, alongside advanced emphysema; the key next steps are to quantify the exact diameter to distinguish ectasia from aneurysm, initiate aggressive risk factor modification, and establish guideline-concordant surveillance with the same imaging modality, escalating to surgical consultation if thresholds or high-risk features are met [^114rZpq2] [^112EvkFf] [^111CW53z].

The CTA shows **diffuse atheromatous plaque** throughout the thoracic aorta [^113ff2BN], with a focal ectasia (mild dilation) of the distal thoracic aorta [^113H89nX], and **severe emphysema** of the lungs [^112Rc7iu]. This pattern reflects **atherosclerotic disease** with early aneurysmal change and advanced COPD, which together increase risks of rupture, dissection, and respiratory complications [^114avjnw] [^112Rc7iu]. Management should include strict blood pressure control, smoking cessation, pulmonary optimization, and serial imaging to monitor the ectasia for progression to aneurysm [^1178KRjh] [^112EvkFf].

## Detailed explanation of findings

### Diffusely atheromatous thoracic aorta

- **Definition**: Generalized atherosclerotic plaque involving the thoracic aorta, with intimal thickening, calcification, and lipid-rich plaque [^notfound].
- **Clinical significance**: Indicates systemic atherosclerosis and raises risks of embolic events, ischemia, and aneurysm formation [^113ff2BN].
- **Risk factors**: Age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking [^notfound].

---

### Focal ectasia of the distal thoracic aorta

- **Definition**: A localized, mild dilation of the distal thoracic aorta below the aneurysm threshold (< 50% enlargement) [^113H89nX].
- **Clinical significance**: Early aneurysmal change that may progress; warrants surveillance for growth or complications [^116AnjUm].
- **Risk factors**: Atherosclerosis, hypertension, and connective tissue disorders [^notfound].

---

### Advanced emphysematous lung disease

- **Definition**: Severe, irreversible destruction of alveolar walls with hyperinflation and air trapping, consistent with COPD [^notfound].
- **Clinical significance**: Causes respiratory symptoms, impaired gas exchange, and increased surgical risk.
- **Risk factors**: Smoking and environmental exposures [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

| **Finding** | **Clinical implications** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|
| Diffuse atheromatous thoracic aorta | - Systemic atherosclerosis <br/> - Increased embolic risk <br/> - Aneurysm formation | - Stroke <br/> - Peripheral embolization <br/> - Aneurysm rupture |
| Focal ectasia of distal thoracic aorta | - Early aneurysmal change <br/> - Potential progression | - Rupture <br/> - Dissection <br/> - Growth |
| Advanced emphysematous lung disease | - Respiratory impairment <br/> - Surgical risk <br/> - Reduced exercise tolerance | - Respiratory failure <br/> - Exacerbations <br/> - Surgical complications |

## Recommended clinical management

### Medical management

Medical management should prioritize **blood pressure control** with beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors/ARBs to reduce aortic wall stress and slow dilation [^notfound]. Smoking cessation is essential to limit atherosclerosis and emphysema progression [^notfound]. Statin therapy is indicated to lower LDL and stabilize plaque [^notfound]. Pulmonary rehabilitation and optimized bronchodilator therapy should be pursued to improve symptoms and lung function [^notfound].

---

### Imaging surveillance

Imaging surveillance should include **serial CTA or MRI every 6–12 months** to monitor the ectasia for growth or complications [^notfound]. ECG-gated CT improves accuracy and reduces motion artifacts for aortic measurements [^115LuqCG].

---

### Surgical considerations

Surgical considerations include referral to a vascular surgeon if the ectasia progresses to aneurysm size (typically ≥ 5.5 cm) or becomes symptomatic [^notfound]. Preoperative pulmonary optimization is critical given the elevated surgical risk from emphysema [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **rate of aortic dilation**, the severity of emphysema, and adherence to therapy. Diffuse atheroma and focal ectasia increase risks of rupture, dissection, and embolic events, while advanced emphysema worsens respiratory outcomes and surgical risk [^113ff2BN] [^112Rc7iu]. Close follow-up and risk-factor control are essential to improve outcomes.

---

The CTA shows diffuse atheroma of the thoracic aorta, a focal distal thoracic ectasia, and severe emphysema, reflecting atherosclerotic disease with early aneurysmal change and advanced COPD. Management should focus on **blood pressure control, smoking cessation, pulmonary optimization, and serial imaging** to monitor for progression and complications [^112EvkFf].

Ectasia terminology in aortic imaging — Many radiologists use "ectatic" rather than "dilated" to describe a mildly enlarged aorta, others use "ectatic" for an abnormal aortic shape such as a "tortuous" aorta, and some imaging groups use "ectasia" for larger aortas such as those 4.5 cm to 5.4 cm in diameter, which overlaps with what most experts would consider to be an aneurysm. In the coronary arteries, "ectasia" is typically used to describe diffuse (rather than focal) dilation, which may lead to clinical uncertainty when applied to the aorta.

Aortic dilatation terminology — definitions and reporting: The text notes that with "a common echocardiographic upper limit of 37 mm" for the ascending aorta, "the ascending aorta is dilated at a diameter of > 55.5 mm (37 + 18.5 mm)", and prefers explicit size reporting such as "there is a 5-cm ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm". It further states that "ectasia is arterial dilatation < 150% of normal arterial diameter", "Arteriomegaly is diffuse arterial dilatation… with an increase in diameter > 50% in comparison with the expected normal arterial diameter", and that "Aortic dilatation is an acceptable nonspecific term that encompasses both ectasia and aneurysm".

### Thoracic aortic calcification: diagnostic, prognostic, and management considerations [^111V5cDN]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and for the cardiovascular imager, is predominantly encountered in 4 settings: 1) incidentally, for example, during a coronary artery calcium scan; 2) as part of dedicated screening; 3) in the evaluation of an embolic event; or 4) in procedural planning. This review focuses on TAC in these contexts. Within atherosclerosis, TAC is common, variable in extent, and begins in the intima with a patchy distribution. In metabolic disorders, aortitis, and radiation-associated cardiovascular disease, calcification preferentially involves the media and is often more concentric. As an incidental finding, atherosclerotic TAC provides limited incremental discriminative value, and current data do not support screening. After an embolic event, the demonstration of thoracic atheroma provides diagnostic clarity, but has limited treatment implications. Before any procedure, the plan often changes if the most severe form of TAC, a porcelain aorta, is discovered.

Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU) begins with ulceration of an atherosclerotic plaque leading to focal disruption of the aortic intima that allows blood to penetrate into the medial layer and is often associated with an intramural hematoma (IMH) of variable size. PAUs most often appear in the middle or distal descending thoracic aorta, less frequently in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta, and rarely in the ascending aorta; they can vary in size with multiple PAUs often present, and the true incidence is estimated to account for 2% to 7% of all AAS cases. Patients typically are older (> 70 years of age) and present more often with extensive and diffuse atherosclerotic disease with common comorbidities such as hypertension, tobacco use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal insufficiency; PAU can also occur in younger patients with connective tissue disorders and men are more commonly affected than women. The natural history is not well defined and can include stability, enlargement, or progression to IMH, dissection, pseudoaneurysm, or aortic rupture, with a reported risk of rupture up to 40%.

Thoracic aorta imaging modality selection — when assessing broadly for the presence or size of thoracic aortic aneurysms, CTA or MRA is preferred; in contrast, TEE is not generally preferred for routine aortic imaging; when the region of clinical interest is specifically the aortic root (such as screening for or following Marfan syndrome), TTE may be preferred; echocardiography is less consistently able to image the distal ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta, and to image these segments, CTA and MRA are preferred; for serial follow-up of an enlarging thoracic aortic aneurysm, it is best to use the same imaging modality for future imaging.

Surveillance follow-up planning — roles and logistics: The plan for follow-up surveillance imaging should not be left to other practitioners alone, with primary responsibility with the aortic specialist overseeing evaluation and management; ideally a computer database should capture clinical, surgical, and imaging details for every thoracic aortic disease patient; modality and follow-up frequency should be based on clinical history, prior intervention, and disease progression, with small aortas or mild disease followed less frequently than larger aortas; studies may be performed near the patient's home, but images should ideally be reviewed and patients followed by an experienced provider or center.

Conclusion

The conceptual classification of culprit aortic lesions of AAS into pathologies involving either a diseased media (medial degeneration) or a diseased intima (advanced atherosclerosis) avoids some of the confusing terminology regarding AAS. In addition to the discriminating features of each aortic disease, recognition of the overlapping and transitional features in the dynamic and evolving process of AAS will allow a more comprehensive understanding of their underlying pathophysiologic conditions and their natural history, and may improve strategies for therapeutic management. Understanding these features will provide the radiologist with helpful clues facilitating image assessment, allowing further prediction of the natural disease course as well as permitting appropriate management recommendations.

Coronary artery ectasia and aneurysm

Coronary artery aneurysms are commonly defined as a 50% or greater localized increase in diameter of the affected vessel compared with the adjacent arterial segment. Giant coronary artery aneurysms can reach several cm in diameter. Coronary artery ectasia is defined as diffuse coronary artery dilation with less than 50% increase in diameter. Coronary artery aneurysms are most commonly caused by atherosclerosis in adults or by Kawasaki disease in children. Other etiologies include trauma (including iatrogenic), arteritis (granulomatosis with polyangitis, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus arteriosus), infection (syphilis, staphylococcus), dissection, connective tissue disorders (Marfan's, Ehlers-Danlos), and cocaine abuse.

Patients may be asymptomatic or present with heart failure or angina due to embolic or thrombotic phenomena. Hypertension is a risk factor. Aneurysms are most commonly found in the right coronary artery (RCA, 40%), followed by the left anterior descending (LAD, 32%) and circumflex (LCX, 23%) coronary artery. Aneurysms have traditionally been diagnosed by echocardiography (ECHO) or catheter angiography, but the latter may underestimate the size of the aneurysm if there is considerable intraluminal thrombus. Nowadays, they are increasingly found on CT and MR imaging. On imaging, coronary artery aneurysms are seen as fusiform dilatations of a portion of the coronary artery (Fig. 5). Some have classified them according to the extent of involvement (diffuse or discrete ectasia and number of vessels affected). Differential diagnosis includes coronary artery fistula and aberrant origin of the coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (Bland-White-Garland syndrome).

### Computed tomography angiography for aortic diseases [^116vAKK1]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Aortic pathologies encompass a heterogeneous group of disorders, including acute aortic syndrome, traumatic aortic injury, aneurysm, aortitis, and atherosclerosis. The clinical manifestations of these disorders can be varied and non-specific, ranging from acute presentations in the emergency department to chronic incidental findings in an outpatient setting. Given the non-specific nature of their clinical presentations, the reliance on non-invasive imaging for screening, definitive diagnosis, therapeutic strategy planning, and post-intervention surveillance has become paramount. Commonly used imaging modalities include ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and MR imaging. Among these modalities, computed tomography angiography (CTA) has emerged as a first-line imaging modality owing to its excellent anatomic detail, widespread availability, established imaging protocols, evidence-proven indications, and rapid acquisition time.

### Diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysms by computed tomography without allometric scaling [^114rZpq2]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) are defined as aorta diameter greater than 1.5 times the expected size by 11 stakeholder medical societies. Enlarged aortas less than 1.5 times the expected size are termed ectasia, whereas aortas within 2 standard deviations of population means are considered normal. Dilatation is synonymous with ectasia or aneurysm. A logistical challenge in diagnosing TAA according to current definitions is the dependence of expected aorta diameter on age, sex, and body size, thus requiring nomograms. Accurate diagnosis of TAA is important because overdiagnosis (eg, diagnosing aneurysm in cases of ectasia) or misdiagnosis (eg, diagnosing aneurysm or ectasia when normal) may cause unnecessary patient anxiety, unwarranted tests, and excessive referrals. Motivated by inappropriate consultations, we hypothesized that aortas diagnosed as abnormal by computed tomography (CT) are not routinely normalized for patient characteristics, and we evaluated whether radiological diagnoses are concordant with nomogram-based definitions of TAA.

Diagnostic studies and imaging in symptomatic thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) — In patients considered at low or intermediate risk based on history and physical examination findings, we suggest chest X-ray as the first radiographic test as it may identify an alternative diagnosis for symptoms and may obviate the need for additional aortic imaging, with Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). In patients considered at high risk for symptomatic TAA or acute aortic syndrome, we recommend urgent imaging, usually CTA because of its speed and ease of use for preoperative planning; magnetic resonance angiography and transesophageal echocardiography are also adequate for screening in certain scenarios, with Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). Implementation remark: The choice of a screening diagnostic study should be based on what is immediately available at that institution.

CTA has become an important diagnostic tool in the evaluation of vascular diseases in virtually all parts of the body. Whereas CTA is able to provide images depicting exquisite anatomic detail, careful scanning technique and selection of scan parameters are critical for high quality studies. The choices to be made when prescribing a scan can seem daunting at first, but if one applies the principles outlined previously, CTA can be a relatively easy, fast, and safe diagnostic technique that is effective in the majority of patients with vascular disease.

Electrocardiographic gating, multidetector computed tomography (CT), dual-energy CT, parallel magnetic resonance imaging techniques, and advanced postprocessing methods are some of the many recent advancements that have revolutionized cross-sectional imaging of thoracic aorta. Imaging appearances of aortic disease can be complex and variable. Normal findings may simulate abnormalities, and many abnormalities may be asymptomatic. Knowledge and understanding of the imaging techniques, imaging findings of acute thoracic aortic syndromes, natural history of aortic diseases, and aortic surgical techniques may help to appropriately perform and interpret aorta-specific radiology studies.

Imaging findings

All clinically available imaging modalities play an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of TA. Until recently, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was the procedure of choice, but this has been subsequently replaced by cross-sectional imaging as the major disadvantages of DSA are the high radiation dose, substantial contrast material burden and difficulty in assessing cases of long-segment stenosis and aortic wall abnormalities such as arterial calcification, wall inflammation or chronic fibrosis. Additionally, transoesophageal echocardiography and intravascular US are tools that provide high-resolution images of subtle changes in aortic segments that may appear normal with other imaging techniques, although usually only the proximal aorta can be assessed.
Computer tomography Acute stage: The vast majority of TA cases are diagnosed with CT angiography (CTA) since CTA can depict early findings in the vessel wall and lumen, such as circumferential vessel wall thickening, thrombosis, stenosis, occlusion, vessel ectasia, aneurysms and ulcers (Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4). The "double ring" appearance of the thickened aortic wall at contrast-enhanced CT is an early stage finding with a poorly enhanced internal ring of swollen intima and an enhancing outer ring of the inflamed media and adventitia. Fig. 1 a – c A 25-year-old previously healthy man with chest and abdominal pain, weight loss and low grade fever. Axial (a), sagittal (b) and coronal (b) images of CTA of the torso demonstrate circumferential wall thickening of both the ascending and descending thoracic aorta as well as aortic wall thickening including in the abdominal aorta (white arrows). Diffuse narrowing of the aorta can be appreciated on all three views.

Axial (a, b) CTA images demonstrate concentric thickening of the brachiocephalic artery, continuing toward its branches: right common carotid artery, right subclavian artery and left subclavian artery (originating from the brachiocephalic artery in this case). Multiplanar curved reformats (c, d) demonstrate both wall thickening and aneurysmal dilatations along the course of both common carotid arteries (c right, d left) and brachiocephalic artery trunk (c).

MDCTA of the abdomen demonstrates diffuse thickening of the aorta and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) with substantial narrowing of the SMA lumen (arrow). Courtesy of Dr. Ludmila Guralnik, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel That milder degrees of inflammation or wall oedema may not be apparent with CTA is of note. It is considered less sensitive than other modalities such as MR or PET-CT for evaluating the degree of inflammation in the aortic wall. Since CTA is performed using iodinated contrast, it offers the additional advantage of allowing rapid exclusion of aortic pathologies that may clinically mimic acute aortitis, including aortic dissection, intramural haematoma and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer. Chronic stage: Chronic findings include long-standing, burned out aortitis such as linear arterial wall calcification that can be seen after a minimum of 5 years of inflammatory involvement in the aorta or any of the involved vessels, except the ascending aorta. CT can also be used to assess the progression of a potential thoracic aortic aneurysm. High specificity and sensitivity of CT angiography (95% and 100%, respectively) as well as high availability make it the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of TA. Although ionising radiation is of concern, new CT low-dose techniques focussing on decreased kilovoltage and novel reconstruction algorithms provide substantial dose reduction and should be considered, especially when patients are young.
Magnetic resonance imaging A major strength of MR imaging is its ability to depict wall abnormalities before luminal changes occur. Gadolinium-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted images are preferred to assess thickening and enhancing of the arterial wall and T2-weighted images for showing high signal of the vessel wall representing mural oedema (Figs. 5 and 6). MR angiography may show stenosis at multiple levels, mural thrombi, thickening of aortic valve cusps and pericardial effusions. Signal alterations within the pericardial effusion, reflecting fluid and granulation tissue, can be seen as well. Cine MRI can detect cardiovascular and haemodynamic changes, such as aortic regurgitation in patients with TA; MR angiography demonstrates the anatomical location, degree, extent of stenosis and vascular dilation, and patency of collateral vessels and surgical bypass grafts. Fig. 5 a – d A 51-year-old male with chest pain. Spin-echo T1-weighted (a), post-gadolinium enhanced (b) and proton density (c) images of the aortic arch show diffuse and relatively uniform thickening of the aortic arch with focal aneurysmal dilatation of the posterior aspect of the distal arch (arrow). Vivid gadolinium enhancement is uniform and diffuse (b), being even more vivid at the mid-outer portion of the aortic wall (d), corresponding to a "double ring" appearance Fig. 6 a – g A 63-year-old man with a prolonged history of Takayasu arteritis. MDCTA axial images of the chest at the level of the main and left pulmonary artery (a), right pulmonary artery (b, c) and right upper lobe demonstrate substantial thickening of the pulmonary arterial wall, especially pronounced at the level of the right pulmonary artery with almost complete occlusion of the right upper lobe branch and pulmonary infarcts (d) (arrows). T1-weighted (e), T2-weighted (f) and GD-enhanced (g) MRI images emphasise the same findings as well as substantial wall oedema seen as bright signal on T2-weighted images (f) (arrows) Both contrast-enhanced MRI and CTA play an important role in the early diagnosis of TA, i.e. by demonstrating crescentic or ring-like aortic thickening of more than 3 mm, as well as for assessing disease activity. Limitations of MR angiography include the possibility that vascular branch points may be improperly interpreted as occlusions (breath-hold techniques have lessened this problem) and that maximum-intensity projection images may falsely accentuate the degree of vascular stenosis. It is therefore advisable to assess the degree of vascular stenoses from the MR angiography source images. Additional drawbacks of MRI are the relatively decreased sensitivity in the assessment of small vessels and poor visualisation of vascular calcifications, as well as the limited anatomical range that can be scanned as opposed to CT. Finally, MRI is commonly less available in the geographic regions where TA is most prevalent.
Nuclear imaging PET-CT may help to identify vasculitis in patients referred for whole-body imaging for constitutional symptoms and fever of unknown origin, as well as to monitor treatment response. The circumferential region of increased metabolic activity in the vessel wall is characteristic of the active phase of TA (Fig. 7). FDG-PET has a reported sensitivity of up to 92% and a specificity of 89–100% for the detection of large vessel vasculitis among untreated patients with elevated serum markers. Recently, the use of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET, either alone or in combination with contrast-enhanced CTA or MRA, has emerged as a potential tool for the initial diagnosis and assessment of disease activity of aortitis caused by Takayasu arteritis with a variable sensitivity of 60–90% and specificity of 88–100%. PET-CT may also be useful for monitoring treatment response, reflected in decreases in vessel wall metabolic activity. However, the main limitations of these studies are the small sample size, heterogeneous patient population and inconsistent reference standards. Fig. 7 a – c A 59-year-old woman with low-grade fever, malaise and high white blood cell count. Axial (a) CTA image demonstrates normal thickness (arrowhead) of the ascending aortic wall with minimal thickening of the descending aortic wall (arrow). Axial contrast-enhanced MR image (b) shows contrast in the ascending and descending aortic wall corresponding to vivid 18-FDG uptake on PET-CT image (c) Hybrid imaging with 18F-FDG PET and either CTA or MRA allows more precise anatomic localisation of disease activity with increased uptake of 18F-FDG thought to be a surrogate marker of increased activity of inflammatory cells. The presence of wall thickening, arterial stenosis, luminal thrombus and aneurysm cannot be assessed by PET alone; CTA and MRA are complementary to PET for complete evaluation of the patient with aortitis.

Introduction

The aorta is the largest and main artery in the body and consists of two arteries; the thoracic and the abdominal. The thoracic aorta is divided into three regions including ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta. The aortic root includes the aortic valve, as well as annulus and sinus of Valsalva. The ascending aorta extends from the Sino tubular junction to the first arch vessel. The aortic arch comprises of the innominate, left common carotid, and left subclavian artery, as well as the ligamentum arteriosum at the end of the arch. The descending aorta begins at the end of ligamentum arteriosum and continues to the diaphragm. The aorta size increases during life, and the normal size of aorta depends on age, sex, and body surface.

Ectasia refers to the enlargement of the aortic diameter to at least 50% of the normal range, which results in aneurysm formation when the ectasia exceeds tolerance limits. TAA can involve one or more segments of the aorta. Overall, 60% of TAA cases involve the aortic root and the ascending aorta, 40% inflict the descending aorta, and 10% are identified in each of arch or the thoracoabdominal segment. TAA is divided into three categories based on the underlying cause; degenerative, inflammatory, and hereditary. However, TAA may be detected in the context of a variety of other disorders. There are several risk factors for the growth and rupture of ATAA. These include a familial history of the disease, aortic dissection, advanced age, hypertension, COPD, cigarette smoking, male gender, and elevated aortic diameter. ATAA is a subtle, indolent, and dangerous disease, and most patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.

COPD exacerbations — course, prognosis, and risk stratification — usually feature increased symptoms for 7 to 10 days, but some last longer; at 8 weeks up to 20% of patients will not have recovered to their pre-exacerbation state, exacerbations contribute to disease progression especially with slow recovery, and they can cluster with increased likelihood of another event. Some patients are susceptible to frequent exacerbations (defined as two or more exacerbations per year) with worse health status and morbidity; the strongest predictor of future frequency is the number of exacerbations in the prior year, and other associated risk factors/severity markers include an increased ratio of the pulmonary artery to aorta cross sectional dimension (i.e., ratio > 1), greater percentage of emphysema or airway wall thickness on chest CT, and chronic bronchitis.

### Chest CT angiography for acute aortic pathologic conditions: pearls and pitfalls [^1178Q3DJ]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Chest CT angiography (CTA) is essential in the diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes. Chest CTA quality can be optimized with attention to technical parameters pertaining to noncontrast imaging, timing of contrast-enhanced imaging, contrast material volume, kilovolt potential, tube-current modulation, and decisions regarding electrocardiographic-gating and ultra-fast imaging, which may affect the accurate diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes. An understanding of methods to apply to address suboptimal image quality is useful, as the accurate identification of acute aortic syndromes is essential for appropriate patient management. Acute aortic syndromes have high morbidity and mortality, particularly when involving the ascending aorta, and include classic aortic dissection, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and acute intramural hematoma. An understanding of the pathogenesis and distinguishing imaging features of acute aortic syndromes and aortic rupture and some less common manifestations is helpful when interpreting imaging examinations. Related entities, such as ulcerated plaque, ulcerlike projections, and intramural blood pools, and mimics, such as vasculitis and aortic thrombus, are important to recognize; knowledge of these is important to avoid interpretive pitfalls. In addition, an awareness of postsurgical aortic changes can be useful when interpreting CTA examinations when patient history is incomplete. The authors review technical considerations when performing CTA, discuss acute aortic syndromes, and highlight diagnostic challenges encountered when interpreting aortic CTA examinations. © RSNA, 2021.

Computed tomography technology has improved dramatically in the past decade and now constitutes the backbone of preoperative evaluation for aortic disease. Image acquisition is accomplished with multi-row detectors, and coupled with new reconstruction algorithms provide clinicians with high-resolution images that can be visualized in synch with the cardiac cycle, or as complex three-dimensional renditions of in vivo anatomy. Knowledge regarding the means of data acquisition, reconstruction algorithms, and modes of interpretation are critical for the optimal assessment of aortic disease. These issues are increasingly important as endovascular therapy becomes more commonplace for the treatment of thoracic aortic lesions.

### Acquired diseases of the thoracic aorta: role of MRI and MRA [^111SRcv9]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Diseases of the thoracic aorta can present with a broad clinical spectrum of symptoms and signs. Their prevalence appears to be increasing in western populations, most likely corresponding to aging and heightened clinical awareness but also influenced by the progress of high-resolution, noninvasive imaging modalities. Among them, MRI provides an excellent visualization of vascular structures and is well suited for evaluation of thoracic aorta disease. Currently, in many centers, noninvasive imaging modalities are the first choice in the cardiovascular system evaluation and diagnosis, reserving conventional angiography for use only before therapeutic intervention. Understanding the principle MRA techniques is essential for acquiring consistent diagnostic images. Basic technical considerations, which include fast spin-echo, fast gradient-echo, and MRA techniques with phase contrast and contrast-enhanced methods, are discussed and applied in the evaluation of acquired thoracic aorta diseases.

Common aortic surgical techniques — key features for imaging recognition include that the interposition technique removes the diseased ascending aorta and replaces it with a polyester (Dacron) graft with proximal anastomosis often supracoronary and distal anastomosis immediately proximal to the brachiocephalic artery, with anastomoses often reinforced with circumferential Teflon felt; the inclusion technique places an artificial graft within the diseased native aorta and wraps and sutures the native aorta around it, creating a potential space between graft and native wall with important imaging implications; composite grafts are synthetic aortic grafts with a directly attached mechanical or bioprosthetic valve and use coronary "button" reimplantation; for aortic arch involvement, open surgery may involve partial to complete arch replacement with or without debranching and reattachment of one or more arch vessels; and the elephant trunk procedure for diffuse thoracic aortic disease is commonly performed in a two-stage operation with first-stage repair of the ascending aorta and arch and insertion of a graft extension into the proximal descending thoracic aorta.

### Pathobiology of aortic aneurysms and dissections: synthesis of recent investigations and evolving insights [^115umk3n]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to atherosclerosis, the aorta, "the greatest artery", can develop several different types of aneurysms (diameter increase of at least 1.5 times normal), primary dissections (longitudinal split in the media), aneurysms complicated by dissections, and focal lesions, including intramural hematoma and penetrating aortic ulcer. These lesions are distinguished by their locations and extent and have chronic and acute clinical presentations (Figure 1, Supplemental Figures 1 to 3).,

### A 59-year-old woman with visible precordial pulsations [^113frD1h]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Correct answer: E

The correct answer is giant cell aortitis. Progressive aortic ectasia is noted on serial imaging. The ECG-gated CT aortogram demonstrates an aortic annulus within normal limits, but there is severe dilatation of the aortic root. The proximal ascending aorta is severely aneurysmal (maximum diameter 77.5 mm). The aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta show circumferential 4 mm intramural thickening in the absence of atheroma and with contrast enhancement of the adventitia (figure 2). The history of polymyalgia rheumatic and the CT pattern of annuloaortic ectasia in the presence of intramural thickening (≥ 2 mm) with adventitial contrast enhancement are compatible with giant cell aortitis.

Figure 2
ECG-gated cardiac CT angiogram reconstructions of the (A) aortic arch and (B) descending thoracic aorta. Circumferential intramural thickening (4 mm) with adventitial contrast enhancement of the descending thoracic aorta (inset).

Takayasu arteritis typically manifests as concentric aortic wall thickening with a 'double ring' appearance on contrast CT, due to inflammation of the adventitia. A later occlusive stage is often characterised by branch vessel stenoses. Seronegative arthopathies are associated with subvalvular and cusp thickening, which are not present in the case. Infections of the aorta are rare, however, Salmonella aortitis can occur in immunocompromised patients with coexistent osteomyelitis and an atherosclerotic aortopathy which are not features of this case. IgG4-related disease is a fibroinflammatory condition associated with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and retroperitoneal fibrosis.

The patient underwent valve-sparing surgery with replacement of the aortic root, ascending aorta and hemiarch (see online supplementary figure 2). Aortitis is an important diagnosis to consider in the management of suspected vasculitic syndromes.

Thoracic aortic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) protocols — the scan length (anatomic scan range) on CTA should be individually tailored to avoid unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation. In the acute setting of a suspected AAS, it is important to initiate the protocol by a noncontrast thoracic computed tomographic scan to rule out IMH; this scan identifies concentrated hemoglobin within the aortic wall with a characteristically high computed tomographic density (40–70 Hounsfield units) and provides characterization of the hematoma, vascular calcifications, and a baseline for postcontrast evaluation. Motion artifacts involving the thoracic aorta are evident in most (92%) standard nongated computed tomographic angiograms and may appear as a "double aortic arch" on standard nongated CTA, which may lead to a false-positive diagnosis of a dissection flap and impair accurate measurement of the aortic root and ascending aorta. Prospective or retrospective synchronization of data acquisition with the electrocardiographic tracing eliminates these artifacts, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnosis and reproducibility of aortic size measurements, and low-dose prospective electrocardiographically gated CT protocols have the advantage of decreased radiation exposure compared with the standard technique. A late thoracoabdominal scan (~50 msec after bolus injection) improves the detection of visceral malperfusion in the acute setting of aortic dissection, detects slow endograft leaks, distinguishes slow flow from thrombus in the false lumen, and allows alternative abdominal diagnoses in the absence of acute aortic pathology.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) — definitions and distribution: True aneurysms result from stretching of the entire thickness of the aortic wall and contain all three layers (intima, media, and adventitia), and TAAs may involve one or more aortic segments including the aortic root, ascending aorta, arch, or descending thoracic aorta. Sixty percent of TAAs involve the aortic root and/or ascending tubular aorta, 40% involve the descending aorta, 10% involve the arch, and 10% involve the thoracoabdominal aorta, and aneurysm was defined as a permanent focal dilatation of an artery having a ≥ 50% increase in diameter compared with the expected normal diameter for the artery in question.

Imaging techniques — TTE limitations and abdominal aorta assessment indicate that the descending thoracic aorta is often incompletely imaged by TTE, and the distal descending thoracic aorta frequently cannot be imaged clearly because of reduced resolution in the far field. For abdominal imaging, a substantial portion of the upper abdominal aorta can be easily imaged in subcostal views to the left of the inferior vena cava, and this should be routinely performed as a part of a 2D echocardiographic study; when present, aneurysmal dilatation, external compression, intra-aortic thrombi, protruding atheromas, and dissection flaps can be imaged, and flow patterns can be assessed, while the infrarenal abdominal aorta is best imaged as part of an abdominal ultrasound examination by use of a linear array probe.

Aortic thrombus — classification, presentation, diagnosis, and management: Aortic mural thrombus is typically associated with underlying aortic pathology and can be considered "secondary", most often appearing in the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta, whereas "primary" thrombus occurs in a normal or minimally atherosclerotic aorta and is often pedunculated and protrudes into the lumen. Aortic thrombus is most often asymptomatic but may present with limb ischemia, visceral ischemia, or stroke from embolization. The diagnosis is often typically confirmed by either computed tomography angiography (CTA) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Asymptomatic patients with secondary mural thrombus are usually managed conservatively, while primary aortic thrombus or embolic presentations are often managed with anticoagulation, endovascular intervention, or open surgical therapy, informed by the patient's history and the thrombus location, size, and mobility. Long-term anticoagulation is most often considered in patients with thrombus in the ascending aorta and aortic arch because of the increased risk of stroke from potential embolization should aortic thrombus recur.

### Pulmonary artery CTA [^1168qM7T]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The latest with the introduction of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT), CT has been firmly established as the modality of choice for imaging the pulmonary arteries, particularly as the de facto first line test for imaging patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Before the introduction of MDCT, remaining concerns regarding CTs accuracy for diagnosis of isolated peripheral emboli had prevented the unanimous acceptance of this test as the reference standard for imaging PE. After a decade of uncertainty, there is now conclusive evidence that CT, if positive, provides reliable confirmation of the presence of PE and, more importantly, if negative effectively rules out clinically significant PE. Current endeavors to streamline and facilitate workflow for CT diagnosis of PE will further improve the acceptance, utility, and importance of this test. Examples include improvements in workflow, CT derivation of right ventricular function parameters for triage and prognostication of patients with acute PE and the comprehensive assessment of patients with acute chest pain for PE, coronary disease, aortic disease, and pulmonary disease by means of a single, contrast enhanced, ECG-synchronized CT scan. Although the diagnosis or exclusion of acute PE is the most common and important application of CT pulmonary angiography, the ease of scan acquisition and the high spatial resolution of modern CT techniques make this test ideally suited for the greatest majority of congenital and acquired, acute and chronic disorders of the pulmonary arteries.

Aortic penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU) is a relatively common incidental finding on thoracic computed tomography (CT) examinations. This is likely to relate to the steady increase in the number of CT examinations performed and also due, in part, to the increasing age of the general population. There is as yet no consensus on the management of incidental PAUs in asymptomatic patients. This article aims to review the literature and discuss the natural history, prognosis, and management of incidental PAU.

Thoracic aortic disease family screening and follow-up: Cascade screening extends imaging to identify asymptomatic thoracic aortic enlargement in at-risk relatives, and individuals with pathogenic variants in genes for heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) should be screened with aortic imaging for asymptomatic TAD. Multiple studies have confirmed the utility of screening aortic imaging of at-risk relatives of all TAD patients with a positive family history, and studies also support the screening of first-degree relatives of patients with TAD who do not have a family history of the disease. If initial imaging is negative, repeat screening imaging might be worthwhile in 5 years for younger family members or 10 years in older family members, and aortic imaging may be repeated years later depending on the relative's age and aortic size. It should be recognized that there is no upper limit to the age at which patients present with TAD that precludes an underlying genetic cause of the disease, and the specific aortic diameters should be recorded in the medical record so that the information can be readily retrieved when needed in the future.

Sporadic and degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) — clinical distinctions emphasize differing age at diagnosis, risk factors, and pathobiology: Even when limited to "sporadic" aneurysms, ages differ between aortic root/ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta aneurysms at 64 versus 72 years, respectively, typical atherosclerosis risk factors are significantly less common in sporadic root and ascending versus descending aortic aneurysms, and the prevalence of aortic calcification or atheroma is low in sporadic root/ascending TAA but high in descending aneurysms at 8% to 9% versus 80% to 88%, respectively. Collectively, aneurysms of the aortic root and ascending aortic tend to have a congenital if not hereditary cause, whereas descending thoracic aortic aneurysms tend to have an atherosclerotic cause, and descending thoracic aortic aneurysms not related to connective tissue disorders are referred to as "degenerative".

Heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) — testing approach and management guidance states that a pathogenic variant in genes predisposing to thoracic aortic disease (TAD) is a major risk factor, and that although recommendations focus on those at high risk for a single gene mutation, genetic testing may have a role in many TAD patients. A multigene panel comprising all genes suspected to cause HTAD is described as the most cost-effective and clinically useful approach to testing, and only pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are disease-causing and should be used for cascade genetic testing. In families with HTAD in which the causative gene has not been identified, the clinical features in the affected family member should dictate management of other family members, including the diameter of the aortic root and ascending aorta in affected family members who have had a type A dissection and other vascular disease or features segregating with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) in the family. Clinical genetic testing is integral to the diagnostic evaluation of patients with TAD who have clinical indicators of an underlying single gene disorder, and in patients meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome but without ectopia lentis, genetic testing is reasonable to exclude an alternative diagnosis of Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Variants of unknown significance should not be used to identify at-risk relatives or to guide clinical management, and families with potential to help further classify such a variant should be evaluated in collaboration with the genetic testing company.

Patients with thoracic aortic diseases may be completely asymptomatic (as in thoracic aortic aneurysms) or present acutely with severe chest pain (as in acute aortic dissections). Thoracic aortic disease is often occult until a life-threatening complication occurs or the disease is discovered incidentally on imaging. Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) can be used to diagnose various acute and chronic abnormalities of the aorta, including aortic aneurysms, aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, traumatic aortic transection, and congenital malformations. This article reviews the MDCT appearance of various thoracic aortic diseases.

Computed tomography (CT) for aortic disease — CT can image the entire aorta and its branches with high spatial resolution and fast acquisition, and electrocardiograph-gated technology decreases motion artifact of the root and ascending aorta, increasing measurement precision and diagnostic confidence; when necessary, CT can be performed without iodinated contrast and noncontrast imaging can accurately provide diameter assessment of aortic aneurysms for surveillance when MRI is not feasible, while iodinated intravenous contrast delineates lumen and wall and generally improves assessment of wall changes; CT has a very high sensitivity and specificity for acute aortic syndromes (AAS) and traumatic aortic injuries, can identify concomitant coronary and branch vessel involvement and hemopericardium, and may aid identification of dissection entry tears; for suspected AAS, a noncontrast series is typically obtained first to distinguish intramural hematoma, followed by arterial-phase contrast-enhanced thin-slice images for computed tomographic angiography (CTA) extending from the thoracic inlet to the femoral arteries to define the extent of dissection and guide therapy, and in this document CT refers broadly to computed tomography with technique selection based on indication and history.

### Multimodality imaging of thoracic aortic diseases in adults [^116fYTwu]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

In diagnosing and following patients with acute aortic syndromes and thoracic aortic aneurysms, high-quality imaging of the thoracic aorta is indispensable. Mainstay modalities for thoracic aortic imaging are echocardiography, computed tomographic angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography. For any given clinical scenario, the imaging modality and protocol chosen will have a significant impact on sensitivity and specificity for the aortic diagnosis of concern. Imaging can also provide important ancillary information regarding myocardial performance, aortic valve morphology and function, and end-organ perfusion. Surveillance of patients following thoracic aortic surgery with serial imaging studies can identify complications that may require reintervention, and imaging has played an integral role in development of new surgical and interventional methods. Emerging techniques in thoracic aortic imaging include positron emission tomography, which addresses vessel wall inflammation, and 4-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography, which illustrates flow dynamics.

In this pictorial review, we illustrate discriminating imaging features of AAS disease entities as well as the overlapping and transitional ones as revealed by modern ECG-gated CTA (Fig. 2). Awareness of some related and distinguishing radiologic features in AAS may improve our understanding of these diseases and provide further insight into the pathophysiology and natural history and guide appropriate management of these lesions.

Discriminating and overlapping features of acute aortic syndrome. In addition to the certain discriminating features as revealed by recent advances in imaging, each disease in acute aortic syndrome (AAS) may show overlapping features and transition from one to another. In such overlapping and transitional features of aortic diseases, the diagnosis may be affected by the time point at which the imaging has been examined and also by the detectability of tiny pathology by the imaging modality. Awareness of some related and distinguishing radiologic features in AAS is helpful in understanding these diseases and providing new insight into the pathophysiology

Pulmonary dysfunction — preoperative imaging, history, and pulmonary function testing thresholds: Assessment of intrathoracic anatomy is mandatory in the preoperative evaluation of the cardiac surgical patient; those without prior thoracic surgery may be evaluated with a posteroanterior and lateral chest radiograph, while chest computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed for prior cardiac or thoracic surgery or suspected thoracic abnormalities, with CT of the thoracic aorta considered in peripheral vascular disease, and CT or MRI may also aid in diagnosing chronic lung disease. An assessment of chronic lung disease should begin with a thorough history including social, environmental, and familial pulmonary disease. Poor PFT performance should not be used as the sole factor to exclude candidacy; however, randomized device trials of continuous-flow LVADs excluded patients with severely reduced pulmonary function defined by pulmonary function studies as FEV1/FVC < 0.7 and FEV1 < 50% predicted. Subsequent to chest radiography or CT, pulmonary function test (PFTs) evaluation will help delineate COPD, restrictive, and diffusion pathology.

### Pulmonary CTA reporting: expert panel narrative review [^115YCUPq]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary CTA is a ubiquitous study interpreted by radiologists with different levels of experience in a variety of practice settings. Pulmonary embolism (PE) can range from an incidental and clinically insignificant finding to a clinically significant thrombus that can be managed on an outpatient basis to a potentially fatal condition requiring immediate medical or invasive management. Accordingly, a clear and concise pulmonary CTA report should effectively communicate the most pertinent findings to help the treating medical team diagnose or exclude PE and provide information to guide appropriate management. In this Expert Panel Narrative Review, we discuss the purpose of the radiology report for pulmonary CTA, the optimal report format, and the relevant findings that need to be addressed and their clinical significance.

### Aortic morphologic findings after TEVAR… [^111n8Ps1]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Interventions We performed TEVAR to cover proximal thoracic aorta tears in patients who underwent acute or chronic type B aortic dissections. Main Outcomes and Measures Aortic morphologic findings of pre-TEVAR CT or MRI were compared with the most recent findings of post-TEVAR CT or MRI. Frequency of thoracic false lumen thrombosis and false lumen patency was determined and the effect on post-TEVAR aortic morphologic findings analyzed. Total abdominal aortic volume significantly increased in patients with thoracic FLP. Conclusions and Relevance Favorable aortic remodeling of the thoracic aorta occurs after TEVAR for type B aortic dissections in patients with thoracic FLT and FLP. However, failure to achieve thrombosis of the thoracic false lumen negatively influences aortic morphologic findings of the contiguous abdominal aorta.

In this study, we examine the effect of TEVAR for the treatment of type B aortic dissections on midterm aortic morphologic findings. Of special interest is the frequency of FLT, the condition of the aortic true lumen, the diameter and total volume of the dissected aorta, and the morphologic behavior of the dissected abdominal aorta. The diagnosis of type B aortic dissection was established by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging evidence of a thoracic aortic tear distal to or at the left subclavian with the creation of true and false lumens for variable lengths of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The dissection was considered acute in those patients treated with TEVAR within 14 days of symptom onset; for all other patients, the dissections were considered chronic. There was one late death in a patient who initially underwent TEVAR for an acute type B aortic dissection.

The patient developed acute cholecystitis and displayed CT findings significant for persistent partial false lumen flow with interval expansion of the proximal aorta. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed and a staged placement of a proximal endograft extension was planned. The patient died before the aortic procedure presumably because of an aortic rupture, although the family declined an autopsy. Overall, 1- and 3-year survival was 89% by life-table analysis.
