## Question

how long solumedrol for COPD exacerbation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to use intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu‑Medrol) for an acute COPD exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized evidence comparing short versus longer systemic steroid courses. Then, I should verify what current guidelines recommend for duration, especially GOLD and ATS/ERS. Next, I will check the FDA labeling for Solu‑Medrol regarding duration of high-dose IV use and transition to oral therapy. After that, I need to weigh adverse-event risks with longer courses. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, clinically usable regimen that respects dose equivalence and the IV-to-oral switch, while confirming any exceptions or caveats in special scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the core evidence on duration. The REDUCE trial is the pivotal RCT in acute COPD exacerbations and showed that 5 days of systemic corticosteroids was noninferior to 14 days for prevention of re-exacerbation and other key outcomes, thereby establishing that a short course is sufficient in most patients; although this trial used oral prednisone, the class effect supports applying the same duration principle to IV methylprednisolone in comparable clinical circumstances [^116yypFs]. Wait, I should also verify route issues before extrapolating duration from oral to IV; Cochrane analyses found systemic corticosteroids improve outcomes and did not demonstrate superiority of parenteral over oral administration, which supports using IV only when oral is not feasible and keeping the same brief duration once stabilized [^117PBi3B].

> I need to verify that guidelines align with this short-course approach. GOLD 2025 explicitly recommends systemic corticosteroids typically for no more than five days during acute exacerbations to improve FEV₁, oxygenation, and recovery, and to shorten length of stay; this strongly supports targeting a 5-day total exposure regardless of route once the patient can take oral therapy [^115pVBZR]. Hold on, I should ensure that "no more than five days" is indeed current across the GOLD 2025 report sections and not an older iteration; multiple sections consistently reflect this short course recommendation, reinforcing the 5-day target [^115pVBZR].

> Next, I should review ATS/ERS guidance for context. The 2017 ATS/ERS exacerbation guideline recommends a short course of oral corticosteroids with an upper bound of 14 days, but it favors the shortest effective course when supported by evidence, which the REDUCE trial provides; so although the ceiling is 14 days, the guideline logic supports 5 days as the preferred duration in typical cases [^115mkeDk] [^116yypFs]. Hmm, wait a minute, I recall some older practice patterns using 10 to 14 days by default; that is precisely what REDUCE and subsequent guidance sought to shorten, so I should stick with the 5-day default unless there is a compelling individualized reason to deviate [^116yypFs] [^115pVBZR].

> I need to check the Solu‑Medrol label regarding how long to keep patients on high-dose IV therapy. The FDA labeling cautions that high-dose corticosteroid therapy should generally not continue beyond 48 to 72 hours and that dosing should be individualized with transition to the lowest effective dose, often via an oral equivalent once stabilized; this argues for a brief IV phase and then conversion to oral prednisone or oral methylprednisolone to complete a total short course rather than prolonging IV use [^113fD9UZ] [^113fD9UZ]. Hold on, I should verify that this label language applies broadly and not just to other indications; the wording is general for high-dose systemic steroids, and in the context of AECOPD with improving status, it supports early IV-to-oral transition consistent with guideline targets [^113fD9UZ].

> I will now examine the harm signal with extending steroids beyond the shortest effective period. Systemic steroids reduce treatment failure but increase adverse events such as hyperglycemia and infection, and extending exposure without added benefit is not justified; Cochrane review data and ATS pharmacologic guidance both emphasize minimizing systemic steroid exposure and avoiding maintenance oral steroids due to net harm, which further argues against courses longer than necessary [^117PBi3B] [^113Ui3fR]. Let me reconsider whether any subgroup needs longer by default; absent specific complications or alternative diagnoses, most patients do not derive additional benefit from longer courses, so I should maintain the short-course stance while individualizing when clinically mandated [^116yypFs].

> Translating this into practice, I should confirm dose equivalence and operational steps. Prednisone 40 mg per day is the common evidence-based oral dose; this is roughly equivalent to about 32 mg of methylprednisolone, yet many inpatient protocols pragmatically use methylprednisolone 40 mg IV daily at initiation for severe or NPO patients, then switch to oral prednisone as soon as feasible to complete a total of 5 days; for a 5-day total course, tapering is generally not required in otherwise steroid-naïve patients once improvement is achieved, aligning with the principle of the shortest effective course [^115pVBZR] [^116yypFs]. Wait, let me verify the route assumption again; oral therapy is preferred when possible and performs at least as well as IV in large comparative analyses, reinforcing an early transition as the airway and GI status allow [^114NDCjw] [^115mkeDk].

> But wait, what if the patient remains severely ill or cannot take oral therapy beyond 48 to 72 hours. In that circumstance, I should re-evaluate for complications or mimics of COPD exacerbation such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, acute heart failure, or asthma overlap that could explain a slower steroid response; a structured differential diagnosis approach in acute care helps prevent unnecessary prolongation of systemic steroids and directs the right therapy, including antibiotic use when indicated by GOLD criteria for purulence plus volume or dyspnea or the need for ventilatory support where the typical antibiotic duration is also short [^114NhHvq] [^116VjHs8] [^112Smz9Q]. I should double-check that inadequate response is not due to undertreatment of airflow obstruction or missed triggers before extending the steroid course, since prolongation increases adverse effects without proven benefit in uncomplicated AECOPD [^116yypFs].

> Let me first confirm and then state the bottom line. For an acute COPD exacerbation requiring IV methylprednisolone, use a short systemic steroid course targeting a total duration of 3 to 5 days, keep the IV phase as brief as clinically possible and generally not beyond 48 to 72 hours per labeling, then transition to oral prednisone to complete no more than five days of systemic exposure, discontinuing once stabilized without routine taper in steroid-naïve patients; this is supported by REDUCE, GOLD 2025, ATS/ERS guidance favoring the shortest effective course, and FDA Solu‑Medrol label cautions about prolonged high-dose IV use [^116yypFs] [^115pVBZR] [^115mkeDk] [^113fD9UZ]. Hold on, let me verify that this aligns with safety data; yes, longer courses add harm without incremental benefit, so the shortest effective course remains the expert consensus standard for AECOPD management unless individualized factors dictate otherwise [^116yypFs].

The standard duration for Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) in COPD exacerbations is **5 days**, as supported by GOLD 2025 [^115pVBZR] and the REDUCE trial [^116yypFs]. This short course improves FEV₁, oxygenation, and recovery [^115pVBZR] while minimizing adverse effects; longer courses are not superior and increase harm [^116yypFs]. For courses ≤ 5 days, **tapering is unnecessary**, and IV therapy should be switched to oral as soon as feasible.

---

## Recommended duration of solumedrol therapy

- **GOLD 2025 guidelines**: Systemic corticosteroids for COPD exacerbations should be given for **no more than 5 days** [^115pVBZR] to improve FEV₁, oxygenation, and recovery, and to shorten hospitalization.

- **REDUCE trial**: A 5-day course of 40 mg prednisone daily was noninferior to 14 days for re-exacerbation, with fewer steroid-related adverse effects.

- **ERS/ATS 2017 guidelines**: Recommend a short course (≤ 14 days) [^115mkeDk] of oral corticosteroids for ambulatory exacerbations, with 5 days now standard.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting short-duration therapy

Clinical evidence supporting short-duration therapy includes the **REDUCE trial**, which found that 5 days of prednisone was comparable to 14 days for time to next exacerbation, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality, while causing fewer adverse effects. Meta-analyses likewise show that **shorter courses (5–7 days)** are as effective as longer courses (10–14 days) for treatment failure, lung function, and symptoms, and are associated with fewer adverse effects [^112ajs61].

---

## Risks associated with prolonged corticosteroid therapy

Prolonged systemic corticosteroids increase [^112ajs61]:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Higher risk with longer courses [^112ajs61] [^113jdbvi].

- **Infections**: Greater risk of secondary infections [^112ajs61].

- **Psychiatric effects**: More frequent with extended use [^112ajs61] [^113jdbvi].

- **Osteoporosis**: Higher fracture risk with chronic exposure [^112ajs61] [^115FEsVh].

---

## Clinical factors influencing duration of therapy

Severity of exacerbation may warrant closer monitoring, but a **5-day course remains standard** [^115pVBZR]. Patient response guides **duration** — rapid improvement supports 5 days, whereas a slower response may prompt reassessment. Comorbidities such as diabetes, osteoporosis, and heightened infection risk favor shorter courses [^113jdbvi]. Patients with frequent prior exacerbations may require individualized plans, though 5 days is typical [^115mkeDk].

---

## Current clinical practice guidelines

| **Guideline** | **Recommended duration** | **Route of administration** |
|-|-|-|
| GOLD 2025 | 5 days [^115pVBZR] | Oral preferred; IV if oral not feasible [^116heFe3] |
| ERS/ATS 2017 | ≤ 14 days (typically 5 days) [^115mkeDk] | Oral preferred; IV if oral not feasible [^116heFe3] |
| FDA labeling | 48–72 hours for high-dose IV therapy [^113fD9UZ] | IV or IM |

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Standard duration**: 5 days of systemic corticosteroids for COPD exacerbations [^115pVBZR].

- **Route of administration**: Use oral corticosteroids when feasible [^114NDCjw]; switch from IV to oral promptly [^116heFe3].

- **Tapering**: Not required for courses ≤ 5 days.

- **Monitoring**: Watch for hyperglycemia, infections, and psychiatric effects, especially with longer courses [^113jdbvi].

---

The standard duration of systemic corticosteroids for COPD exacerbations is **5 days** [^116yypFs], balancing efficacy and safety; longer courses do not improve outcomes and increase adverse effects.

### Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Does the dosage of corticosteroids and type of antibiotic matter [^112ajs61]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are significant events that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic therapy and systemic corticosteroids are important treatments for patients with severe AECOPD. The objective of this review is to summarize the most recent evidence concerning antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, with a focused evaluation on the contribution of antibiotic type and corticosteroid dosage on patient outcomes.

- **Recent findings**: Macrolides should be considered the antibiotic of choice for prevention of AECOPD in patients who qualify for therapy. Macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams are all reasonable treatment options for severe AECOPD, and the decision to use one over the other should be based upon patient characteristics and institutional or regional antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The best available evidence now suggests that higher-dose corticosteroids are not superior to treatment with lower-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe AECOPD. Additionally, longer durations of systemic corticosteroid therapy do not improve clinical outcomes.

- **Summary**: Several antibiotic options are efficacious in the management of severe AECOPD, and drug selection should be patient-specific. Recent studies suggest that lower dosages and shorter durations of corticosteroid treatment may be prudent.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111ZMHsZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

This document provides clinical recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It represents a collaborative effort by a panel of expert COPD clinicians and researchers, along with a team of methodologists under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society.

- **Methods**: Comprehensive evidence syntheses were performed on all relevant studies addressing clinical questions and critical patient-centered outcomes agreed upon by the panel of experts. The evidence was appraised, rated, and graded, and recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

- **Results**: After evaluating the quality of evidence and balancing the desirable and undesirable effects, the guideline panel made the following recommendations:
	1. A strong recommendation for the use of long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance.
	2. A conditional recommendation for the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance who have experienced one or more exacerbations in the past year.
	3. A conditional recommendation for ICS withdrawal for patients receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) if they have had no exacerbations in the past year.
	4. No recommendation for, or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting treatments.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of single inhaler triple therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: New user cohort study [^117CmkWc]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

The primary outcomes were the first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (effectiveness) and the first admission to hospital with pneumonia (safety). Moderate exacerbations were defined by fills of prednisone prescribed for 5–14 days, with a positive predictive value of 0.73, and severe COPD exacerbations by admission to hospital with a COPD diagnosis code specified in the primary position, based on ICD-9-CM codes (positive predictive value 0.86). Conversion to ICD-10-CM codes was performed based on clinical review. If a patient met criteria for both a moderate and severe COPD exacerbation within 14 days of each other, the exacerbation was considered severe, starting on the day when criteria for exacerbation were first met.

This categorization of COPD exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (moderate) versus those requiring admission to hospital (severe) is used in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines and has been widely used in randomized controlled trials and other observational studies. Admission to hospital with pneumonia was defined based on ICD-10-CM codes (J.09.X1, J10.xx-J18.x, A01.03, A02.22, A37.01, A37.11, A37.81, A37.91, A54.84, B01.2, B05.2, B06.81, B77.81, J85.1, J22) in any position, with a positive predictive value of 0.88, based on ICD-9-CM codes. Conversion to ICD-10-CM codes was performed based on clinical review.

Patients were followed up for up to one year, until the end of data, or until they had an outcome of interest or discontinued treatment (with a grace period of 60 days permitted).

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116gCu8E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition primarily related to smoking. Acute exacerbations of COPD, usually associated with superimposed infections, occur frequently. Systemic corticosteroids are widely used in their management, often in combination with other treatments such as antibiotics, oxygen supplementation, and bronchodilators.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, on the outcomes of acute exacerbations of COPD.

- **Search strategy**: Searches were conducted using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD RCT register, with additional studies sought from the bibliographies of randomized controlled trials and review articles. Authors of identified trials were contacted for other published and unpublished studies. The last search was carried out in August 2008.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing corticosteroids (administered either parenterally or orally), with an appropriate placebo control were included. Other interventions, such as bronchodilators and antibiotics, were standardized. Clinical studies of acute asthma were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Information measured but not reported was requested from authors of included studies. Trials were combined using Review Manager for analyses.

- **Main results**: Eleven studies (n = 1081) fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and 10 studies contributed data for analyses (n = 1051). There were significantly fewer treatment failures within thirty days in patients given corticosteroid treatment, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.50.

### Improving adherence for management of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111Erv3q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend 40–60 mg of prednisone equivalent for 10–14 days for patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the amount of corticosteroid prescribed varies widely in clinical practice. Using the electronic health record, we implemented an evidence-based order set to standardize the treatment of patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD.

- **Methods**: This is a pre- and post-intervention study on patients hospitalized between January 1, 2009, and September 30, 2012, with a primary discharge diagnosis of COPD (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code: 491.xx, 492.xx, and 496) and receipt of at least one dose of corticosteroid at our tertiary care hospital. Data on baseline demographics and the dose of corticosteroid in prednisone equivalent administered during the first 48 hours and during the entire hospitalization were collected from the electronic health record. Evidence-based guidelines were used to build and implement acute exacerbations of COPD management electronic order sets in our electronic health record, Epic (Verona, WI). We divided the study into 2 time periods (January 1, 2009, through February 28, 2011, as pre- [n = 203] and March 1, 2011, through September 30, 2012, as post-intervention periods [n = 217]). The primary outcome measure was the corticosteroid dose administered in the first 48 hours. Secondary outcome measures were corticosteroid dosage during the entire hospitalization, length of stay, hospital follow-up rates, and 30-day readmission rates.

The treatment of acute overdosage is by supportive and symptomatic therapy. For chronic overdosage in the face of severe disease requiring continuous steroid therapy, the dosage of the corticosteroid may be reduced only temporarily, or alternate day treatment may be introduced.

### Long-term natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Severe exacerbations and mortality [^116cweBQ]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by progressive, generally irreversible airflow limitation associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs, has been increasing in prevalence. It affects over 12 million people in the United States alone, where it has become the third leading cause of death. While the disease course involves a slow progressive deterioration in airflow, it is punctuated by exacerbations, many of which are serious, requiring hospitalization and associated with higher mortality and elevated costs.

The progressive deterioration in COPD has traditionally been illustrated by the Fletcher-Peto curves, which suggest a smooth continuous accelerated decay in lung function over time. Such a gradual decay in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) inherently implies that exacerbations interspersed within the course of the disease do not necessarily alter this natural history. Yet, recent studies report an association between exacerbations and a greater decline in lung function. Moreover, increasing exacerbation frequency has been associated with higher mortality, while exacerbations appear to cluster in time, and a history of exacerbations is the single best predictor of future exacerbations. Thus, rather than the smooth gradual decay suggested by the Fletcher-Peto curves, these findings evoke more of a stepwise component to the deterioration in COPD over time. Such a hypothesis, however, is uncertain, as all natural history studies have been based on prevalent cohorts where disease duration is not considered.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^112amFJu]. Thorax (2020). High credibility.

Prevention of exacerbations is a crucial therapeutic aim in stable COPD. Most available treatments address this to some extent, as demonstrated by RCTs of unselected patients with COPD and frequent exacerbations (summarised in the ERS/ATS guideline on the prevention of COPD exacerbations and the GOLD document).

More personalised preventive approaches have not been tested yet. However, there is emerging evidence suggesting a potential role for such interventions. Characteristically, a recent report from the AERIS longitudinal cohort suggested that patients tend to experience either recurrent bacterial or eosinophilic exacerbations. This group of patients might benefit from different preventive strategies. Consistently, in the Study to Understand Mortality and Morbidity in COPD (SUMMIT) trial, the addition of an ICS (fluticasone furoate) led to a reduction in the frequency of exacerbations that were treated with systemic corticosteroids alone or with both antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids, with treatment being decided by the responsible clinician. On the other hand, fluticasone led to a 12% increase in the frequency of exacerbations treated by antibiotics alone, compared with placebo. Data from the Effect of Indacaterol Glycopyrronium vs. Fluticasone Salmeterol on COPD Exacerbations (FLAME) trial showed that the combination of a long-acting beta-agonist (indacaterol) with a long-acting antimuscarinic (glycopyrronium), compared with the combination of a long-acting beta-agonist (salmeterol) and an ICS.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113jdbvi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Two studies (n = 247) assessed the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events. The list of adverse events included, but was not limited to, hyperglycemia, hypertension, secondary infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute psychiatric illness requiring a consultation, an invasive procedure, or initiation of a specific therapy. The studies revealed a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use versus no oral steroid (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16–2.34; P = 0.006). There was low certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 174 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 43 more to 359 more).

Based on the five critical outcomes using RCT evidence and completion of the GRADE evidence table, the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be "low", and this certainty was assigned to the final recommendation as per GRADE guidance.

The panel believed that maintenance oral steroid therapy has not been shown in clinical trials to improve clinical outcomes, and the available evidence suggests that chronic oral steroid therapy has a potential for harm. Two RCTs revealed an increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use, suggesting excess adverse events (harms) in patients who are prescribed daily oral steroids. However, this recommendation was based on RCTs that had small sample sizes, a small number of events, short durations, and broad CIs around the point estimates. In addition, these studies occurred when there was a paucity of medications available for management.

### New developments in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115TduAZ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were a poorly defined and understood entity. The application of better study designs and new research methodologies has shed considerable light on the pathogenesis of this common clinical syndrome.

- **Recent findings**: Inflammation is an important component of the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and exacerbations probably represent acute increases in airway inflammation brought about by one or more etiological agents. Environmental particulate and gaseous pollutants have been linked in epidemiological studies with increased respiratory symptoms and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bacterial, viral, and atypical pathogens, either alone or in concert, induce the majority of acute exacerbations.

- **Summary**: A bacterial cause of a substantial proportion of exacerbations is now firmly established by the results of bronchoscopy, molecular epidemiology, immunology, and airway inflammation studies. Future research should focus on pathogenic mechanisms and host defense against the microbial pathogens associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in order to develop better treatment and prevention strategies.

### Long acting beta2 agonists for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with poor reversibility: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^112URb7H]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Three trials reported on COPD exacerbations. Only one trial defined "COPD exacerbation" as episodes requiring antibiotics or corticosteroids but not hospital admission; these occurred at a mean rate of 0.54 exacerbations per patient per year in salmeterol recipients and 0.76 exacerbations per patient per year in placebo recipients (p = 0.0003). In one 16-week trial, the numbers and proportions of patients having exacerbations among those receiving salmeterol 50 or 100 μg twice daily or placebo were 75 (33%), 91 (42%), and 98 (43%), respectively. In an 8+8 week trial, there were fewer exacerbations during treatment with salmeterol 100 μg twice daily than during treatment with placebo (p = 0.065); data were not presented.

Data on adverse effects of interest were not available from the reports.

### Exacerbation-like events in the 12 months prior to identification of chronic respiratory conditions in a primary care population [^113x9mAx]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Initial chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) pharmacotherapy is based on symptom burden and exacerbation history. Inclusion of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is recommended only for those with a history of exacerbations. This brief report highlights that among individuals with previously unrecognized COPD, about 1 in 5 experience one or more exacerbation-like events, and about 1 in 10 experience two or more events in the prior 12 months, whether or not they self-report concomitant asthma. Closer attention to prior exacerbation-like event history might lead to more guideline-concordant care.

In addition, there are two other groups that have impaired but non-obstructive spirometry. Some individuals with significant respiratory symptom burden have frequencies of exacerbation-like events similar to those meeting COPD spirometry criteria. At the time of writing, we have little guidance for the treatment of these individuals.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117PBi3B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admission and mortality. They contribute to a long-term decline in lung function, physical capacity, and quality of life. The most common causes are infective, and treatment includes antibiotics, bronchodilators, and systemic corticosteroids as anti-inflammatory agents.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and to compare the efficacy of parenteral versus oral administration.

- **Search methods**: We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). We also checked references of included studies and trial registries. We conducted the last search in May 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally with an appropriate placebo, or comparing oral corticosteroids with parenteral corticosteroids in the treatment of people with acute exacerbations of COPD were included. Other interventions, such as bronchodilators and antibiotics, were standardized for both groups. We excluded clinical studies of acute asthma.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

- **Main results**: Sixteen studies (n = 1787) met inclusion criteria for the comparison of systemic corticosteroid versus placebo, and 13 studies contributed data (n = 1620). Four studies (n = 298) met the inclusion criteria.

### Corticosteroid therapy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114Ri8jT]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized in part by a chronic inflammatory state in the airways (largely from chronic noxious stimuli such as tobacco smoke), punctuated with acute inflammatory exacerbations, which are often infectious. Although pathologically and biochemically different from the inflammation of asthma, the chronic inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in subgroups with asthma-like features and especially during exacerbations, might be expected to respond to corticosteroid therapy, as does asthma. Complications from long-term corticosteroid use are important, but they appear less when the corticosteroid is given via the inhaled route. Clinical evidence is particularly strong supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids to prevent exacerbations and oral corticosteroids to reduce the duration and impact of exacerbations.

### Solu-medrol [^113fD9UZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In general, high-dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized, usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours. In other indications, the initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.

It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response of the patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary include changes in clinical status due to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In such cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period consistent with the patient's condition. If, after long-term therapy, the drug is to be discontinued, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### Once-daily long-acting beta₂-agonists/inhaled corticosteroids combined inhalers versus inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117S2z39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Three classes of inhaler medication are used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): long-acting beta₂-agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). To encourage patient adherence, two classes of medication are often combined in a single device; once-daily dosing offers the greatest convenience to patients and may significantly influence adherence.

- **Objectives**: To compare a once-daily combination of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta₂-agonist inhalers (ICS/LABA) versus inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists alone (LAMA) for people with COPD.

- **Search methods**: We performed an electronic search of the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Airways Group (14 May 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (14 May 2018), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (20 September 2017). Additionally, we searched other resources, including reference lists of included studies and manufacturers' trial registers (10 October 2017). Two pairs of review authors screened and scrutinised selected articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing once-daily administered ICS/LABA and LAMA in adults with COPD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in each study. We analysed dichotomous data as random-effects odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs), both with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), using Review Manager software.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116Bitqc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The target audience for this guideline includes specialists in respiratory medicine. However, given that COPD is a common condition, primary care physicians, internists, other healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers may also find benefit from these recommendations. Although the panel used a systematic approach and the best available evidence to develop this guideline, it is important to note that study participants in many clinical trials may not reflect all populations. Specifically, patients older than 80 years, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma are rarely represented in clinical trials. We recommend that for all clinical management decisions, the patient and the healthcare provider should engage in a shared decision-making process.

### The 2007 GOLD guidelines: A comprehensive care framework [^11179NH3]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Comprehensive management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes proper assessment, monitoring of disease, reduction of risk factors, the management of stable COPD, and the prevention and management of exacerbations. The 2007 COPD guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease address each of these aspects of COPD management in detail and provide evidence-based recommendations for patients and health-care professionals.

Reduction of risk factors emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation and control of environmental indoor and outdoor pollutants. The management of COPD must be individualized. Aerosol administration of bronchodilators is the most effective method of reducing the work of breathing and alleviating dyspnea. Glucocorticosteroid therapy is recommended to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve health-related quality of life for patients with stage 3 and 4 COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation proves effective in relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing patients' physical and emotional participation in activities of daily life.

Oxygen therapy is essential for patients with substantial hypoxia. Patients with COPD and respiratory failure may benefit from noninvasive ventilation. Surgery may play a limited role in the management of selected patients with COPD. Since exacerbations influence lung function and clinical decline in patients with COPD and contribute to the cost of caring for this disease, efforts must be directed at prevention and management of exacerbations.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111gEY5L]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The studies available at the time of writing used the criterion of one or more exacerbations in the past year to define a patient with frequent exacerbations. This criterion is inadequate because there are likely different risks and responses to pharmacotherapy for patients depending on both the number and severity of exacerbations. For example, a patient with less than one exacerbation per year would likely be at low risk; patients with one exacerbation per year may have a moderate risk; and patients with two or more exacerbations per year, or those with at least one severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization, may be at high risk. Trials using risk stratification of exacerbation risks to more precisely target a treatment response are needed. Evidence is also lacking regarding the subgroup with no history of exacerbations, and trials are needed to better establish the role of triple therapy in this patient population.

Adequately powered, well-designed effectiveness studies (e.g. pragmatic RCTs and nonrandomized studies of interventions), with larger sample sizes, in the area of triple therapy versus dual therapy should be conducted in real-life situations. This includes patients older than 80 years of age, those with multiple chronic health conditions, smokers, and those with a co-diagnosis of COPD and asthma. The results of such trials could provide much-needed robust evidence for optimal personalized clinical management.

- **Question 3**: In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), should the ICS be withdrawn?

### International differences in the frequency of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations reported in three clinical trials [^112gRi75]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the cornerstone of evidence-based treatment. It is now customary to conduct large, complex studies to identify therapies that reduce the incidence of clinically important but infrequent events like death, hospitalization, or symptomatic deterioration. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations are important because they drive clinical and physiological deterioration as well as healthcare costs. However, the interpretation of exacerbation data in clinical trials has proven to be very complex. Exacerbations are not normally distributed over time, and their occurrence can lead to behavioral changes such as leaving the trial. Further, the operational identification of an exacerbation's presence and severity relies on the post hoc determination of a new therapeutic intervention. The determinants of this therapeutic decision have not been studied in detail, and physicians in different countries might choose to manage the same event differently. Moreover, exacerbations may be under or over-reported when determined only by patient-reported symptom variability and the specific treatment initiated.

Although some studies have relied on complex statistical models that address the problem of the patient's individual propensity to exacerbate, other studies have focused on identifying differences in the time to first exacerbation. Even when using these approaches, large numbers of patients are needed to provide sufficient statistical power for a proper test of the null hypothesis when exacerbation is an outcome. Indeed…

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: A need for action [^115EH1uW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations significantly contributing to the overall severity and burden of the disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are predominantly managed in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations.

This review offers practical information about the definition of exacerbations in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients, being associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting.

Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111zy4JZ]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to its high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, important controversies in COPD management persist. Traditionally, COPD has been defined using spirometric criteria; however, more relevant diagnostic methods are needed to describe COPD severity and comorbidity accurately.

The initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease, aimed at slowing progression, is debatable. There are many controversies regarding the role of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD management. Additionally, the use of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of exacerbation has seen a resurgence of interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently required for the optimum management of acute COPD exacerbations. COPD's complexity is underscored by several clinically relevant phenotypes, which will guide future management strategies.

Regarding the medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically in the context of managing acute exacerbations, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend considering the administration of antibiotics (typically for 5 days). The use of antibiotics aims to shorten recovery time and reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and the duration of hospitalization in patients experiencing acute exacerbations.

### Medication regimens for managing COPD exacerbations [^114ziMd3]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a hallmark feature of COPD and contribute to morbidity and mortality. There is general agreement that the pharmacotherapy of COPD exacerbations includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Strong evidence exists for the benefit of corticosteroids for exacerbations and of antibiotics in the acute hospital setting. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, in the best drug selection, dose, route, and duration of treatment. This article reviews the evidence base and expert recommendations for drug treatment of COPD exacerbations in the outpatient and inpatient settings.

### International differences in the frequency of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations reported in three clinical trials [^1142cP1X]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are an important endpoint in multinational clinical treatment trials, but the observed event rate is often lower than anticipated and appears to vary between countries. We investigated whether systematic differences in national exacerbation rates might explain this observed variation. Data from three large multicenter international randomized trials conducted over an 18-year period with different designs and clinical severities of COPD were reviewed. These trials compared bronchodilator and/or inhaled corticosteroids with bronchodilators alone and/or placebo. Exacerbations were defined by antibiotic and/or oral corticosteroid use (moderate) or the need for hospitalization (severe). Crude exacerbation rates were calculated in the 30 countries contributing 30 or more patients to at least two trials. Data were grouped by exacerbation rate based on the first study contribution.

For the 29,756 patients in 41 countries analyzed, the mean exacerbation rate was two- to threefold different between the highest and lowest tertiles of the recruiting nations. These differences were not explained by demographic features, study protocol, or reported exacerbation history at enrollment. Of the 18 countries contributing to all trials, half of those in the highest and half in the lowest tertiles of exacerbation history remained in these groups across trials. Severe exacerbations showed a different rank order internationally. Countries contributing to COPD trials differ consistently.

### Inhaled drugs to reduce exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A network meta-analysis [^113xphgu]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receive inhaled long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. Conventional meta-analyses have established that these drugs reduce COPD exacerbations when separately compared with a placebo. However, there are relatively few head-to-head comparisons, and conventional meta-analyses focus on single comparisons rather than on a simultaneous analysis of competing drug regimens that would allow rank ordering of their effectiveness. Therefore, we assessed the relative effectiveness of the common inhaled drug regimes used to reduce exacerbations in patients with COPD using a network meta-analytic technique.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and searched existing systematic reviews and electronic databases for randomized trials of ≥ 4 weeks' duration that assessed the effectiveness of inhaled drug regimes on exacerbations in patients with stable COPD. We extracted participants' and intervention characteristics from included trials and assessed their methodological quality. For each treatment group, we registered the proportion of patients with ≥ 1 exacerbation during follow-up. We used treatment-arm-based logistic regression analysis to estimate the absolute and relative effects of inhaled drug treatments while preserving randomization within trials.

- **Results**: We identified 35 trials enrolling 26,786 patients with COPD, of whom 27% had ≥ 1 exacerbation. All regimes statistically significantly reduced exacerbations compared with a placebo (odds ratios ranging from 0.71, with a 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.

### Pharmacologic therapies in patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^111HgcMr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by frequent exacerbations. This study aims to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and adverse events (AEs) of pharmacologic interventions for adults experiencing exacerbations of COPD.

- **Data sources**: English-language searches of several bibliographic sources from database inception to 2 January 2019.

- **Study selection**: Sixty-eight randomized controlled trials were included. The trials enrolled adults with exacerbations of COPD treated in outpatient or inpatient settings, except intensive care, and compared pharmacologic therapies with placebo, "usual care", or other pharmacologic interventions.

- **Data extraction**: Two reviewers independently extracted data and rated study quality and strength of evidence (SOE).

- **Data synthesis**: Compared with placebo or management without antibiotics, antibiotics administered for 3 to 14 days improved exacerbation resolution at the end of the intervention (odds ratio [OR], 2.03 [95% CI, 1.47 to 2.80]; moderate SOE) and reduced treatment failure (OR, 0.54 [CI, 0.34 to 0.86]; moderate SOE), regardless of exacerbation severity in outpatients and inpatients. Systemic corticosteroids provided for 9 to 56 days, when compared with placebo in outpatients and inpatients, were associated with reduced treatment failure at the intervention's end (OR, 0.01 [CI, 0.00 to 0.13]; low SOE) but led to more total and endocrine-related AEs. Other pharmacologic interventions, like aminophyllines, magnesium sulfate, anti-inflammatory agents, and inhaled corticosteroids, were evaluated against placebo or usual care in inpatients, but the text was cut off before further details were given.

Regarding the medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly in the management of acute exacerbations, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend administering antibiotics for acute exacerbations of COPD in patients with increased sputum purulence plus increased sputum volume and/or dyspnea, or in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Antibiotics should be selected based on local resistance patterns, with empiric options including amoxicillin/clavulanate, macrolide, tetracycline, or, in selected cases, quinolone.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: A state of the art review [^111KzuaQ]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Affecting 10% of the population over the age of 40, the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has reached epidemic proportions. COPD is defined by the presence of poorly reversible airflow obstruction and an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung to noxious particles or gases. Punctuating the decline in lung function are acute deteriorations in respiratory health, termed exacerbations. As discussed further below, exacerbations are important events in the natural history of COPD. This review provides a critical summary of present exacerbation therapies and aims to update the reader on recent developments in the treatment and prevention of exacerbations in COPD.

### Steroids in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Are nebulized and systemic forms comparable [^111B8w7L]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are strongly recommended in the treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As COPD patients are usually elderly and relatively immobile, the side effects of systemic corticosteroids frequently outweigh their beneficial effects. Conversely, nebulized corticosteroid solutions have a negligible systemic side-effect profile. This review summarizes the role of nebulized corticosteroids as an alternative to systemic corticosteroids during exacerbation periods of COPD.

- **Recent findings**: The number of trials in the literature is increasing. Regarding the available data, high-dose nebulized budesonide was found to be as effective as systemic corticosteroids in exacerbations of COPD. The side-effect profile, particularly blood glucose levels, is better for nebulized budesonide.

- **Summary**: Findings from recent studies give a positive impression of the role of high-dose nebulized budesonide in exacerbations of COPD. However, larger and more statistically powered trials testing different types of nebulized corticosteroid solutions with varying dosages are still lacking. Before recommending the routine use of nebulized corticosteroids in exacerbations, present findings need to be confirmed with further high-quality studies.

### Solu-medrol [^1172d8ug]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.

Dosage must be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered for more than a few days. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued. Routine laboratory studies, such as urinalysis, two-hour postprandial blood sugar, determination of blood pressure and body weight, and a chest X-ray should be made at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with an ulcer history or significant dyspepsia.

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.

### Deciding what type of evidence and outcomes to include in guidelines: article 5 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS/ERS workshop report [^111fiaS5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use more rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. This is the fifth of a series of 14 articles that were prepared by an international panel to advise guideline developers in respiratory and other diseases on approaches for guideline development. This article focuses on what type of evidence and outcomes to include in guidelines.

- **Methods**: In this review, we addressed the following topics and questions. (1) What methods should be used to select important outcomes? (2) What types of outcomes should be considered? (3) What sources of evidence should be considered? (4) How should the importance of outcomes be ranked? (5) How to deal with surrogate outcomes. (6) What issues related to outcomes should be considered in the evidence review? (7) What quality of evidence should be used? (8) How to interpret the effect on outcomes. (9) How to incorporate outcomes related to harm. We based our responses on a PubMed literature review, prior reviews, relevant methodological research, and workshop discussions.

- **Results and discussion**: Guideline panels should use transparent and systematic methods to select both the evidence and important outcomes, with input from groups that represent a wide range of expertise and constituencies. Outcomes should address both benefits and downsides, with consideration of the definitions, severity, and time course of the outcomes.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116ArCpM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

This document provides clinical recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It represents a collaborative effort by a panel of expert COPD clinicians and researchers, along with a team of methodologists under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society.

- **Methods**: Comprehensive evidence syntheses were performed on all relevant studies that addressed the clinical questions and critical patient-centered outcomes agreed upon by the panel of experts. The evidence was appraised, rated, and graded, and recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

- **Results**: After weighing the quality of evidence and balancing the desirable and undesirable effects, the guideline panel made the following recommendations:
	1. A strong recommendation for the use of long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance.
	2. A conditional recommendation for the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance who have experienced one or more exacerbations in the past year.
	3. A conditional recommendation for ICS withdrawal for patients with COPD receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year.
	4. No recommendation for, or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators.

### Role of corticosteroids in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115jaowF]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroid therapy for patients experiencing exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has become increasingly commonplace over the past two decades. This practice was initially controversial due to a number of small clinical trials that provided inconclusive evidence regarding its efficacy. However, experience from recent trials indicates that systemic corticosteroids are modestly effective in this setting.

Systemic corticosteroids administered to hospitalized patients reduce the absolute treatment rate by about 10%, increase the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) by approximately 100 mL, and shorten the hospital stay by 1 to 2 days. It is advised that treatment should not extend longer than 2 weeks, although the optimal starting dose is not known. Expected complications of treatment include hyperglycemia and potentially an increased rate of secondary infections.

### TNFα antagonists for acute exacerbations of COPD: A randomised double-blind controlled trial [^113yQ3jX]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this randomized double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial was to investigate whether etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) antagonist, would provide more effective anti-inflammatory treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than prednisone.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 81 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD and randomly assigned them to treatment with either 40 mg oral prednisone given daily for 10 days or 50 mg etanercept given subcutaneously at randomization and 1 week later. Both groups received levofloxacin for 10 days plus inhaled bronchodilators. The primary endpoint was the change in the patient's forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) 14 days after randomization. Secondary endpoints included 90-day treatment failure rates, dyspnoea, and quality of life.

- **Results**: At 14 days, the mean ± SE change in FEV₁ from baseline was 20.1 ± 5.0% and 15.2 ± 5.7% for the prednisone and etanercept groups, respectively. The mean between-treatment difference was 4.9% (95% CI -10.3% to 20.2%), p = 0.52. Rates of treatment failure at 90 days were similar in the prednisone and etanercept groups (32% vs 40%, p = 0.44), as were measures of dyspnoea and quality of life. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with serum eosinophils > 2% at exacerbation tended to experience fewer treatment failures if treated with prednisone compared with etanercept (22% vs 50%, p = 0.08).

- **Conclusions**: Etanercept was not more effective than prednisone for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^111szwkx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years.

Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and ensure proper evaluation of the severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include:

- **Symptoms**: Assessing the level and presence of symptoms is crucial for proper classification.
- **Severity of airflow limitation**: Determining the degree of airflow limitation is essential for categorizing the condition.
- **History of exacerbations**: Understanding past exacerbations helps in predicting future risks.
- **Comorbidities**: Identifying and treating comorbid conditions must have high priority.

The first three points can be used to evaluate the level of symptoms and the risk of future exacerbations. This evaluation categorizes patients with COPD into four categories: A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations.

Identification and treatment of comorbidities must be prioritized, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in their presence. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant stakeholders, with the hope of inspiring future national and local guidelines on the management of the disease.

### Association of corticosteroid dose and route of administration with risk of treatment failure in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114NDCjw]. JAMA (2010). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are beneficial for patients hospitalized with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, their optimal dose and route of administration are uncertain. The objective is to compare the outcomes of patients treated with low doses of steroids administered orally to those treated with higher doses administered intravenously.

This pharmacoepidemiological cohort study was conducted at 414 US hospitals involving patients admitted with acute exacerbation of COPD in 2006 and 2007 to a non-intensive care setting, who received systemic corticosteroids during the first two hospital days.

- **Main outcome measures**: A composite measure of treatment failure, defined as the initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbation of COPD within 30 days of discharge. Additional outcomes included length of stay and hospital costs.

Of the 79,985 patients, 73,765 (92%) were initially treated with intravenous steroids, whereas 6,220 (8%) received oral treatment. We found that 1.4% (95% confidence interval, 1.3%-1.5%) of the intravenously and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.7%-1.2%) of the orally treated patients died during hospitalization. Additionally, 10.9% (95% CI, 10.7%-11.1%) of the intravenously and 10.3% (95% CI, 9.5%-11.0%) of the orally treated patients experienced the composite outcome. After multivariable adjustment, including the propensity for oral treatment, the risk of treatment failure among patients treated orally was not worse than for those treated intravenously.

### Personalized variable vs fixed-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of COPD: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial [^111YdfrY]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD exacerbations decrease treatment failure and shorten the length of hospitalization. However, the optimal dose is unclear.

- **Research question**: Is personalized-dose corticosteroid administered according to a dosing scale more effective than fixed-dose corticosteroid administration in hospitalized patients with COPD with exacerbations?

- **Study design and methods**: This was a prospective, randomized, open-label trial. In-hospital patients with COPD exacerbations were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to either the fixed-dose group (receiving the equivalent of 40 mg of prednisolone) or the personalized-dose group for 5 days. The primary end point was a composite measure of treatment failure that included in-hospital treatment failure and medium-term (postdischarge) failure. Secondary end points were length of stay and costs.

- **Results**: A total of 248 patients were randomly assigned to the fixed-dose group (n = 124) or personalized-dose group (n = 124). One patient in each group was not included in the intention-to-treat population because of incorrect initial COPD diagnosis. Failure of therapy occurred in 27.6% in the personalized-dose group, compared with 48.8% in the fixed-dose group (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24–0.68; p = 0.001). The in-hospital failure of therapy was significantly lower in the personalized-dose group (10.6% vs 24.4%; p = 0.005), whereas the medium-term failure rate, adverse event rate, hospital length of stay, and costs were similar between the two groups.

### Effect of corticosteroids on exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116YxUPz]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Periodic exacerbations of disease severity, which may lead to hospitalization, are a characteristic feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), becoming more prevalent as disease severity increases. Oral corticosteroids increase the rate of resolution of these episodes in both diseases. Inhaled corticosteroids are much less effective at conventional doses and are not recommended as a primary treatment for exacerbations of either disease.

Maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids significantly reduces the chance that a further exacerbation will occur in asthma. In general, increasing doses of inhaled corticosteroids are more effective than placebo therapy in preventing exacerbations, at least until patients become persistently symptomatic and regular users of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Thereafter, the gains from doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy are modest and generally inferior to those that result from adding other anti-inflammatory or bronchodilator agents to the treatment regime.

The reduction in the incidence of exacerbations with inhaled corticosteroids, compared with placebo, ranges from 15 to 20% in COPD versus almost 50% in severe asthma. However, given the impact of exacerbations on overall quality of life in COPD, even this modest reduction is likely to be clinically important.

### Treatment patterns in patients with newly diagnosed COPD in the United States [^1141KxHL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States (US). It is often characterized by periods of intensified disease activity, known as exacerbations, marked by a worsening of respiratory symptoms such as cough, phlegm production, and dyspnea, which typically last more than 1 or 2 days. These exacerbations are linked with increased morbidity, mortality, and high healthcare costs due to the worsening of the disease.

Previous studies, including the ECLIPSE study and a more recent retrospective study from Germany, have concluded that most patients with COPD are not frequent exacerbators in the first years after diagnosis. COPD treatment strategies are tailored based on symptom severity and the frequency and risk of exacerbations. **Moderate exacerbations**: Are generally treated with oral systemic corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics. **Severe exacerbations**: Require hospitalization.

Maintenance therapy may aid in preventing exacerbations. The 2011 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) report recommended treating patients with COPD using a short-acting bronchodilator, a long-acting bronchodilator, or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long-acting bronchodilator, based on disease severity. The 2024 GOLD report for maintenance therapy advocated the use of single or dual long-acting bronchodilator combinations, such as a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) + a long-acting muscarinic antagonist.

Regarding the medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with specific focus on pharmacological agents, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend against using statins for the prevention of exacerbations in patients who have COPD and are at increased risk of exacerbation but do not have indications for statin therapy. The guidelines acknowledge that statins may have positive effects on some outcomes for patients with COPD who are receiving statins for cardiovascular and metabolic indications.

### Systemic corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: An overview of Cochrane systematic reviews [^111eUZgB]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by symptoms of cough, sputum, and breathlessness, which worsen during acute exacerbations. The airway inflammation associated with COPD has led to trials assessing the effects of systemic corticosteroids in COPD, as reviewed in two Cochrane systematic reviews.

In stable COPD, oral corticosteroid treatment, compared with placebo, increased the mean FEV(1) by 53 mL and the mean 12-minute walking distance by 29 meters. However, it also resulted in a higher risk of any drug-related adverse event (OR 7.8). In cases of acute exacerbations, oral corticosteroid treatment reduced the chance of treatment failure (OR 0.48), improved the mean FEV₁ at 72 hours by 140 ml, and enhanced arterial blood gases, although it increased the risk of drug-related adverse events (OR 2.3).

Thus, the treatment of both stable and acute exacerbations of COPD with systemic corticosteroids offers statistically significant average benefits but also heightens the risk of adverse events. In stable COPD, there is limited support for systemic corticosteroid treatment due to the lack of long-term outcome data. Conversely, the evidence supporting the use of systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations is stronger, although further research is necessary to determine the optimal dose, route, and duration of treatment.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112gGHR2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance, it is recommended to use long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

For patients with COPD experiencing dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite dual therapy with LABA/LAMA, the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA is suggested over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA, especially in those with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics, oral steroids, or hospitalization (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

In patients on triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), it is suggested that the ICS can be withdrawn if no exacerbations have occurred in the past year (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

No definitive recommendation is made for, or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics, oral steroids, or hospitalization, where ICS is suggested as an additive therapy (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

For patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations despite otherwise optimal therapy, the use of maintenance oral corticosteroid therapy is advised against (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: Best practice [^114NhHvq]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

A careful medical history and physical examination, complemented by the rational measurement of objective variables, can help establish with a degree of certainty that an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD) is the most likely diagnosis, particularly in patients with mild events seen in the outpatient setting. However, in many patients, the signs and symptoms of an ECOPD, especially if more severe, are not specific. Other diseases may mimic an ECOPD and/or aggravate its clinical presentation. Most of these patients are seen in an acute care setting, and we developed an initial practical algorithm to help reach a more precise diagnosis.

- **The CASE approach**: Complete, Assess, Severity, Establish. This is used for a patient with confirmed or suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presents with worsening respiratory symptoms.

- **Mimicking diseases**: In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diseases presenting with acute worsening of dyspnea and/or chest discomfort may mimic or contribute to the clinical presentation of an exacerbated COPD.

- **Practical algorithm for evaluation**: A practical algorithm to aid in evaluating patients with COPD presenting with symptoms consistent with an exacerbated COPD. Recommendations are based on the most recent available guidelines, consensus documents, and/or original studies referenced in the manuscript. Key indicators include: ABG (arterial blood gases), CRP (C-reactive protein), CTPA (computed tomography pulmonary angiogram), ECG (electrocardiogram), ECOPD (exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^114EwRAi]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States as well as throughout the rest of the world. An exacerbation of COPD, defined as periodic escalations of symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and sputum production, is a major contributor to worsening lung function, impairment in quality of life, the need for urgent care or hospitalization, and increased cost of care in COPD patients. Research conducted over the past decade has significantly contributed to our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of COPD. Additionally, an evolving body of literature has emerged focusing on the prevention of acute exacerbations.

- **Methods**: In recognition of the importance of preventing exacerbations in patients with COPD, the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) developed a joint evidence-based guideline (AECOPD Guideline). This guideline aims to provide a practical and clinically useful document describing the current state of knowledge regarding the prevention of acute exacerbations, categorized by major prevention therapies. Three key clinical questions were formulated using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format. These questions addressed the prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD through nonpharmacologic therapies, inhaled therapies, and oral therapies. Recognized document evaluation tools were employed to assess and select the most relevant studies, extract meaningful data, and grade the level of evidence to support the recommendations for each PICO question in a balanced and unbiased manner.

- **Results**: The AECOPD Guideline is unique not only for its topic, the

### Inhaled corticosteroid withdrawal in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Can IMPACT help [^115SQa5w]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Another potentially strategic marker is the occurrence of an early exacerbation. Indeed, we previously showed that the difference in the occurrence of the first exacerbation between LAMA–LABA and triple therapy is only observed in the first month of follow-up, with equal occurrence in the subsequent 11 months. This suggests that there is a subset of patients who are harmed early by ICS withdrawal, whereas the remaining patients are equally safe when stepped down to LAMA–LABA therapy.

Figure E1 of Han and colleagues shows that early exacerbators (in the first month) represent approximately 20% of the 1,481 patients randomly allocated to LAMA–LABA, whereas for the remaining 80%, the effectiveness is similar between LAMA–LABA and triple therapy. The analysis of Han and colleagues that excludes early exacerbations, rather than early exacerbators (likely the frequent exacerbators), falls short of addressing this issue.

In all, this analysis of the IMPACT trial by Han and colleagues provides some useful information on the potential effects of ICS withdrawal on the risk of exacerbations in COPD. However, the skewed patient population resulted in greatly different results from trials specifically aimed at studying ICS withdrawal. Moreover, by pooling rather than splitting, this analysis fails to identify the key patient groups who could benefit from ICS withdrawal or from continuation. Indeed, stratified analyses by characteristics such as a history of asthma, GOLD grade severity of airway obstruction, exacerbation frequency, and the degree of eosinophilia should be considered.

### Inhaled corticosteroid withdrawal in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can IMPACT help [^112zhS1y]? American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The pharmacological strategy to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), is to initiate treatment with long-acting bronchodilators, namely long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), alone or in combination. For patients with frequent COPD exacerbations and significant dyspnea despite these bronchodilators, treatment is intensified to triple therapy by adding inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). These recommendations have remained quite stable over time, although the 2019 recommendations introduce the use of blood eosinophil levels in the decision to add ICSs.

A global phenomenon, however, is the large gap between these recommendations and clinical practice, particularly in respect to the overuse of ICSs. In the United States, the SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study) found that 50% of patients were treated with nonindicated ICS-containing regimens. The POPE (Phenotypes of COPD in Central and Eastern Europe) study found that over 50% of nonexacerbators were using ICSs, including 37% on triple therapy. Apart from the absence of effectiveness, a major concern around such nonindicated ICS overuse is the increased risk of pneumonia and other adverse events associated with ICS.
