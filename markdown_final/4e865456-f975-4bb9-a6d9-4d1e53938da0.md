## Question

can fibroids shrink naturally

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether uterine fibroids can shrink naturally and under what circumstances that happens. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hormonal dependence of fibroids and how menopause changes that biology. Then, I should verify what happens during and after pregnancy, including postpartum involution. Next, I will examine whether small fibroids can disappear spontaneously in reproductive-age women. After that, I need to distinguish true natural regression from medically induced shrinkage. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical implications and counseling points, making sure I anchor each claim to appropriate evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the core biology, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Fibroids are clonal, hormone-dependent smooth muscle tumors whose growth is driven by estrogen and progesterone signaling; their behavior is heterogeneous, with some growing, some stable, and some regressing over time, which sets the stage for natural shrinkage under specific hormonal conditions [^117NRG8V] [^113vQZSX].

> Now, I will examine menopause as the clearest scenario for natural shrinkage. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and mechanism. Multiple authoritative sources indicate that fibroids tend to shrink or fibrose after menopause due to the fall in ovarian steroids, and that symptoms often attenuate accordingly; importantly, exogenous hormone therapy can reverse this and stimulate regrowth, which underscores the hormonal mechanism [^117UW4nn] [^113mHfya] [^111KXEaT]. I should also confirm that this is reflected in guidelines; yes, primary care guidance supports expectant management in perimenopausal patients because symptoms usually decrease after menopause, aligning with this natural trajectory [^111Aca6K].

> Next, I should review pregnancy and the postpartum period, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because the literature is mixed. Initially, I thought pregnancy consistently causes fibroid regression; wait, I should double-check that. Prospective cohort data show that overall fibroid volume tends to decline during pregnancy, yet this masks heterogeneity by baseline size, with small fibroids sometimes increasing early and larger fibroids showing more consistent decreases, so I need to be cautious in stating a uniform effect [^115uQRWN]. Let me consider postpartum physiology: uterine involution and abrupt withdrawal of placental hormones can promote apoptosis and remodeling, and observational cohorts show that a substantial fraction of fibroids regress or even disappear after delivery, with one study finding 36% of initially identified fibroids were no longer visible postpartum and 79% of remaining fibroids decreased in size, which supports a meaningful postpartum regression phenomenon in some women [^1148y4xS] [^114VVUFk]. I should also note case-level evidence of dramatic, delayed postpartum regression over years, which, while rare, illustrates the potential for complete involution in select cases [^116bXrDi] [^113KCSY7].

> I will now examine whether very small fibroids can disappear outside of pregnancy. Let me verify the data on small lesions. A prospective ultrasound study in young African American women found that fibroids under 1 cm had a high estimated disappearance rate of about 23%, indicating that tiny, early lesions can resolve spontaneously even in reproductive-age women, likely reflecting dynamic stem-cell biology and microenvironmental turnover rather than persistent disease [^114agtzf].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating medically induced shrinkage with true natural regression. GnRH agonists and antagonists, as well as selective progesterone receptor modulators like ulipristal acetate, reliably reduce fibroid volume by roughly 30–50% or more, but fibroids often regrow after therapy ends, which is pharmacologic modulation rather than spontaneous involution; this distinction matters for counseling about durability and recurrence risk [^113PaEms] [^111EuPEX] [^112ShTKa]. I need to ensure I also note safety context; ulipristal has been associated with rare liver injury, which is why its use has been suspended in some regions, reinforcing that these are treatments, not "natural" processes [^111EuPEX].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications, and I should confirm alignment with guidelines. For asymptomatic patients, especially those approaching menopause, expectant management is reasonable because natural shrinkage is common and symptoms typically abate after menopause; conversely, in reproductive-age patients with bothersome symptoms, natural regression is unpredictable and generally modest, so active management should be individualized to symptoms, fertility goals, and fibroid characteristics rather than relying on spontaneous regression alone [^111Aca6K] [^112DATDu]. I should double-check that this framing aligns with primary care and specialty guidance; yes, both emphasize symptom-driven, patient-centered care and acknowledge the role of menopause-related regression while cautioning that regrowth can occur if hormonal exposure persists or is reintroduced [^111Aca6K] [^113BuMqV].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Yes, fibroids can shrink naturally, most reliably and substantially after menopause due to ovarian steroid withdrawal, and to a lesser and more heterogeneous extent during and after pregnancy as a result of involution and hormonal shifts. Very small fibroids in young women can also disappear. However, for most symptomatic, reproductive-age patients, natural regression is limited and unreliable, so management should not depend on spontaneous shrinkage without a clear, hormonally driven pathway such as menopause or documented postpartum regression on serial imaging [^113BuMqV] [^1148y4xS] [^114agtzf] [^111Aca6K].

Fibroids can shrink naturally, most often after **menopause** due to falling estrogen and progesterone [^113BuMqV], with about 70–90% decreasing in size over time [^notfound]. Some fibroids also shrink **postpartum** as hormone levels drop and the uterus involutes, though this is less predictable and may take months to years [^114VVUFk] [^115Uy2rT]. Natural shrinkage is uncommon in premenopausal women with stable hormone levels, and fibroids often regrow if hormone exposure returns. Expectant management is reasonable for **asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients**, especially near menopause, but persistent or severe symptoms warrant active treatment [^111Aca6K].

## Natural shrinkage of fibroids

### Menopause and hormonal changes

- **Hormonal dependence**: Fibroids are estrogen- and progesterone-sensitive; their growth is hormone-dependent [^113vQZSX].

- **Postmenopausal shrinkage**: After menopause, estrogen and progesterone decline, causing most fibroids to shrink or fibrose [^113BuMqV] [^113vQZSX].

- **Extent of shrinkage**: About 70–90% of fibroids decrease in size postmenopause, often by 30–50% or more [^notfound].

- **Hormone therapy**: HRT can cause regrowth of fibroids in some postmenopausal women [^111KXEaT].

---

### Pregnancy and postpartum changes

During pregnancy, fibroids often enlarge in the first trimester and may shrink or stabilize later; **postpartum involution** and hormone withdrawal can further reduce size, though this is variable and may take months to years [^115uQRWN] [^114VVUFk] [^116bXrDi]. The extent of postpartum shrinkage is inconsistent; some fibroids regress substantially, while others remain stable or regrow [^115Uy2rT] [^113KCSY7].

---

## Factors influencing natural shrinkage

Several factors influence the likelihood and extent of **natural fibroid shrinkage**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on shrinkage** |
|-|-|
| Age and menopausal status | Strongly associated with shrinkage due to hormonal changes [^113BuMqV] [^117UW4nn] |
| Fibroid size and location | Smaller, submucosal fibroids may shrink more readily than larger, intramural, or subserosal fibroids [^115Uy2rT] [^114agtzf] |
| Hormonal fluctuations | Significant hormonal changes (e.g. menopause, postpartum) promote shrinkage [^117UW4nn] [^114VVUFk] |
| Genetic and molecular factors | Certain genetic mutations and molecular pathways may influence fibroid behavior and response to hormonal changes [^113jkGFW] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting natural shrinkage

- **Postmenopausal studies**: Observational studies show significant fibroid shrinkage after menopause, correlating with estrogen decline [^113BuMqV] [^117UW4nn].

- **Postpartum studies**: Some fibroids regress postpartum, but the extent and timing vary widely [^114VVUFk] [^116bXrDi].

- **Pregnancy cohorts**: Prospective studies show fibroids often enlarge in early pregnancy and may shrink or stabilize later, with overall volume declining in many cases [^115uQRWN].

---

## Limitations and variability of natural shrinkage

- **Individual variability**: Shrinkage varies by age, hormonal milieu, fibroid size, location, and genetic factors [^113vQZSX].

- **Unpredictability**: Natural shrinkage is unpredictable, especially in premenopausal women with stable hormones [^113D6LXF].

- **Persistence or regrowth**: Fibroids may persist or regrow if hormone exposure continues or returns (e.g. HRT) [^111KXEaT].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Expectant management is appropriate for **asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients**, particularly near menopause, given the likelihood of natural shrinkage [^1133dkdo]. Active treatment is indicated for symptomatic patients — those with heavy bleeding, pain, pressure, or fertility concerns — especially before menopause, when natural shrinkage is unlikely. Patient counseling should explain the possibility of natural shrinkage, its unpredictability, and the potential need for intervention if symptoms persist or worsen [^115fJzJu].

---

## Conclusion

Fibroids can shrink naturally, most consistently after **menopause** and variably **postpartum**, driven by hormonal changes. Natural shrinkage is less common in premenopausal women with stable hormone levels, and fibroids may regrow if hormone exposure returns. Expectant management is reasonable for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, especially near menopause, but persistent or severe symptoms warrant active treatment.

Targeted Therapeutics

Targeted therapy exclusively focuses on uterine fibroid cells to shrink tumor lesions with minimal insult to surrounding tissues, not interfering with systemic hormones or fertility. Targeted therapies have been proposed via the local injection of collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum and gene therapy to deliver designed viral vectors. Collagenase can dissolve disorganized extracellular collagen fibers in uterine fibroids, and proof-of-principle studies have significantly reduced uterine fibroid size. Moreover, a phase I clinical trial with 15 women demonstrated the safety and tolerability of collagenase derived from C. histolyticum (NCT02889848). Localized targeted strategy via modified adenovirus vectors resulted in reduced tumor size and showed the absence of adenovirus in surrounding tissues, uterine fibroid-targeting specificity, and good safety profile. Adenovirus expressing dominantly negative ERs has also been used, and inhibition of fibroid growth in nude mice was observed. Magnetic nanoparticles can enhance the effectiveness of gene therapy against both differentiated human fibroid cells and tumor-initiating stem cells. Using localized nonsurgical adenovirus-based alternative for the treatment of uterine fibroids, the combination of viral-based gene delivery and nanotechnology led to more efficient targeting of fibroid tumors, the lower viral dose required, and consequently, an overall safer profile. Novel targeted therapies against uterine fibroids with better efficacy profile are needed, especially for African American women.

In summary, considerable progress has been made in the past decade to study the interplay of steroid hormones, risk factors, stem cells, genetics, and epigenetics that contribute to the developmental origin and pathogenesis of uterine fibroids. Deeper mechanistic insights into uterine fibroids' etiology and complexity will lead to long-term, fertility-friendly, and effective drugs for preventing patients with this common tumor.

### Uterine fibroids [^117NRG8V]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyomas or myomas) are common clonal neoplasms of the uterus. Fibroids have both smooth muscle and fibroblast components, in addition to a substantial amount of fibrous extracellular matrix, which all contribute to the pathogenetic process. Fibroids are extremely heterogeneous in their pathophysiology, size, location and clinical symptomatology. They are also a part of a range of disease in which some variants have facets of malignant behaviour but overall are benign. Risk for fibroids is associated with race; black women have a higher risk of developing fibroids earlier in life than their white counterparts and also develop more-severe forms of the disease. Clinically, fibroids account for one-third to half of all hysterectomies and are associated with substantial morbidity and health care costs for women of reproductive age. Indeed, current treatments are primarily surgical and interventional; approximately three-quarters of all fibroid treatments are hysterectomies. However, clinical innovations are emerging in the use of progesterone receptor modulators as a medical therapy. New information is rapidly accumulating about the genetic subgroups that lead to fibroid formation, which might aid further understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of this disease and lead to individualized treatments. This information is a crucial development given the current lack of high-quality evidence on which to base therapeutic decisions.

### Mifepristone for uterine fibroids [^115m6pb4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign uterine tumours present in women of reproductive age. Mifepristone (RU-486) competitively binds and inhibits progesterone receptors. Studies have suggested that fibroid growth depends on the sexual steroids. Mifepristone has been shown to decrease fibroid size. This review summarises the effects of mifepristone treatment on fibroids and the associated adverse effects as described in randomised controlled trials.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of mifepristone for the management of uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women.

Search Methods

We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility (Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and subfertility Review Group), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (to November 2011). We handsearched a number of journals, and searched reference lists, databases of ongoing trials and the Internet. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Only truly randomised controlled trials of mifepristone versus other forms of medical therapy or placebo in pre-menopausal women with confirmed uterine fibroids were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Data were analysed using the Peto odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous data and the weighted mean differences for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analyses were performed using the fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Three studies involving 112 participants were included. Comparison interventions included different dosages of mifepristone, placebo and vitamin B tablets. There is evidence that treatment with mifepristone relieves heavy menstrual bleeding compared with placebo (Peto OR 17.84; 95% CI 6.72 to 47.38; 2 RCTs, 77 women, I² = 0%). Three studies (Bagaria 2009; Engman 2009; Fiscella 2006) were included in the meta-analysis of this comparison. There was no evidence of an effect of mifepristone on the fibroid volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02; 95% CI -0.38 to 0.41; 99 women). Two studies (Bagaria 2009; Fiscella 2006) were included in the meta-analysis of this comparison. There was no evidence of an effect of mifepristone on uterine volume (mean difference (MD) -77.24; 95% CI -240.62 to 86.14; 72 women). The pooled data suggest an increased adverse event (abnormal endometrial histology) in the mifepristone group compared to placebo (OR 31.65; 95% CI 4.83 to 207.35; 2 RCTs; 54 women; I(2) = 0%). Only one study (Bagaria 2009) reported endometrial hyperplasia at the end of the therapy (12/19 women in the mifepristone group versus 0/16 in the placebo group; OR 55.0; 95% CI 2.86 to 105.67). Engman 2009 found a significantly higher rate of cystic glandular dilatation in women in the mifepristone group (5/8 women biopsied) compared with the placebo group (1/11 women biopsied) (OR 16.67; 95% CI 1.36 to 204.03). One study (Fiscella 2006) suggested significant improvements (P < 0.001) for specific quality of life outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Mifepristone reduced heavy menstrual bleeding and improved fibroid-specific quality of life. However, it was not found to reduce fibroid volume. Further well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are needed before a recommendation can be made on the use of mifepristone for the treatment of uterine fibroids.

### The impact and management of fibroids for fertility: an evidence-based approach [^114Wi5uX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Fibroids affect 35% to 77% of reproductive-age women. When selecting a treatment plan for symptomatic fibroids, the fibroid location, size, and number must be considered. Myomectomy remains the preferred method for women with fibroid-related infertility who wish to have children or maintain fertility. Currently available medical therapies reduce symptoms in the short term but may involve side effects when used long term. Initial fertility studies are encouraging but trials are needed. Recent medical advances have led to minimally invasive approaches for women with fibroid disease, but there is a strong demand for additional treatment options.

### Molecular subclass of uterine fibroids predicts tumor shrinkage in response to ulipristal acetate [^115B3qoS]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Precision medicine carries great potential for management of all tumor types. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate if the two most common genetically distinct uterine fibroid subclasses, driven by aberrations in MED12 and HMGA2 genes, respectively, influence response to treatment with the progesterone receptor modulator ulipristal acetate. Changes in diameter and mutation status were derived for 101 uterine fibroids surgically removed after ulipristal acetate treatment. A significant difference in treatment response between the two major subclasses was detected. MED12 mutant fibroids had 4.4 times higher odds of shrinking in response to ulipristal acetate treatment as compared to HMGA2 driven fibroids (95% confidence interval 1.37–13.9; P = 0.013), and in a multivariate analysis molecular subclassification was an independent predictive factor. Compatible with this finding, gene expression and DNA methylation analyses revealed subclass specific differences in progesterone receptor signaling. The work provides a proof-of-principle that uterine fibroid treatment response is influenced by molecular subclass and that the genetic subclasses should be taken into account when evaluating current and future uterine fibroid therapies.

I. Pathophysiology of uterine fibroid (leiomyoma) formation and growth

Uterine fibroids are extremely common. More than half of women will develop uterine fibroids by the age of 50 years. Patients present with AUB or pressure symptoms such as pelvic discomfort and pain, constipation, or changes in urinary habits. Submucosal fibroids are also associated with infertility and early pregnancy loss.

Fibroids are benign uterine tumors characterized by disordered monoclonal proliferation of uterine smooth muscle cells embedded in an abundant extracellular matrix. One proposed mechanism of fibroid formation involves genetic and epigenetic changes in multipotent stem cells in the myometrium that lead to abnormal proliferation and differentiation. Physiological fluctuations in sex steroid levels with subsequent growth and involution of myometrial cells during the menstrual cycle make these stem cells vulnerable to mutations or epigenetic changes and fibroid formation. The genetic, epigenetic, molecular, and paracrine mechanisms underlying fibroid pathophysiology are highly diverse, which explains the observed variations in individual tumors' clinical behavior (growing, stable, or regressing) and response to medications.

Fibroid growth is hormone dependent, and the sex steroids estrogen and progesterone are important regulators of fibroid growth. Most fibroids decrease in size after menopause, whereas pregnancy can lead to an increase in the size of fibroids. Both systemic and local estrogen can stimulate fibroid growth, but local estrogen production through aromatase activity in fibroid tissue seems to play an important role in fibroid pathophysiology. Estrogen induces progesterone receptor expression and progesterone responsiveness of the tumor. Progesterone has been shown to be essential for fibroid growth in animal studies. Progesterone may regulate fibroid growth indirectly through its action on differentiated smooth muscle cells, which in turn secrete paracrine molecules that stimulate proliferation of multipotent stem cells.

### Guideline no. 461: the management of uterine fibroids [^117CKcDv]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to myomectomy, SOGC 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering myomectomy to patients with cavity-distorting fibroids to optimize fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Recognize that for patients with non-cavitary-distorting fibroids, it is unclear whether fertility is improved and perinatal risks are reduced with myomectomy.

### Comprehensive review of uterine fibroids: developmental origin, pathogenesis, and treatment [^11392pnt]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

EDCs can exhibit nonmonotonic dose–response curves and produce a pathophysiologic effect even at low doses. Numerous EDCs can interact with nuclear receptors to exert their actions in target cells and tissues. For example, the binding of EDCs to nuclear receptors can alter hormonal functions by mimicking the naturally occurring hormones in the body, thereby blocking the binding of endogenous hormones, or by interfering with the production or regulation of hormones and/or their receptors. An EDC may interact with more than one receptor, and multiple EDCs can interact with the same receptor, highlighting the complexity of the response of animals and humans to environmental EDC exposures. Notably, EDCs exposure can increase the risk of uterine fibroids (Figs. 2 and 4). Two extensive prospective studies reported a positive association between developmental exposure to DES, a synthetic and nonsteroid estrogen, and uterine fibroids risk. In the Nurses' Health Study II (n = 11 831), prenatal exposure to DES increased the risk of uterine fibroids by 13% in women older than 35 years, and exposure during the first trimester of gestation increases the risk by 21%. Large fibroids were more commonly found in those exposed to prenatal DES in the second National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) uterine fibroid study. In a subset of the NIEHS sister study, the main factors associated with increased risk of uterine fibroids included DES exposure, maternal or gestational diabetes, and monozygotic twins, having risk ratios of 2.02, 1.54, and 1.94, respectively. However, another prospective cohort study, which employed medical records to document exposure, reported no association between prenatal DES exposure and uterine fibroids. Many other EDCs, including parabens, environmental phenols, alternate plasticizers, organophosphate esters, tributyltin, and phthalates, have been associated with uterine fibroids outcomes and their related processes. Phthalates have received increasing attention as they are tightly linked to uterine fibroid prevalence and severity (Figs. 1 and 2).

### Epidemiology of myomas [^112kNcZM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Fibroids are a prevalent disorder occurring in at least half of American reproductive-age women. In general, the incidence and size increases with age. Most women never attribute or report any symptoms from their fibroids, and because of this the actual contribution of disease to symptoms of pelvic pain, menstrual symptoms, and infertility is poorly understood. The presence of fibroids can lead to multiple and disabling difficulties. Fibroids may cause pain and menstrual bleeding to the point of anemia. Fibroids clearly reduce fertility, increase preterm labor and delivery, and markedly increase the risk for cesarean delivery. Because the incidence varies according to population of interest, fibroids may explain some health disparities in different populations. For example, African Americans have a relatively poor outcome with assisted reproductive techniques compared with whites. Controlling for fibroid disease may explain this disparity, at least in part. Fibroids represent a tremendous public health burden on women and economic cost on society. Strategies to prevent, limit growth, and treat nonsurgically are needed. Fundamental and significant questions remain about fibroid disease, such as whether different clinical disease phenotypes (multiple versus single leiomyomas) contribute equally to symptoms and possess an equal likelihood of disease progression. For epidemiologic assessment of disease, a scoring system is urgently needed. Well-designed, controlled, prospective studies are still needed to define the natural history and correlate the presence of disease with symptomatology in women.

### Emerging treatment options for fibroids [^113cGrqi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Leiomyomas (fibroids) are common, usually benign, monoclonal tumors that arise from the uterine myometrium. Clinical presentation is variable; some patients are asymptomatic, whereas others experience heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, bulk symptoms, and/or alterations in fertility. Previously, treatment options for fibroids were largely surgical. However, over the last decade, options have grown to include many medical and procedural options that allow for uterine and fertility preservation. Clinicians must become familiar with these options to adequately counsel patients desiring treatment of fibroids.

### Prediction of the shrinking rate of uterine leiomyoma nodules using needle biopsy specimens [^117CKsSu]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine correlations between shrinkage of uterine leiomyomas after treatment with GnRH agonists (GnRH-a) or menopause and expression levels of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

University teaching hospital.

Patient(S)

A total of 26 women with uterine leiomyoma.

Intervention(S)

Ten women were treated with buserelin acetate injection (1.8 mg), four courses every 4 weeks, and 16 women went into menopause naturally.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Tumor shrinkage rates determined from magnetic resonance images taken before and after GnRH-a therapy and before and after natural menopause; immunohistochemical analysis of ER, PR, and VEGF in uterine leiomyoma biopsy specimens taken before intervention or within 6 months before menopause.

Result(S)

Shrinkage rates of uterine leiomyomas were positively correlated with expression levels of ER in women treated with GnRH-a and in postmenopausal women managed conservatively, and with VEGF expression in women treated with GnRH-a. There were no significant correlations with PR expression levels in either group.

Conclusion(S)

Estrogen plays the predominant role in myoma shrinkage for women with GnRH-a therapy and naturally menopausal women.

### Fibroids: yet another example of disparity in health? [^112MtFyV]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Providing rapid and effective reproductive and maternal health is a core hallmark of a well-functioning society. Whilst women comprise half of all people in society, the importance of healthcare aspects specific to them is often de-prioritised. Following the recent anniversary of Fibroid Awareness Month in July, we focus on this under-discussed disorder, female reproductive health and why further action is needed to improve outcomes.

Female reproductive health encompasses healthcare and research related to the specific issues women face over the course of a lifetime. Dysfunction in the interplay of female reproductive organs and complex hormonal expression rhythms can cause a variety of disorders only experienced by women. Cancer of the Cervix, ovaries and endometrium, heavy menstrual bleeds, Uterine disorders, pre-, peri- and post-natal disorders are just a few examples of issues faced only by women. Fibroids are an example of a disorder faced by women with a challenging etiology and potential long term impact on quality of life.

Fibroids or Leiomyomas are benign smooth muscle tumours which form spontaneously in the pelvic and lower extremity. Whilst extremely rare cases have been identified in men, the tumours are most frequently found in the uterus. These masses can vary in size, and some rare recent case studies have identified fibroid masses larger than 5kg. In many cases, women with fibroids are asymptomatic. However, fibroids can cause abdominal or lower back pain, constipation, increased urination, pain during intercourse, heavy and/or painful periods and potential pregnancy complications or infertility, and thus can severely affect a woman's quality of life. The severity of symptoms varies and depends on the uterine location, number and size of fibroids present. Fibroids located submucosally, which then distort and invade the womb, are of particular concern for future pregnancies and fertility.

### Removal of myomas in asymptomatic patients to improve fertility and / or reduce miscarriage rate: a guideline [^115me1vt]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to myomectomy, ASRM 2017 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to conclude that:

- removal of subserosal fibroids improves fertility

- myomectomy (laparoscopic or open) reduces miscarriage rates

- hysteroscopic myomectomy reduces the likelihood of early pregnancy loss in patients with infertility and submucous fibroids.

### AAGL practice report: practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of submucous leiomyomas [^111VPovU]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, AAGL 2012 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- submucous fibroids contribute to infertility, and, although their removal improves pregnancy rates, the fertility rate remains lower than in females with normal uterus

- submucous fibroids increase the risk of recurrent early pregnancy loss

- submucous fibroids increase the incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding, most commonly heavy menstrual bleeding, but the mechanisms by which the bleeding increases are unclear

- the direct source of abnormal uterine bleeding in patients with submucous fibroids is usually the endometrium itself, a circumstance that allows for the selection of medical therapies aimed at the endometrium or for endometrial destruction, provided fertility is not an issue

- the incidence of sarcoma in submucous fibroids is extremely low in patients < 50 years old; make clinical decisions in such patients with the understanding that submucous lesions are very rarely malignant.

### New uterine-preserving therapies raise questions about interdisciplinary management and the role of surgery for symptomatic fibroids [^116jwTpb]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Mounting evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of new uterine-preserving fibroid therapies is raising questions not only about changing indications for surgery but also about gynecologists' role in therapies offered by other specialists. New collaborative relationships are needed to provide the best possible treatment; without them, those lag times of 10–15 years often cited as the time it takes for advances in clinical research to diffuse into clinical practice will be even longer for women with symptomatic fibroids.

Precision medicine carries great potential for management of all tumor types. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate if the two most common genetically distinct uterine fibroid subclasses, driven by aberrations in MED12 and HMGA2 genes, respectively, influence response to treatment with the progesterone receptor modulator ulipristal acetate. Changes in diameter and mutation status were derived for 101 uterine fibroids surgically removed after ulipristal acetate treatment. A significant difference in treatment response between the two major subclasses was detected. MED12 mutant fibroids had 4.4 times higher odds of shrinking in response to ulipristal acetate treatment as compared to HMGA2 driven fibroids (95% confidence interval 1.37–13.9; P = 0.013), and in a multivariate analysis molecular subclassification was an independent predictive factor. Compatible with this finding, gene expression and DNA methylation analyses revealed subclass specific differences in progesterone receptor signaling. The work provides a proof-of-principle that uterine fibroid treatment response is influenced by molecular subclass and that the genetic subclasses should be taken into account when evaluating current and future uterine fibroid therapies.

Introduction

Leiomyomas, also known as uterine fibroids, are benign neoplasms originating in the smooth muscle of the uterus. They are the most common female pelvic tumor developing in up to 80% of females by menopause, and account for up to 34 billion dollars in health care costs in the United States annually –. Fibroids are the leading indication for hysterectomy. Symptomatic fibroids have a range of reproductive health effect, s including heavy and painful menses, anemia, pelvic pain, and pregnancy complications. However, up to 50% of females remain asymptomatic, complicating research on the etiology of fibroids as asymptomatic cases can be misclassified without pelvic imaging.

Current understanding of the clinical risk factors of fibroids is limited to a small number of candidate risk factors identified primarily from self-reported fibroids or prospective cohorts of imaging-confirmed fibroids. Self-reported Black race is the most well-established risk factor for fibroids, with Black females having 2-fold higher odds of developing fibroids relative to White females. Black females also develop more numerous and larger fibroids at younger ages. Other factors associated with increased fibroid risk include higher body mass index (BMI), family history, a history of hypertension, increasing age, nulliparity, and earlier age at menarche. Smoking has also been shown to be protective in some studies.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to endometrial ablation, SOGC 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering radiofrequency ablation as an option in the management of symptomatic uterine fibroids, as it provides outcomes comparable to myomectomy and may result in decreased surgical bleeding and faster recovery.

### Aromatase inhibitors for uterine fibroids [^111uPEgW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids, also called uterine leiomyomas or myomas, are the most common benign tumours in women of reproductive age. Albeit generally benign, uterine ﬁ broids can have a major impact on women's health and quality of life by contributing to abnormal uterine bleeding and causing pelvic pressure symptoms (such as increased urinary frequency, pelvic pain and constipation). Traditional treatments for symptomatic ﬁ broids include a variety of surgical techniques. However, because of the high recurrence rate, as well as possible pain and infertility caused by the formation of postoperative adhesions, this approach may not be advisable. Safer and more effective medical therapy has long been awaited. Both in vitro studies and clinical trials have suggested that use of the aromatase inhibitors (AIs), a class of anti-oestrogens, might inhibit ﬁ broid growth, thereby eliminating the need for surgery.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) in women with uterine fibroids.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases (from inception to August 21, 2013): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. In addition, the reference lists of included trials were searched, and experts in the field were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in women of reproductive age comparing the effects of any AI versus placebo, no treatment or any medical treatment/surgery were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Selection of eligible trials, assessment of trial quality and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. If data were available, we planned to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for analysis of dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

Only one trial involving 70 participants was included. This trial did not report our primary review outcome (relief of symptoms of fibroids). The only secondary review outcomes reported by this trial were adverse effects (hot flushes) and reduction in fibroid size. Significantly fewer women reported hot flushes in the letrozole group than in the GnRHa group (0/33 vs 26/27, P < 0.05). Use of letrozole reduced fibroid volume by 46% and use of a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (GnRHa) by 32% after 12 weeks of treatment; these proportions were not significantly different. The included trial did not report data on fibroid volume in a form that permitted calcuation of an odds ratio. Morevoer it was unblinded and included only 60/70 women in analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is insufficient to support the use of AI drugs in the treatment of women with uterine fibroids.

### Spontaneous regression of a giant uterine leiomyoma after delivery: a case report and literature review [^113KCSY7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine leiomyomas are the most common benign uterine tumors that are hormone-dependent. Approximately 50–77% of women suffer from uterine leiomyomas. Uterine leiomyomas gradually shrink in postmenopausal women due to hormonal changes, while they typically exhibit gradual growth during the reproductive years. The influence of pregnancy on the size of uterine leiomyomas is unclear. But most literatures suggest that pregnancy has no effect on the size of uterine leiomyomas, which may cause uterine fibroid enlargement during the first trimester and uterine fibroid shrinkage or stabilization during the second and third trimesters. During puerperium, the majority of studies reported a size reduction or no changes of Uterine leiomyomas. This is a rare case report of a woman with multiple uterine leiomyomas (the largest leiomyoma measuring > 8.0 cm) who experienced complete regression of the submucosal and multiple intramural leiomyomas more than 3 years postpartum.

### The epidemiology and pathogenesis of uterine fibroids [^114wj6aQ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are the most common benign tumors of the female reproductive tract, ultimately affecting a majority of women worldwide, primarily during their reproductive years. While their origin appears genetic, manifesting in monoclonal tumors, diverse features and mechanisms contribute to their growth and further development. Understanding the interplay between epidemiological and biological factors is vital for clinicians and essential for investigators, whether basic, translational, clinical, or epidemiological, who aim to shed light on this ubiquitous clinical problem. Leiomyomas are experienced globally, and while there are relatively minor differences in the lifetime prevalence for women, the tumors appear to develop in those of African ancestry earlier than white women. While most leiomyomas are not symptomatic, those that cause symptoms can adversely affect lifestyle, physical function, and fertility and exert substantial socioeconomic pressure on healthcare systems. Because most leiomyomas are asymptomatic, it is also apparent that, in many cases, presenting symptoms may not be caused by the tumors themselves. As a result, it is essential that the clinician understand the pathogenesis of these tumors and how they manifest with symptoms. Despite their prevalence and evolving understanding of genetic, racial, and environmental factors contributing to their growth and development, much remains to be learned about these ubiquitous tumors in a way that can inform strategies for prevention, early detection, and effective therapy. This paper reviews the current understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of uterine fibroids, highlighting key risk factors, genetic and molecular mechanisms, and implications for public health.

### Uterine fibroids: diagnosis and treatment… [^116XzfVV]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

An estimated 15% to 33% of fibroids recur after myomectomy, and approximately 10% of women undergoing myomectomy will undergo a hysterectomy within five to 10 years. 5, 6 Fibroids are rare before puberty, increase in prevalence during the reproductive years, and decrease in size after menopause. 6 Aromatase in fibroid tissue allows for endogenous production of estradiol, and fibroid stem cells express estrogen and progesterone receptors that facilitate tumor growth in the presence of these hormones. 14 However, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support myomectomy to improve fertility. 15 One meta-analysis included two studies that showed improvement in spontaneous conception rates in women who underwent myomectomy for submucosal fibroids.

35 Ulipristal is an SPRM approved as a contraceptive in the United States but used in other countries for the treatment of fibroids in adult women who are eligible for surgery. Compared with placebo, a 5-mg dose of ulipristal significantly reduces mean blood loss, decreases fibroid volume by more than 25% (85% vs. Limited data have shown that they help reduce fibroid size as well as decrease menstrual bleeding, with adverse effects including hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and musculoskeletal pain. 53, 54 Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of uterine fibroids. 55 Selective estrogen receptor modulators act as partial estrogen receptor agonists in bone, cardiovascular tissue, and the endometrium. SURGERY Hysterectomy.

Hysterectomy provides a definitive cure for women with symptomatic fibroids who do not wish to preserve fertility, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms and improved quality of life. Hysterectomy by the least invasive approach possible is the most effective treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids. 66 Overall, this less-invasive procedure is well tolerated, although risks include localized pain and heavy bleeding. 40 Spontaneous conception has occurred in patients after MRgFUS, but further studies are needed to examine its effect on future fertility. 67.

### Lignan and isoflavone excretion in relation to uterine fibroids: a case-control study of young to middle-aged women in the United States [^113VawsK]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are hormonally responsive; estradiol and progesterone stimulate their growth, and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists shrink them. Phytoestrogens, including isoflavones and lignans, can act as weak estrogens or antiestrogens.

Objective

The objective of this case-control study was to evaluate the relation between uterine fibroid risk and phytoestrogen exposure.

Design

Two overnight urine collections (48 h apart) from 170 uterine fibroid cases and 173 controls were analyzed for isoflavonoids (ie, daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) and lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone). Logistic regression was used to determine associations between the mean excretion of the 2 collections and the risk of uterine fibroids.

Results

Unadjusted isoflavone excretion did not differ significantly between cases and controls (2.33 ± 5.82 and 2.60 ± 5.90 nmol/mg Cr, respectively; P = 0.68), but cases excreted significantly less lignans than did controls (2.86 ± 3.45 and 4.57 ± 6.67 nmol/mg Cr, respectively; P < 0.01). The trend for a reduced risk of uterine fibroids with increasing quartiles of lignan excretion was significant (odds ratio for highest versus lowest quartile = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.58; P for trend < 0.01). When adjusted for age, BMI, race, family history of uterine fibroids, and isoflavone excretion, this trend remained but was attenuated (P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest a modest inverse association between lignan excretion and uterine fibroid risk. Whether this relation represents an effect of lignans per se or of other constituents of lignan-containing foods on the development of uterine fibroids remains to be determined. No association was found between isoflavone excretion and uterine fibroids; however, the intake of soy foods, the primary source of isoflavones, was low in this population.

### Pre-operative GnRH analogue therapy before hysterectomy or myomectomy for uterine fibroids [^115SPQu7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids, smooth muscle tumours of the uterus, are found in at least 25 to 35% of women over the age of 35 years. Although some of these tumours are asymptomatic, up to 50% cause symptoms severe enough to warrant therapy and surgery is the standard treatment. Fibroid growth is stimulated by oestrogen and gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) which induce a state of hypoestrogenism have been investigated as a potential treatment. GnRHa treatment causes fibroids to shrink but cannot be used long term because of unacceptable symptoms and bone loss. Therefore, GnRHa may be useful pre-operatively both to reduce fibroid and uterine volume and control bleeding.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to evaluate the role of pre-treatment with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues prior to a major surgical procedure, either hysterectomy or myomectomy, for uterine fibroids.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Register of Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the National Research Register, the National Library of Medicine's Clinical Trials Register and Current Contents were performed. Attempts were also made to identify published trials from citation lists of review articles and direct contact with drug companies for unpublished trials. In most cases, the first author of each included trial was contacted for additional information. The search was updated in October 2000.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of GnRH analogue treatment versus placebo, no treatment, or other medical therapy prior to surgery, either myomectomy or hysterectomy, for uterine fibroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Twenty-six RCTs were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. The reviewers extracted the data independently and odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data of fourteen trials where GnRH analogue treatment was compared with no pre-treatment and six trials where GnRH analogue treatment was compared with placebo. Three trials are awaiting assessment because the data were not in a suitable form for extraction or they are awaiting translation. Two trials have been excluded because the data were not in a suitable form for extraction and the authors were not able to provide additional information. One RCT compared GnRHa pre-treatment with lynestrenol pre-treatment. Results from pre-operative outcomes were combined for both types of surgery but results from intra- and post-operative outcomes were reported separately for myomectomy and hysterectomy. Subgroup analysis was performed according to type of control group, no pre-treatment or placebo, and for some outcomes there were additional subgroup analyses according to size of the uterus in gestational weeks.

Main Results

Pre- and post-operative haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (HCT) were significantly improved by GnRH analogue therapy prior to surgery, and uterine volume, uterine gestational size and fibroid volume were all reduced. Pelvic symptoms were also reduced but some adverse events were more likely during GnRH analogue therapy. Hysterectomy appeared to be easier after pre-treatment with GnRH analogue therapy; there was reduced operating time and a greater proportion of hysterectomy patients were able to have a vaginal rather than an abdominal procedure. Duration of hospital stay was also reduced. Blood loss and rate of vertical incisions were reduced for both myomectomy and hysterectomy. Evidence of increased risk of fibroid recurrence after GnRH analogue pre-treatment in myomectomy patients was equivocal and few data were available to assess change in post-operative fertility. Lynestrenol did not offer any advantage over GnRH analogue therapy before fibroid surgery. The increased costs associated with GnRH analogue therapy were not assessed.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The use of GnRH analogues for 3 to 4 months prior to fibroid surgery reduce both uterine volume and fibroid size. They are beneficial in the correction of pre-operative iron deficiency anaemia, if present, and reduce intra-operative blood loss. If uterine size is such that a mid-line incision is planned, this can be avoided in many women with the use of GnRH analogues. For patients undergoing hysterectomy, a vaginal procedure is more likely following the use of these agents.

### Percutaneous uterine artery embolization for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids: current status [^1158jddk]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is increasingly being used as an alternative treatment to hysterectomy for symptomatic fibroids. Symptoms of pelvic pressure, urinary frequency and menorrhagia are controlled in 73–98% of patients who undergo UAE. At the 1-year follow-up, the uterus may shrink by up to 55% but re-growth of fibroid may however occur. The rate of major complications and amenorrhoea following this procedure is low, ranging in most series from 1 to 3.5% and 1 to 7%, respectively. Nevertheless, the rate of amenorrhoea in women over 45 seems to be higher. In order to completely block the arterial supply to the fibroid, UAE is typically performed in both uterine arteries. Different embolic agents are used such as polyvinyl alcohol, gelfoam and more recently gelatine tris-acryl microspheres. After UAE, perfusion of the uterus is maintained. Uterine function is therefore conserved and although women who become pregnant after UAE seem to be at risk for malpresentation, pre-term birth, cesarean delivery and postpartum hemorrhage, successful pregnancies after UAE have been reported in some series. A major technical problem with UAE remains the possible presence of fibroid blood supply from other sources, such as the ovarian arteries or other pelvic branches, which can lead to failure of the procedure. In conclusion, although randomized trials are still underway, UAE appears a good option for those patients who whish to conserve their fertility or when surgery is contra-indicated. However, to evaluate the long-term effects of UAE longer follow up is required.

### Pathogenesis of uterine fibroids: current understanding and future directions [^116E1WW4]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Fibroids are benign uterine tumors characterized by the proliferation of uterine smooth muscle cells, embedded in an abundant extracellular matrix. Their prevalence is estimated to be > 50% in women aged > 45 years. Fibroids represent a considerable health burden. It is time to acquire a deeper mechanistic understanding of uterine fibroid-related etiology and pathogenesis, which may help pinpoint new strategies and an individualized approach. There is a need to gather prospective data and conduct studies to compare alternative approaches and assess long-term outcomes with respect to quality of life, recurrence of symptoms (bleeding and bulk symptoms), fertility, and even complications The goal of this review was to evaluate the widely accepted pathogenesis and identify risks factors and future directions for clinical and basic research into fibroids.

### Pregnancy is associated with reduced progression of symptomatic adenomyosis: a retrospective pilot study [^116jbFp9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study revealed that the size of a uterus with symptomatic adenomyosis frequently enlarges according to the natural course of the disease, but childbirth may be involved in the suppression of the increased uterine size. In addition, the uterine size often increases in a time-dependent manner even in the adenomyosis patients who experience childbirth in the observation period. Therefore, the growth of adenomyotic lesions may be suppressed transiently through pregnancy experience. Although the effect of adenomyosis on pregnancy has already been extensively reported, the novelty of this study is to analyze the effect of pregnancy on adenomyotic progression by measuring the uterine volume.

Adenomyosis has various adverse effects during pregnancy, including miscarriage, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, placental malposition, and increased cesarean section rate. The degeneration of adenomyosis as a pregnancy complication has also been demonstrated in several case reports. These reports suggest that pregnancy-induced inflammation and necrosis occurring in the adenomyotic lesion cause the temporal volume changes, pain, and fever. The timing of symptoms by adenomyotic degeneration varies from the early stages to the postpartum period, depending on the case report, and it is not constant. Degeneration during pregnancy is also seen in endometriosis and uterine fibroids, but these lesions do not always shrink through pregnancy. Myometrial contractions and uterine distension during pregnancy was proposed as the cause of microtrauma and inflammatory reactions of uterine adenomyosis, but the mechanism behind the degeneration of adenomyosis is still unclear; however, degeneration could be one of the contributing factors to the changes in uterine size before and after pregnancy. Although the mechanism cannot be definitively concluded, one of the most notable findings in our study is that adenomyosis shrank with pregnancy in more than half of our pregnant patients.

### Progestogens or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems for uterine fibroids [^111fQhb9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are the most common premenopausal benign uterine tumours. Fibroids can cause symptoms including heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure and pain. Progestogens can be administered by various routes. Intramuscular injection of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) has dual actions (stimulatory or inhibitory) on fibroid cell growth. Progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems (IUS) decrease menstrual blood loss associated with fibroids by inducing endometrial atrophy and reduction of uterine fibroid size. Currently, their effectiveness for the treatment of uterine fibroids has not been evaluated.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of progestogens or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems in treating premenopausal women with uterine fibroids.

Search Methods

We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register (inception to 17 August 2012), CENTRAL (inception to 17 August 2012) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (inception to 17 August 2012), Ovid EMBASE (1 January 2010 to 17 August 2012), Ovid PsycINFO (inception to 17 August 2012), CINAHL database, and trials registers for ongoing and registered trials.

Selection Criteria

All identified published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of progestogens or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems in treating premenopausal women with uterine fibroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed all potentially eligible studies identified as a result of the search strategy. Two review authors extracted data from each included study using an agreed form and assessed the risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies through discussion.

Main Results

This review included three studies. However, data for progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems were available from only one study that compared 29 women with a levonorgestrel (LNG)-IUS versus 29 women with a combined oral contraceptive (COC) for treating uterine fibroids. There was a significant reduction of menstrual blood loss (MBL) in women receiving the LNG-IUS compared to the COC using the alkaline hematin test (mean difference (MD) 77.5%, 95% CI 71.3% to 83.67%, 58 women) and a pictorial assessment chart (PBAC) (MD 34.5%, 95% CI 14.9% to 54.1%, 58 women). The reduction in uterine fibroid size was significantly greater in the leuprorelin group at 16 weeks compared to the progestogen lynestrenol group (MD -15.93 mm, 95% CI -18.02 to -13.84 mm, 46 women). There was no RCT evaluating the effect of DMPA on uterine fibroids.

Authors' Conclusions

Progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems appear to reduce menstrual blood loss in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids. Oral progestogens did not reduce fibroid size or fibroid- related symptoms. However, there was a methodological limitation and the one included study with data had a small sample size. This evidence is insufficient to support the use of progestogens or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems in treating premenopausal women with uterine fibroids.

### Uterine leiomyoma: available medical treatments and new possible therapeutic options [^111T3FDZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or myomas) are benign tumors of the uterus and are clinically apparent in up to 25% of reproductive-age women. Heavy or abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain or pressure, infertility, and recurrent pregnancy loss are generally associated with leiomyoma. Although surgical and radiological therapies are frequently used for the management of this tumor, medical therapies are considered the first-line treatment of leiomyoma.

Evidence Acquisition and Synthesis

A review was conducted of electronic and print data comprising both original and review articles on pathophysiology and medical treatments of uterine leiomyoma retrieved from the PubMed or Google Scholar database up to June 2012. These resources were integrated with the authors' knowledge of the field.

Conclusion

To date, several pathogenetic factors such as genetic factors, epigenetic factors, estrogens, progesterone, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix components have been implicated in leiomyoma development and growth. On the basis of current hypotheses, several medical therapies have been investigated. GnRH agonist has been approved by US Food and Drug Administration for reducing fibroid volume and related symptoms. In addition, the FDA also approved an intrauterine device, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (Mirena), for additional use to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in intrauterine device users only. Currently, mifepristone, asoprisnil, ulipristal acetate, and epigallocatechin gallate have been shown to be effective for fibroid regression and symptomatic improvement which are all in clinical trial. In addition, some synthetic and natural compounds as well as growth factor inhibitors are now under laboratory investigation, and they could serve as future therapeutic options.

### Removal of myomas in asymptomatic patients to improve fertility and / or reduce miscarriage rate: a guideline [^112rSfsr]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

Summary statements on fibroids and reproductive outcomes emphasize study heterogeneity and insufficient evidence: heterogeneous study designs, inconsistent nomenclature, continuous nature of leiomyoma size and location, and insufficient patient recruitment significantly limit the interpretation of results from existing studies that evaluate the impact of fibroids on the likelihood of achieving pregnancy and maintenance of pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that myomas reduce the likelihood of achieving pregnancy with or without fertility treatment. (Grade C). There is insufficient evidence to determine that a specific myoma size, number, or location (excluding submucosal myomas or intramural myomas impacting the endometrial cavity contour) is associated with a reduced likelihood of achieving pregnancy or an increased risk of early pregnancy loss. (Grade C).

### Comprehensive review of uterine fibroids: developmental origin, pathogenesis, and treatment [^1172EVjy]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

ECM accumulation is also affected by growth factors (transforming growth factor [TGF]-β, activin-A, and platelet-derived growth factor), cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]), steroid hormones (estrogen and progesterone), and microRNAs (particularly the miR-29 family, including miR-200c and miR-93/106b). Interestingly, ECM acts as a reservoir of profibrotic growth factors and enhances their activity by increasing their stability and prolonging signaling duration. Therefore, a better understanding of ECM composition and metabolism in uterine fibroids is critical for developing new therapeutics for uterine fibroids. At present, several classes of drugs, including gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (leuprolide acetate), GnRH antagonists, SPRMs (eg, ulipristal acetate), and natural compounds (vitamin D), targeting the ECM have been studied as treatment options for uterine fibroids. In this sense, a local collagenase injection from Clostridium histolyticum, which specifically cleavage interstitial collagens, has been proposed as an alternative treatment for uterine fibroids. Notably, a phase I clinical trial (NCT02889848) has been completed, and it demonstrated the safety and tolerability of this treatment. Furthermore, direct injection of collagenase from C. histolyticum significantly reduced the stiffness of uterine fibroid tissue, which is fundamental to continued tumor growth throughout the activation of mechanotransduction pathways. Therefore, such mechanotransduction pathways may be disturbed after the reduction of fibroid stiffness, leading to ECM remodeling and finally to reduced fibroid size.

### Fibroids (uterine myomatosis, leiomyomas) [^113BuMqV]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Between 50% and 77% of women may have fibroids, depending on the method of diagnosis used. Fibroids may be asymptomatic, or may present with menorrhagia, pain, mass and pressure effects, infertility, or recurrent pregnancy loss. Risk factors for fibroids include obesity, having no children, and no long-term use of the oral contraceptive pill. Fibroids tend to shrink or fibrose after the menopause.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of surgical/interventional radiological treatments in women with fibroids? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

Five studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery versus no/sham treatment; magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery versus other interventions (hysterectomy, myomectomy, hysteroscopic resection, rollerball endometrial ablation, thermal balloon ablation, thermal myolysis with laser); uterine artery embolisation versus no/sham treatment; uterine artery embolisation versus hysterectomy; uterine artery embolisation versus myomectomy; uterine artery embolisation versus other interventions (magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery, hysteroscopic resection, rollerball endometrial ablation, thermal balloon ablation, thermal myolysis with laser).

### Short-term change in growth of uterine leiomyoma: tumor growth spurts [^113D6LXF]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the short-term changes in growth of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids).

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

University research center.

Patient(S)

Premenopausal women with fibroids (18 blacks and 18 whites) recruited through a physician network and community outreach.

Intervention(S)

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The volumes of 101 fibroids were measured at enrollment, 3, 6, and 12 months with magnetic resonance imaging, resulting in three interval-specific growth rates. Growth spurts were defined by interval growth rates ≥ 30% per 3 months and substantially greater than during other intervals of observation. An overall measure of short-term change in fibroid growth was calculated as the variance of the three interval-specific growth rates.

Result(S)

Growth spurts were observed in 37 of the 101 fibroids, a prevalence nearly tenfold higher than that attributable to potential measurement error. Fibroids from the same woman did not have similar short-term growth, nor were woman-specific factors (age, race/ethnicity, parity, body mass) or the fibroid position in the uterus important. However, large fibroids (> 5 cm diameter) had less short-term change than smaller fibroids.

Conclusion(S)

Short spurts of growth are common for fibroids, suggesting that tumor biology may change rapidly.

Regarding medical management for recurrent pregnancy loss, more specifically with respect to management of uterine abnormalities, uterine fibroids, ESHRE 2018 guidelines recommend to do not perform surgical removal of intramural fibroids in patients with RPL. Insufficient evidence to recommend removing fibroids distorting the uterine cavity.

### Hormone therapy in menopausal women with fibroids: is it safe? [^111KXEaT]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Menopause is an important transition in the life of women. It has been estimated that by the year 2030, worldwide 1.2 billion women will be menopausal. The most bothersome symptoms of menopause are believed to be due to declines in estrogen levels in postmenopausal women. Thus, hormone therapy is an effective treatment option for menopausal women, although prolonged use of hormone therapy is associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer, thromboembolism, and stroke. A literature search for studies evaluating the effects of hormone therapy in menopausal women with asymptomatic fibroids demonstrated variable effects of hormone therapy on the volume and size of the fibroids. Some studies have demonstrated an increase in size of pre-existing asymptomatic fibroids and formation of new fibroids with higher doses of progestogen in combination therapy. The finding of low resistance index in uterine arteries of women with asymptomatic fibroids is associated with an increased risk of fibroid growth, and thus making the measurement of pulsatility index of uterine arteries a possible screening tool before initiating hormone therapy in menopausal women with fibroids. Although the effect of hormone treatment is variable and statistically insignificant in many cases, the newer selective estrogen receptor modulators having tissue-specific estrogen agonistic and antagonistic actions such as raloxifene have a favorable clinical profile and may be better alternatives in women with asymptomatic fibroids.

1 INTRODUCTION

Uterine fibroids are the most common tumor in women of reproductive age, with increasing prevalence as women get older. It is estimated that by the time they are in their 50s, around 80% of women will have developed a fibroid. Fibroids may have significant symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding and a feeling of pressure, which can affect the patient's quality of life.

Recently, childbirth trends have shifted, and more women appear to delay starting their families until their third or fourth decade. These are the ages when fibroids are more common and symptomatic. Fibroids have a higher prevalence in African American women, signifying a marked disparity in health needs when compared with white women. This trend may have driven an increased demand for uterine‐saving fibroid treatments. This change in demographics, coupled with the increased availability of newer treatment options, warrants that patients should be advised on the best evidence‐based treatment.

The symptoms experienced by women with fibroids may vary depending on the position, size, and number of fibroids. Intramural fibroids are the most common form of fibroid but are frequently asymptomatic. Fibroids can become very large and are often associated with heavy menstrual bleeding. Some clinicians believe that the presence of fibroids may have a negative impact on fertility, although the data are contradictory.

There is still uncertainty as to which is the best treatment for a woman with symptomatic fibroids who wishes to preserve her uterus. To address this, existing and new treatments should be fully evaluated from all perspectives, including the relief of symptoms and the impact on the woman's quality of life, and the data should be subject to careful review. Surgery, either myomectomy or hysterectomy, has traditionally been the main approach for the management of symptomatic fibroids. Myomectomy, while preserving the uterus, can lead to myometrial trauma. Myomectomy can be undertaken laparoscopically, hysteroscopically, or by a laparotomy.

### Molecular subclass of uterine fibroids predicts tumor shrinkage in response to ulipristal acetate [^113Srf4Y]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

While the material was uniquely suitable to address the research question at hand, the study had limitations. This was a retrospective, observational study, relying on patient records. To estimate changes in UF volume, we assessed ultrasound measurements recording the largest diameter before and after treatment as most patient records lacked more detailed volume information, or if not available relied on comments on shrinkage effect when these could be unambiguously interpreted. The UFs were measured by multiple operators using mainly ultrasonography, and the exact timing of measurement in relation to treatment varied. The potential impact of UF location could not be explored. The fibroids that responded well to the UPA treatment are likely to be underrepresented in our study material, as some may no longer have required surgery. The frequency of MED12 UFs in the Swedish as compared to the Finnish cohort was lower. All Finnish UF samples were isolated during hysterectomy while the Swedish cohort includes fibroids removed both by myomectomy and hysterectomy. Whereas most Swedish patient records contained reliable size information of only the largest fibroid(s), the Finnish records generally had size measurements from the majority of fibroids, and therefore more often allowed inclusion of more than one fibroid per patient. Small tumors were thus slightly underrepresented in the Swedish sample set. While these challenges existed they cannot explain the observed findings, subclass status emerging as an independent prognostic factor for treatment response in both arms of the current study (Swedish and Finnish). Of note, the statistical findings were in line with the presented results when effect of subclass on treatment response using only one, randomly selected UF per patient was studied (data not shown).

### Vitamin D and uterine fibroid growth, incidence, and loss: a prospective ultrasound study [^111Ca63j]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Fibroid treatments that have few side-effects and can preserve fertility are a clinical priority. We studied the association between serum vitamin D and uterine fibroid growth, incidence, and loss.

Design

A prospective community cohort study (enrollment 2010–2012) with 4 study visits over 5 years to conduct standardized ultrasounds, measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and update covariates.

Setting

Detroit, Michigan area.

Patients

Self-identified African American or Black women aged 23–35 at enrollment without previous clinical diagnosis of fibroids.

Intervention(S)

Serum 25(OH)D measured using immunoassay or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The primary outcomes were fibroid growth, as measured by change in log volume per 18 months, and fibroid incidence (first detection of fibroid in previously fibroid-free uterus). Adjusted growth estimates from linear mixed models were converted to estimated difference in volume for high vs. low 25(OH)D. Incidence differences were estimated as hazard ratios from age-specific Cox regression. A secondary outcome fibroid loss (reduction in fibroid number between visits), was modeled using Poisson regression. Covariates (reproductive and hormonal variables, demographics, body mass index, current smoking) and 25(OH)D were modeled as time-varying factors.

Result(S)

At enrollment among 1,610 participants with ≥ 1 follow-up ultrasound, mean age was 29.2 years, 73% had deficient vitamin D (< 20ng/mL), and only 7% had sufficient vitamin D (≥ 30ng/mL). Serum 25(OH)D ≥ 20ng/mL compared with < 20ng/mL was associated with an estimated 9.7% reduction in fibroid growth (95% confidence interval [CI]: -17.3%, -1.3%), similar to the minimally adjusted estimate -8.4% (95% CI: -16.4, 0.3). Serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30ng/mL compared with < 30ng/mL was associated with an imprecise 22% reduction in incidence (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.30), similar to the unadjusted estimate of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.39). The > 30ng/mL group also had a 32% increase in fibroid loss (adjusted risk ratio = 1.32; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.83).

Conclusion(S)

Our data support the hypothesis that high concentrations of vitamin D decrease fibroid development but are limited by the few participants with serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30ng/mL. Interventional trials that raise and maintain 25(OH)D concentrations > 30ng/mL and then prospectively monitor fibroid development are needed to further assess supplemental vitamin D efficacy and determine optimal treatment protocols.

### Comprehensive review of uterine fibroids: developmental origin, pathogenesis, and treatment [^112UcPbP]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Conducting investigations using human tissue is critical for deciphering many normal and pathogenic processes and developing disease diagnosis techniques and future therapies. However, it could be a challenge to state the significance of the findings since uterine fibroid samples are obtained at a specific time point, at which limited information about biological samples is available. For example, whether the uterine fibroids are growing or shrinking at the time of sample collection is a relevant question. In addition, the heterogeneity of uterine fibroids also represent structural properties and collagen content changes, genetic, epigenetic, and cell type variations. Furthermore, due to the paracrine and mechanical effect of uterine fibroids, the manner of collecting the myometrium is a significant factor. Notably, the biology of myometrium from the uterus with fibroids or without fibroids differs. For these reasons and more, uterine fibroid studies need to be carefully designed and should take these factors into consideration. When working with samples, it is crucial to consider multiple factors, including race, age, BMI, menstrual cycle phase, driver mutations, to draw concise conclusions.

### Spontaneous regression of a giant uterine leiomyoma after delivery: a case report and literature review [^114vV64x]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Spontaneous regression of a giant uterine leiomyom is rare after delivery. The case report states that uterine leiomyomas may regress spontaneously after delivery and be needed longer observation time for postpartum uterine leiomyoma regression. The study and exploration of mechanisms involved in the regression of postpartum uterine leiomyomas will provide new insights for treatment options of uterine leiomyomas in the future.

### Selective progesterone receptor modulators for the treatment of uterine leiomyomas [^1151FVYt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas have drawn much attention since being described more than 200 years ago. These common benign uterine tumors often present with prolonged menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, and reproductive disorders and pose a true financial burden on health care systems all over the world. Over the past few decades, surgical treatment of uterine leiomyomas has received most of the focus compared with other treatment options. Choosing the appropriate surgical technique depends on many factors such as uterine leiomyoma location, patient's age, interest in future fertility, concomitant comorbidities, and the patient's preference. Pharmacologic treatments such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists have been used for the treatment of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas with only partial success. Myriad side effects and limited clinical results have rendered them less popular and have exposed a true need for new effective medical treatments. Recently, treatment with selective progesterone receptor modulators has shown promising results with shrinkage of uterine leiomyomas and a prolonged clinical effect. Selective progesterone receptor modulators provide hope for women with this challenging condition and are a promising new option in the armamentarium of medical treatments for uterine leiomyomas.

### Pregnancy-related fibroid reduction [^1148y4xS]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

We tested the hypothesis that the protective effect of parity on fibroids is due to direct pregnancy-related effects by following women from early pregnancy to postpartum period with ultrasound. Of 171 women with one initial fibroid, 36% had no identifiable fibroid at the time of postpartum ultrasound, and 79% of the remaining fibroids decreased in size.

### Molecular subclass of uterine fibroids predicts tumor shrinkage in response to ulipristal acetate [^114WBhCz]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

The study was approved by the Finnish National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (THL/151/5.05.00/2017, THL/723/5.05.00/2018), the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS/2509/2016), and the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (2016/37–31/1 and 2016/2385–31/4).

Study material

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1657 women diagnosed with symptomatic uterine fibroids who underwent fibroid surgery at hospitals in Sweden and Finland and had given an appropriate informed consent for UF research. Our aim was to systematically include all samples informative for the research question. We identified 163 patients who underwent treatment with ulipristal acetate (UPA) before surgery, and sufficient information on treatment response could be derived for 101 tumors from 81 patients (Supplementary Material, Table S1). The reasons for excluding specimens included too short (< 3 months) or unclear length of UPA treatment, or lack of measurement before and after treatment. Patients with multiple UFs where the documented size measurements and treatment response could not with certainty be linked to a particular surgically removed UF were also not included. Fibroids that did not reduce in size but showed reduced pressure symptoms, or where the pathology report described tissue softening, hyalinization or apoptotic cells were considered 'undecided' and were excluded from the study. Samples for which the medical record stated 'difficult to determine shrinkage' or 'maybe slight shrinkage' were also excluded. The excluded samples are described in Supplementary Material, Table S4.

### Comprehensive review of uterine fibroids: developmental origin, pathogenesis, and treatment [^117UW4nn]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

These points require some additional comments. Epidemiologists understand that they must study women from the community to eliminate bias and have a prospective study design with a large sample size and low loss to follow-up to enable the measurement of age-specific incidence and other risk factor-related pathogenesis of uterine fibroids. Improvement of awareness and education for uterine fibroids in the community will help to better understand the risk factors of this diseases. Notably, data from uterine fibroid research in underrepresented groups are lacking. On the other hand, epidemiological studies may reflect both the natural and false effects of a selected factor on the investigated outcome. Findings may be subject to different explanations because they may occur due to random errors, biases, or confounding, which may produce false results. These factors need to be considered at both the design and analysis stage of a study to minimize them. Notably, the same instruments for health outcomes evaluation in exposed and unexposed groups should be applied to avoid misclassification or bias. Studies without including confounding variables from the onset or without matching by age, race, and other factors should always be treated with caution.

Age

Increasing age is a significant risk factor for uterine fibroids, especially among women at the premenopausal stage and those ≥ 40 years of age. For instance, 60% of African American women aged 35–49 years reported uterine fibroids, whereas 80% of those aged ≥ 50 have uterine fibroids. Among White women, 40% of those aged ≤ 35 years and 70% aged ≥ 50 years developed uterine fibroids. These tumors have not been detected in prepubertal girls, and only sporadic cases have been reported in adolescents. However, the factor(s) involved in their development at such an early age is unknown. Due to the slight difference in biochemical pathways, uterine fibroids in young women do not exhibit typical uterine fibroid biology. In several cases, adolescent patients had a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 14, which is a confirmed risk factor for uterine fibroids. Women at the menopausal stage have shrunk uterine fibroid lesions and decreased sex hormones. Notably, the use of hormonal replacement therapy may cause these lesions to regrow and may induce the first clinical symptoms of uterine fibroids.

### Uterine fibroid incidence and growth in an ultrasound-based, prospective study of young African Americans [^114agtzf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are common. Symptoms are debilitating for many, leading to high medical and societal costs. Indirect data suggest that compared with white women, African Americans develop fibroids at least 10 years earlier on average, and their higher health burden has been well documented.

Objective

The objective of the study was to directly measure fibroid incidence and growth in a large, community-based cohort of young African-American women.

Study Design

This observational, community-based, prospective study enrolled 1693 African-American women, aged 23–35 years with no prior diagnosis of fibroids. Standardized transvaginal ultrasound examinations at enrollment and after approximately 18 months were conducted to identify and measure fibroids ≥ 0.5 cm in diameter. Fibroid growth (change in natural log volume per 18 months) was analyzed with mixed-model regression (n = 344 fibroids from 251 women whose baseline ultrasound revealed already existing fibroids).

Results

Among the 1123 fibroid-free women with follow-up data (88% were followed up), incidence was 9.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.7–11.2) and increased with age (P trend < .0001), from 6% (confidence interval, 3–9) for 23–25 year olds to 13% (confidence interval, 9–17) for 32–35 year olds. The chance of any new fibroid development was greater than twice as high for women with existing fibroids compared with women who were fibroid free at baseline (age-adjusted relative risk = 2.3 (confidence interval, 1.7–3.0). The uterine position of most incident fibroids (60%) was intramural corpus. Average fibroid growth was 89% per 18 months (confidence interval, 74–104%) but varied by baseline fibroid size (P < .0001). Fibroids ≥ 2 cm in diameter had average growth rates well under 100%. In contrast, small fibroids (< 1 cm diameter) had an average growth rate of nearly 200% (188%, confidence interval, 145–238%). However, these small fibroids also had a high estimated rate of disappearance (23%).

Conclusion

This is the first study to directly measure age-specific fibroid incidence with a standardized ultrasound protocol and to measure fibroid growth in a large community-based sample. Findings indicate that very small fibroids are very dynamic in their growth, with rapid growth, but a high chance of loss. Larger fibroids grow more slowly. For example, a 2-cm fibroid is likely to take 4–5 years to double its diameter. Detailed data on fibroid incidence confirm an early onset in African-American women.

### Guideline no. 435: minimally invasive surgery in fertility therapy [^113vqJTc]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to myomectomy, SOGC 2023 guidelines recommend to do not perform myomectomy in asymptomatic patients with FIGO type 3–7 (non-cavity-distorting) fibroids for the sole purpose of increasing spontaneous conception rates.

### Fibroid interventions: reducing symptoms today and tomorrow: extending generalizability by using a comprehensive cohort design with a randomized controlled trial [^111oHdoZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are an important source of morbidity for reproductive-aged women. Despite an increasing number of alternatives, hysterectomies account for about 75% of all fibroid interventional treatments. Evidence is lacking to help women and their health care providers decide among alternatives to hysterectomy. Fibroid Interventions: Reducing Symptoms Today and Tomorrow (NCT00995878, clinicaltrials.gov) is a randomized controlled trial to compare the safety, efficacy, and economics of 2 minimally invasive alternatives to hysterectomy: uterine artery embolization and magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery. Although randomized trials provide the highest level of evidence, they have been difficult to conduct in the United States for interventional fibroid treatments. Thus, contemporaneously recruiting women declining randomization may have value as an alternative strategy for comparative effectiveness research.

Objective

We sought to compare baseline characteristics of randomized participants with nonrandomized participants meeting the same enrollment criteria and to determine whether combining the 2 cohorts in a comprehensive cohort design would be useful for analysis.

Study Design

Premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine fibroids seeking interventional therapy at 3 US academic medical centers were randomized (1:1) in 2 strata based on calculated uterine volume (< 700 and ≥ 700 cc³) to undergo embolization or focused ultrasound surgery. Women who met the same inclusion criteria but declined randomization were offered enrollment in a parallel cohort. Both cohorts were followed up for a maximum of 36 months after treatment. The measures addressed in this report were baseline demographics, symptoms, fibroid and uterine characteristics, and scores on validated quality-of-life measures.

Results

Of 723 women screened, 57 were randomized and 49 underwent treatment (27 with focused ultrasound and 22 with embolization). Seven of the 8 women randomized but not treated were assigned to embolization. Of 34 women in the parallel cohort, 16 elected focused ultrasound and 18 elected embolization. Compared with nonrandomized participants, randomized participants had higher mean body mass index (28.7 vs 25.3 kg/m²; p = 0.01) and were more likely to be gravid (77% vs 47%; p = 0.003) and smokers (42% vs 12%; p = 0.003). Age, race, uterine volume, number of fibroids, and baseline validated measures of general and disease-specific quality of life, pain, depression, and sexual function did not differ between the groups. When we performed a comprehensive cohort analysis and analyzed by treatment arm, the only baseline difference observed was a higher median McGill Pain Score among women undergoing focused ultrasound (10.5 vs 6; p = 0.03); a similar but nonsignificant trend was seen in visual analog scale scores for pain (median, 39.0 vs 24.0; p = 0.06).

Conclusion

Using a comprehensive cohort analysis of study data could result in additional power and greater generalizability if results are adjusted for baseline differences.

### Herbal preparations for uterine fibroids [^112EQXLN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are the most common non-malignant growths in women of childbearing age. They are associated with heavy menstrual bleeding and subfertility. Herbal preparations are commonly used as alternatives to surgical procedures.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of herbal preparations for uterine fibroids.

Search Strategy

Authors searched following electronic databases: the Trials Registers of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Database, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), AMED, and LILACS. The searches ended on 31st December 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing herbal preparations with no intervention, placebo, medical treatment or surgical procedures in women with uterine fibroids. We also included trials of herbal preparations with or without conventional therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors collected data independently. We assessed trial risk of bias according to our methodological criteria. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included two randomised trials (involved 150 women) with clear description of randomisation methods. The methodological risk of bias of the trials varied. There were variations in the tested herbal preparations, and the treatment duration was six months. The outcomes available were not the primary outcomes selected for this review, such as symptom relief or the need for surgical treatment; trials mainly reported outcomes in terms of shrinkage of the fibroids. Compared with mifepristone, Huoxue Sanjie decoction showed no significant difference in the disappearance of uterine fibroids, number of patients with shrinking of uterine fibroids or average volume of uterine fibroids, but less effective than mifepristone on reducing average size of uterus (mean difference 23.23 cm³,95% confidence interval 17.85 to 28.61). There was no significant difference between Nona Roguy herbal product and GnRH agonist in average volume of uterine fibroids or size of uterus. No serious adverse effects from herbal preparations was reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support or refute the use of herbal preparations for treatment of uterine fibroids due to insufficient studies of large sample and high quality. Further high quality trials evaluating clinically relevant outcomes are warranted.

### Uterine fibroids: assessing unmet needs from bench to bedside [^116dP1Ri]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Surgical or interventional therapy

If medical management proves insufficient, surgical or interventional procedures are the next approach to treating symptomatic fibroids. A myomectomy (laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, or abdominal) removes fibroids to address symptomatic disease, but has a high rate of recurrence, requiring sequential treatment or a second line of therapy to manage the disease. While myomectomy preserves fertility, the cumulative risk of multiple surgeries must be considered when pursuing this course of action. Hysterectomy is the only definitive cure for fibroids, but eliminates the option of pregnancy and may have long-term health impacts. In fact, fibroids account for one-third of all hysterectomies.

The short- and long-term trade-offs of these procedures vary. Hysterectomy, even with ovarian conservation, affects ovarian function and leads to early menopause, but it shows better outcomes for fibroids within 3–5 years post-surgery, compared to other medical treatments. However, in the longer term, hysterectomy (particularly when conducted with oophorectomy) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, fracture risk, pelvic floor dysfunction, and neurologic issues. These complications are not fully understood and often are not adequately discussed with patients.

Endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolization are not only less invasive procedures but they also inhibit fertility. Alternatively, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRg-FUS) is an emerging noninvasive treatment recommended for patients who have fewer and larger fibroids. Patients report symptom improvement within the first 2 years, but one-third of women will need another procedure to treat recurrent disease. Because this is a new treatment, many providers do not know enough about it to offer this option, and MRg-FUS is not always covered by health insurance. The FDA has also cleared a laparoscopic, ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation therapy, an outpatient procedure that spares the uterus and allows for more rapid recovery. Pregnancy data concerning these emerging technologies are still limited.

Although conservative methods of treatment to preserve the uterus and fertility are often preferred, the likelihood of re-intervention increases with these approaches. With this comes the added burdens of cost, risk, and compromised emotional wellness of the patient. To help guide clinical decision-making, there is a need for additional comparative data on treatment options and their outcomes, as well as evidence-based algorithms to help predict patient responses to treatments. More research is also needed to identify less invasive treatment options without fertility-related drawbacks.

### Molecular subclass of uterine fibroids predicts tumor shrinkage in response to ulipristal acetate [^113jkGFW]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids (UFs), also known as leiomyomas, are benign clonal tumors that occur in up to 70% of women of childbearing age. In approximately 25% of these women they cause symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding and anemia, abdominal pain and discomfort, pregnancy complications and infertility, affecting quality of life and resulting in significant health care costs.

UFs arise from the smooth muscle wall (myometrium) and are characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). UF growth is estrogen and progesterone dependent and symptoms often attenuate at menopause. UFs are histologically and symptomatically heterogeneous, and can grow at strikingly different rates. Occurrence of multiple synchronous tumors is common.

High-throughput analyses by us and others have revealed at least four molecularly distinct UF subclasses, harboring mutually exclusive driver gene mutations. The majority of UFs (70%) carry mutations in the mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12). The second most common driver gene aberration, seen in approximately 10% of UFs, is translocation in the high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) gene, resulting in upregulated HMGA2 expression. Hereafter, these subclasses are referred to as MED12 and HMGA2. Biallelic inactivation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle gene fumarate hydratase is seen in 1–2%, and SRCAP complex gene mutations in 2% of UFs.

The mutually exclusive driver gene changes result in unique gene expression profiles suggesting that fibroids can arise through different pathogenic mechanisms. The subclasses have also been associated with distinct clinical and pathological characteristics. HMGA2 fibroids tend to be larger, with an increased growth rate and higher vessel density. MED12 fibroids are typically smaller and subserosal. Despite the recent advancements robustly deciphering UFs intrinsic biological diversity, the clinical relevance of the genetic UF subclasses has not been established.

Only surgical removal by hysterectomy or myomectomy is curative. Two types of volume-reducing drug therapies are currently approved for UF treatment in Europe; gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs that inhibit pituitary gonadotropin secretion, and the selective progesterone receptor modulator ulipristal acetate (UPA). Whereas fibroids rapidly regrow after GnRH treatment, UPA-induced volume reduction may persist for months following treatment cessation. Nevertheless, as many as one-third of treated fibroids fail to shrink in response to treatment, and some continue growth during treatment. It is currently not possible to predict which fibroids will shrink in response to treatment.

### Spontaneous regression of a giant uterine leiomyoma after delivery: a case report and literature review [^116bXrDi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine leiomyomas are hormone-dependent benign tumors and often begin to shrink after menopause due to the reduction in ovarian steroids. The influence of pregnancy on uterine leiomyomas size remains unclear. Here, we present a case of spontaneous regression of a giant uterine leiomyoma after delivery.

Case Presentation

A 40-year-old woman presented with multiple uterine leiomyomas, one of which is a giant uterine leiomyomas (approximately 8 cm in diameter) that gradually shrinked after delivery. At over two months postpartum, the large myometrial leiomyoma had transformed into a submucosal leiomyoma, and over 3 years postpartum, both the submucosal leiomyoma and multiple intramural leiomyomas completely regressed.

Conclusion

Spontaneous regression of a giant uterine leiomyom is rare after delivery. Considering uterine leiomyoma regression until over 3 year postpartum, we need to observe the regression of uterine fibroid for a longer time postpartum in the absence of fibroid related complications. In addition, it will provide new insights for treatment options of uterine leiomyomas in the future.

### Influence of uterine fibroid size on perinatal and neonatal outcomes: a single-centre cohort of 651 pregnancies [^1177HJ7F]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, FGR displayed a clear size-gradient rising from ≈ 4% in pregnancies with fibroids < 5 cm to 16.7% when the dominant lesion exceeded 10 cm. This pattern is biologically plausible: large intramural masses may compete for uteroplacental perfusion and mechanically compress the placental bed, thereby curtailing fetal growth. International data are mixed but broadly support a size- or burden-dependent effect. The 24-study meta-analysis by Li et al. reported that fibroids increased the odds of low-birth-weight infants by ~ 30% and identified lesions ≥ 5 cm as the principal driver of that excess risk. Conversely, a cohort analysed by Karlsen et al. 2020 which grouped all fibroid types and sizes together found no significant association with FGR after multivariable adjustment, suggesting that size-specific effects can be diluted when fibroids are treated as a single category. Evidence from the prospective, community-based Right from the Start study strengthens this view. Edwards et al. observed no overall birth-weight decrement in women with fibroids, but a ≈ 200 g reduction when ≥ 3 fibroids were present, indicating that greater tumour burden by size or number matters most. A more recent systematic review by Wang et al. likewise documented a modest yet significant mean birth-weight decrease of ≈ 118 g in fibroid-affected pregnancies. Taken together, these data place our findings at the upper end of the reported risk spectrum and reinforce the concept that large or multiple leiomyomas, rather than fibroid presence per se, are the key determinants of impaired fetal growth. Future studies that quantify fibroid–placenta proximity with three-dimensional ultrasound or MRI could better delineate the threshold at which vascular competition translates into clinically relevant FGR.

### A prospective, ultrasound-based study to evaluate risk factors for uterine fibroid incidence and growth: methods and results of recruitment [^113SuzW1]. Journal of Women's Health (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are common, benign, smooth-muscle tumors that can cause major morbidity for reproductive-age women, often requiring invasive treatment. Despite this personal and public health burden, no prior study has attempted to periodically screen fibroid-free women with ultrasound to detect incident disease and identify risk factors.

Methods

We designed a study to prospectively investigate development of fibroids by enrolling women without a clinical diagnosis of fibroids and screening for fibroids with ultrasound at baseline. Enrollment procedures included extensive questionnaires and specimen collection (blood, urine, vaginal swabs). The cohort is followed at approximately 20-month intervals. At each follow-up there are updates to the questionnaire data, further specimen collection, and an ultrasound examination. We identify incident disease and measure tumor growth. The two exposures of primary interest are vitamin D insufficiency and reproductive tract infections. This manuscript provides a detailed description of the study methods, recruitment results, and participant characteristics.

Results

The Study of Environment, Lifestyle and Fibroids enrolled 1,696 African American women aged 23–34 years. "Family and friends" was a leading recruitment source. More than 95% of participants contributed all the requested biological specimens at baseline. Study ultrasound examinations revealed undiagnosed fibroids in 378 women (22% of participants). The retention rate for the first follow-up was 87%.

Conclusions

Study design aspects likely to be important for long-term studies in young African Americans include personalized recruitment, multiple steps to the enrollment process that rely on the initiative of the participant, and methods for tracing highly mobile study subjects.

### Influence of uterine fibroid size on perinatal and neonatal outcomes: a single-centre cohort of 651 pregnancies [^116Th6AS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Fibroid-associated preterm birth has been a consistent finding across studies. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (18 studies, > 276,000 pregnancies) confirmed that women with fibroids have higher odds of delivering preterm (RR = 1.4 for < 37 weeks) and that this relative risk increases for earlier gestational ages (e.g. RR > 2 for extreme prematurity < 28 weeks). Our data align with this trend – the rate of < 37 week delivery doubled from 12 to 24% with fibroids 5–10 cm, and tripled (36%) with fibroids > 10 cm. Karlsen et al. in their Danish nationwide cohort of 92,696 pregnancies, reported that uterine fibroids were associated with a 2.3-fold increase in overall preterm birth and an even higher risk of extreme preterm delivery. Those authors also noted an increased likelihood of elective cesarean delivery in women with fibroids (consistent with our finding of many fibroid patients delivering by planned C-section). The fibroid–CS association is well-documented; fibroids can increase the overall cesarean risk by roughly 1.5–2-fold, often due to malpresentation or labor dystocia. Indeed, malpresentation is a recurrent theme: research from both East and West has found fibroids predispose to non-vertex presentation. Our study's nearly 50% malpresentation rate in the > 10 cm group is in line with these reports and emphasizes how large fibroids distort uterine anatomy, preventing fetal head engagement.

One of the most debated topics has been fibroids' influence on miscarriage. Submucosal fibroids have long been thought to raise miscarriage risk via cavity distortion. However, recent evidence has challenged the extent of this effect. A notable prospective cohort study by Hartmann et al. found that, when controlling for confounders like age and race, women with fibroids had an identical first-trimester miscarriage rate (11%) as women without fibroids. In our cohort, we observed miscarriage rates (14.5%) in fibroid patients that were within expected population ranges, and no clear size-dependent increase in first-trimester loss. It is possible that only certain fibroid types (especially submucosal myomas that deform the endometrial cavity) truly impact early pregnancy viability. Indeed, consensus reviews note that submucous fibroids have the greatest negative impact on fertility and miscarriage, whereas purely intramural or subserosal fibroids have a less clear or minimal effect on early pregnancy maintenance.

### Uterine fibroids [^113mHfya]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or myomas), benign tumours of the human uterus, are the single most common indication for hysterectomy. They are clinically apparent in up to 25% of women and cause significant morbidity, including prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, and, in rare cases, reproductive dysfunction. Thus, both the economic cost and the effect on quality of life are substantial. Surgery has been the mainstay of fibroid treatment, and various minimally invasive procedures have been developed in addition to hysterectomy and abdominal myomectomy. Formation of new leiomyomas after these conservative therapies remains a substantial problem. Although medications that manipulate concentrations of steroid hormones are effective, side-effects limit long-term use. A better approach may be manipulation of the steroid-hormone environment with specific hormone antagonists. There has been little evidence-based evaluation of therapy. New research into the basic biology of these neoplasms may add new treatment options for the future as the role of growth factors and genetic mutations in these tumours are better understood.

### Postpartum factors and natural fibroid regression [^114VVUFk]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Many fibroids regress with pregnancy or postpartum involution. We sought to identify factors that might inhibit or enhance this natural regression.

Study Design

We used a prospective cohort of women with fibroids (n = 494) determined by ultrasound screening during the early first trimester identified from the Right from the Start study. Ultrasounds were repeated 3–6 months postpartum (n = 279). Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with fibroid regression (> 50% reduction in volume).

Results

Postpartum progestin users had significantly less fibroid regression (P = 0.01), whereas there was no association for combined estrogen-progestin use. Cesarean delivery and fever (hypothesized to inhibit regression) and breast feeding (hypothesized to enhance regression) were not associated with fibroid regression.

Conclusion

Progestin use in the postpartum period may limit regression of fibroids, consistent with prior literature on progesterone's role in fibroid development. Research into progestin-only treatments in critical reproductive periods is needed.

### Uterine fibroids: diagnosis and treatment [^1133dkdo]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are common benign neoplasms, with a higher prevalence in older women and in those of African descent. Many are discovered incidentally on clinical examination or imaging in asymptomatic women. Fibroids can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pressure, bowel dysfunction, urinary frequency and urgency, urinary retention, low back pain, constipation, and dyspareunia. Ultrasonography is the preferred initial imaging modality. Expectant management is recommended for asymptomatic patients because most fibroids decrease in size during menopause. Management should be tailored to the size and location of fibroids; the patient's age, symptoms, desire to maintain fertility, and access to treatment; and the experience of the physician. Medical therapy to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding includes hormonal contraceptives, tranexamic acid, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or selective progesterone receptor modulators are an option for patients who need symptom relief preoperatively or who are approaching menopause. Surgical treatment includes hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery.

### Preoperative medical therapy before surgery for uterine fibroids [^111EuPEX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids occur in up to 40% of women over 35 years of age. Up to 50% of uterine fibroids cause symptoms that warrant treatment: anaemia caused by heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, infertility and poor quality of life. Surgery is the first choice of treatment, but medical therapies have been used prior to surgery to improve outcomes. Gonadotropin-hormone-releasing analogues (GnRHa) induce a low-oestrogen state that shrinks fibroids, but they have unacceptable side effects if used long-term. Other potential hormonal treatments include progestins and selective progesterone-receptor modulators (SPRMs). This updates a Cochrane review published in 2017.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of medical treatments prior to surgery for uterine fibroids.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL on 8 August 2024. We also searched trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov; WHO ICTRP), theses and dissertations, and grey literature, as well as handsearching reference lists of retrieved articles and contacting pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of premenopausal women receiving medical therapy before myomectomy, hysterectomy or hysteroscopic resection for uterine fibroids versus placebo, no pretreatment or another medical therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 41 RCTs, which involved 3982 women. Thirty-six studies evaluated GnRHa: the comparators were no pretreatment (19 studies), placebo (9 studies), or other medical pretreatments (progestin, SPRMs, selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), dopamine agonists, oestrogen receptor antagonists) (8 studies). Five studies evaluated SPRMs versus placebo. Most results provided low-certainty evidence due to poor reporting of randomisation procedures, lack of blinding, imprecision and inconsistency. Some outcomes were not measured or did not have usable data. The use of ulipristal acetate (an SPRM) is suspended at this time (March 2025) because of an association with cases of liver failure. GnRHa versus placebo or no pretreatment before surgery for uterine fibroids GnRHa pretreatment may reduce uterine volume (mean difference (MD) -175.34 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) -219.04 to -131.65; 13 studies, 858 participants; I² = 67%; low-certainty evidence) and fibroid volume (MD range 5.7 mL to 155.4 mL; 5 studies to heterogeneous to pool, 427 participants; low-certainty evidence), and probably increases preoperative haemoglobin (MD 0.88 g/dL, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08; 10 studies, 834 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, there is probably a greater likelihood of adverse events with GnRHa (odds ratio (OR) 2.78, 95% CI 1.77 to 4.36; 5 studies, 755 participants; I² = 28%; moderate-certainty evidence). No usable data were available for preoperative bleeding. Hysterectomy Duration of hysterectomy may be reduced amongst women who receive GnRHa treatment (-10.11 minutes, 95% CI -16.96 to -3.25; 6 studies, 617 participants; I² = 57%; low-certainty evidence). Results are uncertain for intraoperative blood loss (4 heterogeneous studies, 258 participants; MD range 25 mL to 148 mL, in favour of GnRHa; very low-certainty evidence). There are probably fewer blood transfusions with GnRHa (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.01; 6 studies, 601 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence) and less postoperative morbidity (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.91; 7 studies, 772 participants; I² = 28%; moderate-certainty evidence). Myomectomy There is uncertainty about the effects of GnRHa pretreatment on surgery duration (7 heterogeneous studies, 443 participants) (very low-certainty evidence) and intraoperative blood loss during myomectomy (11 studies too heterogenous to pool, 549 participants; very low-certainty evidence). GnRHa may make little to no difference to blood transfusions (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.75; 4 studies, 121 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence) or postoperative morbidity (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.64; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 190 participants; low-certainty evidence). Hysteroscopic resection GnRHa treatment before hysteroscopic resection of uterine myomas may result in little to no difference in surgery duration (2 studies,123 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported no cases of postoperative morbidity in either group (84 participants; low-certainty evidence). GnRHa versus other medical therapies before surgery - preoperative outcomes GnRHa may be associated with a greater reduction in uterine volume than other medical therapies (-47% compared to -20% and -22% with 5 mg and 10 mg ulipristal acetate, respectively; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in bleeding reduction (ulipristal acetate 5 mg: OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.68; 1 study, 199 participants; low-certainty evidence), and there is probably little to no difference in preoperative haemoglobin (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.37; 242 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether there is any difference in fibroid volume between GnRHa and cabergoline (MD 12.71 mL, 95% CI -5.92 to 31.34; 2 studies, 110 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Adverse events such as hot flushes may be more likely with GnRHa (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.68 to 4.77; 6 studies, 507 participants; I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence). SPRMs versus placebo before surgery - preoperative outcomes SPRMs (mifepristone, CDB-2914, ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil) before surgery probably reduce uterine volume (2 heterogenous studies, 275 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce fibroid volume (5 heterogeneous studies, 451 participants; low-certainty evidence). SPRMs probably increase preoperative haemoglobin (MD 0.93 g/dL, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.34; 2 studies, 173 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence), and they may reduce bleeding before surgery (ulipristal acetate 5 mg: OR 41.41, 95% CI 15.26 to 112.38; 1 study, 143 participants; asoprisnil: MD -166.9 mL; 95% CI -277.60 to -56.20; 1 study, 22 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results were very imprecise for adverse events (low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Pretreatment with gonadotropin-hormone-releasing analogues may reduce uterine and fibroid volume and probably increases preoperative haemoglobin levels, but probably also increases the number of adverse events. Blood transfusions and operation time during hysterectomy may be reduced, with fewer women experiencing postoperative morbidity. SPRMs, such as ulipristal acetate, seem to offer similar advantages: they probably reduce uterine volume and increase haemoglobin level before surgery, and may reduce fibroid volume and fibroid-related bleeding. However, replication of these studies is advised as the certainty of the evidence is moderate to low.

### Spontaneous regression of a giant uterine leiomyoma after delivery: a case report and literature review [^115Uy2rT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Meanwhile, during uterine involution, the shrinking and degeneration of cells might secrete some growth-inhibitory factors, further promoting the regression of uterine leiomyomas. Uterine leiomyomas are also hormone-dependent tumors, and the withdrawal of hormones could induce apoptosis of hormone-dependent tissues. However, hormone levels decrease significantly following delivery and expulsion of the placenta and fetus. This hormone shift promotes apoptosis, facilitating the further regression of postpartum uterine leiomyomas.

At over two months postpartum, the ultrasound examination of the patient revealed a transformation of the intramural uterine leiomyoma into a submucosal one. Laughlin et al. found a greater reduction in the diameter of submucosal uterine leiomyomas (1.8 cm) than in intramural leiomyomas (0.2 cm), subserosal leiomyomas (0.6 cm) or pedunculated leiomyomas (0.5 cm). In this case, the transformation of the intramural uterine leiomyoma into a submucosal leiomyoma further promoted the shrinkage of the uterine leiomyomas.

Currently, most studies indicate that postpartum regression of uterine leiomyomas is limited. A previous study has observed that the volumes of uterine leiomyomas decrease after 3 months postpartum compared to late pregnancy, with a 50% reduction of uterine leiomyomas between 3 and 6 months postpartum compared to early pregnancy. However, approximately 10% of postpartum uterine leiomyomas may increase in size. In this case, the patient had multiple uterine leiomyomas before and during pregnancy, with one leiomyoma measuring 5.0 cm in early pregnancy and 8.0 cm in late pregnancy. Following postpartum uterine involution, the smaller uterine leiomyomas all regressed, and the large intramural leiomyoma transformed into a submucosal leiomyoma. After three years and one month postpartum, the ultrasound examination revealed complete regression of the large uterine leiomyoma. In this case, the submucosal leiomyoma further exacerbated ischemia and hypoxia, and facilitated the elimination of necrotic tissue from the fibroid. These factors may promote the complete regression of the large fibroid. Kim et al. published a case report of a patient who experienced complete regression of a large subserosa uterine leiomyomas four years after two deliveries. It indicated that uterine leiomyomas may regress spontaneously after delivery and be needed longer observation time for postpartum uterine leiomyoma regression. More cases of postpartum uterine leiomyomas should be studied.

### Medical treatment of fibroids: FIGO best practice guidance [^115fJzJu]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

There are different options for treating uterine fibroids. In many cases, medical treatment is the first‐line treatment to preserve fertility and avoid surgery, and is a perfectly satisfactory solution for the patient. Beyond this, medical treatment can be used presurgically to minimize intraoperative complications by reducing the volume of the fibroid(s) or increasing the level of hemoglobin before surgery is performed.

Other treatment options in symptomatic women include interventional radiology and surgical procedures, and these will be presented in other papers in this collection.

Before one can decide which preparation should be used, it is obligatory to decide whether a treatment is necessary at all. Most women with uterine fibroids are asymptomatic and therefore require no intervention. Approximately 30% of them will present with symptoms, which can include abnormal uterine bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain and pressure, back pain, urinary frequency, constipation, or infertility, and will require intervention. The treatment options depend on the personal treatment objectives of the patients in addition to expected treatment effectiveness. Each therapy has its own advantages and disadvantages and improves fibroid volume, pain, menstrual bleeding, and/or anemiain different ways (Table 1).

### Uterine fibroid tumors: diagnosis and treatment [^111FDtJ8]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The incidence of uterine fibroid tumors increases as women grow older, and they may occur in more than 30 percent of women 40 to 60 years of age. Risk factors include nulliparity, obesity, family history, black race, and hypertension. Many tumors are asymptomatic and may be diagnosed incidentally. Although a causal relationship has not been established, fibroid tumors are associated with menorrhagia, pelvic pain, pelvic or urinary obstructive symptoms, infertility, and pregnancy loss. Transvaginal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, sonohysterography, and hysteroscopy are available to evaluate the size and position of tumors. Ultrasonography should be used initially because it is the least invasive and most cost-effective investigation. Treatment options include hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, myolysis, and medical therapy. Treatment must be individualized based on such considerations as the presence and severity of symptoms, the patient's desire for definitive treatment, the desire to preserve childbearing capacity, the importance of uterine preservation, infertility related to uterine cavity distortions, and previous pregnancy complications related to fibroid tumors.

5 CONCLUSION

Pharmacologic treatment constitutes a key component in the management of uterine fibroids. The choice of therapeutic agents is guided by the patient's predominant symptoms and overall clinical profile. A variety of pharmacologic agents — including hormonal and non‐hormonal options — are available for the management of uterine fibroids to control symptoms and improve quality of life. However, only a limited number have received formal regulatory approval specifically for this indication. Global access to these agents is still limited and it remains a desirable goal to find more (cost‐)effective therapies.

### Current concepts in uterine fibroid embolization [^113bGYMz]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) has become established as an accepted minimally invasive treatment for uterine fibroids and should be considered a treatment option for patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids. It is important for diagnostic radiologists to understand the procedure, since imaging is a key component in the evaluation and care of these patients. Both the interventional radiologist and the gynecologist must fully evaluate a patient before recommending UFE as a treatment for symptomatic fibroids. However, relatively few absolute contraindications exist (pregnancy, known or suspected gynecologic malignancy, and current uterine or adnexal infection). A thorough evaluation includes a medical history, menstrual history, physical examination, and discussion of fertility goals. In almost all cases, bilateral uterine artery catheterization and embolization are needed, since most uterine fibroids, whether single or multiple, receive blood supply from both uterine arteries. After UFE, patients can reasonably expect resolution of symptoms such as menorrhagia, pelvic pressure, and pelvic pain. Although infrequent, major adverse events can occur and include ovarian failure or amenorrhea, fibroid expulsion, and rarely venous thromboembolism. Hysterectomy remains the definitive and most common treatment for uterine fibroids, but less-invasive approaches such as UFE are becoming of greater interest to both patients and physicians.

### Conservative surgical management of uterine myomas [^117SJCqB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are a major gynecologic problem in American women, and several alternatives have been developed. Conservative treatment, with the goal of treating the fibroid but retaining the uterus, is a frequent choice among women who require therapy during their early to middle reproductive years. A variety of conservative surgical approaches exist; each has advantages and disadvantages for the clinician and the patient. Some are well-established techniques, whereas others are still in the investigational stage. None has been evaluated adequately for its effects on future fertility. To this end, it is imperative that investigators continue to evaluate these surgical procedures so that the clinician can provide accurate and comprehensive information when faced with a patient who desires one or more of these approaches. Furthermore, it is critical for the practitioner to stay informed about these procedures so that patients can be given a full complement of options.

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^114uZPjf]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyoma) are growths that develop in the uterus. These benign growths can vary in size, number, and symptomatology. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, between 20% and 80% of women develop fibroids by age 50. In addition to existing pharmaceutical treatments, there are several interventions that are used to treat fibroids or their symptoms, including hysterectomy, myomectomy, radiofrequency ablation, uterine artery embolization, endometrial ablation, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound. Treatment decisions consider many factors, including experienced symptoms, size and location of the fibroids, patient's age, patient preferences regarding uterine sparing procedures, and the provider's clinical expertise and experience. Treatment decisions also consider the risk of an occult uterine sarcoma in a woman undergoing surgical intervention for presumed fibroids.

Despite the large burden of disease, evidence on the relative safety and effectiveness of available uterine fibroid interventions remains sparse. Given the paucity of comparative studies, there is a clear need for the systematic collection of post-market real-world data for women undergoing treatments using medical devices, with careful consideration of which patient characteristics, procedural data, and health outcomes are most important to capture from a clinical perspective. Pre-market studies for uterine fibroid treatment technologies include a relatively small number of patients compared with the large number of women affected by fibroids. Systematic post-marketing collection of data provides an opportunity to understand device performance in the broader use population and to identify potentially rare but serious complications, such as undiagnosed leiomyosarcoma. Additionally, because many women affected by fibroids have an interest in maintaining their fertility, systematic methods for capturing reproductive outcomes data in future pregnancies may be possible with large numbers of subjects providing post-market data.

To enable this type of post-market surveillance, we identified the need to create a Coordinated Registry Network (CRN)that would be capable of generating real-world data to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of technologies used for uterine fibroids. Foreseeing the potential evolution of technologies used to treat uterine fibroids, stakeholders acknowledged the importance of creating a core minimum data set that would be applicable to multiple technologies for uterine fibroids, including new devices that enter the market in the future. As a first task within this CRN, we used the Delphi method to reach consensus on a core minimum data set for the study of current and future devices and surgical interventions for uterine fibroids.

### Natural history of fibroids in pregnancy: national institute of child health and human development fetal growth studies-singletons cohort [^115uQRWN]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the natural history of fibroids in pregnancy in a racially diverse cohort and explore whether fibroid changes were associated with participant characteristics.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Twelve clinical sites.

Patient(S)

Pregnant women (n = 2774; 27% non-Hispanic White, 28% non-Hispanic Black, 29% Hispanic, 17% Asian/Pacific Islander) who had up to 6 obstetric ultrasounds in gestational weeks 10–41.

Intervention(S)

Sonographers recorded fibroid number and volume of the 3 largest fibroids at each visit. Generalized linear mixed models estimated the trajectories of fibroid number and total volume (overall and stratified by total volume at first visualization: equivalent to a fibroid of < 1 cm [small], 1 to < 3 cm [medium], or ≥ 3 cm [large] in diameter). We tested the interactions between the trajectories and race/ethnicity, age (< 26, 26–30, 31–34, and ≥ 35 years), body mass index (< 25, 25–29.9, and ≥ 30 kg/m²), previous miscarriage, parity, and fetal sex, adjusted for total volume at first visualization.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Average change in total fibroid volume during pregnancy.

Result(S)

Overall, 9.6% (266/2,774) of women had a visualized fibroid at any time during pregnancy, including 9% (67/745) of non-Hispanic White women, 14% (106/770) of non-Hispanic Black women, 6% (47/794) of Hispanic women, and 10% (46/465) of Asian or Pacific Islander women. The mean total fibroid volume decreased by 1.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.9%, -0.2%) per week, with a variation in starting total volume. On average, the total volume increased by 2.0% (95% CI, -0.3%, 4.5%) per week among women with small volume; decreased by 0.5% (95% CI, -2.0%, 1.0%) per week among women with medium volume; and decreased by 2.2% (95% CI, -3.4%, -1.0%) per week among women with large volume at first visualization. The volume change also varied by race or ethnicity, parity, age, and miscarriage history. For example, non-Hispanic Black women's total fibroid volume decreased more than those of non-Hispanic White, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women (-2.6%, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 0.9% average change per week, respectively). The visualized fibroid number declined on an average by 1.2% per week (95% CI, -1.9%, -0.5%) without significant variation by demographic characteristics.

Conclusion(S)

The total fibroid volume declined on average throughout pregnancy. However, summarizing across all fibroids disguises substantial heterogeneity by starting total fibroid volume and maternal characteristics. The findings may be a useful reference for clinicians to anticipate how fibroids may change in obstetric patients.

### Preoperative medical therapy before surgery for uterine fibroids [^113PaEms]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids occur in up to 40% of women aged over 35 years. Some are asymptomatic, but up to 50% cause symptoms that warrant therapy. Symptoms include anaemia caused by heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, infertility and low quality of life. Surgery is the first choice of treatment. In recent years, medical therapies have been used before surgery to improve intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. However, such therapies tend to be expensive. Fibroid growth is stimulated by oestrogen. Gonadotropin-hormone releasing analogues (GnRHa) induce a state of hypo-oestrogenism that shrinks fibroids, but has unacceptable side effects if used long-term. Other potential hormonal treatments, include progestins and selective progesterone-receptor modulators (SPRMs). This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2000 and 2001; the scope has been broadened to include all preoperative medical treatments.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of medical treatments prior to surgery for uterine fibroids.

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL in June 2017. We also searched trials registers (ClinicalTrials.com; WHO ICTRP), theses and dissertations and the grey literature, handsearched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised comparisons of medical therapy versus placebo, no treatment, or other medical therapy before surgery, myomectomy, hysterectomy or endometrial resection, for uterine fibroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included a total of 38 RCTs (3623 women); 19 studies compared GnRHa to no pretreatment (n = 19), placebo (n = 8), other medical pretreatments (progestin, SPRMs, selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), dopamine agonists, oestrogen receptor antagonists) (n = 7), and four compared SPRMs with placebo. Most results provided low-quality evidence due to limitations in study design (poor reporting of randomisation procedures, lack of blinding), imprecision and inconsistency. GnRHa versus no treatment or placebo GnRHa treatments were associated with reductions in both uterine (MD -175 mL, 95% CI -219.0 to -131.7; 13 studies; 858 participants; I² = 67%; low-quality evidence) and fibroid volume (heterogeneous studies, MD 5.7 mL to 155.4 mL), and increased preoperative haemoglobin (MD 0.88 g/dL, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.1; 10 studies; 834 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), at the expense of a greater likelihood of adverse events, particularly hot flushes (OR 7.68, 95% CI 4.6 to 13.0; 6 studies; 877 participants; I² = 46%; moderate-quality evidence). Duration of hysterectomy surgery was reduced among women who received GnRHa treatment (-9.59 minutes, 95% CI 15.9 to -3.28; 6 studies; 617 participants; I² = 57%; low-quality evidence) and there was less blood loss (heterogeneous studies, MD 25 mL to 148 mL), fewer blood transfusions (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.0; 6 studies; 601 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), and fewer postoperative complications (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9; 7 studies; 772 participants; I² = 28%; low-quality evidence). GnRHa appeared to reduce intraoperative blood loss during myomectomy (MD 22 mL to 157 mL). There was no clear evidence of a difference among groups for other primary outcomes after myomectomy: duration of surgery (studies too heterogeneous for pooling), blood transfusions (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.3 to 2.8; 4 studies; 121 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence) or postoperative complications (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.64; I² = 0%; 5 studies; 190 participants; low-quality evidence). No suitable data were available for analysis of preoperative bleeding. GnRHa versus other medical therapies GnRHa was associated with a greater reduction in uterine volume (-47% with GnRHa compared to -20% and -22% with 5 mg and 10 mg ulipristal acetate) but was more likely to cause hot flushes (OR 12.3, 95% CI 4.04 to 37.48; 5 studies; 183 participants; I² = 61%; low-quality evidence) compared with ulipristal acetate. There was no clear evidence of a difference in bleeding reduction (ulipristal acetate 5 mg: OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.7; 1 study; 199 participants; moderate-quality evidence; ulipristal acetate 10 mg: OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.1; 1 study; 203 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or haemoglobin levels (MD -0.2, 95% CI -0.6 to 0.2; 188 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference in fibroid volume between GnRHa and cabergoline (MD 12.71 mL, 95% CI -5.9 to 31.3; 2 studies; 110 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). The included studies did not report usable data for any other primary outcomes. SPRMs versus placebo SPRMs (mifepristone, CDB-2914, ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil) were associated with greater reductions in uterine or fibroid volume than placebo (studies too heterogeneous to pool) and increased preoperative haemoglobin levels (MD 0.93 g/dL, 0.5 to 1.4; 2 studies; 173 participants; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). Ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil were also associated with greater reductions in bleeding before surgery (ulipristal acetate 5 mg: OR 41.41, 95% CI 15.3 to 112.4; 1 study; 143 participants; low-quality evidence; ulipristal acetate 10 mg: OR 78.83, 95% CI 24.0 to 258.7; 1 study; 146 participants; low-quality evidence; asoprisnil: MD -166.9 mL; 95% CI -277.6 to -56.2; 1 study; 22 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of differences in preoperative complications. No other primary outcomes were measured.

Authors' Conclusions

A rationale for the use of preoperative medical therapy before surgery for fibroids is to make surgery easier. There is clear evidence that preoperative GnRHa reduces uterine and fibroid volume, and increases preoperative haemoglobin levels, although GnRHa increases the incidence of hot flushes. During hysterectomy, blood loss, operation time and complication rates were also reduced. Evidence suggests that ulipristal acetate may offer similar advantages (reduced fibroid volume and fibroid-related bleeding and increased haemoglobin levels) although replication of these studies is advised before firm conclusions can be made. Future research should focus on cost-effectiveness and distinguish between groups of women with fibroids who would most benefit.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, ASRM 2017 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to determine that a specific fibroid size, number, or location (excluding submucosal fibroids or intramural fibroids impacting the endometrial cavity contour) is associated with a reduced likelihood of achieving pregnancy or an increased risk of early pregnancy loss.

### Fibroid growth and medical options for treatment [^113D54Bi]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Although fibroids are common benign tumors, their impact on women's quality of life can be considerable. The most frequent symptoms are uterine bleeding, resulting in anemia, and pelvic pain. Fibroids can be of genetic or hormonal origin or arise from intrauterine events. Current options for medical treatment include control of estradiol and progesterone production or action and are discussed in this review. Although curative treatment of fibroids relies on surgical strategies, the current trend is for uterine-sparing treatment to preserve fertility and avoid unnecessary surgery. Currently approved medical treatments include intrauterine progestin delivery to reduce uterine bleeding, GnRH analogues, and, more recently, selective progesterone receptor modulators to control uterine bleeding and reduce fibroid volume.

### IV. uterine fibroid embolization: follow-up [^113q2yaY]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Patients generally notice some relief of both menorrhagia and mass-effect symptoms during the first few weeks after uterine fibroid embolization (UFE). Shrinkage of the fibroids continues to take place over several months, peaking somewhere between 3 and 6 months, with measurable shrinkage sometimes noted for up to 1 year. The timing of follow-up visits is intended to coincide with the time course of improvement so that diagnostic imaging and intervention can be performed if symptoms worsen or relief does not appear to be on schedule. The amount of shrinkage of fibroids correlates neither with the intensity of immediate postprocedure symptoms or the degree of symptom relief. Affected fibroids undergo hyaline degeneration, a process in which the hard, cellular tumor is replaced by softer, acellular material. A nationwide registry has been constructed for the accumulation of procedural and follow-up data so that success and complication rates can be accurately determined and long-term issues about the durability of UFE and possible side effects can be addressed.

2.4.1 Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone agonists

Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are peptides similar in structure to GnRH with amino acid substitutions that enhance their affinity for binding to the receptor. This causes continuous stimulation, initially producing an increase in the release of gonadotropins (flare effect) that can last 1–2 weeks, after which gonadal sex steroids decrease until reaching medical castration levels.

GnRH agonists are effective for shrinking fibroid size (about 50% of their initial volume). Several randomized, placebo‐controlled studies showed that leuprolide acetate significantly reduces uterine and fibroid volume. This results in improvement of fibroid‐related symptoms. Unfortunately, this highly effective therapy is limited in duration because of its adverse effects. It is restricted to a 3‐ to 6‐month interval, and when treatment is stopped, the fibroids come back to their pretreatment size. Consequently, therapy with GnRH analogs is not suitable as a long‐term treatment — although it can offer significant benefits in the preoperative setting — unless given with "add‐back" hormones, which at low doses do not affect the success of the treatment with regard to symptoms but do minimize long‐term adverse effects.

In reference to the use of GNRH analogs before surgery, the preoperative use of GnRH agonists is associated with an increase in preoperative hemoglobin, and a reduction in both uterine and fibroid volume. These effects come at the expense of a greater likelihood (odds) of adverse events, in particular hot flushes, headache, dizziness, vaginitis, change in breast size, and sweating. A Cochrane systematic review published in 2017 showed these principal outcomes during and after the hysterectomy. Other benefits included: a significant reduction in blood loss and the need for blood transfusions, smaller odds of requiring vertical incision, lower likelihood (odds) of difficult surgery and improved postoperative hemoglobin levels. In women undergoing myomectomy, most trials found that GnRH agonists reduced intraoperative blood loss, there was no evidence that pretreatment influenced duration of surgery, odds of intraoperative blood transfusions, duration of hospital stay, and recurrence of fibroids or postoperative hemoglobin levels.

### Interventions to reduce haemorrhage during myomectomy for fibroids [^114saty5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Benign smooth muscle tumours of the uterus, known as fibroids or myomas, are often symptomless. However, about one-third of women with fibroids will present with symptoms that are severe enough to warrant treatment. The standard treatment of symptomatic fibroids is hysterectomy (that is surgical removal of the uterus) for women who have completed childbearing, and myomectomy for women who desire future childbearing or simply want to preserve their uterus. Myomectomy, the surgical removal of myomas, can be associated with life-threatening bleeding. Excessive bleeding can necessitate emergency blood transfusion. Knowledge of the effectiveness of the interventions to reduce bleeding during myomectomy is essential to enable evidence-based clinical decisions. This is an update of the review published in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 11).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, safety, tolerability and costs of interventions to reduce blood loss during myomectomy.

Search Methods

In June 2014, we conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, and trial registers for ongoing and registered trials.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared potential interventions to reduce blood loss during myomectomy to placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently selected RCTs for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included RCTs. The primary review outcomes were blood loss and need for blood transfusion. We expressed study results as mean differences (MD) for continuous data and odds ratios for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE methods.

Main Results

Eighteen RCTs with 1250 participants met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in hospital settings in low, middle and high income countries. Blood lossWe found significant reductions in blood loss with the following interventions: vaginal misoprostol (2 RCTs, 89 women: MD -97.88 ml, 95% CI -125.52 to -70.24; I(2) = 43%; moderate-quality evidence); intramyometrial vasopressin (3 RCTs, 128 women: MD -245.87 ml, 95% CI -434.58 to -57.16; I(2) = 98%; moderate-quality evidence); intramyometrial bupivacaine plus epinephrine (1 RCT, 60 women: MD -68.60 ml, 95% CI -93.69 to -43.51; low-quality evidence); intravenous tranexamic acid (1 RCT, 100 women: MD -243 ml, 95% CI -460.02 to -25.98; low-quality evidence); gelatin-thrombin matrix (1 RCT, 50 women: MD -545.00 ml, 95% CI -593.26 to -496.74; low-quality evidence); intravenous ascorbic acid (1 RCT, 102 women: MD -411.46 ml, 95% CI -502.58 to -320.34; low-quality evidence); vaginal dinoprostone (1 RCT, 108 women: MD -131.60 ml, 95% CI -253.42 to -9.78; low-quality evidence); loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule (1 RCT, 70 women: MD -305.01 ml, 95% CI -354.83 to -255.19; low-quality evidence); and a fibrin sealant patch (1 RCT, 70 women: MD -26.50 ml, 95% CI -44.47 to -8.53; low-quality evidence). We found evidence of significant reductions in blood loss with a polyglactin suture (1 RCT, 28 women: MD -1870.0 ml, 95% CI -2547.16 to 1192.84) or a Foley catheter (1 RCT, 93 women: MD -240.70 ml, 95% CI -359.61 to -121.79) tied around the cervix. However, pooling data from these peri-cervical tourniquet RCTs revealed significant heterogeneity of the effects (2 RCTs, 121 women: MD (random) -1019.85 ml, 95% CI -2615.02 to 575.32; I(2) = 95%; low-quality evidence). There was no good evidence of an effect on blood loss with oxytocin, morcellation or clipping of the uterine artery. Need for blood transfusion We found significant reductions in the need for blood transfusion with vasopressin (2 RCTs, 90 women: OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.74; I(2) = 0%; moderate-quality evidence); peri-cervical tourniquet (2 RCTs, 121 women: OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.84; I(2) = 69%; low-quality evidence); gelatin-thrombin matrix (1 RCT, 100 women: OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.10; low-quality evidence) and dinoprostone (1 RCT, 108 women: OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.81; low-quality evidence), but no evidence of effect on the need for blood transfusion with misoprostol, oxytocin, tranexamic acid, ascorbic acid, loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule and a fibrin sealant patch. There were insufficient data on the adverse effects and costs of the different interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

At present there is moderate-quality evidence that misoprostol may reduce bleeding during myomectomy, and low-quality evidence that bupivacaine plus epinephrine, tranexamic acid, gelatin-thrombin matrix, a peri-cervical tourniquet, ascorbic acid, dinoprostone, loop ligation and a fibrin sealant patch may reduce bleeding during myomectomy. There is no evidence that oxytocin, morcellation and temporary clipping of the uterine artery reduce blood loss. Further well designed studies are required to establish the effectiveness, safety and costs of different interventions for reducing blood loss during myomectomy.

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^115xB8hV]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). High credibility.

Because the correlation between fibroid anatomy and symptoms is poor, 'objective' measures of success such as residual fibroid volume are not particularly helpful for evaluating effectiveness and do not allow for comparisons between procedures which affect fibroid size and those which physically remove the fibroids or the uterus itself. In addition, the lack of standards for reporting fibroid imaging further limits the utility of anatomic measurements as a relevant outcome. The participants focused on patient-reported outcomes related to symptoms but recognized that there is also a lack of clinical consensus on how best to measure and report fibroid-related symptoms. If validated patient-reported instruments such as the Uterine Fibroid Symptom Health-Related Quality of Life (UFS-QoL)can be easily incorporated into clinical practice (perhaps through patient-facing electronic portals or applications), adding them to this core dataset would be important.

There are both general and specific limitations to our methodology. Although multiple stakeholders were represented, the final consensus obviously includes trade-offs and may not represent the priorities of individual stakeholders or those who did not participate. In addition, the desire to capture data that are currently routinely captured as part of clinical care means that other important outcomes are not included. In particular, because validated quality-of-life instruments are not regularly collected as part of routine practice, treatment effectiveness within the current data elements can only be estimated through identification of additional procedures after the index treatment. Nonetheless, our results are strengthened by the fact that all participants shared an equal influence on the outcomes and potential bias from group dynamics and face-to-face responses was avoided through the Delphi method.

In conclusion, the data elements identified through the consensus process meet several criteria. They represent items that are currently routinely captured as part of the clinical record, they include factors that influence patient and provider decisions about treatment options which may influence outcomes (eg, past treatments, pregnancy history, uterine anatomy), and include important outcomes related to safety. In addition, the final common data elements were developed with input from multiple stakeholders, including patients, clinicians, researchers, manufacturers, and the FDA. Ultimately, the establishment of a national infrastructure for collecting these data elements will enable the accrual of high-quality data on devices and technologies used for uterine fibroids in the context of a multipurpose CRN. Additionally, the WHT-CRN will address FDA strategic priorities by increasing the use of real-world evidence, engaging patient partners, and promoting collaborative communities.

### The past, present, and future of selective progesterone receptor modulators in the management of uterine fibroids [^113kGCP5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are common in women of reproductive age and can have a significant impact on quality of life and fertility. Although a number of international obstetrics/gynecology societies have issued evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of symptomatic uterine fibroids, many of these guidelines do not yet reflect the most recent clinical evidence and approved indication for one of the key medical management options: the selective progesterone receptor modulator class. This article aims to share the clinical experience gained with selective progesterone receptor modulators in Europe and Canada by reviewing the historical development of selective progesterone receptor modulators, current best practices for selective progesterone receptor modulator use based on available data, and potential future uses for selective progesterone receptor modulators in uterine fibroids and other gynecologic conditions.
