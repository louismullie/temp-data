## Question

Labs to draw for a patient that is easily bruising

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to order for a patient with easy bruising. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and distinguishing physiologic from pathologic bruising. Then, I should define the core first-line laboratory panel. Next, I will plan interpretation of PT/aPTT patterns to triage the differential. After that, I'll outline targeted second-line tests based on initial results. I need to consider special populations and red flags, determine when to involve hematology, and finally summarize an algorithm with quality-improvement considerations, ensuring each step is evidence-linked and internally consistent.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing and pretest probability by taking a careful history and exam before ordering tests; I should verify onset, distribution, severity, family history, personal bleeding history, and especially medication and supplement use that increase bruising risk such as DOACs, heparin, or agents that affect platelets, while also screening for alcohol use and nutritional restriction, because these factors can independently cause or amplify bruising and will shape the lab strategy [^112mm21G] [^116rXRpi] [^111cyueF] [^111dWsVc]. Hold on, I should also look for mucocutaneous bleeding patterns that suggest platelet/von Willebrand pathology, and for hepatosplenomegaly or stigmata of liver disease that push the differential toward acquired coagulopathy, since this will refine what I expect from PT/aPTT and platelet indices on the initial panel [^115JGd2S] [^111dWsVc] [^1146F8KM].

> Next, I should review the recommended first-line laboratory panel; wait, let me verify the core tests endorsed for undifferentiated bruising in primary care: CBC with differential and platelet count, peripheral smear, PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen, because together they interrogate the cellular and plasmatic arms of hemostasis and give me a structured branching point for the differential [^1146F8KM] [^117KXGaS]. I need to ensure the smear is actually examined for platelet morphology, red cell fragments, and other line abnormalities, since pattern recognition there can redirect the workup early and prevent missed thrombotic microangiopathy or marrow processes [^117KXGaS].

> I will now examine how to interpret initial patterns; let me think about this carefully. If PT and aPTT are both normal with persistent bruising, I should suspect platelet function defects or von Willebrand disease; if PT is prolonged with normal aPTT, the extrinsic pathway is implicated (Factor VII deficiency, early vitamin K deficiency, warfarin effect, or liver synthetic dysfunction); if aPTT is prolonged with normal PT, I should consider intrinsic pathway defects like hemophilia A/B or the presence of heparin; if both PT and aPTT are prolonged, I need to check for multiple factor deficiencies from advanced liver disease, DIC, or hypofibrinogenemia, making the fibrinogen value and clinical context decisive [^1146F8KM] [^115BQgCV] [^111dWsVc]. I should double-check platelet counts and indices because isolated thrombocytopenia changes the path entirely toward peripheral destruction (e.g. ITP) versus decreased production or sequestration, each with its own second-line studies [^1146F8KM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions when PT/aPTT are normal; I need to check for mucocutaneous bleeding with normal screening labs that still fits von Willebrand disease or qualitative platelet dysfunction, in which case targeted second-line testing should include a VWD panel with VWF antigen, VWF activity, and Factor VIII, and consideration of platelet function screening as a gate to formal aggregation studies when available [^115JGd2S] [^115WeHtV] [^111DbZRS]. But wait, what if diet is poor or restrictive or there are perifollicular changes suggesting scurvy; then I should add a vitamin C level, because vitamin C deficiency can present with easy bruising despite normal coagulation screening and responds dramatically to repletion [^112gpa8r] [^111hUAgZ] [^112joYqQ].

> If coagulation times are abnormal, I should confirm next steps systematically; let me first confirm with mixing studies to distinguish factor deficiency from an inhibitor, then proceed to specific factor assays guided by the pattern, while adding D-dimer and fibrin degradation studies if DIC is suspected and comprehensive liver tests if hepatic synthetic dysfunction is in the differential [^1146F8KM] [^111dWsVc]. I need to ensure heparin contamination is excluded when an isolated aPTT prolongation appears in hospitalized patients, since preanalytical issues can mislead me into chasing nonexistent inhibitors or factor defects [^117KXGaS]. If thrombocytopenia is present, I should review peripheral smear and consider secondary causes including HIV and hepatitis C in the appropriate clinical setting, because these infections can underpin immune thrombocytopenia and change management [^11116SA2].

> Let me consider special populations and context to avoid missing key diagnoses. For women with heavy menstrual bleeding plus bruising, I should confirm whether bleeding began at menarche or there is a family history, which increases the pretest probability for an inherited bleeding disorder and warrants focused coagulation evaluation including VWD testing, while also screening for anemia given guideline recommendations in AUB [^117Tuu1f] [^117RCrqV] [^115JGd2S]. For patients with alcohol use disorder, I should verify liver function and platelet count because alcohol-related liver disease and hypersplenism contribute to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, and pattern recognition there guides the lab cascade and referral timing [^111dWsVc]. For pediatric patients, I must not forget that bruising in nonmobile infants is rare, and I should run a parallel evaluation for nonaccidental trauma while considering medical causes of bleeding, as recommended by pediatric guidance documents, so I neither under- nor overtest for bleeding disorders in this sensitive context [^112FD7bN] [^111ATqoa] [^113frSVG].

> I should confirm perioperative and trauma considerations as well; in major bleeding or trauma where rapid functional assessment is needed, viscoelastic testing such as TEG/ROTEM can complement conventional assays and help tailor component therapy, while recognizing these tests are adjuncts to, not replacements for, the core diagnostic framework discussed above [^116MmcXL]. Let me also reconsider my reliance on coagulation "screens" for predicting perioperative bleeding risk; coagulation panels miss platelet and VWF disorders, so a bleeding history is often superior for triage and may reduce unnecessary testing if embedded into clinical pathways [^115apUhR].

> When should I involve hematology? I should double-check that referral occurs for any clearly abnormal core test, a strong personal or family bleeding history despite normal screens, or the need for specialized studies such as platelet aggregation testing or genetic assays, because early consultation can expedite diagnosis and management in inherited and acquired disorders alike [^1146F8KM] [^111ZHhFD]. I need to ensure the threshold for referral remains low when clinical suspicion is high, even if initial labs are unrevealing, given the known limitations of screening assays in mucocutaneous bleeding disorders [^115JGd2S].

> Let me summarize the algorithm to verify coherence: start with a targeted history and exam focused on bleeding phenotype and modifiers; obtain CBC with platelets, smear, PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen; if PT/aPTT are normal but bruising persists, pursue platelet function and VWD testing and consider vitamin C deficiency; if PT and/or aPTT are abnormal, perform mixing studies followed by factor assays and DIC or liver panels as indicated; if thrombocytopenia is present, evaluate for secondary causes, including HIV/HCV, and consider ITP. Hold on, I should also weave in quality-improvement principles to avoid indiscriminate testing and prioritize high-yield pathways based on history, because structured ordering reduces low-value coagulation testing without compromising safety [^116aPBCx] [^115apUhR] [^11116SA2] [^1146F8KM].

> Finally, I need to check preanalytical pitfalls that can confound interpretation; sample quality matters, so I should confirm proper citrate-to-blood ratios in blue-top tubes, avoid expired collection systems that increase inadequate samples, and be mindful of spuriously prolonged aPTT from heparin contamination, since these issues can lead to erroneous diagnoses and unnecessary downstream testing [^114tucbo] [^116dg4Ef] [^117KXGaS]. Hmm, wait a minute, if a result contradicts the clinical picture, I should repeat critical assays under controlled preanalytical conditions before escalating the workup, to ensure I am acting on true signals rather than artifacts [^117KXGaS].

For a patient with easy bruising, order a CBC with platelet count and peripheral smear [^117KXGaS] to assess for thrombocytopenia or marrow disorders, and PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen to screen for coagulopathies [^1146F8KM]. If initial tests are abnormal or suspicion remains high, add VWF antigen/activity, factor VIII, and platelet function assays to evaluate for von Willebrand disease or platelet dysfunction [^115JGd2S] [^115WeHtV] [^111DbZRS]. Additionally, check LFTs, renal function, TSH [^notfound], and vitamin C to identify systemic or nutritional causes [^111dWsVc] [^112gpa8r] [^111hUAgZ]. Escalate to mixing studies, specific factor assays, or hematology referral if results are inconclusive or if severe disease is suspected [^117KXGaS].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize a thorough history and physical examination to guide testing. Initial testing should include CBC, peripheral smear, PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen [^1146F8KM]. If these are normal but suspicion remains high, consider von Willebrand factor assays, platelet function tests, and specific factor assays [^117KXGaS] [^115JGd2S].

---

## Conclusion

Laboratory evaluation for easy bruising should begin with CBC, peripheral smear, PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen. Based on clinical suspicion and initial results, add specialized tests. Also assess for systemic and nutritional causes [^117KXGaS].

### Bleeding and bruising: Primary care evaluation [^1146F8KM]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Easy bruising and bleeding are commonly seen in primary care settings. The use of a bleeding assessment tool, along with a comprehensive history, physical examination, and patient-provided photographs, can help identify the causes of abnormal bleeding and bruising. A family history can aid in diagnosing a heritable cause. Nonaccidental trauma should be considered, especially in vulnerable populations.

Initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood cell count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen. Normal PT and aPTT results may indicate a platelet disorder. A normal PT result with a prolonged aPTT result indicates a disorder of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, while a prolonged PT result with a normal aPTT result may indicate a disorder of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. It is recommended to consult with a hematologist when the initial evaluation suggests a bleeding disorder or when there remains a high suspicion despite normal laboratory workup results.

### The laboratory diagnosis of platelet disorders [^111DbZRS]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To provide both a detailed description of the laboratory tests available for the diagnosis of platelet disorders and a testing algorithm based on platelet count, a literature search was conducted using the National Library of Medicine database. The literature on laboratory testing of platelet function was reviewed, and based on this review, an algorithm for platelet testing was developed.

A history of mucocutaneous bleeding often indicates abnormal platelet function, which can be associated with a normal, increased, or decreased platelet count. Multiple laboratory procedures can now be employed to determine the underlying pathologic condition of platelet dysfunction once other deficiencies or defects of the coagulation cascade or fibrinolysis are ruled out. Simple procedures such as platelet count, peripheral blood smear, and a platelet function screening test can often guide the investigator to more specific analyses.

Although platelet function testing is often limited to larger medical centers with highly trained technologists, newer technologies are being developed to simplify procedures and make platelet function testing more accessible. This review provides an algorithm for platelet testing that may benefit pathologists and physicians managing hemostatic disorders.

- **Case 4**: A 67-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for a skin check. On examination, he was found to have petechiae and purpura on the back and chest, in addition to curly, corkscrew hairs. He denied any gum bleeding or swelling but endorsed easy bruising of the arms and legs for the past few years. He denied alcohol use and reported a prior 90-pack-year history of smoking, having quit 24 years ago. His diet included fruit intake 3 to 4 times weekly and infrequent vegetable intake, once monthly. He did not take any vitamin supplements.

	- A vitamin C level was ordered, resulting at 0.4 mg/dL, the absolute lower limit of normal. The patient was advised to avoid alcohol, incorporate more citrus fruits into his diet, and begin ascorbic acid 100 mg or 250 mg daily for a few months.

- **Case 5**: A 61-year-old African American man presented to the dermatology clinic for an acne follow-up. He noted intermittent blackhead-like lesions on his arms. On physical examination, hyperpigmented, erythematous follicular-based papules were appreciated on the bilateral forearms (Fig 4). Few compound hair follicles were present without evidence of any hair shaft changes. He denied gum bleeding or swelling or easy bruising. He took a baby aspirin and vitamin D daily. He has been drinking 2 ounces of hard liquor 3 times monthly for the last 2 years with periodic cigar smoking. His diet consisted of vegetable and fruit intake a few times weekly.

	**Fig 4**: Hyperpigmented follicular-based papules on the forearm.

	- The differential diagnosis included keratosis pilaris versus vitamin C deficiency. The patient was initiated on topical Amlactin twice daily.

### Identification and basic management of bleeding disorders in adults [^111XxjR1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Adults with bleeding disorders may present to their family physician with minor bleeding symptoms or hematologic laboratory abnormalities discovered during evaluation for surgery or another purpose. Identifying the small proportion of adults who have an underlying bleeding disorder as the cause for such signs or symptoms may be challenging. In cases of asymptomatic hematologic laboratory abnormalities, the particular abnormality should narrow down the potentially affected hemostatic component(s), ideally streamlining subsequent investigation.

In patients presenting with bleeding symptoms, a thorough history and physical examination are critical for first identifying bleeding as pathologic, then performing the appropriate diagnostic evaluation after excluding identifiable causes. Knowledge of the pathophysiologic processes contributing to impaired hemostasis in any given bleeding disorder ensures proper treatment and avoids therapies that are unnecessary or even contraindicated.

Management is further determined by bleeding phenotype and, for invasive procedures, the anticipated risk for bleeding. Consultation with a hematologist may facilitate proper evaluation and treatment, particularly in adults with rare bleeding disorders or no identifiable cause for bleeding. This article reviews the diagnostic approach to hematologic laboratory abnormalities and abnormal bleeding in adults, as well as basic preventive care and hemostatic management of adults with bleeding disorders.

### Rebinyn [^111SxpNv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Always take Rebinyn exactly as your healthcare provider has instructed. If you are uncertain, consult your healthcare provider. In the event that you infuse more Rebinyn than recommended, contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible.

- **Possible side effects of Rebinyn**: Common side effects include infusion site reactions such as bruising, bleeding, swelling, pain, or redness, itching, and rash. Additionally, your body may produce antibodies, known as "inhibitors", against Factor IX — including Rebinyn — which could prevent it from functioning correctly. Your healthcare provider might need to test your blood for inhibitors periodically.

- **Allergic reactions and blood clot risks**: There is a possibility of an allergic reaction to coagulation Factor IX products. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives, chest tightness, wheezing, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face. Moreover, the risk of developing blood clots may increase, particularly if you have existing risk factors. Consult your healthcare provider if you encounter chest pain, difficulty breathing, or leg tenderness or swelling.

### Unexpected diagnosis in an adolescent with bruises and ecchymosis: Celiac disease [^11139j62]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

Acquired coagulopathy is a rare but challenging diagnosis for pediatric emergency physicians. Although the coagulopathy usually presents with mild skin and mucosal hemorrhages, it can also lead to life-threatening events. Therefore, accurate interpretation of clues obtained from a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory findings is essential for prompt diagnosis and management. This case demonstrates an uncommon cause of coagulopathy: celiac disease that presented with spontaneous bruises and ecchymosis in an adolescent.

### Why is there variation in test ordering practices for patients presenting to the emergency department with undifferentiated chest pain? A qualitative study [^111QDd8K]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Low credibility.

- **Limited in-house specialty and diagnostic services**: A senior ED physician from a smaller metropolitan hospital indicated that limited after-hours access to diagnostic services resulted in workarounds and increased ordering of certain GNI tests. "Clearly the [blood] gas is flat-out stand-up. A gas in my institution is a default biochemistry because after hours, everything goes to [another site] and there's a long turnaround time", he explained. "It gets to that stage now that anyone that gets cannulated almost invariably gets a gas, and that's borne out of this practice of knowing that after hours the gas is the only thing you've got rapid accessibility to" (Consultant, site 3, focus group).

	- The same physician also suggested that smaller sites were required to complete a more thorough diagnostic workup for patients to ensure acceptance by referral hospitals. "This department is challenged by the lack of inpatient services that the hospital provides", he stated. "The specialty patients, or the sub-specialty patients all that goes to [another hospital]. Before [that hospital] tend to accept, they need to be fairly certain that what it is they're accepting is appropriate for them. So there's often a greater workup here for the patients we need to transfer, to ensure that they get specificity at their end of the world" (Consultant, site 3, interviews).

- **Impact of health information technology on inappropriate ordering**: Several participants felt that the introduction of eMR alone had made test requesting easier, resulting in increased test ordering; the ease of selecting a set of tests in an o

### Bruising, hives, and joint pain in a 3-year-old boy [^1118nqYu]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What is the most appropriate first-line treatment for this patient?
- **A. Admission to the hospital for management**: Incorrect. The patient is stable, and supportive care can be managed in the outpatient setting. Indications for hospitalization include severe symptoms (high fever or severe arthritis) or uncontrolled infection for which the culprit drug had been prescribed.
- **B. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and administration of plasmapheresis**: Incorrect. While immediate cessation of the suspected triggering medication is correct, plasmapheresis is unnecessary. Plasmapheresis may be utilized in situations where it is not possible to immediately stop the offending medication.
- **C. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and short course of glucocorticoids**: Incorrect. High fever or severe arthritis and arthralgias may be managed with a short course of systemic glucocorticoids. This patient does not have these findings and is best managed conservatively with NSAIDs.
- **D. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and supportive care**: Correct. This is appropriate management for this patient whose symptoms are limited to the skin and joints and is otherwise stable.
- **E. Short course of glucocorticoids and administration of antihistamines**:

Ensure the most suitable treatment plan is chosen based on the patient's condition and symptoms.

### Advances in immunopathogenesis of adult immune thrombocytopenia [^11116SA2]. Frontiers of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The disease, immune thrombocytopenia, can be associated with a range of symptoms and factors. These include an age peak of 20–40 years, flu-like symptoms, easy bruising, viral hepatitis, autoimmune disorders, HIV-1 infection, heavy menstrual bleeding, gum bleeding, female sex, petechiae, hematuria, blood in the stools, nosebleeds, and a decreased platelet count.

### Managing snakebite [^114XfTB7]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

What tests can be performed?

Perform a baseline 20-minute whole blood clotting test (20WBCT) to screen for coagulopathy in patients without overt bleeding. The 20WBCT is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive bedside test to screen for and monitor coagulopathy in areas with limited access to emergency laboratory facilities. Collect a sample of venous blood from the patient and place a few millilitres into a clean, dry test tube. Leave it undisturbed for 20 minutes at ambient temperature. Unclotted blood that runs out or a friable clot that readily breaks down on tipping the tube once at 20 minutes indicates a possible clotting disorder [fig 2].

- **Figure 2: Examples of the 20-minute whole blood clotting test**:
	- A) With normal blood, a clot is seen at 20 minutes after sample collection.
	- B) Incoagulable blood at 20 minutes, from a patient with Russell's viper envenoming.

Most clinical validation studies on the 20WBCT report a sensitivity of 82–89% and specificity of 82–98%. One study indicated that the test might potentially miss one of every five coagulopathic patients. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the 20WBCT to evaluate its accuracy in detecting coagulopathy (defined as INR > 1.4 or fibrinogen < 100 mg/dL) revealed an 84% sensitivity and 91% specificity using the international normalised ratio (INR) as a reference standard, and 72% sensitivity and 94% specificity using plasma fibrinogen as a reference standard. The test was less sensitive in detecting milder coagulopathy (median INR for patients with a false negative 20WBCT was 1.9 (IQR 1.6 to 12), skewness of 1.06 and kurtosis).

### Quality improvement in the coagulation laboratory: Reducing the number of insufficient blood draw specimens for coagulation testing [^116dg4Ef]. Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The objective was to report the efforts of our laboratory to reduce quantity-not-sufficient (QNS) specimens via several methods and to directly measure the effect of expired collection tubes on the amount of blood that can be drawn.

- **Methods**: We tracked the number of QNS venous-blood specimens per month received by our coagulation laboratory from March 2008 to December 2012. Interventions involved communications that informed nurses and phlebotomists how to avoid drawing QNS specimens, and floor sweeps in which laboratory staff searched for and removed expired vacuum-based blood-collection tubes (VBCTs) from inpatient hospital floors. Additionally, we assessed 11 healthy donors to determine the amount of blood that could be drawn into expired VBCTs.

- **Results**: During the study period, the rate of QNS specimens dropped from a mean of 0.7% to 0.3%. In expired VBCTs collected from healthy donors, we observed a statistically significant difference in the amount of blood drawn into nonexpired vs. expired VBCTs (P < 0.001). Also, there was a negative relationship between the number of months that the VBCT had been expired and the amount of blood that could be drawn into the VBCTs (P < 0.001). For every month that VBCTs were expired, the amount of blood drawn decreased by approximately 1.8 mm (0.1 mL), using linear regression analysis.

- **Conclusion**: Our evidence strongly suggests that expired VBCTs consistently and progressively yield QNS specimens. Methods to reduce blood draws from expired VBCTs may include communications promoting proper blood draw technique, and floor sweeps to remove expired VBCTs.

### The utility of routine electrolytes and blood cell counts in patients with chest pain [^116w3rNy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine whether routine screening laboratory tests, such as electrolytes (E) and hemoglobin and hematocrit (H/H), could have been safely avoided in emergency department (ED) patients presenting with chest pain. A retrospective case series over a 3-month period was reviewed. Acceptable indications for E and H/H test ordering were prospectively developed using American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) guidelines. Charts were reviewed to determine whether any indications were present, whether the E and H/H laboratory tests were abnormal, and whether the abnormal test affected treatment or disposition.

Patients were excluded if they had an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) indicating ischemia or electrolyte abnormality. This resulted in 191 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Sixty-eight patients did not have any criteria for ordering E or H/H. Of these, only one (1.5%) had an abnormal laboratory test. The sensitivity of the guidelines for predicting an abnormal laboratory test was 96% (95% CI, 82% to 100%) and the specificity was 46% (95% CI, 38% to 54%). There were no interventions, consultations, or any changes in disposition based on E or H/H testing in these patients. Of the 123 patients that met at least one criterion for ordering laboratory tests, 27 (18%) had an abnormal result. It was concluded that practice guidelines may reduce the number of E and H/H tests ordered without missing significant abnormalities. A prospective trial is needed to validate these findings.

### The feasibility and impact of midnight routine blood draws on laboratory orders and processing time [^1153qr6m]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate the feasibility of midnight routine blood draws, we assessed their impact on test result availability and stat laboratory orders. We changed the timing of routine blood draws from early morning to midnight on five inpatient wards during the period November 16 to 30, 2011.

Results showed that for the entire institution, laboratory test orders placed from 4:00 to 8:00 am decreased from 55% to 39%, and those placed from 12:00 to 4:00 am increased from 12% to 30%. Stat orders per day decreased during the intervention period (301 ± 53 vs. 344 ± 55, P = 0.04). Additionally, morning specimens were more likely to be available by 9:00 am (78.1% vs. 58.9%, P < .001), and their turnaround time improved by 25.8 minutes (158 vs. 184 minutes, P < .001). A patient survey revealed a potential preference for midnight blood draws.

In conclusion, midnight is a feasible alternative for the timing of routine blood draws. Redesigning the inflow of laboratory orders improved the efficiency of laboratory processing and reduced stat orders.

### The use of viscoelastic haemostatic assays in the management of major bleeding: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^116MmcXL]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for traumatic hemorrhage, particularly in relation to coagulation and viscoelastic testing, the BSH 2018 guidelines recommend considering low clot strength measures on thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry. Additionally, lysis of greater than 3% on thromboelastography is indicated as a sign that a trauma patient is at a higher risk of requiring RBC and blood components.

### Bruising in infants: Those with a bruise may be abused [^112FD7bN]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Bruising in young infants is rare, and if present, it may be a manifestation of physical child abuse. Early signs of abuse, such as bruising, are often overlooked or their significance goes unrecognized, resulting in poor patient outcomes. In such cases, the opportunity to intervene and potentially prevent repeat injury is lost, and the child is placed back in harm's way. This brief report presents three cases of nonmobile infants who presented to healthcare providers with bruising before a subsequent fatal or near-fatal event. These cases emphasize the importance of including abusive trauma in the differential diagnosis of an infant with a bruise or a history of easy bruising. Moreover, it highlights the importance of initiating a thorough trauma evaluation immediately and concomitantly with any other workup for the causes of bruising in the noncruising infant.

### Xarelto [^112mm21G]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients to report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Inform patients that it might take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, and that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with Xarelto [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Bleeding risks**: If patients have had neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, and particularly if they are taking concomitant NSAIDs or platelet inhibitors, advise patients to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematoma, such as back pain, tingling, numbness (especially in the lower limbs), muscle weakness, and stool or urine incontinence. If any of these symptoms occur, advise the patient to contact their physician immediately [see Boxed Warning].

- **Invasive or surgical procedures**: Instruct patients to inform their healthcare professional that they are taking Xarelto before any invasive procedure, including dental procedures, is scheduled.

- **Concomitant medication and herbals**: Advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs or herbals, so their healthcare professionals can evaluate potential interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Pregnancy and pregnancy-related hemorrhage**: Advise patients to inform their physician immediately if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with Xarelto [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise pregnant women receiving Xarelto to immediately report to their physician any bleeding or symptoms of blood loss [see Warnings and Precautions].

### The NSW pathology atlas of variation: Part I-identifying emergency departments with outlying laboratory test-ordering practices [^116TPcPJ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain and chest pain are leading reasons for emergency department (ED) presentations, with laboratory tests frequently ordered to aid the diagnostic process. Our study aims to identify EDs with outlying laboratory ordering practices for patients presenting with undifferentiated abdominal pain and chest pain.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective observational study of 519,597 patients who presented with the complaint of abdominal or chest pain at 44 major hospital EDs across New South Wales, Australia, from January 2017 to September 2018. For each condition, we evaluated the risk-adjusted rate of ordering at least one laboratory test and each of the top 15 ordered tests. We used funnel plots to graph variations in test ordering and to identify EDs with outlying test-ordering practices. EDs lying above or below the 99.8% funnel control limits were regarded as outliers.

- **Results**: From 3,360,152 unplanned presentations, abdominal pain and chest pain represented 8.8% (n = 296,809) and 6.6% (n = 222,788) of all cases, respectively. No major outliers were observed for ordering at least one laboratory test; however, variations were observed for individual tests. For abdominal pain, the top three tests with the highest ordering variation included glucose (20 outlier EDs), C-reactive protein (10 outliers), and calcium-magnesium-phosphate (7 outliers). For chest pain, the top three tests with the highest ordering variation were glucose (21 outlier EDs), C-reactive protein (17 outliers), and liver function test (14 outliers).

Identifying EDs with outlying laboratory test-ordering practices is crucial for understanding and potentially standardizing diagnostic processes.

### The London SIGN (patterned bruising of blunt abdominal trauma) [^113KLuxM]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Patterned bruising of the abdominal wall in blunt trauma is called the London sign. It indicates that the impacting force is sharp and severe enough to cause visceral injury. Despite its practical significance, this sign is seldom described in textbooks, and there are no journal articles about it. This communication is intended to draw the attention of pediatric surgeons to this useful clinical sign.

### Blood draws, fluid input, and bleeding events after percutaneous coronary intervention [^117MrRXc]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) CathPCI Registry reports bleeding events within 72 hours of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as a quality metric. It is plausible that NCDR post-PCI bleeding events may be influenced by markers of the intensity of patient care not related to PCI quality. The relationship between iatrogenic phlebotomy, intravenous fluid input, and post-PCI bleeding events is unknown.

- **Methods**: This is a patient-level, observational study of 13,553 PCI procedures at a single center between June 11, 2009, and June 14, 2017. Multivariable logistic regression determined associations between NCDR bleeding events, total oral and intravenous fluid volume input, and the number of lab tubes drawn on the day of PCI up to 72 hours post-PCI. Improvement in the discriminatory ability of adding these variables to a bleeding risk model was assessed with the C-statistic.

- **Results**: There were 767 (5.7%) bleeding events. Every 100 mL input was independently associated with a 2.0% increased odds of bleeding (odds ratio [OR] 1.01–1.03, p < 0.001). Every 3 mL lab tube drawn was independently associated with an 8.1% increased odds (OR 1.07–1.09, p < 0.001). A multivariable model including baseline patient characteristics and PCI variables achieved good discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.858), but with the addition of input, number of lab draws, and length of stay (LOS), it achieved an excellent discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.927, p < 0.001 comparing C-statistics).

- **Conclusions**: Variables reflecting the intensity of patient illness, including the frequency of lab draws…

### Reducing unnecessary coagulation testing in the emergency department (REDUCED) [^116aPBCx]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Although our study was prospective, the results are limited by the fact it was not randomized and it lacked individual patient-level characteristics. We also did not specifically monitor when appropriate INR/PT or aPTT were not ordered due to our intervention. This aspect is currently being assessed in a separate project that involves performing a full chart review in a random subset of patient charts during our project. Furthermore, while we reduced PT/INR and aPTT testing in the ED, it is unknown whether these patients later had these tests ordered if admitted to the hospital. This is, however, unlikely to affect the magnitude of our findings since only 15% of patients who arrive to the ED are admitted. Since our study was based at a single academic teaching hospital, the results may not be widely generalizable. In hindsight, it would have been ideal to perform this study at multiple centers to strengthen our external generalizability.

An important consideration for any quality improvement (QI) study is the sustainability of the observed results. We believe our results are sustainable since the most significant impact occurred after implementing a process change in the way laboratory tests are ordered in the ED. This process change made it easy for physicians not to order these unnecessary tests, which we believe is crucial for sustainability. Additionally, the lower rate of coagulation test ordering has been maintained to the present date.

We also received positive feedback from the laboratory staff, who noticed a decrease in test volumes after the order panel changes. This feedback has been encouraging for our ongoing efforts.

### Evaluating for suspected child abuse: Conditions that predispose to bleeding [^111ATqoa]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Child abuse might be suspected when children present with cutaneous bruising, intracranial hemorrhage, or other manifestations of bleeding. In these cases, it is necessary to consider medical conditions that predispose to easy bleeding or bruising. When evaluating the possibility of bleeding disorders and other conditions that predispose to hemorrhage, the pediatrician must consider the child's presenting history, medical history, and physical examination findings before initiating a laboratory investigation. Many medical conditions can predispose to easy bleeding. Before ordering laboratory tests for a disease, it is useful to understand the biochemical basis and clinical presentation of the disorder, condition prevalence, and test characteristics. This technical report reviews the major medical conditions that predispose to bruising or bleeding and should be considered when evaluating for abusive injury.

### Ear bruising in a newborn [^1173We5r]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Although rare, severe complications can occur with subgaleal hemorrhages, including hypovolemic shock, coagulopathy, severe metabolic acidosis, seizures, apnea, and death.

Early detection and monitoring are key in preventing poor outcomes. Infants should be closely monitored for signs of blood loss, which include pallor and tachycardia. Serial hematocrit checks and coagulopathy work-up should be considered. Head imaging, such as MRI or computed tomography (CT), may be useful in differentiating other cranial injuries if the diagnosis is uncertain. Head ultrasound can be used as a noninvasive tool that can better describe the hemorrhage. An outpatient provider should closely follow the newborn's physical examination and head circumference.

Treatment is based on the severity of presentation and is primarily supportive. In severe cases, volume resuscitation may be necessary, and blood products should be administered to correct anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy that can occur as a sequela of the expanding hemorrhage. Like other extracranial injuries in newborns, subgaleal hemorrhages can cause hyperbilirubinemia from increased bilirubin production due to red blood cell breakdown. Bilirubin should be monitored closely to determine the need for phototherapy or exchange transfusion. Surgical intervention to evacuate subgaleal blood is rare and limited to case reports.

Final diagnosis: It was determined that the retro-auricular bruising was secondary to a subgaleal hemorrhage from birth, causing blood accumulation within the subgaleal space in this area.

### Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII: Periodontitis, easy bruising, marfanoid habitus, and distinctive facies [^111fpyBd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

An 11-year-old boy had a history of easy bruising, poorly healing wounds since infancy, and severe, early-onset periodontitis. He also exhibited mild hypermobility of the small joints of the hands, long limbs with striking arachnodactyly, and a triangular face with delicate features. Analysis of type I and type III collagens revealed no abnormalities. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII (EDS-VIII), an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder recently mapped to chromosome 12q13. We draw attention to the clinical features that typify EDS-VIII, including extensive pretibial bruising, a marfanoid body habitus, and characteristic facies, as well as childhood onset of progressive periodontal disease.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^114vSVDV]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

In taking account of these advances, the fundamentals for a systematic approach to the diagnosis and management of inherited thrombocytopenia remain largely those expertly outlined in a recent European Hematology Association consensus report on mild and moderate bleeding disorders, to which the reader is directed. In the context of immune thrombocytopenia, a systematic approach includes careful primary tier assessment of the basic clinic-pathological information for each new patient prior to next stage investigations and, if needed, referral to a specialist center. The recommendations in this European Hematology Association report are very useful in emergency situations and for prevention or control of spontaneous bleeding, such as epistaxis or gum bleeding, and at-risk situations, including dental and surgical procedures or traumatic events when immediate practical decisions must be made.

### Von Willebrand's disease [^115JGd2S]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Von Willebrand disease can be associated with a variety of symptoms including postoperative bleeding, anemia, and easy bruising. Patients may experience a bleeding tendency with normal INR, decreased von Willebrand factor (vWF) activity, and increased bleeding time. The MCMDM-1VWD score is usually elevated. Other associated conditions include uterine fibroids, endometriosis, petechiae, normal platelet count, vWD, blood group O, and pulmonary hypertension.

Symptoms may also involve heavy menstrual bleeding, easy bleeding, ecchymosis, rectal bleeding, increased PTT, uterine polyps, gastrointestinal bleeding, ovarian cysts, postpartum hemorrhage, and angiodysplasia. Notably, there is typically no history of migraines. Additional symptoms may include hemarthrosis, gum bleeding, and nosebleeds.

### Management of bleeding diathesis in elective and orthopaedic trauma: A review [^113UdwxV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Low credibility.

There is a general need among orthopaedic surgeons for practical advice on managing patients with bleeding disorders. Appropriate diagnosis and management of these disorders is paramount once discovered before, during, or after the patient's surgical course. Bleeding disorders disrupt the body's ability to control bleeding, commonly through platelet function and blood clotting. Normally, the vessel contracts and retracts once disruption of blood vessels occurs, limiting blood loss. Blood platelets adhere to exposed collagen, aggregate at the site, and obstruct blood loss. Because platelet aggregates are temporary, blood clotting is needed to back up the platelet plug and provide a milieu for the healing process that completes the hemostatic events. Disorders that interfere with any of these events can result in hemorrhage, drainage, or rebleeding. Bleeding disorders are a group of conditions, either hereditary or acquired, marked by abnormal or excessive bleeding and/or bruising. The most effective methods for assessing coagulation disorders include a detailed history and a series of blood tests. Clinical examination findings are notable but may be less specific. If a surgical patient has a bleeding disorder discovered preoperatively, postoperatively, or intraoperatively, treatments exist with medications, surgical management, interventional radiology procedures, and replacement therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of mild bleeding disorders [^111ZHhFD]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Mild bleeding disorders are a common reason for referral to a hematologist, and these conditions can be challenging to evaluate. Recent research has highlighted that some bleeding symptoms are quite common in the general population and that there is clinical variability in symptom expression among individuals with defined bleeding problems. Moreover, bleeding risks for many bleeding disorders are unknown.

This article reviews symptoms and problems that can be considered suspicious of a mild form of bleeding disorder and the diagnostic investigations useful to evaluate these problems. A stepwise approach is presented for the diagnostic evaluation to allow detection of common and rare coagulation and fibrinolytic defects, and adequate assessments of potential von Willebrand factor and platelet problems. Some common problems in the diagnosis and management of mild bleeding problems are reviewed, including the common failure to establish a diagnosis with testing. An approach is proposed for the translation of knowledge to patients who are challenged by mild bleeding problems.

### Anagrelide [^111cyueF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dose**: Instruct patients that their dosage will be adjusted weekly until it effectively lowers their platelet count to an appropriate level. This gradual adjustment will also help them adapt to common side effects. Patients are advised to contact their doctor if they experience any tolerability issues, so the dose or dosing frequency can be appropriately modified [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Advise patients to immediately contact a doctor if they experience chest pain, palpitations, or irregular heartbeat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Risk of pulmonary hypertension**: Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, swelling in their legs or ankles, or notice a bluish color in their lips and skin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Risk of bleeding**: Warn patients that concomitant use of aspirin or other medications affecting blood clotting may increase bleeding risk. They should immediately contact a doctor if they notice signs or symptoms of bleeding, such as vomiting blood, passing bloody or black stools, or experiencing unexplained bruising or bleeding more easily than usual [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Lactation**: Advise patients not to breastfeed while being treated with anagrelide and for one week after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

- **Infertility**: Inform females of reproductive potential that treatment with anagrelide may impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Extensive bruising secondary to vitamin C deficiency [^111hUAgZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

An otherwise fit and well 56-year-old man presented with extensive ecchymosis and soft-tissue hematomas affecting his legs. Coagulation studies were normal. Further questioning revealed a severely restricted diet. The bruising improved rapidly after commencing oral vitamin C supplementation, and serum vitamin C levels were low, supporting the clinical diagnosis of scurvy.

### Slow versus fast subcutaneous heparin injections for prevention of bruising and site-pain intensity [^111QntDA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Heparin is an anticoagulant medication that is normally injected subcutaneously. Subcutaneous administration of heparin may result in complications such as bruising, hematoma, and pain at the injection site. One of the factors that may affect pain, hematoma, and bruising is injection speed.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of the duration (speed) of subcutaneous heparin injection on pain, hematoma, and bruising at the injection site in people admitted to hospitals or clinics who require treatment with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 7). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and two Persian databases, Iranmedex and SID (August 2013).

- **Selection criteria**: We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of different durations of subcutaneous injections of heparin on pain, bruising, and hematoma at the injection site.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors, working independently, extracted data onto a structured form and assessed study quality. We used the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Handbook to assess the quality of included studies. The study outcomes were summarised using quantitative and qualitative methods.

- **Main results**: One RCT was identified, involving 50 participants with a mean age of 55.25 (± 12.37) years. In this trial, it was not possible to blind the participants and caregivers.

### European consensus-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of Kawasaki disease - the SHARE initiative [^116asp1B]. Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Kawasaki disease, specifically concerning laboratory tests, the SHARE initiative 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests in patients with suspected KD:

- **CBC**: Complete blood count should be conducted to assess overall health and detect various disorders.
- **ESR**: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is important to identify inflammation in the body.
- **CRP**: C-reactive protein test is necessary to measure levels of inflammation.
- **LFTs (bilirubin, AST, ALT)**: Liver function tests, including bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are crucial for assessing liver health.
- **Albumin**: Checking albumin levels helps evaluate the body's protein status.
- **Sodium**: Monitoring sodium levels is vital for maintaining fluid balance and nerve function.
- **Renal function tests**: Essential for assessing the functioning of the kidneys.
- **Urinalysis**: Provides valuable information on kidney function and urinary tract health.

### A novel approach to improving coagulation sample ordering in an emergency department [^115apUhR]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

It has been shown that many investigations ordered in the emergency department are inappropriate. Coagulation samples are acknowledged as one of the most common blood samples requested on admission. The common expectation among doctors is that these results will assist in identifying patients who are at increased risk of bleeding. However, there are many pitfalls in a coagulation screen, and a normal result can be found in Von Willebrand's disease, the most common of the inherited bleeding disorders. Coagulation screens do not provide any information regarding fibrinolysis or platelet dysfunction.

Various studies have shown that coagulation studies have limited value prior to surgery and invasive procedures, suggesting that a structured bleeding history is of more value in identifying those who require further evaluation. Similar studies performed in medical assessment units and emergency departments have advocated the use of coagulation testing policies to guide staff in requesting these samples. A study carried out in a Glasgow emergency department removed coagulation bottles from the main clinical area, reducing the number of samples sent.

### Unexplained bruising: A developing story [^113cxdW6]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 10-month-old male infant who arrived at the accident and emergency department with unexplained bruising on the ear. Initial blood tests revealed no clotting or platelet abnormalities. Consequently, an investigation for non-accidental injury was initiated.

He was subsequently reviewed by the dermatology team, who suggested a diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy, presumably triggered by a viral or bacterial infection. The clinical findings were consistent with this diagnosis.

### Why is there variation in test ordering practices for patients presenting to the emergency department with undifferentiated chest pain? A qualitative study [^114gUxgx]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Diagnostic investigations involving laboratory tests aim to increase certainty of the presence or absence of disease, support clinical management, and monitor a patient's trajectory (e.g. during or after treatment). It is estimated that 60%–70% of medical decisions are based on laboratory test results. Evidence shows that approximately 84% of people admitted to a hospital can expect to have at least one pathology test during their stay, usually within four hours of their admission as an inpatient.

Zhi and colleagues estimated that 45% of laboratory testing in healthcare is underused, and 21% is overused. Major international initiatives, such as Choosing Wisely, are seeking to reduce the inappropriate use of tests, treatments, and procedures as part of a collaborative effort involving health professionals, consumers, and specialist colleges, societies, and associations. The Sensible Test Ordering Practice initiative was developed in Australia to promote consistent and rational diagnostic test ordering practices in acute care settings. It involves the use of traffic light systems (green, amber, or red) to restrict the range of tests that can be ordered depending on the seniority of the clinician — 'green' tests may be ordered by junior doctors, while more complex and expensive tests in 'amber' or 'red' require senior medical staff sign-off. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) have also developed a set of laboratory testing recommendations for adult patients attending the ED across a range of common presentations.

### Bruising: A neglected, though patient-relevant complication of insulin injections coming to light from a real-life nationwide survey [^116GKWru]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Another original aspect of this paper was the first clinical evaluation made of skin bruising at the injection sites.

- **Figure 2**: Insulin injection-induced bruising in two subjects: in the abdominal wall on the left and on the arm in the right panel.

- **Figure 3**: Bruising at the injection site (a, b). Lateral view of a LH nodule coming together with bruising (c), best seen after magnification (d).

Bruising is mentioned in several studies as a rather disturbing insulin injection side effect due to the resulting blemishes, for which no solutions have been identified as yet. Unfortunately, from both patient and healthcare provider perspectives, injection-related problems negatively affect the overall number of shots that patients with diabetes are willing to take, leading to reports from some studies that half of the patients mention such problems to their healthcare providers without obtaining any solutions for the associated pain and bruising. Site-related adverse events, including pain, redness, bleeding, and especially bruising, are significant barriers to patient adherence to multiple daily injection regimens. This issue is particularly pronounced when physicians and/or healthcare providers have insufficient experience or knowledge about specific assistance, or when the doctor–patient relationship is unsatisfactory.

To fill this gap, during the last few years, an interesting exchange of experiences started among patients through various networks, including the American Diabetes Association Community. Such forums have enabled patients to propose solutions and share strategies to mitigate these issues.

### Inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy heralding accelerated Chediak-Higashi syndrome [^114CtxCt]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder (gene CHS1/LYST) characterized by partial albinism, recurrent infections, and easy bruising. Survivors develop a constellation of slowly progressive neurological manifestations.

- **Methods**: We describe clinical, laboratory, electrophysiological, and genetic findings of a patient who developed an immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy as the main clinical feature of CHS.

- **Results**: The patient presented with subacute flaccid paraparesis, absent reflexes, and reduced vibration sense. Protein and immunoglobulins (Igs) were elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid. Electrodiagnostic tests indicated an acquired chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy. Intravenous Ig and immunosuppressant treatment resulted in neurological improvement. The patient later developed organomegaly and pancytopenia. Bone-marrow smear revealed giant azurophilic granules pathognomonic for CHS. Two novel mutations in the LYST gene were identified through whole exome sequencing [c.7786C > T and c.9106+1G > T].

- **Conclusions**: This case expands the clinical phenotype of CHS and highlights inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy as a manifestation of the disease. Muscle Nerve 55: 756–760, 2017.

### The effect of laboratory testing on emergency department length of stay: A multihospital longitudinal study applying a cross-classified random-effect modeling approach [^113Mrp8t]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There were 123,455 emergency department (ED) presentations during the study period. In the linked ED–laboratory data set, there were 58,088 ED presentations (n = 48,144 patients) with at least one laboratory test episode and 346,949 tests ordered for these patients. Among these presentations, 54% (n = 31,214 presentations for 28,190 ED patients) involved a single laboratory test order episode; 46% of ED presentations involved more than one test order episode (max = 17). The majority of test order episodes (97.3%) contained multiple tests (max = 61, median = 5, with interquartile range [IQR] = 4 to 7). The median ED length of stay (LOS) was shortest for presentations with only one test order episode (5.6 hours) and longest for presentations with 17 test order episodes (40.7 hours). There was a significant positive relationship between the number of test order episodes and ED LOS (χ² = 7988 with degrees of freedom [df] = 14, p < 0.0001 from the Kruskal-Wallis exact test).

Boxplots illustrate the number of test order episodes per admission. These boxplots show mean (diamond), median, interquartile range, whiskers (defined as 1.5 times the value of the interquartile range), and outliers grouped by the number of test order episodes per admission. The greater the number of test order episodes, the longer the patient's length of stay (p < 0.0001).

### Guidance on the critical shortage of sodium citrate coagulation tubes for hemostasis testing [^114tucbo]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Note: If unbuffered preparation is required, then eliminate the HEPES and pH adjustment steps. The proper ratio is 1 part citrate to 9 parts whole blood when hematocrit is within 25–55%. Citrate volume adjustment for hematocrits outside this range should be done as previously described.

For preparing local blood collection tubes:

- **2.0 mL tubes**: Add 0.2 mL of prepared citrate solution. This will require 1.8 mL of collected whole blood.
- **3.0 mL tubes**: Add 0.3 mL of prepared citrate solution. This will require 2.7 mL of freshly collected whole blood.
- **5.0 mL tubes**: Add 0.5 mL of prepared citrate solution. This will require 4.5 mL of freshly collected whole blood.

After citrate is aliquoted into each blood collection tube, they must be capped using an appropriate rubber stopper (optimal), polypropylene cap, or suitable alternative. Failure to appropriately seal the collection vial may result in leaks during inversion or erroneous citrate concentration or pH due to evaporation or gas exchange with room air.

In-house citrate blood specimen collection tubes should be appropriately labeled indicating citrate concentration, a lot identifier (e.g. preparation date), and expiry date. Tubes should be stored in a cool, dry place or refrigerated after capping. There must be space for labeling with the patient's name and other appropriate identifiers, along with the date and time of blood collection. All information on the tube label must be in permanent, water-insoluble ink.

When required for patient testing, the blood must be collected via syringe technique.

### Simple interventions improve the quality of a missed lab appointment process [^112gtJfH]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Low credibility.

When considering the possible reasons for the system failure, we decided that the process needed to become more patient-centered. An intervention was designed to communicate the importance of having the labs completed to the patient on a more personal level. A number of different ideas were considered, including having the clinician or their allied health staff personally call patients. However, these options did not seem sustainable over time.

The agreed-upon intervention was that each provider would receive a message through our electronic medical record system to advise them that their patient had missed a lab appointment. The provider was prompted to respond to the message and request either: a) the lab order be cancelled (if deemed no longer needed) or b) a reminder be sent to the patient, which included the corresponding diagnosis for the lab study.

Reminder letters were sent via the electronic patient portal (an internet or mobile application that allows patients 24-hour access to their care team, electronic medical record, and upcoming appointments) or through the US postal service to patients without a portal account. The letters were structured so that they could easily be personalized by inserting relevant information. If after 14 days there was still no response, a second and final letter was sent to the patient.

The intervention was potentially sustainable for the following reasons:

1. There was no extra monetary cost involved.
2. A system was already in place that could be modified and improved. Specifically, missed lab reports were…

### The effect of laboratory testing on emergency department length of stay: a multihospital longitudinal study applying a cross-classified random-effect modeling approach [^1165pmp8]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The objective was to examine the relationship between laboratory testing, including test volume and turnaround time (TAT), and emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) using linked patient-level data from four hospitals across four years.

This retrospective, multisite cohort study focused on patients presenting to one of four EDs in New South Wales, Australia, during a 2-month period (August and September) in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. Data from ED information systems were linked to laboratory test data. A cross-classified random-effect modeling approach was applied to identify factors affecting ED LOS, considering the correlation between patients' presentations at the same hospital and/or in the same calendar year. Number of test order episodes (tests ordered at one point in time during the ED stay) and TAT (time from laboratory order receipt to result available) were examined.

As the number of test order episodes increased, so did the duration of patient ED LOS (p < 0.0001). For every five additional tests ordered per test order episode, the median ED LOS increased by 10 minutes (2.9%, p < 0.0001). Each 30-minute increase in TAT was, on average, associated with a 5.1% (17 minutes; p < 0.0001) increase in ED LOS, after adjustment for other factors. Patients presenting to the ED at night (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) had longer stays than those presenting during the daytime, although the median TATs at nights were shorter than those during the daytime.

Laboratory testing has a direct effect on patients' LOS in ED.

### Evaluating for suspected child abuse: Conditions that predispose to bleeding [^112mWRez]. Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Child abuse might be suspected when children present with cutaneous bruising, intracranial hemorrhage, or other manifestations of bleeding. In these cases, it is necessary to consider medical conditions that predispose to easy bleeding or bruising. When evaluating for the possibility of bleeding disorders and other conditions that predispose to hemorrhage, it is important for pediatricians to consider the child's presenting history, medical history, and physical examination findings before initiating a laboratory investigation.

Many medical conditions can predispose to easy bleeding. Before ordering laboratory tests for a disease, it is useful to understand the biochemical basis and clinical presentation of the disorder, condition prevalence, and test characteristics. This technical report reviews the major medical conditions that predispose to bruising or bleeding and should be considered when evaluating for abusive injury.

### Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse [^113frSVG]. Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Bruising or bleeding in a child can raise concerns about child abuse. Assessing whether these findings are the result of trauma or if the child has a bleeding disorder is critical. While many bleeding disorders are rare, not every child with concerning bruising or bleeding requires an evaluation for these conditions. However, in some instances, bleeding disorders can present similarly to child abuse. It is important to note that bleeding disorders cannot be ruled out solely based on patient and family history, regardless of its extensiveness.

The history and clinical evaluation are essential in determining the necessity of an evaluation for a possible bleeding disorder. The prevalence and known clinical presentations of individual bleeding disorders can guide the extent of laboratory testing required. This clinical report provides guidance to pediatricians and other clinicians regarding the evaluation for bleeding disorders when child abuse is suspected.

### A good growth in a child with scurvy [^112joYqQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

We report on a 13-month-old boy who experienced pain while mobilizing and had bruising and swelling of the lower limbs. Laboratory examinations revealed anemia, and skeletal X-rays showed irregularity and thickening of the provisional zones of calcification in the lower and upper limbs. The boy had been fed with only goat milk, homogenized meat, fruits, and vegetables, all of which had been boiled together. Forty-eight hours after starting oral vitamin C supplementation, the patient showed dramatic clinical improvement.

The clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging findings, together with the good response to vitamin C intake, allowed us to confirm the diagnosis of infantile scurvy. Scurvy is a disease that can be found among children, especially among groups with restrictive eating patterns. Fortunately, once diagnosed, scurvy is an easily treatable disease through the administration of vitamin C and a correct diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and fresh meat, all of which contain vitamin C.

### Lipodystrophy in insulin-treated subjects and other injection-site skin reactions: Are we sure everything is clear [^116D4MqT]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Another original aspect of insulin injection-related skin lesions is bruising at the level of the injection site, as shown in Figure 1. Bruising is mentioned in several published studies on insulin injections. It is a problematic side effect of insulin injections, which disturbs diabetic patients due to the resulting blemishes, for which there are as yet no solutions. Unfortunately, from both patient and healthcare provider perspectives, injection-related problems negatively affect the overall number of injections that diabetic patients are willing to take. In fact, in some studies, half of the patients reported mentioning injection-related problems to their healthcare providers, who were unable to resolve the associated pain and bruising.

- **Figure 1: Examples of bruising**: Two examples of bruising due to insulin injection, in the absence of any antiplatelet and/or anticlotting agents.

In a series of 780 insulin-treated adults with type 2 (n = 556) or type 1 (n = 223) diabetes mellitus on a multiple daily injection regimen (4 shots/day), 46.2% of patients had areas affected by lipohypertrophy (LH), with a mean lesion diameter of 4.8 ± 3.1 cm, while lipoatrophy (LA) was quite uncommon (3.2%) (unpublished data). In this same series, 33.2% of patients showed bruising, either associated with LH (n = 178, 53.9%) or isolated (n = 156, 46.6%), independent of the use of antiplatelet and/or anticlotting drugs (unpublished data).

It is important to note that injection site-related adverse events, such as pain, redness, bruising, and bleeding, are significant barriers to patient adherence to treatment regimens involving multiple daily injections.

### Bleeding and bruising: A diagnostic work-up [^117KXGaS]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians are often consulted about easy bruising, excessive bleeding, or the risk of bleeding before surgery. A thorough history, including family history, is crucial for guiding the appropriate work-up. Physical examination may provide diagnostic clues. A standardized bleeding score system can assist physicians in organizing the patient's bleeding history and in avoiding overlooking the most common inherited bleeding disorder, von Willebrand's disease.

For suspected bleeding disorders, initial laboratory evaluations should include a complete blood count with platelet count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time. More specialized yet straightforward tests, such as the Platelet Function Analyzer-100, mixing studies, and inhibitor assays, may also be beneficial. These tests can aid in diagnosing platelet function disorders, quantitative platelet disorders, factor deficiencies, and factor inhibitors.

### Diagnosis and management of bleeding disorder in a child [^116giQP4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Children with symptoms of bleeding and bruising are commonly seen in clinical practice. Primary care providers should be able to decide when evaluation for a bleeding disorder is warranted. This decision depends on one's index of suspicion for a bleeding disorder based on history, physical examination, and screening laboratory investigations.

Knowledge of the hemostatic physiology is essential to order appropriate laboratory investigations and for their accurate interpretation. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and blood platelet concentration constitute the initial diagnostic work-up for any bleeding disorder. An abnormality in any of these parameters in a child with excessive bleeding should lead to a presumptive diagnosis of a bleeding disorder and trigger referral to a hematologist for confirmation and definitive treatment. Awareness of basic treatment principles for the management of bleeding/clotting disorders may prepare providers to develop appropriate management plans, especially in life-threatening situations.

### Heparin sodium [^1161fA8k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The addition of 70 to 150 units of heparin sodium per 10 to 20 mL sample of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation of the sample. Leukocyte counts should be performed on heparinized blood within two hours after the addition of the heparin. Heparinized blood should not be used for isoagglutinin, complement, or erythrocyte fragility tests, or platelet counts.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit. Slight discoloration does not alter potency.

- **Note**: To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent, or broken by hand.

### How I approach bleeding in hospitalized patients [^114nRFJk]. Blood (2023). Low credibility.

- **Evaluation and management of a patient with peripartum bleeding**: A 27-year-old woman presents in a critical situation to the obstetrics service, with heavy vaginal bleeding 9 days after the delivery of a healthy infant. Her initial postpartum course, after normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at 40 weeks and 1 day, was typical, with an estimated blood loss of < 500 mL. She was discharged on postdelivery day 2 and had normal lochia. She noticed an increase in bleeding over 24 to 48 hours before presentation and, at the time of presentation, was saturating a maxipad every 20 to 30 minutes.

	- Initial laboratory analysis reveals anemia, with hemoglobin dropping to 6.2 g/dL from 10.8 g/dL on postdelivery day 1, and a slightly prolonged aPTT at 37 seconds. Other coagulation assays, including PT and fibrinogen, are normal. Upon careful history taking, the patient reveals that she did in fact have excessive bleeding in the past after childhood tonsillectomy and thinks she might have been diagnosed with VWD. She also notes that her periods have always been heavy, saturating a pad or tampon every 1 to 2 hours on heavy days, and that she has a history of easy bruising and iron deficiency dating back to her teens. This was her first delivery.

	- Her condition is managed with TXA, 1000 mg intravenously, followed by 1300 mg orally every 8 hours and supportive care while laboratory analysis is performed. She is ultimately diagnosed with VWD, per a VWF antigen level of 28%, VWF activity level of 26%, and FVIII level of 45%.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115HRcaT]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

A young female patient with immune thrombocytopenia was presented with symptoms requiring second-line treatment options.

- **Patient's history**: A 20-year-old female returned home from college, noticing heavier periods and easy bruising. Her internist observed pallor and visible petechiae on her arms. Complete blood counts revealed mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 5x10⁹/L. Concerned about possible leukemia, the internist urgently referred her to the emergency room. The physical examination showed no hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or other abnormalities.

- **Diagnosis and treatment**: A review of a peripheral blood smear showed no blasts or abnormalities of other cell lines, although her mean corpuscular volume was low (72 fL), and several of her very few platelets were large. She was diagnosed with ITP and administered prednisone at 1 mg/kg. Over the following days, she experienced typical steroid-related side effects — feeling "a little crazy", insomnia, and abdominal pain. Her bruises and petechiae disappeared, and her period ended. Her hematologist prescribed oral iron supplements and switched her prednisone to dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days. During this period, her steroid-related side effects worsened; however, she soon felt better, with no further petechiae, bruising, or menstrual bleeding noted. Her platelet count normalized to 147x10⁹/L, and her hemoglobin improved to 11.2 g/dL. She began checking her blood counts monthly. The improved complete blood count with a nearly normal mean corpuscular volume excluded bone marrow failure and thalassemia.

### The diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease: A United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organization guideline approved by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^115WeHtV]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

The clinical tool "Diagnostic criteria for von Willebrand disease" serves as a foundational element for identifying patients with this common inherited bleeding disorder. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling appropriate management and treatment strategies for affected individuals.

The diagnostic process involves two key components. First, there must be a history of significant mucocutaneous bleeding, a common symptom in patients with von Willebrand disease. This includes symptoms such as easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from minor wounds, or heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding in women.

Second, there must be a laboratory finding of von Willebrand factor activity less than 0.3 units/mL. von Willebrand factor is a protein that helps blood to clot, and its activity can be measured through laboratory testing. A low level of von Willebrand factor activity indicates the presence of von Willebrand disease.

A diagnosis of von Willebrand disease is confirmed if both criteria are met. If either of these criteria is not met, the diagnosis is not confirmed. This binary approach ensures a high degree of specificity in the diagnostic process, reducing the likelihood of false-positive results.

The tool is designed to determine whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for von Willebrand disease based on two key clinical inputs:

- **History of significant mucocutaneous bleeding**: Assessment of symptoms like easy bruising and frequent nosebleeds.

- **Laboratory findings**: von Willebrand factor activity less than 0.3 units/mL.

### Association between hemoglobin values and VWF assays: a multicenter investigation [^111SUwL9]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and can be classified by quantitative or qualitative defects in the von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWD affects approximately 1 in 100 based on abnormal laboratory parameters; however, roughly 1 in 1000 have a bleeding phenotype. Bleeding manifestations vary and most commonly present as mucocutaneous bleeding, heavy menstrual bleeding, and easy bruising. If severe enough or left untreated, bleeding can lead to anemia or iron deficiency anemia. Diagnosing VWD is challenging because factor levels and activity are influenced by a multitude of variables including ABO-blood type, age, stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis changes, and environmental factors such as inflammation and hormone exposure. Furthermore, bleeding history can vary based on individual interpretation of bleeding symptoms and whether individuals have experienced hemostatic challenges. An association between hemoglobin, VWF activity, and factor VIII activity has been described in single-institution studies, but further research is needed.

A retrospective review was performed across five medical centers to investigate the association between hemoglobin and VWF antigen and platelet binding activity assays. We hypothesized that a negative association exists. Data were collected on nonpregnant participants aged 0 to 21 years who were evaluated for underlying bleeding disorder between January 2001 and October 2022. Demographic information and laboratory results were collected. To be included, participants were required to have laboratory…

### Heparin sodium [^116rXRpi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding and that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when treated with heparin. They should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin, and fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Prior to surgery**: Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia**: Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Other medications**: Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Acquired von Willebrand syndrome: Focused for hematologists [^113RUBMd]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old man presented to the emergency room of the main Mantua city hospital in northeast Italy with spontaneous gingival bleeding. Apart from mild fatigue and headache, the patient felt well, with no bruising or other hemorrhagic symptoms. His medical history was positive for hypertension under satisfactory drug control but negative for a bleeding diathesis, and he had undergone an inguinal herniotomy 20 years earlier with no hemorrhagic complications.

On physical examination, there was mild cutaneous and conjunctival pallor, blood oozing from the gums, and lymphadenomegaly at superficial stations (maximum diameter, 2 cm). Blood tests revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 9 g/dL), with normal white cell and platelet counts. With a normal prothrombin time, the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was mildly prolonged (ratio, 1.29; normal range, 0.82–1.18), but its full correction with a normal plasma mixing test excluded a coagulation inhibitor. Screening for lupus anticoagulant was also negative.

Factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) was 40% (normal range, 50–150%), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) was 18% (normal range, 50–120%), ristocetin co-factor activity (vWF:RCo) was 29% (normal range, 50–150%), and the collagen binding activity (vWF:CB) was 37% (normal range, 50–150%). Following the observation of slightly elevated serum proteins (8.8 g/dL; normal range, 6.5–8.0 g/dL), electrophoresis showed increased concentrations in the beta (β) (2.58 g/dL; normal range, 0.6–0.9 g/dL) and gamma (γ) (2.36; normal range, 0.8–1.4 g/dL) regions.

### Approach to the bleeding child [^1142ZTSs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Because bruising and bleeding are normal events of childhood, the pediatrician must be able to determine whether a child's symptoms are normal or perhaps indicative of defective hemostasis. A thorough medical history and physical examination should enable the clinician to choose those patients warranting further evaluation. Rather than referral to a hematologist at that point in time, pediatricians should be quite capable of performing the initial laboratory evaluation and making the correct diagnosis in a majority of cases.
