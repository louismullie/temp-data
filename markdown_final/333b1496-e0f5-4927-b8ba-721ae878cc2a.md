## Question

Pleural fluid glucose level for malignancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret pleural fluid glucose in suspected malignant pleural effusion, including what cutoffs are important, how to differentiate malignancy from infection, and how to use this information for diagnosis and procedural planning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking glucose to malignancy and infection. Then, I should verify which glucose thresholds are supported by evidence and which are not. Next, I will distinguish malignant effusions from complicated parapneumonic effusions where glucose is also low. After that, I should review guideline positions on using glucose for diagnosing malignancy. Finally, I will integrate glucose into a practical diagnostic and management algorithm and note preanalytical pitfalls that could mislead interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis. In malignant pleural effusions, tumor cells consume glucose and generate lactic acid, and extensive pleural involvement with fibrosis and impaired pleural permeability can further depress glucose, so low glucose reflects high metabolic activity and pleural inflammation rather than a specific malignant signature per se [^1153ULzm]. Hold on, I should verify that this mechanism is not unique to malignancy; indeed, low glucose also occurs in complicated parapneumonic effusions and rheumatoid pleurisy, so it is a marker of pleural inflammation and complexity rather than a stand-alone diagnostic test for malignancy [^113tTMYb] [^1163EZyh].

> Next, I should review the evidence for glucose thresholds. Wait, let me verify the commonly cited cutoffs. A meta-analysis by Heffner suggested pleural glucose less than 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) as a threshold associated with pleurodesis failure, but with only modest diagnostic performance (AUC ~0.66), indicating limited clinical utility for predicting pleurodesis success or failure [^116au8T4]. Another retrospective study proposed glucose less than 65 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L) with better discrimination (AUC ~0.81), yet this was a small, single-center cohort without validation, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting it [^116au8T4]. I need to ensure I do not conflate infection thresholds with malignancy; BTS guidance uses pleural glucose less than 3.3 mmol/L (about 60 mg/dL) as a marker of high probability of complex parapneumonic effusion or pleural infection, which is a different clinical question than diagnosing malignancy [^116co8tN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic value. I should confirm guideline positions. The British Thoracic Society explicitly recommends not using pleural fluid biomarkers, including glucose, to diagnose secondary pleural malignancy, underscoring that glucose lacks sufficient diagnostic accuracy for this purpose [^1156fhWk]. Contemporary reviews likewise conclude that while low glucose may correlate with more aggressive biology, no validated biomarker threshold reliably distinguishes malignant from nonmalignant effusions, and glucose should not be used as a standalone diagnostic test for malignancy [^1153ULzm] [^115K6fGH].

> I will now examine how to distinguish malignant effusions from complicated parapneumonic effusions where glucose is also low. Let me think about the clinical context and the rest of the fluid profile. Low pH, very high LDH, purulence, positive Gram stain or culture, and loculation on imaging favor complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema, whereas exudative fluid with negative microbiology and cytology suggesting malignancy points toward MPE, albeit with overlap and exceptions [^1153NVZZ] [^113g8rWT]. But wait, what if the effusion is transudative? I should double-check that MPEs are not exclusively exudative; indeed, about 3–5% of MPEs meet transudative criteria, so a normal glucose does not exclude malignancy, and a low glucose does not confirm it [^112stTAQ] [^1145hLsu].

> Next, I should review how glucose integrates with diagnostic strategy. Let me first confirm the recommended first-line test. Pleural fluid cytology remains the initial diagnostic test for suspected MPE, with typical sensitivity around 46–67%, and BTS advises submitting 25–50 mL for analysis and escalating to image-guided pleural biopsy if cytology is negative but suspicion remains high [^112stTAQ] [^116FpU73] [^1125RV2Z]. I need to ensure I consider tumor subtype, because cytology yield varies and certain primaries may warrant direct biopsy strategies when cytology is likely nondiagnostic [^1132Qr2o]. Imaging with ultrasound and CT helps characterize the effusion and guide procedures; ultrasound is recommended to guide interventions and can suggest malignancy or trapped lung, while CT is useful when malignancy is suspected but cannot exclude it [^117PZSRi] [^115TB7K7].

> Now, how should glucose inform procedural planning rather than diagnosis? Let me reconsider the prognostic angle. Lower glucose, along with low pH and high LDH, correlates with more extensive pleural disease and may predict pleurodesis failure, but the evidence is heterogeneous and not validated for routine decision-making; thus, glucose should be viewed as supportive context rather than a deterministic biomarker for choosing pleurodesis versus an indwelling pleural catheter [^116au8T4] [^1153ULzm]. I should confirm that current guidance still prioritizes clinical factors, imaging, and patient preferences for selecting pleurodesis or IPC, with multidisciplinary input and symptom-driven goals of care [^115McX1r] [^116UapwE].

> I need to check preanalytical factors that could distort interpretation. Pleural fluid pH is highly sensitive to collection method, residual air, local anesthetic, heparin contamination, and delays in analysis, whereas glucose is relatively robust to these factors, which is why glucose is sometimes used as a surrogate when pH cannot be measured reliably. However, this robustness does not convert glucose into a malignancy-specific test, it just reduces measurement error risk [^1157xEa1] [^114oXeWZ]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not imply diagnostic reliability for malignancy; it does not, and guidelines still advise against using glucose to diagnose malignancy despite its measurement stability [^1156fhWk].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If pleural glucose is low, I should first confirm the clinical picture: is there infection, rheumatoid disease, or extensive pleural malignancy, because all can lower glucose. If infection is suspected, apply parapneumonic guidance using pH, glucose, LDH, imaging, and microbiology to decide on drainage, recognizing that glucose less than 3.3 mmol/L supports a high likelihood of complex infection in the right context [^116co8tN] [^1153NVZZ]. If malignancy is suspected and cytology is negative, I should escalate to image-guided pleural biopsy rather than relying on glucose to make the diagnosis, and I should avoid overinterpreting glucose as a malignancy biomarker [^116FpU73] [^1156fhWk]. If planning pleurodesis, I can consider that very low glucose may portend lower success, but I should not base the decision solely on glucose; instead, integrate trapped lung, fluid characteristics, and patient goals with shared decision-making [^116au8T4] [^116UapwE].

> In summary, I should confirm that pleural fluid glucose has no validated diagnostic cutoff for malignancy and should not be used to diagnose MPE, although very low values may reflect extensive disease and pleural inflammation. By contrast, glucose thresholds are useful for identifying complicated parapneumonic effusions, and accurate interpretation requires the full clinical, biochemical, microbiologic, and imaging context rather than any single analyte [^1156fhWk] [^1153ULzm].

---

Pleural fluid glucose is often low in malignant effusions due to tumor metabolism and impaired pleural permeability, but **no specific cutoff reliably diagnoses malignancy** [^1124T1Tf]. Values below 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) are suspicious and suggest malignancy, especially with low pH and high LDH, yet **overlap with infection and rheumatoid effusions limits specificity** [^113tTMYb]. Low glucose correlates with advanced disease and worse prognosis, but **guidelines do not recommend glucose alone** for diagnosing malignancy; cytology, imaging, and clinical context remain essential [^1156fhWk] [^116FpU73].

---

## Pathophysiology of low glucose in malignant pleural effusions

Low glucose in malignant effusions reflects **tumor metabolism and impaired pleural permeability**. Tumor cells consume glucose via glycolysis, producing lactate and lowering pH, while pleural infiltration and fibrosis reduce glucose diffusion from blood to pleural space [^1153ULzm]. Inflammation further increases metabolic demand and impairs glucose delivery, contributing to low levels [^112uLPhu].

---

## Typical glucose levels in malignant pleural effusions

Pleural glucose in malignant effusions varies widely, but **levels below 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L)** are common and suggest malignancy, especially when pH is low and LDH is high [^1117sDDL]. However, there is no universally accepted diagnostic cutoff, and overlap with other causes limits specificity [^112stTAQ].

| **Study** | **Glucose level (mg/dl)** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Heffner et al. (1995) | < 60 | Associated with complicated parapneumonic effusions and malignancy |
| Rodriguez-Panadero et al. (1980) | < 60 | Associated with extensive pleural malignancy and poor prognosis |
| Pantazopoulos et al. (2019) | < 65 (3.6 mmol/L) | Predicted pleurodesis failure in malignant effusions |

---

## Diagnostic utility of pleural fluid glucose

Pleural glucose is a supportive, not definitive, marker for malignancy. Low glucose, especially with low pH and high LDH, increases suspicion but **cannot reliably distinguish malignancy from infection or rheumatoid effusions** [^113g8rWT] [^113tTMYb]. Accordingly, guidelines do not recommend glucose alone for diagnosing malignancy; cytology, imaging, and clinical context remain essential [^1156fhWk] [^116FpU73].

---

## Differentiation from other causes of pleural effusion

Pleural glucose helps differentiate malignant effusions from other causes, but **overlap limits specificity**:

- **Parapneumonic effusions**: Often have very low glucose (< 40 mg/dL) due to bacterial metabolism and inflammation [^112ujKQy].
- **Rheumatoid effusions**: Characteristically very low glucose (< 30 mg/dL) due to impaired permeability and inflammation [^113tTMYb].
- **Tuberculous effusions**: Typically normal or mildly reduced glucose; very low levels are uncommon [^113w99LX].

---

## Prognostic implications

Low pleural glucose correlates with advanced malignancy, extensive pleural involvement, and worse prognosis. Rodriguez-Panadero et al. found that **very low glucose (< 60 mg/dL) was associated with shorter survival and poor response to pleurodesis** [^notfound]. Similarly, Pantazopoulos et al. reported that glucose < 65 mg/dL predicted pleurodesis failure [^116au8T4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize that pleural glucose should not be used in isolation to diagnose malignancy. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommend **integrated use of cytology, imaging, and clinical context**, with pleural glucose serving only as supportive information [^1156fhWk] [^116FpU73] [^117PZSRi].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors limit the reliability of pleural glucose:

- **Overlap with infection**: Low glucose is common in complicated parapneumonic effusions, reducing specificity for malignancy [^1145hLsu].
- **Sample handling**: Delayed analysis or improper handling can affect glucose accuracy, though less than pH [^114oXeWZ].
- **Patient factors**: Systemic glucose levels, nutritional status, and comorbidities can influence pleural glucose [^112JLLmi].

---

## Clinical approach to low pleural glucose

When pleural glucose is low, **clinicians should**:

- **Consider malignancy**: Especially if pH is low and LDH is high, but confirm with cytology and imaging [^113g8rWT].
- **Exclude infection**: Use clinical features, microbiology, and imaging to differentiate from parapneumonic effusions [^1153NVZZ].
- **Use prognostically**: Recognize that very low glucose may indicate advanced disease and poor response to pleurodesis, guiding management decisions [^116au8T4].

---

Pleural fluid glucose is often low in malignant effusions, but **no specific cutoff diagnoses malignancy** [^115K6fGH]. Low glucose supports the diagnosis when combined with low pH and high LDH, yet overlap with infection and rheumatoid effusions limits specificity. It remains a supportive marker with prognostic value, not a standalone diagnostic test [^1156fhWk].

### Does pleural fluid appearance really matter? The relationship between fluid appearance and cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions of patients with cancer [^114Af6VK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Data extraction

This was a cross-sectional study in a group of patients with symptomatic pleural effusion and a previous diagnosis of cancer, who had a thoracentesis prior to placement of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). The protocol and a waiver of informed consent were approved by the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board.

Between April 2000 and January 2006, 390 patients received a thoracentesis as part of their evaluation prior to IPC insertion. Of this group, 365 patients had a complete description of the procedure in their medical records, including appearance of the fluid, as well as results of cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory analysis.

Medical records were reviewed to collect data on age, gender, type of primary malignancy, number of previous thoracentesis procedures, and results of the index procedure. The index procedure was defined as the thoracentesis performed immediately before insertion of the IPC. Pleural fluid chemical laboratory reports were reviewed to retrieve levels of glucose, total protein, LDH, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Cytology results, white blood cell count with differential, red blood cell count, and survival after the index procedure were also recorded. Information on pleural fluid appearance was extracted from procedure notes available in the electronic medical record, dictated by the pulmonary faculty who had performed the thoracentesis. We separated patients into two groups based on fluid appearance: bloody and non-bloody. No purulent effusions were observed in our group.

Analysis

Age, cell counts, and the results of chemical laboratory analysis of pleural fluids are presented as mean values with standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the mean. Gender, type of primary malignancy, fluid appearance, and cytology results are presented as frequencies and proportions. Differences in pleural fluid cell counts, chemical laboratory parameters, survival after index procedure, and cytology interpretation were compared between fluid appearance groups. Group differences for cytology interpretation were compared using the chi square test. Group differences in cellular counts, chemical laboratory results, and survival after index procedure were compared using student's t test and 95% CI of the mean.

### Clinical significance of pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase / adenosine deaminase ratio in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion [^1177KLud]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical data collection

The following patient data were collected: general clinical data, including age, sex, and disease course; characteristics of the pleural fluid [location of pleural fluid, pleural fluid protein (pfPRO) level, pleural fluid ADA (pfADA) level, pleural fluid LDH (pfLDH) level, and pleural fluid glucose (pfGLU) level]; and peripheral blood test results [white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, serum ADA level, serum LDH level, albumin level, CRP level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)].

Statistical methods

SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. Quantitative data conforming to a normal distribution are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and those with a non-normal distribution are expressed as median (25th, 75th quartile). Categorical variables are expressed as rate or percentage. Single-factor analysis of variance was used. When the variance was uniform, the Student–Newman–Keuls test was used for pairwise comparison among the three groups. When the variance was uneven, the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the differences in rates between the groups. The Bonferroni method was used to adjust the test level for pairwise comparisons between groups. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The sensitivity and specificity of various indicators used for the evaluation of TPE were calculated. Data with a P -value of < 0.001 in the comparison of laboratory parameter ratios between groups were included in the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of each indicator. The area under the ROC curve was calculated, the optimal diagnostic threshold was analyzed and obtained, and the clinical values of different indicators for the diagnosis of the same disease were compared.

### Critical analysis of the utility of initial pleural aspiration in the diagnosis and management of suspected malignant pleural effusion [^1145hLsu]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pleural effusions are a common entity, and although around a third are due to malignancy, there is a wide differential diagnosis. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Pleural Disease guidelines recommend initial pleural aspiration, often of large volume to relieve breathlessness, before proceeding to further investigations and potentially definitive treatments. Aspiration is recommended when a malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is suspected in order to obtain biochemical parameters (which may identify alternative diagnoses), provide cytology to confirm diagnosis and guide oncological treatment, and to identify both non-expansile lung (NEL) and those who experience symptomatic benefit, informing further pleural management choices.

Pleural fluid (PF) biochemistry allows the differentiation of transudate and exudate and identifies pleural inflammation. Although MPE is commonly considered to be exclusively exudative, case series have demonstrated transudates in 5% of cases. Biochemical parameters do not reliably differentiate between pleural infection and inflammatory MPE, with high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low glucose and low pH well recognised in either diagnosis.

PF cytology has a diagnostic sensitivity of around 60%; however, with the expansion of personalised oncological treatments which require specific molecular testing, insufficient information may be derived from a single cytology sample. Tsim et al demonstrated that testing was 'incomplete' (ie, insufficient material to permit molecular testing) in 47% of cytology positive effusions. In patients with a CT scan suggestive of malignancy, the OR for a malignant diagnosis with negative cytology was 2.25, but specific malignant radiological features were not assessed.

Large volume aspiration may reveal the presence of NEL, where insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) is preferable to attempting pleurodesis as definitive pleural management. Therapeutic aspiration confirms symptomatic benefit from the pleural procedure. Psallidas et al showed that 85.7% of patients experienced a clinically significant symptomatic benefit after fluid drainage but it was not possible to predict which patients would not experience symptomatic relief.

### Pleural fluid analysis of lung cancer vs benign inflammatory disease patients [^1178KF7Z]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients and study design

We analysed data from a study group of 19 patients diagnosed with lung cancer, and compared it with a group of 22 patients suffering from various benign inflammatory pathologies. The latter group included patients with inflammatory pathology of the pleura, secondary to trauma, pneumonia or TB. The lung cancer group included 12 men and 7 women with a mean age of 67.8 ± 4.3 years and the non-malignant group included 15 men and 7 women with a mean age of 58.8 ± 7.3 years (not significantly different). Among the lung cancer group were nine patients diagnosed with adeno-Ca, five with non-small-cell Ca (not specified), four with squamous-cell Ca and one with large-cell Ca. No cancer cells were found in the pleural fluid harvested from six patients, similar to all cases of the benign group (sensitivity and specificity rates of 68 and 100%, respectively). The definitive diagnosis of malignant diseases was verified in those six patients whose cytological analysis was negative by further tissue analysis procedures. Pleural fluid samples were collected and stored at −80°C until further use. The protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-3, MMP-2, p27, Skp2, Cox-2, CyclinD1 and Ki67, as well as the levels of carbonyls and the antioxidative capacity (IMANOX assay), were analysed. In addition to these 10 specific markers, presumably related to cancer/proliferation/oxidative stress, a routine analysis of the patient's blood and pleural fluid was performed. The routine pleural analysis included pH, albumin, LDH, glucose, total protein, amylase and white blood cells count (WBC). Albumin, total protein and WBC were also analysed in the patients' blood. Interestingly, none of the routine parameters analysed were significantly different between the two groups (neither in the blood nor in the pleural fluid).

### What is the normal composition of pericardial fluid? [^1179giY1]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Biochemical and cytological pericardial fluid (PF) analysis is essentially based on the knowledge of pleural fluid composition. The aim of the present study is to identify reference intervals (RIs) for PF according to state-of-art methodological standards.

Methods

We prospectively collected and analysed the PF and venous blood of consecutive subjects undergoing elective open-heart surgery from July 2017 to October 2018. Exclusion criteria for study enrolment were evidence of pericardial diseases at preoperatory workup or at intraoperatory assessment, or any other condition that could affect PF analysis.

Results

The final study sample included 120 patients (median age 69 years, 83 men, 69.1%). The main findings were (1) High levels of proteins, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), but not of glucose and cholesterol (2) High cellularity, mainly represented by mesothelial cells. RIs for pericardial biochemistry were: protein content 1.7–4.6g/dL PF/serum protein ratio 0.29–0.83, albumin 1.19–3.06g/dL, pericardium-to-serum albumin gradient 0.18–2.37g/dL, LDH 141–2613U/L, PF/serum LDH ratio 0.40–2.99, glucose 80–134mg/dL, total cholesterol 12–69mg/dL, PF/serum cholesterol ratio 0.07–0.51. RIs for pericardial cells by optic microscopy were: 278–5608 × 10⁶ nucleated cells/L, 40–3790 × 10⁶ mesothelial cells/L, 35–2210 × 10⁶ leucocytes/L, 19–1634 × 10⁶ lymphocytes/L.

Conclusions

PF is rich in nucleated cells, protein, albumin, LDH, at levels consistent with inflammatory exudates in other biological fluids. Physicians should stop to interpret PF as exudate or transudate according to tools not validated for this setting.

### Patient with bilateral pleural effusion: are the findings the same in each fluid? [^111otbMt]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To determine whether, in patients with bilateral pleural effusions, the main cellular and biochemical features of the pleural fluid on the right side differ from or correlate with those on the left side. We examined lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose, and total protein (TP) levels, RBC count, nucleated cell count (NCC), and differential cell count.

Patients and Methods

Twenty-seven patients with bilateral pleural effusions, including 13 patients with effusions after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 12 patients with congestive heart failure, 1 patient with malignant pericarditis, and 1 patient with renal failure, were studied retrospectively.

Results

The right-sided and the left-sided pleural effusions did not differ in the mean TP (p = 0.38), glucose (p = 0.31), and LDH (p = 0.39) levels, RBC count (p = 0.31), NCC (p = 0.96), and the percentage of neutrophils (p = 0.22), lymphocytes (p = 0.73), mononuclear cells (MNCs) [p = 0.49], and eosinophils (p = 0.65). The bias ± precision was 0.1 ± 0.64 g/dL for TP, - 2.7 ± 23 mg/dL for glucose, 41 ± 362 IU/L for LDH, 6,100 ± 62,900 cells/ micro L for RBC count, - 36 ± 1,043 cells/ micro L for NCC, - 2.9 ± 11.6% for the percentage of neutrophils, 1.15 ± 17% for the percentage of lymphocytes, 2.3 ± 17% for the percentage of the MNCs, and - 0.15 ± 5.4% for the percentage of eosinophils. Moreover, there was a close correlation between the right-sided and the left-sided pleural effusions concerning TP level (r = 0.85, p < 0.001), glucose level (r = 0.78, p < 0.001), LDH level (r = 0.71, p < 0.001), RBC count (r = 0.66, p < 0.001), NCC (r = 0.60, p = 0.001), and the percentage of neutrophils (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), lymphocytes (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), MNCs (r = 0.74, p < 0.001), and eosinophils (r = 0.84, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Since the pleural fluid findings tend to be similar in both sides of patients with bilateral pleural effusion, we suggest that diagnostic thoracentesis may not need to be performed on both sides, unless there is a specific clinical indication.

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha in pleural fluid: a marker of complicated parapneumonic effusions [^116fD9Lw]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

We sought to determine whether pleural fluid tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a more accurate parameter to identify nonpurulent complicated parapneumonic effusion (CPPE) than the classical chemistries, namely pH, glucose, or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

Methods

We studied 80 consecutive patients with parapneumonic effusions (35 with uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion [UPPE], 23 with nonpurulent CPPE, and 22 with empyema). Concentrations of standard biochemical parameters together with TNF-alpha were measured in pleural fluid, the latter by using an immunoenzymometric assay.

Results

Pleural TNF-alpha was significantly higher in CPPE (133.0 pg/mL) and empyema (142.2 pg/mL) than in UPPE (39.1 pg/mL). A cut-off value of 80 pg/mL for pleural TNF-alpha resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 78%, 89%, and 0.87, respectively, for the diagnosis of nonpurulent CPPE. A multivariate analysis selected both pleural TNF-alpha ≥ 80 pg/mL and LDH ≥ 1,000 U/L (sensitivity, 74%; AUC = 0.86), but excluded pleural glucose ≤ 60 mg/dL (sensitivity, 39%; AUC = 0.82) and pH ≤ 7.20 (sensitivity, 41%; AUC = 0.78), for identifying the need for drainage. The combined sensitivity of pleural fluid TNF-alpha and LDH was found to be 91%.

Conclusions

Pleural TNF-alpha may contribute to the identification of patients with nonpurulent CPPE with at least the same diagnostic accuracy, if not better, than the use of pH, glucose, or LDH.

### Fluorescence in situ hybridization as adjunct to cytology improves the diagnosis and directs estimation of prognosis of malignant pleural effusions [^1124T1Tf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The survival rate correlated predominant aneusomy for chromosomes 11 has been previously reported in breast cancer and NSCLC. For breast cancer, patients with no exhibiting aneuploidy for chromosome 11 in cancerous effusions had a significantly shorter overall survival rate than did have patients who had aneuploidy. Other studies also found that poor prognosis was associated with aneusomy of chromosome 17 in breast cancer. In the present work, our results were consistent with the above-mentioned studies showing that aneuploidy for chromosome 17 was associated with poor prognosis in patients with malignant pleural effusions. But survival rate was not found to correlate with the predominant aneusomy for chromosomes 7 and 11.

We also observed in the present study that pleural fluids positive by the combined FISH and cytology analysis correlated with pleural invasion. These data suggest that there is a higher yield of malignant cells in the pleural fluid after the pleura is invaded by tumor. This is in agreement with recent studies performed using pleural lavages during pulmonary resections which have shown increased detection of positive pleural lavage cytology when there is parietal pleura invasion by malignancy. Combined cytology and FISH analysis were also more accurate in discerning exudative samples from patients with a primary malignancy. In general, exudative malignant pleural effusions have higher cell counts, lower glucose and pH levels, and are cytologically positive. But these criteria are far from absolute, and in our dataset, cytologic analysis only detected 57% of exudative pleural fluids from patients with a known primary malignancy compared with 64% for FISH alone and 79% for the chromosome and cytology assays combined.

### British thoracic society guideline for pleural disease [^1132Qr2o]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to pleural fluid cytology, BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to take into account that the clinical utility of pleural fluid cytology varies by tumor subtype, including diagnostic sensitivity and predictive value for response to subsequent cancer therapies when planning the most suitable diagnostic strategy (for example, direct biopsies in cases with a likely low cytological yield).

### Paradoxical development of pleural-based masses in patients with pleural tuberculosis during treatment: a clinical observational study in China [^114eKQry]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We found ADA and LDH was higher in effusion of patients with pleural-based masses, meanwhile glucose was lower. It had been reported that pleural thickness may be related to lower glucose and higher ADA in pleural effusion, and fluid ADA does play an important role in differentiating TB and malignant pleural effusion. The vast majority of tuberculous pleural effusions are based on high protein, a lymphocytosis and low culture positive rate in pleural effusion. A low pleural fluid glucose level indicates that the patient probably has infectious disease. We noticed that pleural fluid glucose in patients with pleural-based mass was lower than those without occurrence of pleural-based mass, but seemed higher than patients with mixed other bacterial infection we observed in clinics in which pleural glucose can be obviously low (e.g. as low as 0.03 mmol/L), therefore we speculated that lower fluid glucose in the present study did not exclude the possibility of slightly mixed infection. Although protein content of pleural effusions was thought to be related with pleural thickening, however, we found there was no statistical significance between the two groups in the present study. It might be partly due to small size of study or patient selection bias, the study needs the multicenter, large scale sample clinical trial to verify this conclusion in the future. According to the literature, fibrin deposition and loculation of pleural effusions was related to the imbalance of PAI-1 and t-PA in pleural effusion. Pleural inflammation may increase PAI-1 and decrease t-PA in pleural effusion, it can lead to pleural thickening. Although it seemed like higher TGF-β, PAI-1, and PAI-1/t-PA, lower t-PA were observed in fluid from patients with plural-based masses than those patients without pleural-based masses (p < 0.05), these cytokines had no statistical differences after P value correction and re-evaluation. We speculated the reason might be limited numbers in the present study, it will be verified in the future study by larger samples.

Purpose Of Review

Treatment of parapneumonic effusions (PPEs) is challenged by the decision of whether or not to insert chest tubes. This review focuses on the factors that may aid in determining which patients require an immediate drainage of the pleural space, that is, have a complicated PPE.

Recent Findings

Clinical guidelines advocate the evaluation of radiological (large effusion or loculation), bacteriological (Gram-positive stain or culture), biochemical (pH < 7.20 or glucose < 60 mg/dl), and macroscopic (pus) characteristics of the pleural fluid to assist in the identification of complicated PPEs. In the past few years, a number of new pleural fluid biomarkers have been tested for the same purpose, but with the exception of C-reactive protein (CRP), they should be considered investigative. A pleural fluid CRP higher than 100 mg/l or a serum CRP higher than 200 mg/l, when combined with pleural fluid pH or glucose, may greatly increase our capability to predict the need for instituting tube thoracostomy. Although some ultrasonographic and computed tomography features favor the diagnosis of pleural infection, their role in uncomplicated-complicated PPE discrimination has not been systematically evaluated.

Summary

No pleural fluid tests, other than pH or glucose, have gained wide acceptance for the assessment of patients with PPE. However, if corroborated with further studies, the measurement of pleural fluid or serum CRP, in combination with the classical fluid parameters, may have the potential to be incorporated into medical decision making.

✱ p value (unadjusted), Chi-square ≤ .10 = statistically significant variables; ECOG: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; CI: Confidence Interval.

Patients with an ECOG PS grade of 0 had the longest median survival (55 months), while those with a grade of 1, 2, 3, or 4 had a median survival of 22, 18, 7, and 1 month, respectively (Table 4). Patients with pleural effusion and ovarian cancer had the best median survival (21 months) compared with those with other primary tumors. The medial survival of patients with breast cancer was 6 months, and those with either lung cancer or lymphoma had a median survival of 4 months (Tables 3 and 4).

Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that ECOG PS (HR 73.58, p < 0.0001) was the only independent prognostic factor affecting the survival of patients with MPE (Table 5). If the regression coefficient of the prognostic factor was positive, the risk of death (hazard) was higher (e.g. patients with higher values had a worse prognosis (Table 5). Patients with an ECOG score of 4 had worse survival than those with a better PS (ECOG score of 1 or 2), as shown by the Kaplan–Meier curve (Figure 2).

### Low glucose level and low pH alter the electrochemical function of human parietal pleura [^114njSDK]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether low glucose and pH level, which are usually measured in complicated pleural effusions, alter the electrochemical function of healthy human parietal pleura. Parietal pleural pieces were stripped from 66 patients during thoracic surgery and were mounted in Ussing chambers. Krebs' solutions containing different glucose levels (0, 40 and 100 mg) and balanced at different pH levels (7.4, 7.3 and 7.2) were added to the pleural cavity surface of the pieces. Transmesothelial potential difference was measured at various time-points as an electrophysiological variable and transmesothelial resistance (R(TM)) was calculated using Ohm's law. When normal-glucose Krebs at pH 7.45 was used, R(TM) remained unchanged over time, but when low-glucose Krebs was used, R(TM) decreased. Krebs without glucose caused the greatest decrease in R(TM). Use of low-pH Krebs decreased R(TM). The lower the pH of the Krebs, the faster the decrease in R(TM) and the greater the effect. The decrease in R(TM) was greater with low-pH than with low-glucose Krebs. Low glucose and low pH caused an additive decrease in R(TM). Low glucose concentration and low pH cause alteration of the electrochemical function of human parietal pleura and could act as agents that lead to further exudate progression.

### Important prognostic factors for survival in patients with malignant pleural effusion [^112s1Nbc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Potential predictors of survival

We considered 12 potential independent prognostic factors for survival in 165 patients with MPE from the INCA database. The database included demographic characteristics (age and sex), primary tumor site, glucose in the pleural fluid, levels of total protein and lactate dehydrogenase in the pleural fluid, cytological and histological results, percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the pleural fluid, biochemical classification of pleural fluids into transudates or exudates, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS). Briefly, ECOG PS consists of 5 grades: normal activity, grade 0; symptomatic but fully ambulatory, grade 1; symptomatic but bedridden less than 50% of the time, grade 2; bedridden more than 50% during the daytime, grade 3; completely (100%) bedridden, grade 4; and dead, grade 5 (Table 1). The survival time (measured in months) was defined and calculated from the day of pathological diagnosis to the day of death. No patient was censored.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for parapneumonic effusion and empyema, more specifically with respect to pleural fluid analysis, BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to use the following approach according to measured pleural fluid pH in patients with suspected complex parapneumonic effusion:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|PH ≤ 7.2|- High risk of complex parapneumonic effusion or pleural infection <br/> - Insert an intercostal drain if the volume of accessible pleural fluid on ultrasound deems the procedure safe|
|PH > 7.2 but < 7.4|- Intermediate risk of complex parapneumonic effusion or pleural infection <br/> - Measure pleural fluid LDH and consider performing intercostal drainage if pleural fluid LDH is > 900 IU/L, especially if other clinical parameters support complex parapneumonic effusion, specifically ongoing temperature, high pleural fluid volume, low pleural fluid glucose (72 mg/dL <br/> - ≤ 4.0 mmol/L), and pleural contrast enhancement on CT or septation on ultrasound|
|PH ≥ 7.4|- Low risk of complex parapneumonic effusion or pleural infection <br/> - Do not perform immediate drainage.|

### Malignant pleural effusions… [^115KAzGC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- From 1978 to 1982, 620 pleural fluid cytology specimens were examined, of which 80 were positive in 64 patients. Of these 64, three specimens had false-positive results. Adenocarcinoma of the lung was the most frequent primary site, followed by breast, ovary, and pancreas. Comparing cytology with pleural core needle biopsy specimens in 26 patients, the cytology results were positive in 96%, while the needle biopsy specimens alone were positive in only 69%. Following the diagnoses of malignant pleural effusions, the patients receiving combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy had a mean survival of 328 days, compared with only 79 days for those who received no therapy. In conclusion, cytologic examination of Papanicolaou-stained smears yielded a greater percentage of positive diagnoses than either cell block preparations or pleural needle biopsy specimens.

Over the past 25 years, the mean survival after the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions has shown no improvement. Irani DR, Underwood RD, Johnson EH, Greenberg SD. Malignant Pleural Effusions: A Clinical Cytopathologic Study. Arch Intern Med. 1987; 147: 1133–1136.

### Evaluation of two strategies for the interpretation of tumour markers in pleural effusions [^11192G3v]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions present a diagnostic challenge. Approximately 20% are associated with cancer and some 50% require invasive procedures to perform diagnosis. Determination of tumour markers may help to identify patients with malignant effusions. Two strategies are used to obtain high specificity in the differential diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions: a) high cut-off, and b) fluid/serum (F/S) ratio and low cut-off. The aim of this study is to compare these two strategies and to establish whether the identification of possible false positives using benign biomarkers – ADA, CRP and % of polymorphonuclear cells – improves diagnostic accuracy.

Methods

We studied 402 pleural effusions, 122 of them malignant. Benign biomarkers were determined in pleural fluid, and CEA, CA72–4, CA19–9 and CA15–3 in pleural fluid and serum.

Results

Establishing a cut-off value for each TM for a specificity of 100%, a joint sensitivity of 66.5% was obtained. With the F/S strategy and low cut-off points, sensitivity was 77% and specificity 98.2%, Subclassifying cases with negative benign biomarkers, both strategies achieved a specificity of 100%; sensitivity was 69.9% for single determination and 80.6% for F/S ratio.

Conclusions

The best interpretation of TM in the differential diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions is obtained using the F/S ratio in the group with negative benign biomarkers.

### Interleukin-18 is up-regulated in infectious pleural effusions [^112uLPhu]. Cytokine (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the pleural and systemic expression of interleukin-18 (IL-18) in patients with pleural effusions (PEs), and the effects of the cytokine in mouse pleural space. One hundred and sixty patients, 23 with pleural effusions (PEs) due to heart failure, 60 malignant, 25 parapneumonic/empyemas, 15 tuberculous and 37 with exudates of miscellaneous etiologies were included in the study. Pleural fluid (PF) and serum IL-18 content was determined using ELISA. IL-18 was injected intrapleurally in mice and pleural inflammation was assessed using pleural lavage. The highest PF IL-18 levels were observed in parapneumonic PEs and the lowest PF IL-18 levels in patients with exudates of miscellaneous aetiologies and transudates. PF IL-18 levels were significantly higher in patients with empyemas compared to those with uncomplicated (p = 0.009) or complicated (p = 0.028) parapneumonic effusions, while serum levels did not differ significantly among the three groups. Pleural IL-18 content was higher than that of blood only in patients with empyemas. In patients with pleural exudates of all etiologies and in those with parapneumonic PEs/empyema, PF IL-18 levels were correlated with markers of acute pleural inflammation such as the percentage of PF neutrophils, PF LDH and PF/serum LDH ratio, low PF glucose and PF/serum glucose ratio and low PF pH. In mice, intrapleural IL-18 caused neutrophil-predominant pleural inflammation. In conclusion, IL-18 is linked to the intensity of neutrophilic pleural inflammation in patients with PEs, it is up-regulated in the pleural space of patients with empyema and it stimulates the accumulation of neutrophils in mouse pleura.

Nutrition and cell loss

Pleural fluid contains essential nutrients such as proteins, fat and glucose, and white cells. Each litre of exudative fluid typically contains over 30 g of protein. There have been concerns that long-term intermittent drainage potentiates nutrient loss and immunological impairment, especially for exudative effusion or chylothorax. It is difficult to compensate for the nutritional loss with increased diet intake in malnourished patients with end-stage malignancy. Malnutrition and cachexia is increasingly recognised to affect the outcomes of patients with cancer. Similar concerns have been expressed in the use of IPC for benign effusions where prolonged drainage is expected.

Currently, data reporting the effect of IPC drainage on nutrition and immunology are scant. A case series including 11 benign chylothoraces managed by IPC drainage found no observable changes in nutrition and blood cell counts, though the small sample size, missing data and absence of comparison with a control group precluded the drawing of firm conclusions. Another retrospective study of malignant chylothoraces found no significant changes in body weight and absolute lymphocyte counts. However, a decline in serum albumin level (median drop 0.2 g/dL) pre-IPC and post-IPC at median follow-up of 6 months after the procedure was noted, which was reversible with IPC removal. No difference in the rate of protein depletion was noted between the groups receiving IPC versus talc pleurodesis in a prospective 12-month study. Prospective cohort studies with longer follow-up interval are required before definite conclusions can be drawn. In the meantime, physicians should be aware of the potential effects on nutrition status, in particular for those on prolonged IPC drainage with high protein content and voluminous output.

### Closed pleural needle biopsy: predicting diagnostic yield by examining pleural fluid parameters [^111K8ZaM]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Pleural fluid parameters that predict a diagnostic closed pleural needle biopsy were investigated.

Design

A retrospective analysis.

Setting

The Institute of Pulmonology, Hadassah University Hospital.

Patients and Methods

Forty-four patients who underwent closed pleural needle biopsies were included in this study. Pleural fluid values of protein, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pH, and white blood cell count with differential cell counts, from patients with diagnostic and non-diagnostic pleural biopsies were compared.

Results

Thirteen patients (29%) had diagnostic biopsies. Malignancy was identified in 10 patients (23%), of whom 70% had adenocarcinoma. Three other patients had non-malignant specific diagnosis. LDH levels in pleural fluid from patients with diagnostic pleural biopsy were higher than in patients with non-diagnostic pleural biopsies (1436 ± 333 U l(-1) vs. 775 ± 109 U l(-1); P < 0.05). LDH levels less than 510 U l(-1) were highly predictive of a negative biopsy (negative predictive value of 86.6%). Follow up revealed malignancy including mesothelioma and lymphoma, in 10 of 30 (33%) patients with non-diagnostic biopsies, and one patient died of unrelated cause, while the pleural effusion either resolved, remained stable or an alternative benign process was identified in 19 patients (63%).

Conclusions

Low levels of LDH (< 510 U l(-1)) were highly predictive of a negative pleural needle biopsy. Thus, LDH may serve as a useful guide in deciding whether to perform closed pleural biopsy or to proceed to thoracoscopically guided biopsy.

### Glucose and amylase in pleural effusions… [^113w99LX]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Pleural fluid glucose and amylase levels were measured in a prospective study of 176 effusions. Contrary to some previous opinions, we found that in the great majority of tuberculous pleural fluids the glucose concentration was high rather than low. Glucose levels in most but not all neoplastic fluids was also high. Some effusions associated with pneumonia had glucose levels of more than 60 mg/100 mL even though bacterial cultures were positive. The level of pleural fluid amylase was high in patients with pancreatitis and with pancreatic tumor; and a high amylase level was the first indication of pancreatic disease in two cases. Etiologic diagnosis on the basis of chemical analysis of pleural fluid without other supporting evidence is unreliable. Light RW, Ball WC. Glucose and Amylase in Pleural Effusions.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^1139nEDK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospectively recruited cohort of patients presenting with parapneumonic effusions, high pleural suPAR could predict the insertion of a chest tube with an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.98). It could predict the presence or development of loculations with considerable accuracy. A high pleural suPAR was also indicative of the referral for intrapleural fibrinolytics and/or thoracic surgery and was superior to conventional pleural fluid biomarkers.

The optimal management of parapneumonic effusions is contentious and the topic of several ongoing research studies. Much of the uncertainty relates to the difficulty of predicting which patients require formal drainage of their effusion and which will resolve with conservative management (antibiotics) alone. Guidelines recommend formal drainage in the case of frank pus or a positive Gram stain/culture of pleural fluid. Given low culture rates of fluid from complex parapneumonic effusions, formal drainage is also recommended if the pleural fluid pH is less than 7.2. This threshold was first suggested by Light and colleagues in 1980 after a case series of 90 patients showed that low pH effusions (n = 10) tended to need chest tube drainage. In 1995, Heffner and colleagues performed an elegant meta-analysis of the studies relating to the topic of using pleural pH, glucose, or LDH in distinguishing complicated and uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions. From the seven included studies (251 patients) they concluded that pleural pH was the best performing analyte at a cutoff of 7.21. However, they also recognized that given the observational nature of the seven studies and the fact that this analyte had become "entrenched in clinical practice", it required "validation in well-designed prospective studies". pH falls due to lactic acid and 2 by bacteria within the pleural space. Although indicating the presence of bacteria it is prone to both false positives and negatives in the need for invasive pleural management, it has never been prospectively validated in this regard.

Differentiating TPE from other causes of PE

(1) TPE versus (vs) MPE To distinguish TPE from MPE (Table 1, Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S1, and Additional file 1: Fig. S1), ADA, WBC/ADA, and WBC levels were investigated, and significant differences (P < 0.01) were observed. According to the ROC curve, the AUC values were 0.993 for both ADA (> 19.5 U/L) and WBC/ADA (≤ 271.8). The sensitivity of both ADA and WBC/ADA was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] was 89.4–100%), and the specificity of both was 92.0% (95% CI 74.0–99.0%). With both positive likelihood ratios (LR+) greater than 10 and negative likelihood ratios (LR-) less than 0.1, both ADA (> 19.5 U/L) and WBC/ADA (≤ 271.8) can provide highly credible positive and negative results.

### Complications of indwelling pleural catheter use and their management [^114jauic]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

An increasing number of MPE patients are treated with IPC either as a first-line option instead of pleurodesis, or as rescue therapy when pleurodesis fails. The indications of IPC have also been extended to benign recurrent effusions such as hepatic hydrothorax, cardiac failure and chylothorax. Clinicians must be adequately equipped to handle common complications associated with IPC use, which is reported to occur in 10–20% of patients. There are complications, not specific to IPCs, associated with small bore catheter insertion using the Seldinger technique, for example, wound infection or cellulitis, bleeding, organ injury, pneumothorax, dislodgement, etc, which have been reviewed elsewhere.

There are, however, several important, albeit uncommon, complications that are peculiar to IPC use. We review the current evidence on the occurrence, risk factors and management of these IPC-related complications.

IPC-related pleural infection

The standard diagnostic criteria for pleural infection include the relevant clinical signs and symptoms of infection, presence of low pleural fluid pH (and/or glucose), or presence of pus or bacteria in the pleural fluid. In patients fitted with an IPC, the diagnosis of pleural infection can be challenging. Malignant effusions often have low pleural fluid pH and high lactate dehydrogenase, and fever related to underlying tumour is not uncommon. Akin to long-term urinary catheter use, bacterial 'colonisation' can occur in IPC-treated patients whose pleural fluid yields positive microbiology but without clinical manifestation of empyema or the typical biochemical profile of infected pleural fluid. There are no published studies investigating the incidence, bacteriology and significance of bacterial colonisation in IPC-treated patients.

Pleural infection associated with long-term IPC use is of concern to clinicians, especially oncologists administering chemotherapy. The incidences of IPC-related pleural infection in reported (usually small) series range from 0% to 12% (table 1). A large multicentre review characterised 1021 patients with IPC from 11 centres in Europe, North America and Australasia, and found an infection rate of only 4.8%.

### Evaluation of serum and pleural levels tumor M2-pyruvate kinase in lung cancer patients with pleural effusion [^117F6SRp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

205 patients who were hospitalized in Nanjing Brain Hospital and diagnosed as pleural effusion were consecutively recruited. All pleural effusion had a definite etiology, which was recorded by biochemical examination, cytology, pleural biopsy, percutaneous biopsy, endoscopy and clinical follow-up. In MPE group, 80 males and 45 females were aged (58.5 ± 11.8) years. There were 80 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), 25 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 20 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In BPE group, 50 males and 30 females were aged (59.2 ± 10.6) years. There were 50 patients with tuberculosis and 30 patients with pneumonia. There was no significant difference in sex and age between the two groups (P > 0.05).

Diagnostic criteria for pleural effusion

According to Light's criteria, all the patients who were included in this study have a diagnosis of exudative pleural effusion. The diagnostic criteria for malignant pleural effusions were the presence of malignant tumor cells in pleural effusions or biopsy specimens. Parapneumonic effusion was diagnosed with a glucose concentration > 3.3 mmol/L and PH > 7.3, and bacteria were found in pleural effusion culture or anti-infection treatment was effective. The diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion was based on the positive culture of mycobacterium tuberculosis or the diagnosis of caseous granuloma or pleural fluid adenosine deaminase > 40 µ/l with an improvement of the pleurisy after antituberculous treatment.

Sample collection and determination of TuM2-PK and CEA levels

Pleural effusion was collected by percutaneous thoracic puncture and blood samples were simultaneously collected by vein for different tests. The extracted blood was coagulated under routine test for 15 min and centrifuged at 3000 revolutions per minute for 15 min to obtain serum. Under the same conditions, the pleural effusion was centrifuged and the cell-free supernatant was collected. Aliquots of serum and pleural fluid from this study were stored at − 70° C until analysis. TuM2-PK (Sche-Bo W Tech, Giessen, Germany) concentrations in serum and pleural fluid were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CEA concentrations were measured by an electrochemiluminescence Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Beijing, China). All tests were done in two copies and diluted properly, and technicians ignored the clinical data.

### AABIP evidence-informed guidelines and expert panel report for the management of indwelling pleural catheters [^113Dxbuz]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2020). High credibility.

Recommendation 7 — Management of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)-related pleural space infection without tunnel tract infection states: In patients with IPCs for the management of known or suspected malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) who develop a catheter-related pleural space infection without a concomitant tunnel tract infection, we suggest attempting continuous fluid drainage through the IPC over catheter removal (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Pleural space infections are generally reported to occur with < 5% of IPCs, and an IPC-related pleural space infection is suggested to exist when any of the following are present: obvious pus drained from the catheter; clinical symptoms with positive pleural fluid gram stain or cultures; or clinical symptoms with pleural fluid biochemical analysis supportive of infection, such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low glucose or low pH, and catheter colonization alone should not define infection. Evidence cited includes a 2013 retrospective analysis of 1021 patients with IPCs at 11 international centers with 50 IPC-related pleural infections; all patients were initially treated with antibiotics and catheter drainage; among infected patients, 74% were treated as inpatients, 3/50 died before infection resolution, with a 94% overall rate of infection control; catheter removal was performed in 46% of patients and reinsertion of a chest tube or IPC was required in 48% of those requiring removal, with no surgical interventions necessary. Additional cohorts included 25, 19, and 13 IPCs respectively, and another series of 672 patients with IPC for MPEs identified 25 IPC-related pleural infections with 60% treated as inpatients and 3/25 deaths within 30 days of infection.

### Primary pleural squamous cell carcinoma misdiagnosed as localized mesothelioma: a case report and review of the literature [^117B5h9z]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Early pleural SCC that has not invaded the surrounding structures is usually asymptomatic. As the disease progresses, some atypical symptoms may appear, such as chest pain, cough, sputum production, weakness and weight loss. Early pleural SFT is also asymptomatic, but disease development may result in some typical manifestations. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is observed in about 20% of cases, which may result from production of hyaluronic acid or hepatocyte growth factor by the tumor. Hypoglycemia occurs in 2% to 4% of cases and is thought to be due to production of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), which lowers the blood glucose level and impairs the growth hormone counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia. Hemorrhagic pleural effusions may occur in advanced pleural SCC, and serous pleural effusions may occur in about 10% of cases of pleural SFT. These different symptoms of the two diseases may help to differentiate them.

The lack of specific features makes it difficult to differentiate between early primary pleural SCC and early pleural SFT on preoperative imaging examinations such as chest radiography and computed tomography. These imaging modalities can show the locations of the lesions but cannot distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. Whole-body ¹⁸F-deoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) has become a popular imaging modality in recent years, and can accurately differentiate benign from malignant tumors, as FDG uptake is very high in malignant tumors.

Preoperative biopsy is important for the diagnosis of pleural tumors. The reported rate of accurate diagnosis on CT-guided fine needle aspiration is about 45% in some series. However, transthoracic Tru-Cut needle biopsy can obtain more tissue for histological and immunohistochemical analysis, and may be a better choice. When the nature of pleural nodules is difficult to determine, such invasive examinations may be useful.

### Sudden extensive bloody pleural and pericardial effusion in a subject with untreated known hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy, triggered by pneumonia [^1148qUbH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormones are involved in metabolism, regulation of the sympathetic nervous system, and growth during childhood, and deficiency of thyroid hormones disrupts the metabolic mechanisms of the body. In subjects with hypothyroidism, fluid and mucopolysaccharide are stored in interstitial space and protein osmolality is increased, thus leading to edema and fluid retention. In addition, the characteristics of pleural effusion in this subject was exudative, which point is compatible with previous reports showing that characteristics of pleural effusion due to hypothyroidism is exudative, but not transudative. It is noted here that pleural effusion and pericardial fluid in this subject showed bloody color and included red blood cells. There is no report that pericardial fluid due to hypothyroidism shows bloody color. A flowchart of the diagnosis of a bloody pericardial fluid and bloody pleural effusion in this case is shown in Fig. 3. Bloody pericardial fluid could be brought about by several diseases such as viral pericarditis, tuberculous pericarditis, acute myocardial infarction, malignancy, collagen disease, blood disease, uremia, pulmonary vein thrombosis, trauma and rupture of the aortic aneurysm. In this subject, however, we excluded the possibility of having these diseases as described in case presentation section. Diseases that can bring about grossly bloody pleural effusion include malignancy, tuberculous pleurisy, pulmonary thromboembolism, and traumatic hemothorax, all of which were negative in this case. Although bacterial pleurisy and pyothorax can also cause bloody pleural effusion, pleural fluid culture test was negative and pleural fluid glucose level was not decreased (120 mg/dL) in this case, which was not compatible with bacterial pleurisy or pyothorax. In addition, there was no report of bloody pleural effusion due to pneumonia-associated pleural effusion. In the case of bloody pleural effusions, malignancy and tuberculosis are more frequent, and these tests are prioritized in clinical practice. Other diseases presenting with bloody pleural effusions are less frequent and may delay testing and diagnosis. On the other hand, measurement of thyroid hormones is quite straightforward. If the bloody pleural effusion is due to hypothyroidism, it can be quickly corrected with thyroid hormone replacement. We believe that many clinicians should be aware of this fact.

### Combined serum biomarkers in the noninvasive diagnosis of complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema [^113UDZkn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in lung disease. Parapneumonic effusion (PPE) refers to the filling of the pleural cavity with exudative pleural fluids, and this condition develops secondary to pneumonia. The presence of pleural effusion can be defined with a chest radiograph and/or ultrasound-guided thoracentesis. Identifying the cause of PPE is relatively difficult because patients have the same clinical symptoms, such as cough, chest pain and fever. Traditionally, PPEs are divided into uncomplicated PPE (UPPE), complicated PPE (CPPE), and empyema based on pleural fluid biochemical parameters. Including pH, glucose, and LDH. In addition to routine antibiotic treatments for PPE, patients with severe infection may need an invasive procedure, such as surgery, for resolution. Many reports have indicated that routine and optional pleural fluid tests, including biochemical parameters, proinflammatory cytokines, or enzymes, can be used to guide the clinician toward identifying infectious versus non-infectious pleural effusion and to further stage the PPE.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^113g8rWT]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e., infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels. Additional assessments should be individualized, such as tuberculosis testing in high-prevalence regions. Parapneumonic effusions are the most common cause of exudates. A pH level less than 7.2 is indicative of complicated parapneumonic effusion and warrants prompt consultation for catheter or chest tube drainage, possible tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease therapy, or thoracoscopy. Malignant effusions are another common cause of exudative effusions, with recurrent effusions having a poor prognosis.

### Pleural fluid adenosine deaminase to serum C-reactive protein ratio for diagnosing tuberculous pleural effusion [^1126y2vh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Operational definitions

Abnormal fluid accumulation between the parietal and visceral pleura is defined as pleural effusion. If pleural fluid protein exceeded 3g/dl, it was considered exudative pleural effusion. Tuberculous Pleural Effusion was diagnosed by the detection of caseating granuloma in pleural biopsy specimen. Malignant Pleural Effusion was diagnosed by cytological observation of malignant cells in pleural fluid or histological confirmation of malignancy in pleural biopsy specimen. Pack years of smoking are calculated by multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by the number of years the person has smoked (where a cigarette pack is calculated as the number of cigarettes/20). Someone who has smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and has smoked in the last 28 days was considered a current smoker. An individual who has smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and has not smoked in the last 28 days were considered ex-smoker. A person who has smoked no more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and does not currently smoke was defined as never smoker.

Data collection

Data were collected through face-to-face interviews of patients/guardians using a pretested structured questionnaire. Background information, previous medical records, physical findings, and laboratory reports were recorded. After receiving informed consent, diagnostic thoracocentesis was performed on all patients. Once the thoracocentesis site has been identified, the skin encompassing the site is thoroughly rinsed with an antiseptic solution. Then, 2% xylocaine is used to administer local anesthesia to the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and parietal pleura. Then, a 20-cc syringe with a 22 G needle is inserted into the intercostal space at the upper border of the lower rib, and 10 to 20 cc of pleural fluid is aspirated. Pleural fluid was then sent for pleural fluid study, including physical appearance, biochemistry (protein and glucose), cytology, exfoliative cytology for malignant cell, Gene Xpert for MTB and ADA. Pleural biopsy was performed using Abrams pleural biopsy needle with all aseptic precautions followed by histopathological examination. Blood was collected and analyzed for serum CRP. Echocardiography was performed to rule out heart failure, ascitic fluid analysis was performed to determine the cause of ascites when associated with pleural effusion, blood urea, and serum creatinine were measured to rule out renal failure as a cause of pleural effusion, and a thyroid function test was performed to rule out hypothyroidism as a cause of pleural effusion.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^112AugRi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Pleural suPAR and Referral for Medical/Surgical Rescue Therapies

Pleural suPAR was superior to all other conventional markers combined at predicting the need for rescue therapies (intrapleural fibrinolytics or thoracic surgery) with an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87–0.98; P = 0.02, using DeLong's test). Using a cutoff of 65 ng/ml, pleural suPAR was 94% sensitive and 84% specific (PLR, 6.0 and NLR, 0.1) at predicting the referral for these therapies (16 of the 93 patients) (Table 3).

Table 3.
Median Pleural suPAR and Conventional Biomarker Levels by Clinical Outcomes

Table 4.
Pleural pH and suPAR Levels in Malignant Effusions

The combination of markers that are conventionally used to define a complex parapneumonic effusion (including pleural pH < 7.2 or pleural glucose ≤ 3.0 mmol/L [≤ 55 mg/dl] or pleural LDH > 1000 IU/L) had an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71–0.81) for predicting rescue therapies (Figure 3). Pleural suPAR was the only significant baseline predictor of rescue therapies (P = 0.01); see Appendix E4.

Receiver operating characteristic curves of conventional pleural biomarkers combined (pH, glucose, and LDH) and the additional benefit of pleural suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) at predicting the use of fibrinolytics/surgery, plus boxplot of pleural suPAR and use of fibrinolytics/surgery. LDH = lactate dehydrogenase.

Pleural suPAR in Malignant Effusions

Pleural suPAR levels were significantly higher in malignant effusions that were loculated at the time of pleural fluid analysis (P < 0.01) (Table 4). We performed a further analysis to assess whether baseline pleural suPAR levels could predict future malignant loculations. The "delayed loculation" group included effusions that started out nonloculated (simple) and became loculated (over a period of 4–6 mo). Baseline pleural suPAR levels were nonsignificantly higher in the delayed loculation group compared with those that remained nonloculated (P = 0.19) (Figure 4).

### Correlation between levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and levels of pH, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase in parapneumonic effusions [^1156gVKn]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was undertaken to investigate the correlation, which has not been previously investigated, between levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and levels of pH, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in pleural fluid of patients with uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion (UCPPE), and patients with complicated parapneumonic effusion (CPPE).

Methods

Using a commercially-available high sensitivity ELISA kit, levels of TNF were measured in pleural fluid of patients with UCPPE (n = 23), and CPPE (n = 15), and were compared with levels of pH, glucose, and LDH in these two groups.

Results

The mean ± SD values of pleural fluid TNF, pH, glucose, and LDH in the UCPPE group were 11.05 ± 7.65 pg/ml, 7.41 ± 0.08, 125 ± 48 mg/dl, and 306 ± 182 IU/l, respectively. In the CPPE group the values were 56.07 ± 28.5 pg/ml, 6.82 ± 0.25, 42 ± 36 mg/dl, and 2096 ± 1916 IU/l, respectively. The only significant correlation, which was negative, was found between levels of TNF and pH in the CPPE group (r = -0.62, P = 0.01). Levels of pleural fluid TNF and LDH were significantly higher, and levels of glucose were significantly lower in the CPPE group than in the UCPPE group (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates, for the first time that TNF levels correlate inversely with levels of pH in pleural fluid of patients with CPPE but not of patients with UCPPE. This correlation may, in part, explain the pathophysiology of the pleural complications which occur in the presence of CPPE.

### Early and late morbidity and mortality and life expectancy following thoracoscopic talc insufflation for control of malignant pleural effusions: a review of 400 cases [^114uq9so]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Talc ([Mg₃Si₄]O₁₀[OH]₂) is a trilayered magnesium sheet silicate. Preparations historically have had some minimal associated impurities, most notably asbestos. Talc can be used during thoracoscopy or thoracotomy, or as a slurry via thoracostomy. Chambers using talc slurry in 1958, was the first to utilize talc for the treatment of malignant pleural effusions.

Video-assisted thoracoscopy with talc poudrage has replaced conventional instillation of talc slurry through tube thoracostomy as the painless procedure of choice to achieve pleurodesis. It also offers the advantage of complete evacuation of the pleural cavity and visualization of the pleural surface allowing multiple biopsies to be performed with very high accuracy. Futhermore, adhesions may be broken up with confirmation of complete lung reexpansion. This method also permits the distribution of talc in a uniform manner, even in the most inaccessible areas with acceptable morbidity as shown in our study. On the other hand, other investigators advocate that talc slurry instillation is the procedure of choice for patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusions without trapped lungs due to cost-effectiveness. In our institution, chemical pleurodesis by instillation of asbestos-free talc is strongly recommended in patients with poor Karnofsky Performance Status with an expected median survival of less than 3 months.

In our series in-hospital mortality was 2%, approximately the same with other series. The mortality rate within 3 months was 3.7%, with Karnofsky Performance Status and delay between diagnosis of pleural effusion and pleurodesis to play a statistically significant role. According to the international literature there is a credible possibility that aggressive diseases are responsible for a rapid and plentiful recurrence of pleural effusion and limited life expectancy. Sahn and Good showed that this type of pleural effusion correlated with a pH of 7.28 or less or with a lower glucose concentration. Rodriguez-Panadero and Lopez-Mejias also suggested that the extent of pleural lesions detected during thoracoscopy was closely related to both glucose and hydrogen ion concentrations in pleural fluid and that duration of survival was inversely related to the extent of carcinomatous involvement of the pleura. These pleural fluid characteristics were not examined in our study.

### Evaluation of two strategies for the interpretation of tumour markers in pleural effusions [^114WhjST]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 402 consecutive pleural effusions were included, from 148 women and 254 men with ages ranging from 15 to 93 years (mean 72.2; SD 14.2). Out of the effusions assessed, 280 (69.7%) had a benign aetiology and 122 (30.3%) were malignant (Table 1). The effusions were classified in two groups: group A, those with ADA < 45 U/L, CRP < 50 mg/L and %PN < 90%, and group B, those with at least one of the following: ADA > 45 U/L, CRP > 50 mg/L and %PN > 90% (Table 1). Figures. 1a and b show the flow charts of participants in this study.

### Expression of YKL-40 and MIP-1a proteins in exudates and transudates: biomarkers for differential diagnosis of pleural effusions? A pilot study [^111tEa8T]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study subjects

This retrospective study involved 60 patients with pleural effusions [49 exudates (EX) and 11 transudates (T)] (Table 1) who were hospitalized in the Respiratory Medicine Clinic of the Nicosia General Hospital between November 2012 and October 2014. For patients with exudates, pleural effusions were either parapneumonic (PN: n = 11) or were associated with tuberculosis (TB: n = 10), and malignant effusions associated either with lung cancer (LCa: n = 13) or with metastatic malignancies of non-lung origin (MCa: n = 15) (Table 2). The study protocol was approved by the Cyprus's National Bioethics Committee and the Research Ethics Committee of the Medical School, University of Crete. All participants completed and signed a consent form.

Table 1
Clinical parameters and spirometric values of the exudates and transudates study groups

a Chi-square test; b Kruskal-Wallis H test

The determination of the etiology of pleural effusions was based on widely accepted criteria. The classification between exudates and transudates was based on Light's criteria, using serum and pleural fluid total protein and LDH measurements, and was further confirmed by the clinical diagnosis. Within exudates, PN effusions were characterized by coexistence of pneumonia, response to antibiotics and/or pleural fluid neutrophilia. Malignant effusions were diagnosed by cytological or histological examination. TB effusions were diagnosed with the presence of positive stain or culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the pleural fluid, sputum or pleural biopsy, or with the presence of typical caseating granulomas in pleural biopsy, adenosine deaminase levels in pleural fluid greater than 40 U/L and response to antituberculous therapy.

Sample collection and processing

Samples were obtained during the first day of patient's hospitalization and from the first successful thoracentesis, before patients had received any treatment. Simultaneously, 10 mL of venous blood were obtained. Samples were analyzed for total and differential cell count, glucose, total protein, LDH and pH. Additionally, cytological examinations and cultures for common pathogens and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were routinely performed in all pleural fluid samples. Aliquots of pleural fluid and blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min at room temperature and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C until ΥΚL-40 and ΜΙΡ-1a protein measurements.

### The pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase / adenosine deaminase ratio differentiates between tuberculous and parapneumonic pleural effusions [^113e9Pf2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1
Comparison of clinical and laboratory findings between patients with TPE and PPE

Continuous variables are presented as the median (range) and qualitative variables as the number and percentage.

ADA, adenosine deaminase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PPE, parapneumonic pleural effusion; TPE, tuberculous pleural effusion

Table 2
Comparison of pleural fluid LDH, ADA, and LDH/ADA ratio values between patients with TPE, UPPE, CPPE, and empyema

Values are medians (range)

ADA, adenosine deaminase; CPPE, complicated parapneumonic effusions; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PPE, parapneumonic pleural effusion; TPE, tuberculous pleural effusion UPPE; uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion

Management of pleural effusion is usually initiated after determining its transudative or exudative nature and comparing pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum LDH levels according to Light's criteria. Clinical practice guidelines endorse the use of pleural fluid LDH and glucose to assist in the classification of patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions (CPPE). However, an elevated pleural fluid LDH may present in TPE, PPE, and MPE, and the level is likely to range greatly from normal to extremely increased, which limits the use of LDH for identifying PPE in an individual patient due to the low sensitivity. Therefore, it remains a challenge for clinicians to distinguish between patients with TPE and PPE from elevated pleural fluid ADA and LDH levels. As different mechanisms contribute to the elevation of ADA and LDH, it may be helpful to differentiate TPE from PPE by examining the pleural fluid LDH/ADA ratio, which has not been investigated in previous studies.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of the pleural fluid LDH/ADA ratio as a new parameter to discriminate between TPE and PPE.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^114zymnB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Parapneumonic effusions have a wide clinical spectrum. The majority settle with conservative management but some progress to complex collections requiring intervention. For decades, physicians have relied on pleural fluid pH to determine the need for chest tube drainage despite a lack of prospective validation and no ability to predict the requirement for fibrinolytics or thoracic surgery.

Objectives: To study the ability of suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor), a potential biomarker of pleural fluid loculation, to predict the need for invasive management compared with conventional fluid biomarkers (pH, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase) in parapneumonic effusions.

Methods: Patients presenting with pleural effusions were prospectively recruited to an observational study with biological samples stored at presentation. Pleural fluid and serum suPAR levels were measured using the suPARnostic double-monoclonal antibody sandwich ELISA on 93 patients with parapneumonic effusions and 47 control subjects (benign and malignant effusions).

Measurements and Main Results: Pleural suPAR levels were significantly higher in effusions that were loculated versus nonloculated parapneumonic effusions (median, 132 ng/ml vs. 22 ng/ml; P < 0.001). Pleural suPAR could more accurately predict the subsequent insertion of a chest tube with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.98) compared with pleural pH (AUC 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.90). suPAR was superior to the combination of conventional pleural biomarkers (pH, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase) when predicting the referral for intrapleural fibrinolysis or thoracic surgery (AUC 0.92 vs. 0.76).

Conclusions: Raised pleural suPAR was predictive of patients receiving more invasive management of parapneumonic effusions and added value to conventional biomarkers. These results need validation in a prospective multicenter trial.

### Does pleural fluid appearance really matter? The relationship between fluid appearance and cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions of patients with cancer [^111CAPxB]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions are a common problem in cancer patients. In a postmortem series published by Rodriguez-Panadero and colleagues, there was evidence of malignant pleural involvement in 28% of patients with one or more malignant tumors, of whom approximately one-half presented with a pleural effusion. The incidence of malignant pleural effusions in the United States approaches 150,000 cases annually.

For patients presenting with clinical signs of a pleural effusion, the primary diagnostic tools include roentgenographic studies of the chest and a thoracentesis. Initial information about the pleural effusion comes from the color and appearance of the fluid obtained during thoracentesis. Additional information concerning the inflammatory characteristics of the fluid is obtained later, using indicators such as white and red blood cell counts, and chemical laboratory values including glucose, protein, LDH, amylase, and cholesterol.

A small number of previous publications have attempted to find an association between pleural fluid appearance and cytological diagnosis in patients presenting with a pleural effusion. Two studies on patients without a prior diagnosis of cancer reported an association between bloody effusions and the presence of malignant cells on pleural fluid cytology. In a study of patients with parapneumonic or infection-related effusions, a fluid that was free-flowing and non-purulent indicated an infection that could be treated with antibiotics alone, whereas a fluid with a purulent appearance indicted the need for drainage of the affected pleural cavity.

To our knowledge, there are no publications in the medical literature evaluating the relationship between fluid appearance and the results of cytological evaluation and chemical laboratory testing of pleural effusions in patients with cancer. We therefore conducted a retrospective study in a population of cancer patients with a high pretest probability of having a malignant pleural effusion (MPE) to answer two questions: Is there any relationship between pleural fluid appearance and the presence of malignant cells on pleural fluid cytology? Does fluid appearance correlate with cellular counts or chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions?

Standards and patient samples were pipetted into the wells, so if any IL-33 present in the samples would be bounded to the particular polyclonal antibodies. The wells were washed to remove away any unbound substances. A substrate solution was then added to the wells to check color development in proportion to the amount of bounded IL-33, and then the intensity of the color is measured.

### Features which discriminate between tuberculosis and haematologic malignancy as the cause of pleural effusions with high adenosine deaminase [^116Ur6Z4]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical and laboratory characteristics

Comparisons of clinical and laboratory characteristics of PPE, TBP, and hMPE are listed in Table 1. Patients with PPE were significantly more likely to be male and older. The predominant cells in pleural effusion were PMN (median 85%) in PPE, lymphocytes (median 71%) in TBP, and others (median 69%) in hMPE. Patients with PPE had lower glucose (median 20 mg/dL) in their pleural effusion and higher white blood cells (WBC) (median 12,400/µL) and segmented neutrophils (82%) in their blood than those with TBP and hMPE. Compared to patients with PPE and hMPE, those with TBP were more likely to have higher pleural protein (5.0 g/dL), higher serum protein (6.8 g/dL), and lower pleural lactate dehydrogenase (LD)/ADA (7.9). Patients with PPE had higher proportions of solid cancer (36%) and diabetes (27%) than those with TBP and hMPE. Fifty-two (61%) patients with hMPE had hematological malignancies prior to thoracentesis and the remaining patients were diagnosed with hematological malignancies along with pleural effusion. Detailed information regarding the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with hMPE, sMPE, and other effusions are summarized in Supplement Tables 1 and 2. Patients with lymphoma had higher ADA levels in their pleural effusion (94 vs. 52 IU/L, P = 0.010) than those with leukemia or multiple myeloma. However, there was no difference in pleural LD/ADA ratio (17.1 vs. 20.0, P = 0.327).

### Pleural fluid biomarkers to predict response to pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter for malignant pleural effusion: still a long way to go [^115K6fGH]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This letter summarizes the current literature on pleural fluid biomarkers that predict treatment response to chemical pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheters in patients with malignant pleural effusion. We found evidence on pleural fluid biomarkers to be limited to a few small studies, where the biomarkers prognostic value was not tested in separate validation cohorts. Although low pleural fluid LDH, high glucose, and high pH levels are associated with pleurodesis success, no clinically valuable biomarker has been identified. Hence, further research on the inflammatory processes of malignant pleural effusion and during definitive pleural procedures is needed, as well as proper testing of potential biomarkers in separate model derivation and validation cohorts.

### Accuracy of fluorodeoxyglucose-PET imaging for differentiating benign from malignant pleural effusions: a meta-analysis [^112oJnny]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The role of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET imaging for diagnosing malignant pleural effusions is not well defined. The aim of this study was to summarize the evidence for its use in ruling in or out the malignant origin of a pleural effusion or thickening.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted of diagnostic accuracy studies published in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase (inception to June 2013) without language restrictions. Two investigators selected studies that had evaluated the performance of FDG-PET imaging in patients with pleural effusions or thickening, using pleural cytopathology or histopathology as the reference standard for malignancy. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to FDG-PET imaging interpretation (qualitative or semiquantitative), PET imaging equipment (PET vs integrated PET-CT imaging), and/or target population (known lung cancer or malignant pleural mesothelioma). Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. We used a bivariate random-effects model for the analysis and pooling of diagnostic performance measures across studies.

Results

Fourteen non-high risk of bias studies, comprising 407 patients with malignant and 232 with benign pleural conditions, met the inclusion criteria. Semiquantitative PET imaging readings had a significantly lower sensitivity for diagnosing malignant effusions than visual assessments (82% vs 91%; p = 0.026). The pooled test characteristics of integrated PET-CT imaging systems using semiquantitative interpretations for identifying malignant effusions were: sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 74%; positive likelihood ratio (LR), 3.22; negative LR, 0.26; and area under the curve, 0.838. Resultant data were heterogeneous, and spectrum bias should be considered when appraising FDG-PET imaging operating characteristics.

Conclusions

The moderate accuracy of PET-CT imaging using semiquantitative readings precludes its routine recommendation for discriminating malignant from benign pleural effusions.

### Pleural fluid tests to identify complicated parapneumonic effusions [^117VrCEX]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately 20% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia develop pleural effusions. In about 30% of these patients, the condition progresses to complicated parapneumonic effusion (CPPE) or to empyema. Pleural fluid analysis may aid decision-making for drainage in nonpurulent pleural fluids.

Recent Findings

The classical pleural fluid criteria associated with a poor outcome without drainage are a pleural pH below 7.20, glucose below 60 mg/dl or a positive culture. Promising new biomarkers, in descending order of their likelihood ratios for detecting nonpurulent CPPE, include tumor necrosis factor-alpha, myeloperoxidase, matrix metalloproteinase-2, neutrophil elastase, interleukin-8, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, terminal complement complex SC5b-9, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell, matrix metalloproteinase-9, matrix metalloproteinase-8 and C-reactive protein. Pleural fluid procalcitonin lacks accuracy as a diagnostic marker of CPPE. Notably, the absence of an appropriate independent reference standard is a major limitation of all studies dealing with diagnostic tests for nonpurulent CPPE.

Summary

The proposed markers have similar operating characteristics as traditional pleural fluid biochemistries. However, their role in guiding therapeutic approach to parapneumonic effusions, particularly when classical parameters are not informative, warrants further study.

### Pleural fluid analysis of lung cancer vs benign inflammatory disease patients [^116hc9vs]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Cytological and biochemical examination

The 19 cancer patients included the following three subgroups: nine patients with a definitive diagnosis of NSCCA/Adeno Ca/SCC; four patients with a non-definitive malignant diagnosis or a suspected malignant diagnosis; and six patients with a benign cytological diagnosis identical to that obtained in the 22 benign patients. In all 19 cancer patients, the final diagnosis was made on tissue analysis obtained in a biopsy or in a fine-needle aspiration procedure. The non-malignant cells observed in these six false negatives and in the 22 truly benign cases included mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, leukocytes, granulocytes and histiocytes.

The pleural biochemical analysis revealed the following mean ± STD values in the control group: Ph = 7.4 ± 0.2, albumin = 2 ± 0.9 (mg l⁻¹), LDH = 172 ± 61 (IU l⁻¹), glucose = 129 ± 67 (mg per 100 ml), total protein = 3.8 ± 1.4 (mg per 100 ml) and amylase = 30.4 ± 16.9 (10⁻² IU l⁻¹). WBC was 5.6 ± 3.2. As previously mentioned, these values were not statistically different from those found in cancer patients.

### Useful clinical biological markers in diagnosis of pleural effusions in children [^114QFxwd]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

In a patient with an undiagnosed pleural effusion, the first question to answer is whether the fluid is an exudate or a transudate. This is usually determined by means of Light's criteria, which differentiate transudative effusions from exudative effusions by measuring the levels of total protein and lactate dehydrogenase in the pleural fluid (PF) and serum. In patients under diuretic treatment, Light's criteria misclassify transudates as exudates, but the serum to pleural fluid albumin gradient usually remains above 12 g/L. When tests are done only in PF, protein concentration > 30 g/L performs at least as well as the other individual markers. To diagnose tuberculous pleuritis among exudates, PF adenosine deaminase and PF interferon-g exhibit high diagnostic accuracy. When malignancy is suspected the addition of tumour markers to the results of cytologic analysis increases the rate of detection. Other biochemical markers are useful in specific circumstances involving pleural effusion, such as amylase in effusions due to pancreatitis, or oesophageal rupture, and triglycerides in chylothorax. Several PF markers are associated with complicated parapneumonic effusion - e.g. low PF pH and glucose, and high PF LDH activity — although PF pH appears to be the best biochemical aid in decisions regarding chest tube drainage. Recent reports suggest that neutrophil-derived enzymes (polymorphonuclear elastase and myeloperoxidase) can be useful as early indicators of the need of chest tube insertion; however these findings must be confirmed in large series. This review discusses the clinical usefulness of biochemical markers in the diagnosis and management of pleural effusions. The vast majority of prospective studies in this field have been conducted in adults and, although the mechanisms of pleural effusion production do not differ in children and adults, the prevalence of each etiologic cause does. Therefore it seems advisable to confirm or recalculate the predictive values of each marker in the paediatric population.

### Diagnostic role of interleukin-33 in the differentiation of pleural effusions especially tuberculous and malignant effusions [^113i7ahP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Group II (malignant pleural effusion)

Symptomatic and rapidly accumulating pleural fluid (moderate to massive effusions occupying more than half of a hemithorax), and it had a chemical analysis proved to be exudative. Cytological examination revealed exfoliative malignant cells or confirmed by immunohistochemistry or histopathological examination of the biopsies obtained by different methods of biopsy.

Group III (parapneumonic effusion)

Parapneumonic effusion is any pleural effusion secondary to pneumonia or lung abscess. The diagnosis considered when there was a clinical manifestation of pneumonia, radiological evidence of consolidation associated with effusion and analysis of this fluid. Uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion is not purulent, and yields negative results on Gram stain and culture, it has pH higher than 7.2, glucose more significant than 40 mg/dl and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) lower than 1000 IU/l. While complicated parapneumonic effusion is purulent, and yields positive on either Gram stain or culture, with pH lower than 7.0, glucose lower than 40 mg/dl and LDH greater than 1000 IU/l.

Group IV (transudative pleural effusion)

A- Patients with congestive heart failure (3 cases) diagnosed by the presence of the following evidence.
i. Chemical examination of the pleural fluid aspirate revealed transudative nature.
ii. Clinical symptoms and signs of heart failure; exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower limb edema together with tachycardia or ventricular gallop and bilateral basal inspiratory crepitations.
iii. Cardiomegaly proved clinically, radiologically, or by echocardiography.
iv. Echocardiographical evidence of cardiac dysfunction (low left ventricular ejection fraction percentage)

B- Patients with liver cirrhosis and liver cell failure: (10 cases) were diagnosed according to the following criteria:
i. Chemical examination of the pleural fluid aspirate revealed transudative nature.
ii. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic injury, hypoalbuminemia,
iii. Portal hypertension guided by ultrasonographic examination.

### Pleural ELFA D-dimer assay: a surrogate marker for malignant pleural effusion [^117N9GLR]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant pleural effusion is associated with enhanced fibrinolysis. However, no data are available concerning the precise role of pleural D-dimer assay in pleural effusion. We therefore assessed the role of pleural D-dimer assay in predicting malignant pleural effusion.

Patients and Methods

A prospective laboratory investigation was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital. The study included consecutive patients with pleural effusion who presented at the Pulmonary Department between November 2009 and May 2010. Blood and pleural D-dimer levels were measured by Enzyme Linked Fluorescent assay (ELFA). The results were correlated with the clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings, and with the final diagnosis of the pleural fluid.

Results

A total of 103 patients with pleural effusion were included in the study. The Pleural ELFA D-dimer results were found to be positively correlated with pleural etiology of malignancy (p = 0.0001). Pleural etiology was also correlated with pleural LDH, pleural protein, pleural PH, pleural glucose, pleural and blood CRP, but not with ADA. In a binary logistic regression, only the pleural ELFA D-dimer assay was a significant predictor of the malignant pleural effusion (odds ratio 1.007; 95% confidence interval 1.002–1.012; p = 0.007). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for malignancy was 0.79. A D-dimer level of 146mg/ml had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 74%.

Conclusions

We found high D-dimer levels among malignant pleural effusion. D-dimer might be useful as a simple, noninvasive, surrogate marker for malignant pleural effusion.

### Clinically important factors influencing the diagnostic measurement of pleural fluid pH and glucose [^1157xEa1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale

Accurate pleural fluid pH and glucose measurement is a key component in the diagnosis and management of patients with pleural effusion. Standardized methods of pleural fluid collection have not been defined.

Objectives

To assess the effect of common clinical factors that may distort measurement accuracy of pleural fluid pH and glucose.

Methods

Ninety-two exudative pleural aspirates were collected in commercially available blood gas syringes.

Measurements and Main Results

Samples were analyzed immediately using a blood gas analyzer. The effects of residual air, lidocaine, heparin, and delay in analysis (24 h) on pH and glucose measurement accuracy were assessed. Pleural fluid pH was significantly increased by residual air (mean ± SD, 0.08 ± 0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06 to 0.09; P < 0.001) and significantly decreased by residual lidocaine (0.2 ml; mean change in pH, -0.15 ± 0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.18; P < 0.001) and residual heparin (mean change in pH, -0.02 ± 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to -0.04; P = 0.027). Pleural fluid pH was stable at room temperature for 1 hour and significantly increased at 4 (mean ± SD, 0.03 ± 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.04; P = 0.003) and 24 hours (0.05 ± 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.08; P < 0.001). Pleural fluid glucose concentration was not clinically significantly altered by residual air, lidocaine (up to 0.4 ml), or 24-hour analysis delay.

Conclusions

Accuracy of measured pleural pH is critically dependent on sample collection method. Residual air, lidocaine, and analysis delay significantly alter pH and may impact on clinical management. Pleural fluid glucose concentration is not significantly influenced by these factors. Protocols defining appropriate sampling and analysis methods are needed.

### The use of non-routine pleural fluid analysis in the diagnosis of pleural effusion [^113nDEdW]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The investigation of a pleural effusion is, in general, a very straight forward process with the combination of clinical history, examination, radiology and pleural fluid analysis leading to diagnosis in most cases. While most fluid samples are sent for routine analysis including protein, LDH, glucose, cytology and microbiology, there are a number of more unusual fluid analyses available which in some cases directly lead to, and in others are suggestive of the diagnosis. Moreover, other fluid markers are constantly being evaluated as a diagnostic tool. In this review, we describe these non-routine pleural fluid analyses in detail. English language publications in MEDLINE and references from relevant articles from January 1 1990 to August 1 2009 were reviewed. Keywords searched in combination were pleural fluid, effusion, analysis, transudate, exudate and diagnosis.

### Considerations for imaging of malignant pleural mesothelioma: a consensus statement from the international mesothelioma interest group [^114oAYv4]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive primary malignancy of the pleura that presents unique radiologic challenges with regard to accurate and reproducible assessment of disease extent at staging and follow-up imaging. By optimizing and harmonizing technical approaches to imaging MPM, the best quality imaging can be achieved for individual patient care, clinical trials, and imaging research. This consensus statement represents agreement on harmonized, standard practices for routine multimodality imaging of MPM, including radiography, computed tomography, ¹⁸F-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, by an international panel of experts in the field of pleural imaging assembled by the International Mesothelioma Interest Group. In addition, modality-specific technical considerations and future directions are discussed. A bulleted summary of all technical recommendations is provided.

### Pleural fluid biomarkers to predict response to pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter for malignant pleural effusion: still a long way to go [^116au8T4]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Pleural fluid glucose levels as a biomarker is addressed by Hassan et al. who analyzed data from five studies and 709 patients (two retrospective [, two prospective,], and a meta-analysis by Heffner et al.). They found that higher glucose levels favored pleurodesis success with a mean glucose difference of 36.6 mg/dL (2 mmol/L, 95% CI 16.3–56.2 mg/dL, p < 0.001, I² 93%, p < 0.001). However, there was a lack of agreement between studies regarding the cutoff values. Two of the included studies suggested a cutoff value for pleural fluid glucose to predict pleurodesis failure. A meta-analysis by Heffner et al. (n = 433) 14 suggested a glucose threshold of < 72 mg/dL (4 mmol/L) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66 (95% CI 0.61–0.72), indicating limited diagnostic efficacy. Lastly, Pantazouplos et al. reported an optimal cutoff of glucose < 65 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L) with an AUC of 0.81 and a sensitivity and specificity of 90.7% and 76.8%, respectively (p < 0.001); however, this retrospective study only included 162 patients. Neither study included clinical variables or a validation cohort (Table 1).

### Diagnostic value of interleukine-6, transforming growth factor-beta 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor in malignant pleural effusions [^112Hstin]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

We evaluate the accuracy of pleural interleukine-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels for differentiating benign from malignant pleural exudates.

Patients and Methods

Levels of IL-6, TGF-beta1, and VEGF were measured by ELISA in 103 patients with non neutrophilic (< 50%) exudative pleurisy including both benign and malignant effusions. Pleurisies were split into benign and malignant according to the pathological diagnosis.

Results

Thirty-nine benign (seven infections; 32 inflammatory diseases) and 64 malignant (34 extrathoracic tumors; 25 lung cancers; five mesotheliomas) pleural exudates were diagnosed by thoracoscopy. Pleural reticulo-monocyte count, protein Light's ratio and lactic dehydrogenase Light's ratio were significantly higher in malignant than in benign effusions (p < 0.05, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The median (range) level of VEGF was significantly higher in malignant than in benign effusions (664.50 pg/ml [10–40,143] vs 349 pg/ml [10–8888]) (p < 0.05). VEGF levels correlated with pleural LDH (r = 0.41, p < 0.0001), glucose (r = -0.30, p < 0.01) and red cell count (r = 0.57, p < 0.0001). No significant difference was found between malignant and benign effusions with respect to IL-6 (26.8 ng/ml [1.8–421] vs 18.4 ng/ml [0.45–400], respectively) and TGF-beta1 (1079 pg/ml [18–6206] vs 1123 pg/ml [34–5447]) levels. ROC analysis between benign and malignant pleurisies for VEGF showed an area under the curve of 619 (p = 0.03) with a value of 382 pg/ml as the best threshold for distinguishing benign from malignant effusions.

Conclusions

Malignant effusions may enhance the release of VEGF in pleural space and its measurement may help in the diagnosis of malignant effusion.

### Can cholesterol be used to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates? evidence from a bivariate meta-analysis [^113QDHTh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion often develops in patients with thoracic or systemic diseases. Such effusion has traditionally been classified as transudate or exudate based on the etiology and underlying pathology, and differentiating the two types of pleural effusion is critical for guiding treatment. Transudates are usually taken as a sign of underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis, which then becomes the focus of treatment. Because in the case of a transudate, aetiology and therapy are directed to the underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis. Alternatively, exudates are usually taken as a sign of, inflammatory disorders or malignancy, leading to more extensive diagnostic procedures.

The criteria most widely used to differentiate exudates and transudates in patients with pleural effusions are Light's criteria, established by Light et al. in 1972. These criteria rely on levels of total protein and of lactate dehydrogenase. The criteria maximize sensitivity at the expense of specificity: they typically identify 98% of pleural exudates, but they misclassify approximately 25% of transudates as exudates. As a result, patients misclassified with exudate undergo unnecessary and risky invasive diagnostic procedures, such as thoracoscopic pleural biopsy and image-guided percutaneous pleural biopsy. This highlights the need to develop better methods to differentiate exudative and transudative pleural effusions.

Since Light's criteria were published in 1972, pleural cholesterol levels have been explored for their usefulness in diagnosing pleural exudates. Cellular degeneration and vascular leakage due to increased permeability are thought to elevate pleural cholesterol levels. Several studies suggest that pleural cholesterol is increased in pleural exudates, making it a potential biomarker for differentiating exudative and transudative pleural effusions. Studies have come to conflicting conclusions about whether pleural cholesterol levels can provide adequate differentiating power, and other studies have explored the diagnostic potential of the ratio of cholesterol in pleural fluid to cholesterol in serum (P/S cholesterol ratio) and come to similarly conflicting conclusions. To help gain more reliable insights, we meta-analyzed the literature on using pleural cholesterol level or the P/S cholesterol ratio to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^111MmHUw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society — Asymptomatic malignant pleural effusion (MPE) management — we suggest that therapeutic pleural interventions not be performed in patients with known or suspected MPE who are asymptomatic (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in estimate of effects; Tables E4B and E5B). Data are insufficient to recommend sampling or draining these asymptomatic effusions, and drainage would only subject the patient to the risks of the procedure without providing clinical benefit; however, if pleural fluid is required for diagnostic purposes, fluid and/or tissue sampling would be appropriate.

### Diagnostic and prognostic significance of survivin levels in malignant pleural effusion [^114ZKX8R]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of measuring survivin levels, which is an inhibitor of apoptosis in pleural effusions.

Methods

Group I, malignant (MPE) (n = 51); Group II, tuberculosis (TPE) (n = 18); Group III transudative (TE) (n = 9) effusions were enrolled prospectively. We used ELISA to analyze 78 effusions. The value for the differential diagnosis and the correlation between survivin and survival in MPE were analyzed.

Results

Survivin level was 41.75 ± 76.20 in MPE, 15.83 ± 10.92 in TPE and 8.33 ± 8.67 in TE. When the patients divided two groups as malignant and non-malignant pleural effusion (non-MPE), survivin level was significantly higher in MPE (41.75 ± 76.20) than in non-MPE (13.33 ± 2.05) (p = 0.012). The cutoff value for survivin levels detected by ROC curve analysis was 7.5 pg/ml, with sensitivity and specificity values of 72%, 44%, respectively. Survivin had no discriminative power in differentiating exudative effusions of MPE from TPE (p = 0.405). There was no correlation between survivin level and age, sex, location, fluid pH, glucose, protein, albumine and ADA level while there was significant moderate correlation with fluid LDH (r = 0.49; p < 0.001). Survivin levels can distinguish patients who had poor prognosis (median survival 75 days, n = 24) and those who had good prognosis (median survival 219 days, n = 27, p = 0.03) in MPE. In conclusion, survivin expression levels detected with ELISA had no discriminative power in differentiating exudative effusions included MPE and TPE. Elevated survivin levels are associated with poor survival in MPE. Our results suggest that survivin may be a potential prognostic marker in MPE.

### Pleural fluid biomarkers to predict response to pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter for malignant pleural effusion: still a long way to go [^1153ULzm]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This research letter highlights the absence of suitable pleural fluid biomarkers to support clinical decision-making in the management of MPE. This is particularly relevant to treatment with IPCs, presumably due to the long-standing use of talc slurry pleurodesis via chest tube or thoracoscopic talc poudrage as first-line interventions. The current evidence on biomarkers is limited to a few small prospective studies with substantial heterogeneity in the definition of pleurodesis success (radiographic vs. patient symptoms) and the type of pleurodesis agent. Overall, the available studies do not adhere to gold standards for biomarker development, such as presentation of prognostic performance in separate model derivation and validation cohorts, and presentation of the added prognostic value to already known clinical biomarkers such as trapped lung or daily MPE fluid volume production.

Although there is evidence that low pleural fluid LDH, high glucose, and pH levels are associated with pleurodesis success in several small studies, none of them have shown promise as independent predictive biomarkers. High pleural fluid LDH, low glucose, low pH, and high protein levels reflect increased metabolic activity and thus high cancer cell activity, which may hinder the pleurodesis. However, they may also reflect more general inflammation, which could induce local inflammation during pleurodesis. Hence, there is a need for further understanding of the inflammatory processes involved in MPE and the response to definitive pleural procedures in these patients. The identification of key mechanisms for success, failure, or adverse events will improve patient-tailored MPE management, and could potentially lead to the development of targeted drug therapies to control MPE production. Currently, clinicians must still rely on clinical data derived from chest radiographs and measurement of fluid volume output to provide imperfect clues to the predicted outcome of pleurodesis.

### Important prognostic factors for survival in patients with malignant pleural effusion [^1117sDDL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Our findings – pH of pleural fluid and glucose levels - are different from those of several other authors. In a study by Heffner et al. the pH of pleural fluid was not predictive of the need for pleurodesis in selected patients, based on estimated survival. However, Rodrigues-Panadero and Lopez-Mejias concluded that pH (lower than 7.35) and glucose levels (lower than 60.0 mg/dL) in pleural fluid are risk factors for worse survival in patients with pleural cancer owing to extensive disease. Potential explanations for this discrepancy between different studies are the different regression models used for validation of the data, sample size, bias, and distinct populations used by other authors.

Our study adds important information to the existing literature. The projected survival time can help determine the most appropriate type of intrapleural therapy for MPE (e.g. pleurodesis vs. chronic drainage with indwelling catheters). There are several options for the treatment of MPE patients, some of which involve chemotherapy, including therapeutic pleural thoracentesis, chemical pleurodesis with intercostal tube drainage or after thoracoscopy, a pleural-peritoneal shunt, a long-term ambulatory or indwelling pleural catheter for drainage, and open pleurectomy. Each of these procedures can successfully relieve dyspnea, but they are all associated with potential complications. When the expected survival is short, less invasive procedures should be considered (e.g. repeated thoracocentesis to relieve the symptoms).

For patients with MPE and an anticipated survival time of 6 months, treatment with long-term indwelling pleural catheters is comparable to treatment with talc pleurodesis. There are no robust data to support which of these two treatments is more effective at palliating symptoms and improving quality of life.

Study limitations

Our study has a few limitations as follows. Our data originated from a single referral center, the study was retrospective, there was a small number of patients in some categories, and there was a lack of patients with mesothelioma in the cohort. The absence of patients with mesothelioma in our cohort is probably owing to the fact that the incidence of this cancer is low in Brazil: 221 cases were reported from 2000 to 2011.

### Rheumatoid pleurisy with effusion… [^113tTMYb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid pleuritis characteristically occurs in middle-aged male rheumatoid patients and may antedate the arthritis. The pleural fluid is an exudate, frequently turbid, and may be milky. The glucose content of the fluid is less than 30 mg/100 mL in 70% to 80% of effusions. A low glucose level in pleural fluid that is nonpurulent, negative for bacteria on smear and culture, and negative for malignant cells on cytologic examination almost invariably indicates that the effusion is due to rheumatoid pleuritis unless pleural biopsy reveals tuberculosis.

### Glucose measurement in body fluids: a ready reckoner for clinicians [^114mJjJ8]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Blood glucose measurement is central to the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes. Considering that a clinician relies heavily on blood (or rarely other body fluid) glucose values for decision making, an understanding of the basic aspects of glucose measurement in body fluids is necessary.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in PubMed for articles in English on measurement of glucose in body fluids.

Results

Glucose can be measured in several body fluids, namely blood, interstitial fluid, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid and ascitic fluid in appropriate clinical settings. For blood glucose measurement, the present-day enzymatic methods have replaced the older reducing and condensation methods on account of their better accuracy. It is important to consider preanalytical factors such as sample collection, storage and transport when analyzing a laboratory blood glucose report. The measurement of glucose in interstitial fluid using continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) enables better understanding of glucose trends and fluctuations. The CGMS data should be reported using standard metrics which include parameters such as mean 24-h glucose, glycemic variability and time-in, below and above range. The measurement of glucose in urine sample is rarely ever used these days and should be reserved for exceptional circumstances.

Conclusion

This review provides a detailed account of various aspects of glucose measurement including their evolution, pitfalls, and their utility in current clinical practice.

### Does this patient have an exudative pleural effusion? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^116mtozu]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thoracentesis is performed to identify the cause of a pleural effusion. Although generally safe, thoracentesis may be complicated by transient hypoxemia, bleeding, patient discomfort, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax.

Objective

To identify the best means for differentiating between transudative and exudative effusions and also to identify thoracentesis techniques for minimizing the risk of complications by performing a systematic review the evidence.

Data Sources

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to February 2014 to identify relevant studies.

Study Selection

We included randomized and observational studies of adult patients undergoing thoracentesis that examined diagnostic tests for differentiating exudates from transudates and evaluated thoracentesis techniques associated with a successful procedure with minimal complications.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted data from studies of laboratory diagnosis of pleural effusion for calculation of likelihood ratios (LRs; n = 48 studies) and factors affecting adverse event rates (n = 37 studies).

Results

The diagnosis of an exudate was most accurate if cholesterol in the pleural fluid was greater than 55 mg/dL (LR range, 7.1–250), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was greater than 200 U/L (LR, 18; 95% CI, 6.8–46), or the ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to serum cholesterol was greater than 0.3 (LR, 14; 95% CI, 5.5–38). A diagnosis of exudate was less likely when all Light's criteria (a ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein > 0.5, a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH > 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH > two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH) were absent (LR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02–0.11). The most common complication of thoracentesis was pneumothorax, which occurred in 6.0% of cases (95% CI, 4.0%-7.0%). Chest tube placement was required in 2.0% of procedures (95% CI, 0.99%-2.9%) in which a patient was determined to have radiographic evidence of a pneumothorax. With ultrasound, a radiologist's marking the needle insertion site was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (skin marking vs no skin marking odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.08–1.7). Use of ultrasound by any experienced practitioner also was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.06–5.3).

Conclusions and Relevance

Light's criteria, cholesterol and pleural fluid LDH levels, and the pleural fluid cholesterol-to-serum ratio are the most accurate diagnostic indicators for pleural exudates. Ultrasound skin marking by a radiologist or ultrasound-guided thoracentesis were not associated with a decrease in pneumothorax events.

### Evaluation of two strategies for the interpretation of tumour markers in pleural effusions [^117LFPuy]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To obtain the maximum diagnostic yield from the measurement of tumour markers in pleural effusions, we support simultaneous determination of markers in fluid and serum with a low cut-off point in patients in whom no increases in TM due to benign disease are suspected (i.e. with ADA, CRP and PN% below the discriminant values). In patients in whom increases in TM due to benign disease are suspected, the strategy of a single determination in fluid may offer better diagnostic accuracy.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^111PcySH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Between 2009 and 2016, 93 patients presenting to our center with pleural effusions secondary to infection (excluding frank pus) were recruited and had biological samples stored. As control subjects, 31 cases of malignant effusions and 16 transudative effusions were also included in this analysis. The median age of patients with parapneumonic effusions was 66 years and there was a male predominance. Full patient demographics by etiology are represented in Table 1.

Table 1.
Patient Demographics, Baseline Biochemistry, and Pleural suPAR Levels

Pleural suPAR Levels in All Effusions

The median pleural suPAR of pleural effusions varied significantly by etiology, with parapneumonic effusions having significantly higher levels than malignancy and transudative effusions at baseline (P ≤ 0.01). Pleural suPAR was strongly correlated with the commonly used pleural fluid indicators of infection: pH (CC, −0.576; P < 0.01), glucose (CC, −0.632; P < 0.01), and LDH (CC, 0.596; P < 0.01), but not pleural fluid protein (CC, 0.057; P = 0.59) across all etiologies.

### Prognostic significance of pleural fluid microbiological positivity in pleural infection: a bicentric 10-year retrospective observational study [^113EbKFk]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a retrospective observational study which recruited patients in two acute-care hospitals in Hong Kong (Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital [PYNEH] and Ruttonjee Hospital [RH]). Adult patients admitted for pleural infection in the two hospitals over a 10-year period (1 January 2011 to 31 December 2020) were identified in a territory-wide healthcare electronic database (Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System) using the relevant discharge diagnosis codes consistent with parapneumonic effusion and empyema (ICD-9 codes 510.0, 510.9, 511.0 and 511.1). Exclusion criteria included (1) duplicated records, (2) no pleural fluid for analysis, (3) uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion not fulfilling the definition of pleural infection, (4) tuberculous pleuritis, and (5) pleural effusion of other causes.

Patients were included if they had a clinical presentation consistent with pleural infection, and any of the following criteria: (1) pleural fluid that was frank pus; or (2) pleural fluid that was positive on Gram staining or culture for bacteria; or (3) pleural fluid with a pH ≤ 7.2; or (4) pleural fluid with a low glucose level (≤ 2.2 mmol/l) or (5) contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) evidence of pleural infection (consolidation of underlying lung with enhancing pleural collection) in a patient with clinical evidence of infection, alongside exclusion of other sources of infection. Evidence of infection was assessed by the investigators based on the presence of fever, an elevated peripheral white blood cell (WBC), or elevated serum inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP). As the standard practice in the two participating hospitals, in patients with suspected pleural infection undergoing thoracentesis or drainage, the appearance of pleural fluid was documented routinely (pus or non-pus), and the pleural fluid was sent for gram staining and culture in plain bottle (without the use of blood culture bottle). Other pleural fluid analysis including pleural pH and glucose were arranged at the discretion of treating physician, if fluid volume is adequate.

### Factors influencing the measurement of pleural fluid pH [^114oXeWZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural fluid pH measurement is important in the management of patients with exudative pleural effusions, especially in guiding treatment of parapneumonic effusions. Common variations in the method used to sample pleural fluid affect the accuracy of the value obtained. This article reviews the effects of these variations.

Recent Findings

Pleural fluid pH is decreased by exposure to acidic fluids, such as retention of local anesthetic or heparin in the syringe or sampling following infiltration of local anesthetic. Exposure of the sample to air leads to an increase in pH. If immediate analysis is not possible, delay of up to 4 h does not cause a significant change in pH, even when the sample is kept at room temperature. It is essential that a blood gas analyzer is used to obtain accurate pH measurement. These factors have less effect on the glucose concentration, which may be used to guide management if an accurate pH value is not available.

Summary

Several common variables in collection method can lead to a clinically significant alteration in the pH value obtained. An evidence-based method for sampling and handling pleural fluid in order to obtain an accurate pH measurement is described.

### Thoracic involvement in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases: pathogenesis and management [^112JLLmi]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pleura

Pleural involvement is common in SLE and to a lesser extent in RA, but is a rare finding in other ARDs.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Pleural effusion is the most common pulmonary manifestation of SLE. Clinically relevant pleural effusion is observed in up to 50% of SLE patients during the disease course, with effusions being either bilateral or unilateral. The pathogenesis of lupus pleuritis involves immune complexes (IC) deposition from systemic circulation with activation of complement and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Long-standing disease, late-onset SLE, positive anti-RNP and anti-Smith antibodies are associated with a nearly twofold increased risk of developing pleuritis. In addition, pleural involvement is more common in patients with active disease and multiorgan involvement. Pleural fluid in lupus pleuritis is often exudative with increased leukocyte (i.e. neutrophils or lymphocytes) cell count. In patients without a previous diagnosis of SLE, the presence of high titres of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (i.e. > 1:160) in the pleural fluid supports the diagnosis of lupus pleuritis, although this phenomenon can also be observed in malignancies. When performed, pleural biopsies reveal non-specific findings, namely lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration, fibrosis and fibrinous pleuritis.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

Pleural effusion in RA is found in up to 20% of patients and is more frequent in middle-aged (> 50 years) males, particularly in patients with long-standing arthritis, smoking history and underlying lung disease. Rheumatoid effusion is usually exudative with low glucose levels and unilateral (generally affecting the left side) in the majority of patients (around 70%). The levels of RF in rheumatoid pleural effusion are generally similar or higher than those in the serum, with the presence of RF in the pleural effusion being strongly suggestive of a rheumatoid origin. Patients with rheumatoid effusions display also high levels of pleural sC5b-9 (a product of alternate pathway complement system activation) and low levels of C3, C4, indicating a local autoimmune activation.

### Longitudinal measurement of pleural fluid biochemistry and cytokines in malignant pleural effusions [^1143jXGK]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common. Existing literature on pleural fluid compositions is restricted to cross-sectional sampling with little information on longitudinal changes of fluid biochemistry and cytokines with disease progression. Indwelling pleural catheters provide the unique opportunity for repeated sampling and longitudinal evaluation of MPE, which may provide insight into tumor pathobiology.

Methods

We collected 638 MPE samples from 103 patients managed with indwelling pleural catheters over 95 days (median, range 0–735 days) and analyzed them for protein, pH, lactate dehydrogenase, and glucose levels. Peripheral blood was quantified for hematocrit, platelets, leukocytes, protein, and albumin. Cytokine levels (monocyte chemotactic protein [MCP]-1; vascular endothelial growth factor; interleukin-6, -8, and -10; tumor necrosis factor-α; and interferon-gamma) were determined in 298 samples from 35 patients with mesothelioma. Longitudinal changes of all parameters were analyzed using a linear mixed model.

Results

Significant decreases were observed over time in pleural fluid protein by 8 g/L per 100 days (SE, 1.32; P < .0001) and pH (0.04/100 days; SE, 0.02; p = 0.0203), accompanied by a nonsignificant rise in lactate dehydrogenase. The ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein decreased by 0.06/100 days (SE, 0.02; p = 0.04). MPEs from mesothelioma (n = 63) had lower pleural fluid glucose (P = 0.0104) at baseline and a faster rate of decline in glucose (P = 0.0423) when compared with non-mesothelioma effusions (n = 38). A progressive rise in mesothelioma pleural fluid concentration of [log] MCP-1 ([log] 0.37 pg/mL per 100 days; SE, 0.13; p = 0.0046), but not of other cytokines, was observed.

Conclusions

MPE fluids become less exudative and more acidic over the disease course. The rise in MCP-1 levels suggests a pathobiological role in MPE.

### Low pleural fluid-to-serum glucose gradient indicates pleuroperitoneal communication in peritoneal dialysis patients: presentation of two cases and a review of the literature [^112vvbTC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Transudative pleural effusions due to pleuroperitoneal communication occur in 1.6–10% of patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) and usually have overtly elevated glucose concentrations.

Methods

We report two cases of verified pleuroperitoneal communication with minimally elevated pleural fluid glucose levels. We reviewed the literature of all PD patients with pleuroperitoneal communication that reported pleural glucose levels to assess their clinical and laboratory features and pleural fluid-to-serum glucose gradients.

Results

We evaluated a total of 47 reported patients on PD with diagnosed pleuroperitoneal communication. Onset of the transudative pleural effusion after initiating PD was < 3 months in only 48%. Shortness of breath was reported in 96%. Pleural effusions were right sided in 87%. Pleural fluid-to-serum glucose gradients varied from 2 to 1885 mg/dL, with 20% ≤ 50 mg/dL, 13% being 51–100 and 67% > 100 mg/dL. All pleural fluid-to-serum glucose ratios were > 1.

Conclusions

With a transudative pleural effusion in patients receiving PD, a pleural fluid-to-serum glucose ratio > 1 is consistent with a pleuroperitoneal communication. In questionable cases, independent verification is necessary.

### Diagnostic performance of adenosine deaminase activity in pleural fluid in tuberculous pleural effusion and relevant factors: a single-center experience with 1, 491 consecutive patients [^113Q3Anf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our distribution pattern analysis reveals a clinically significant diagnostic challenge, demonstrating substantial overlap in ADA values between TPE and malignant pleural effusion within the 20–35 U/L interval, where ADA's discriminative power markedly declines. These findings argue against using absolute ADA cutoff values as definitive diagnostic thresholds and instead support establishing a 20–35 U/L "gray zone" requiring cautious interpretation, where clinicians should maintain high suspicion for TPE. This aligns with prior evidence from Kim et al. who identified similar diagnostic complexities in intermediate ADA ranges. Given these findings, we recommend adopting the integrated diagnostic approaches proposed by Liu et al. and Lee et al. when evaluating pleural effusions in this gray zone, which emphasize combining multiple parameters (e.g. biochemical markers including CEA and IFN-γ, radiographic features, and clinical predictors) through comprehensive scoring systems rather than relying on single biomarkers. This multidimensional strategy has been shown to significantly improve differential diagnostic accuracy for challenging effusions. Future validation studies should further refine these integrated models specifically for the 20–35 U/L ADA range to optimize clinical decision-making.

### Calprotectin: a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of pleural effusion [^1155JPjn]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Before the beginning of any treatment, the biochemical parameters of the pleural fluid (differential cell counts, pH, proteins, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose, and adenosine deaminase (ADA)) were analysed.

The aetiology of PE was determined based on accepted criteria as described by the Spanish Society for Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery. Two principal groups (MPE and BPE) were established for analysis. Malignant origin was defined when malignant cells were identified upon cytological or histological examination or in a biopsy specimen. Malignant origin cases were divided into three subgroups according to the PE aetiology: epithelial-origin neoplasias, mesotheliomas, and lymphomas. Patients with BPE were divided into five subgroups: tuberculous, parapneumonic, miscellaneous, paramalignant, and non-neoplastic of unknown origin. The diagnosis of tuberculous PE was based on the presence of positive stain or culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the pleural fluid, sputum, or pleural biopsy or the presence of typical caseating granulomas in the pleural biopsy. Any PE associated with pneumonia and response to antibiotics was classified as parapneumonic effusion. The miscellaneous group included PE that fulfilled the specific criteria for the diagnosis of PE of diverse origin (post-surgery, chylothorax, secondary to collagen vascular disease, secondary to drug reactions, Dressler's syndrome, uraemic pleuritis, post-trauma, or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome). Paramalignant PE refers to effusions caused by the indirect effects of cancer on the pleural space or the pleural effects of cancer radiation or drug therapy. Non-neoplastic PE of unknown origin was defined as PE comprising non-specific pleuritis observed at thoracoscopy, thoracotomy, biopsy, or autopsy, or the absence of symptoms or recurrence of PE within 1-year clinical and radiological follow-up.

PE sampling

Pleural fluid samples (5 ml) were obtained, centrifuged at 800 g for 15 min and immediately frozen in 0.5 mL aliquots at −20 °C.

Biochemical procedures

Calprotectin levels were determined using a sandwich ELISA from Hycult Biotechnology (Uden, The Netherlands). The laboratory calprotectin test was conducted completely independently of clinical diagnosis and treatment. The assay was conducted according to the manufacturer's guidelines.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1 with huge intrathoracic meningoceles misdiagnosed as pleural effusion: a case report and literature review [^111jMHHg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large low-density image in the right thoracic cavity, and a defect was observed in part of the vertebral plate in the thoracic spine (Fig. 1). The chest tube brought from local hospital was ineffective in draining the fluid, leading us to conduct a thoracoscopy to investigate the cause of the pleural effusion. The intraoperative exploration revealed that the drainage tube was in the thoracic cavity with only a small amount of fluid present. The pleurae appeared normal with no nodules, and the pleural biopsy results were normal as well (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, postoperative plain chest X-rays showed a significant pleural effusion still present in the right thorax, contradicting the findings of the thoracoscopy.

Fig. 1
Chest CT scan revealed a large low-density mass in the right thoracic cavity that extended into the spinal canal. Scoliosis deformity in the thoracic spine, a defect on the right side of the T3-T5 thoracic vertebrae, and enlargement of the spinal canal and intervertebral foramen

Fig. 2
The thoracoscope confirmed the presence of a drainage tube within the thoracic cavity. The figures indicated minimal fluid accumulation and smooth pleurae, and a tissue biopsy was conducted

This raises the question of what caused the sudden accumulation of such a large amount of fluid in the pleural cavity and why it was not detected during the thoracoscopy. To address this issue, we replaced the original chest drainage tube with a new one guided by ultrasound. Following the insertion of the new tube, approximately 1000 mL of clear liquid was drained, leading to a significant relief in the patient's chest tightness symptoms. However, she developed a severe headache the following day and found relief by lying flat on her back. Subsequent analysis of the hydrothorax revealed a white blood cell count of 11 × 10⁶/L, lactate dehydrogenase level of 36U/L, total protein level of 3.7 g/L, and glucose level of 3.21 mmol/L. Cytology examination confirmed the absence of malignant tumor cells in the pleural effusion. Furthermore, thorough examination and data analysis ruled out heart failure, hepatic and renal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, and hypoproteinemia.

### Critical analysis of the utility of initial pleural aspiration in the diagnosis and management of suspected malignant pleural effusion [^112stTAQ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

The currently used pathway for investigation of potential MPE has been unchanged for over 15 years, despite new evidence on cytological accuracy, requirement for molecular markers and no modern re-assessment of the utility of biochemical results. Pleural aspiration as an initial diagnostic step is promoted based on being less invasive than pleural biopsy techniques, allowing diagnosis of NEL and providing important information including 'diagnostic' cytology and the presence of transudate. In this study, we adopted a pragmatic approach to assess if the current BTS pathway remains relevant to modern practice and to ensure that recently published study results are applicable to real-world practice.

In the present study, 3% of those with confirmed MPE had transudative biochemistry, which is consistent with previously published data. It is widely recognised that pH and glucose may be low in both MPE and many other pathologies. These data suggest that biochemical results alone are insufficient to completely exclude MPE as a cause of an undiagnosed effusion.

Sensitivity of PF for cytological diagnosis is between 46% and 67% for patients with MPE, although a recent study showed that it was not possible to identify all the 'necessary predictive markers' in 47% of cases. The aim of the present study was to use a pragmatic approach to determine the utility of the information gleaned from PF cytology, that is, whether the information was sufficient to guide ongoing management. A positive management decision covered a spectrum of outcomes from palliation at one end to initiation of mutation driven oncological therapies at the other. Despite this broad range of acceptable outcomes, an initial pleural aspiration provided sufficient information to guide management in only 63% of patients who had initially positive PF cytology, and in 32% of cases of MPE as a whole. If the analysis also included patients with 'presumed' MPE, the success rate is likely to be even lower.

Pleural fluid eosinophilia and malignancy

Comparative analysis of patients with malignant versus nonmalignant EPE showed that patients with malignant EPE were significantly older and had a smaller WBC count in the pleural fluid (1.8 vs 4.7 cells × 10⁹/L, P < 0.05) (Table 4). However, the percentage of eosinophils in PE was not significantly different between malignant EPE and nonmalignant EPE (p = 0.66).

Data are presented as the mean (range) or n (%). MEPE malignant eosinophilic pleural effusion, WBC white blood cell, LYM lymphocyte, EO eosinophil, RBC red blood cell, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, ADA adenosine deaminase, GLU glucose, CEA carcinoembryonic antigen

Pleural fluid eosinophilia and other laboratory parameters

In EPE, there was a positive correlation between the percentage of eosinophils and ADA in PE (r = 0.383 p = 0.025), and a reverse correlation between eosinophils and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in PE (r = − 0.396, p = 0.021). There was a significant correlation between the percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood and WBC count in PE (r = 0.453, p = 0.007). However, there was no correlation between the percentage of eosinophils in PE and peripheral blood (r = 0.29; p = 0.09). There were no noteworthy relationships between eosinophils in PE and other laboratory parameters. There was no significant difference between cases of EPE with peripheral eosinophilia and those with normal peripheral eosinophil count (Table 4).
