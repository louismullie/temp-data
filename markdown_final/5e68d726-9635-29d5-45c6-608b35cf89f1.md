## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which therapy is most appropriate for a 63-year-old man with acute decompensated heart failure presenting with orthopnea, pulmonary rales, and bilateral pitting edema, and to choose among furosemide, normal saline, terlipressin, or norepinephrine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and hemodynamic profile. Then, I should verify guideline-directed initial therapy for congestion. Next, I will examine why the alternatives are inappropriate or harmful. After that, I need to check dosing strategy, including renal function considerations. Finally, I will outline monitoring and safety checks to ensure effective decongestion without precipitating renal injury or hypotension.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and hemodynamic profile. The combination of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, fine rales, and 2+ pitting edema in a patient with prior MI strongly supports acute decompensated heart failure with volume overload, and the blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 88/min suggests a "warm and wet" phenotype rather than cardiogenic shock, which aligns with standard ED phenotyping of acute heart failure presentations [^ed01d7b9] [^0c6a9c7e].

> Wait, let me verify the initial therapy for congestion. Contemporary guidelines consistently recommend intravenous loop diuretics as first-line therapy for hospitalized HF with signs of fluid overload, with the goal of rapid decongestion and symptom relief; this is a Class 1 recommendation in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline and reiterated in the 2024 ACC expert consensus pathways for hospitalized HF management [^f38c27af] [^0dacd237] [^7de52bfd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dosing. I should confirm the approach in someone already on outpatient furosemide. The DOSE trial and subsequent pathways support using an IV dose 1–2.5 times the total daily oral dose, typically 40–80 mg IV if no prior loop diuretic, and repeating or escalating based on response; given his home "as-needed" furosemide, a pragmatic starting point is 40 mg IV with reassessment at 1–2 hours and escalation if urine output and symptoms are inadequate [^7de52bfd] [^0dacd237] [^d77e726e].

> I need to ensure renal function does not preclude loop diuretics. A creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL corresponds to an eGFR around 35–40 mL/min/1.73 m², which is not a contraindication; loop diuretics remain indicated in CKD, though higher doses may be required and closer monitoring is warranted, so I should plan for serial creatinine and electrolytes rather than withholding diuresis [^91636fa1] [^1e47142e].

> Let me consider why the alternatives are inappropriate. Normal saline would worsen volume overload and pulmonary edema in a congested HF patient, so that would be counterproductive; terlipressin is a vasopressin analog used for variceal bleeding and hepatorenal syndrome, not for routine HF decongestion; norepinephrine is reserved for hypotensive cardiogenic shock or profound vasodilatory shock, and this patient is not hypotensive or in shock, so vasopressors would be inappropriate and potentially harmful here [^0dacd237] [^ed01d7b9].

> Next, I should review adjuncts and sequencing. If dyspnea remains severe or blood pressure allows, adding a vasodilator such as IV nitrates can improve symptoms and hemodynamics, and noninvasive ventilation can be considered for respiratory distress, but these are adjuncts to, not replacements for, loop diuretics; I should also remember that early IV furosemide is associated with improved outcomes in registries, reinforcing timely administration in the ED [^4fb90928] [^0c6a9c7e].

> I will now examine monitoring and safety. I should double-check urine output, daily weights, blood pressure, and electrolytes every 4–8 hours initially, watching for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and creatinine rises; if diuretic response is inadequate, I should escalate the loop dose, add a thiazide-type diuretic for sequential nephron blockade, or consider a continuous infusion strategy, while avoiding excessive diuresis that could precipitate hypotension or renal injury in this borderline BP and CKD context [^0dacd237] [^f38c27af] [^9629d4d6].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate therapy is intravenous furosemide for rapid decongestion, with an initial dose of 40 mg IV over 1–2 minutes, reassessing at 1–2 hours and escalating to 80 mg if needed, while monitoring vitals, urine output, electrolytes, and renal function; this aligns with guideline-directed care and the patient's hemodynamic profile, and the alternatives either worsen congestion or are indicated for different clinical scenarios [^d77e726e] [^f38c27af] [^0dacd237].

---

The most appropriate therapy for this 63-year-old male with acute decompensated heart failure and volume overload is **intravenous furosemide** [^f38c27af] to rapidly relieve congestion, with dosing 1–2.5× his oral dose [^7de52bfd] and close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^0dacd237]. Normal saline would worsen edema, terlipressin is not indicated for heart failure, and norepinephrine is reserved for shock or severe hypotension [^ed01d7b9].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

The patient presents with classic signs of **acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF)** [^ed01d7b9]:

- **Dyspnea and orthopnea**: Suggestive of pulmonary congestion.
- **Fine rales on lung examination**: Indicative of pulmonary edema.
- **Bilateral lower extremity pitting edema**: Suggestive of systemic congestion.
- **Elevated BUN and creatinine**: Indicate renal dysfunction, likely due to cardiorenal syndrome.

Given the history of myocardial infarction and current clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is **ADHF with volume overload** [^ed01d7b9].

---

## Rationale for therapy selection

### Furosemide (loop diuretic)

- **Indication**: Intravenous loop diuretics are first-line therapy for ADHF with volume overload [^f38c27af] [^0dacd237].
- **Mechanism**: Inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle, promoting diuresis and reducing intravascular volume.
- **Clinical evidence**: The DOSE trial demonstrated that higher initial IV doses (2.5× oral dose) result in greater fluid and weight loss, and improved dyspnea relief by 72 hours [^7de52bfd].
- **Dosing**: For patients already on oral loop diuretics, the initial IV dose should be 1–2.5× the total daily oral dose [^7de52bfd]. Given the patient's intermittent furosemide use, a reasonable starting dose would be 40–80 mg IV, with subsequent dosing adjusted based on response and renal function [^0dacd237].

---

### Normal saline

Normal saline is **contraindicated** in this patient because it would exacerbate volume overload and pulmonary edema, worsening symptoms and potentially leading to respiratory failure [^notfound].

---

### Terlipressin

Terlipressin, a vasopressin analog, is **not indicated** for heart failure management. It is primarily used in hepatorenal syndrome and variceal bleeding, and there is no evidence supporting its use in ADHF.

---

### Norepinephrine

Norepinephrine is a vasopressor indicated for **severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock** [^cd58f9d2]. This patient's blood pressure is 108/60 mmHg, which, although low-normal, does not meet criteria for shock or require vasopressor support [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

- **Renal function**: Monitor serum creatinine and BUN closely, as aggressive diuresis can worsen renal function, particularly in cardiorenal syndrome [^b4541870].
- **Electrolytes**: Monitor potassium, sodium, and chloride levels regularly to detect and manage electrolyte disturbances [^88e5208c].
- **Clinical response**: Assess for improvement in dyspnea, reduction in edema, and increased urine output to guide further dosing [^0dacd237].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate therapy for this patient is **intravenous furosemide** [^f38c27af] to rapidly relieve congestion, with dosing 1–2.5× his oral dose and close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^0dacd237]. Normal saline would worsen edema, terlipressin is not indicated for heart failure, and norepinephrine is reserved for shock or severe hypotension [^ed01d7b9].

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)—scope and general assumptions emphasize that this pathway primarily addresses chronic HFrEF with LVEF ≤40% in the ambulatory setting without clinical instability, and that patients presenting with orthopnea or uncomfortable peripheral edema should first receive diuretic agent therapy with early follow-up to ensure progress toward decongestion before applying subsequent steps. The Writing Committee endorses evidence-based approaches enumerated in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guideline, the algorithms assume multidisciplinary input as needed to guide clinical management, and patient preferences and values, in addition to evidence-based clinical judgment, should guide clinical decision-making; these suggestions and algorithms may be superseded by new data.

Conclusion

In summary, although the use of furosemide could help to improve the lung CT imaging findings in patients with HAPE, there are no significant benefits in terms of length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. Clinicians still need to assess the use of such medications based on individual circumstances. And we suggest that in cases where standardized treatment centers can be accessed promptly, the decision to delay descent to a lower altitude may be considered.

Decongestion with diuretic and adjunctive therapy—initial inpatient dosing and continuation: Establishing an effective diuretic regimen is crucial for achieving decongestion, and first doses, often given in the emergency department (ED), are generally based on previous home loop diuretic doses, as in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial. For patients already on outpatient loop diuretics, the total daily dose should be changed to an oral furosemide equivalent and administered intravenously (IV) at 1 to 2.5 times the total daily dose. For patients not previously on outpatient diuretics, the initial furosemide dose usually is around 40 to 80 mg IV daily. In the DOSE trial, initiation of the 2.5 times higher dose led to 37% more fluid loss, 43% more weight loss, and greater dyspnea relief by 72 hours. Diuretic agents are usually continued throughout the early hospital stay, either by IV bolus every 8 to 12 hours or by continuous IV infusion.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Adults: Parenteral therapy with Furosemide Injection should be used only in patients unable to take oral medication or in emergency situations and should be replaced with oral therapy as soon as practical.

Edema

The usual initial dose of furosemide is 20 to 40 mg given as a single dose, injected intramuscularly or intravenously. The intravenous dose should be given slowly (1 to 2 minutes). Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, another dose may be administered in the same manner 2 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 mg and given not sooner than 2 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. This individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily. Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response. Close medical supervision is necessary.

When furosemide is given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable. (See PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests .)

If the physician elects to use high dose parenteral therapy, add the furosemide to either Sodium Chloride Injection USP, Lactated Ringer's Injection USP, or Dextrose (5%) Injection USP after pH has been adjusted to above 5.5, and administer as a controlled intravenous infusion at a rate not greater than 4 mg/min. Furosemide Injection is a buffered alkaline solution with a pH of about 9 and drug may precipitate at pH values below 7. Care must be taken to ensure that the pH of the prepared infusion solution is in the weakly alkaline to neutral range. Acid solutions, including other parenteral medications (e.g., labetalol, ciprofloxacin, amrinone, milrinone) must not be administered concurrently in the same infusion because they may cause precipitation of the furosemide. In addition, furosemide injection should not be added to a running intravenous line containing any of these acidic products.

Acute Pulmonary Edema

The usual initial dose of furosemide is 40 mg injected slowly intravenously (over 1 to 2 minutes). If a satisfactory response does not occur within 1 hour, the dose may be increased to 80 mg injected slowly intravenously (over 1 to 2 minutes).

If necessary, additional therapy (e.g., digitalis, oxygen) may be administered concomitantly.

Geriatric Patients

In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. (See PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use .)

Treatment for Patients During the First Days of Admission forHas Not Been Shown to Improve Outcomes

About 20 years ago, it was suggested that the treatment of AHF can be divided into 3 major stages: first, the initial stabilization, then the first few days in the hospital, and finally before and after discharge.

The interventions administered to patients during the first hours of admission for AHF are based on little evidence. The most common treatment administered is intravenous furosemide or other types of loop diuretics. This practice is endorsed by all guidelines. For instance, the 2022 Heart Failure Clinical Practice Guidelinesinclude a level 1 recommendation for diuretics in the initial treatment of AHF, but with level B‐NR evidence (nonrandomized studies). Nonetheless, the use of intravenous loop diuretics to decrease congestion in patients with AHF during the initial first few hours of admission is important for symptom relief. The effect of this therapy on short‐ and longer‐term outcomes is, however, not known. Keeping loop diuretics as a background therapy, studies have been done throughout the years to assess the addition of other treatments early in the AHF admission. Two small studies,suggested an early benefit of intravenous nitrates on oxygenation and need for mechanical ventilation for early myocardial infarction in patients with pulmonary edema; however, a recent study has shown that those strategies do not improve short‐term outcomes.Noninvasive ventilation was also proposed as a way to improve both patients' symptoms and outcomes in the immediate stabilization of AHF; however, a prospective studyhas shown that noninvasive ventilation improves patients' dyspnea but has no effect on short‐term outcomes. Therefore, as of now, guidelines recommend the use of diuretics as the first‐line treatment of patients with AHF. Other therapies, such as intravenous vasodilators and noninvasive ventilation, can be considered for symptom improvement, but these interventions do not seem to improve short‐term outcomes.

### Effect of furosemide in the treatment of high-altitude pulmonary edema [^feaeea7a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The average time of onset for HAPE in this study was approximately 4 days after arriving at high-altitude areas, which is consistent with the 2–5 days reported in the previous literature. The latest onset of symptoms in our study occurred on the tenth day after entering the high-altitude area, which is later than what has been reported in the literature. This difference may be related to variations in factors such as oxygen supply facilities, level of exertion, and individual susceptibility.

Further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is needed to elucidate the impact of imaging improvements on clinical outcomes and to better understand the various factors influencing hospital stay duration in HAPE patients.

Limitation

As our study is retrospective, it is prone to bias. The mortality rate of patients with HAPE after formal treatment is lower, and a larger sample size is needed to determine the effect of furosemide on in-hospital mortality in patients with HAPE.

### Rituximab induced lung injury [^aaabb593]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 73-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of DLBCL presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of worsening shortness of breath and hypoxemia 88% on room air requiring 2–3 L supplemental oxygen. Her social history includes a 25-pack year of tobacco smoking which she quit 33 years before her diagnosis. Pertinent family history includes breast cancer in her mother and sister. The patient has received both sars-cov-2 and influenza vaccination for the year.

Two weeks prior to her current presentation, patient had received the first cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP). Her initial infusion was complicated by an episode of lacy, erythematous rash that was attributed to potential hypersensitivity reaction. A week after administration, she was noted to have persistent dyspnea associated with small pleural effusion and lower extremity edema. She was started on a diuretic for concern for possible volume overload with a close follow up in a week. No thoracentesis was done given small size and no safe window.

Upon presentation to the emergency department, she was visibly dyspneic at rest and with minimal exertion. Initial vitals showed a normal temperature of 36.9 °C, blood pressure, 124/75 and heart rate at 100 beats per minute. On physical examination, her pulmonary auscultation revealed diffuse rhonchi with decreased breath sounds at the left lower lung base and 1 + putting edema in the lower extremity.

Initial work up in the emergency room included complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), Troponin, prothrombin (PT) and international normalized ration (INR), Urinalysis, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), electrocardiogram (EKG), chest radiography (chest x-ray), and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest. EKG showed premature atrial complexes, inferior infarct, and a shortened QT interval. Chest x-ray revealed a left perihilar opacity and a small left pleural effusion. Chest tomography angiogram of the chest revealed no pulmonary embolism, multifocal ground glass opacities (GGO) present in all five lobes, emphysema, and trace left pleural effusion with atelectasis (Fig. 1). Labs demonstrated mildly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count.

Case presentation

A 70-year-old Chinese man was admitted to our hospital complaining of a 12-h history of paroxysmal chest distress and chest pain. He had a past medical history of midbrain hemorrhage 6 years ago. He denied a history of hypertension, diabetes, paroxysmal headache, palpitations, or profuse sweating. He denied a history of drug abuse or recent intense emotional stress. His family history was unremarkable. The patient, without obvious inducement, suddenly experienced chest tightness and pain while in bed at 1 a.m. The paroxysmal chest pain lasted about 1 h each time and was accompanied by a feeling of crushing in the precordial region, sweating, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and nausea. Upon admission, a physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 185/122 mmHg, a heart rate of 100 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min. A pulmonary examination showed diffuse moist rales in the lungs. The initial results of laboratory findings (Table 1) showed elevated white blood cell count, myocardial enzyme, and troponin I levels. The extremely high levels of brain natriuretic peptide and arterial blood gases suggested that the patient might have heart and respiratory failure. Electrocardiography findings suggested sinus tachycardia and mild ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6. A pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary edema and a massive lesion in the left adrenal area. Transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular regional wall (apical wall and mid septal wall) motion abnormalities with an ejection fraction of 34%. The clinical diagnosis was ACS, heart failure, and respiratory failure. The patient was given a venturi mask for oxygen inhalation, morphine for pain relief and vasodilation, furosemide for diuresis, isosorbide nitrate for coronary artery dilation, aspirin combined with clopidogrel for antiplatelets, low molecular weight heparin for anticoagulation, and atorvastatin for lipid- lowering.

### Intravenous furosemide for acute decompensated congestive heart failure: what is the evidence? [^ceb48d6a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Use of intravenous furosemide rather than oral administration in acute decompensated congestive cardiac failure is universally recommended in international guidelines. We argue that this recommendation is not supported by the existing evidence, and suggest that trials should be performed to determine whether larger doses of oral furosemide should be prescribed prior to an IV switch. This could reduce length of hospital admissions and allow for more patients to be managed in the primary care setting.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure—diuretic therapy management and risks: Electrolyte imbalances should be treated aggressively and the diuresis continued, and if hypotension or azotemia occurs the physician may elect to slow the rapidity of diuresis, but diuresis should nevertheless be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated, even if this strategy results in mild or moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Once fluid retention has resolved, treatment with the diuretic should be maintained to prevent the recurrence of volume overload, with dose adjustment often accomplished by having patients record their weight each day and make changes in their diuretic dosage if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Patients may become unresponsive to high doses if they consume large amounts of dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block the effects of diuretics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo- oxygenase-2 inhibitors), or have a significant impairment of renal function or perfusion, but diuretic resistance can generally be overcome by the intravenous administration of diuretics (including the use of continuous infusions), the use of 2 or more diuretics in combination (e.g., furosemide and metolazone), or the use of diuretics together with drugs that increase renal blood flow (e.g., positive inotropic agents). Diuretics can cause the depletion of potassium and magnesium and can predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis therapy, and the risk of electrolyte depletion is markedly enhanced when 2 diuretics are used in combination; concomitant administration of ACEIs alone or in combination with potassium-retaining agents (such as spironolactone) can prevent electrolyte depletion in most patients with HF who are taking a loop diuretic, and when these drugs are prescribed, long-term oral potassium supplementation is generally not needed and may be deleterious. Excessive use of diuretics can decrease blood pressure and impair renal function and exercise tolerance; if there are no signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia are likely to be related to volume depletion and may resolve after a reduction in diuretic dose, whereas the signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia, are likely to reflect worsening HF and a decline in effective peripheral perfusion, which is an ominous clinical scenario and necessitates considering the measures discussed under Stage D HF.

### Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement to treat multijet paravalvular regurgitation: a case series and review [^80b62521]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

3 CASE 2

A 69‐year‐old male presented for evaluation of known moderate to severe PVR with symptoms of progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and weight gain 2 months after coronary artery bypass surgery and aortic valve replacement at another institution. His past medical history included nonsmall cell lung cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 3‐vessel coronary artery disease. The patient had originally presented after a non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction with severe aortic stenosis and severe coronary artery disease. At the time of his 3‐vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and open surgical aortic valve replacement the surgery was complicated by inability to advance a 23 mm sizer through the sinotubular junction due to severe calcium, which resulted in the placement of an undersized 21 mm Magna valve (Edwards, Irvine, California). At the completion of the surgery, intraoperative imaging revealed moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, but the calcium was felt prohibitive for repair and the patient was referred to our institution.

On presentation, the patient was wheelchair bound with New York Heart Association Class IV symptoms and was hypoxic requiring supplemental oxygen. Examination identified a diastolic murmur, 4 + lower extremity edema, and bibasilar rales.

TEE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% to 60%, grade III diastolic dysfunction, and moderate PVR with two distinct jets in the noncoronary sinus (Figure 2A,B). The patient improved clinically with careful diuresis and further imaging with computed tomography suggested his aortic annulus actually measured 2.2 x 2.6 cm, larger than the 21 mm valve placed at surgery. Based on this, the PVR was felt to be due to the placement of an undersized 21 mm valve. Given excessive open surgical risk for this bedridden patient, transcatheter options were considered. This magna valve true inner diameter of 19 mm. 5 ViV TAVR with balloon fracture of the surgical valve ring was felt the most appropriate method to address his regurgitation. 6

Case Presentation

A 60-year-old man with no significant medical history presented to the pulmonology clinic with 2 years of progressive weakness and shortness of breath. Showering and other activities of daily living caused him significant fatigue and dyspnea. He had a 20-pack-year smoking history, but no significant history of alcohol or illicit drug use. He did not take any prescribed or over-the-counter medications for chronic medical conditions and had never been on statin therapy. Vital signs were significant for an oxygen saturation of 91% on 4-L nasal cannula. He required up to 6 L of oxygen during a walk test. Physical examination showed mild inspiratory crackles in the lung bases, loud splitting of the second pulmonic valve (P2) with a right parasternal heave, and 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. There was muscle weakness, pain, and wasting of the proximal upper and lower extremities, particularly in his legs. He denied any joint pain, and there was no evidence of rash or dysphagia.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected and known heart failure: 2024 update [^28e28090]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent and complex clinical syndrome with no single reference standard diagnostic test. Imaging has a supportive role in patients with suspected and known HF, including initial imaging assessment of an adult with suspected HF, but without history of HF, including evaluation of pulmonary edema and detection of left ventricular dysfunction (Variant 1). In adults with established diagnosis of HF but unknown etiology, imaging also has an important role in the assessment of the underlying disease process, including ischemic and nonischemic etiologies (Variant 2). In the course of continuing care for adult patients with an established diagnosis of HF without new symptoms, follow-up imaging is performed to assess for longitudinal changes in ventricular function, response to therapy and prognostication (Variant 3). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure: recognition, risk stratification, and treatment review [^45f294ab]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) has emerged as a major healthcare problem. It causes approximately 3% of all hospitalizations in the United States, with the direct medical cost of these hospitalizations estimated at $18.8 billion per year. Early recognition, risk stratification, and evidence-based treatment are crucial in reducing the morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with this disorder. Classic signs and symptoms of ADHF, such as rales, dyspnea, and peripheral edema, may be absent at hospital presentation and, even when present, are not specific to this disorder. As a result, serum B-type natriuretic peptide level is now used to rapidly and accurately detect ADHF. Multivariate analyses have identified renal dysfunction, hypotension, advanced age, hyponatremia, and comorbidities as significant and independent mortality risk factors. Based on these factors, mortality risk can be stratified from very low to very high using published algorithms that have been validated in independent populations. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of ADHF are available from both the European Society of Cardiology and the Heart Failure Society of America. In general, an intravenous loop diuretic, either alone or in combination with a vasodilator, is recommended as initial therapy in patients with volume overload, depending on the patient's clinical status. Use of inotropic agents should be limited to the small subset of patients with low-output syndrome and significant hypotension. In any event, frequent monitoring of clinical response is essential, with subsequent therapy determined by this response. Finally, focused patient education during hospitalization may help reduce readmissions for ADHF.

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) is a life-threatening condition that is frequently encountered in standard emergency medicine practice. Traditionally, diagnosis was based on physical assessment and chest radiography and treatment focused on the use of morphine sulfate and diuretics. Numerous advances in diagnosis and treatment have been made, however. Serum testing for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has improved the accuracy of diagnoses in these patients. Treatment should focus on fluid redistribution with aggressive preload and afterload reduction rather than simply on diuresis. Some specific medications and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have been shown to be safe and rapidly effective in improving patients' symptoms and improve outcomes.

AHF: a diagnostic and management challenge

AHF is a syndrome rather than a diagnosis per se, caused by a wide array of pathologies that result in a spectrum of disease severity ranging from breathlessness to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. AHF is a highly lethal condition, and studies have shown that minimizing the ‘time to appropriate therapy’ — the initiation of treatment as soon as possible, including in the prehospital setting — is potentially beneficial in improving outcomes,. AHF is variably defined as the rapid onset or acute worsening of symptoms and signs of heart failure that is associated with elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides,. However, substantial diagnostic uncertainty is inevitable when relying only on traditional clinical findings, and currently a lack of specificity exists in routine investigations for this condition. Indeed, although patients often present with a suggestive history, clinical features (such as shock, and pulmonary or peripheral congestion), and/or symptoms related to the underlying potential cause, these traditional clinical features are frequently absent; over-reliance on these factors might delay diagnosis and implementation of appropriate therapy, or contribute to a missed diagnosis in up to 20% of patients,. Furthermore, patients’ clinical features might vary according to the site of initial medical contact and the management strategies employed,.

The majority of patients with AHF present to emergency departments; however, many patient are also assessed and managed in other acute care settings such as in intensive care and inpatient cardiology units. Patients with AHF usually present with symptoms of congestion and breathlessness rather than cardiac arrest or shock. Symptoms of breathlessness account for 3–5% of emergency department attendances in Europe and the USA, and the major causes of breathlessness and their prevalence include AHF (50%), pneumonia or bronchitis (20%), exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (20%), and pulmonary embolism (5–10%),. Current guidelines recommend that clinical examination and investigations should be integrated to form the diagnosis, including the use of electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph, and biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides, troponin, and D-dimer as indicated,,. Unfortunately, these data can be challenging to interpret, in particular in the 10–15% of patients in whom two concomitant diagnoses exist,,. Specifically, although included in the current definition of AHF, levels of natriuretic peptides can be elevated in respiratory disease and other acute conditions such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and anaemia –.

A case of C.X.Z, male aged 39-year old, and farmer by profession was wheeled into our department with severe symptoms of subacute RHF. His spouse narrated that in January,2018, he had experienced mild bilateral swelling of lower limbs (in form of stockings), and was managed on diuretics for about 7 days, after which symptoms disappeared completely. She denied him having had any cardiac surgery, chest radiation, tuberculosis or significant chest trauma. 8 months after initial symptoms, thus in October,2018, he suddenly developed chest pain, which he thought was due to long working hours in the field. On-counter remedies (pain killers) offered temporal relief. After 2-days of progressive chest pain, patient begun experiencing abdominal discomfort and observed swelling of feet after bed. On the 4th day in his illness, he developed shortness, a development that prompted him seek medical attention.

On presentation the patient through his spouse complained of breathing difficulties, abdominal fullness and swelling of lower limbs. She further narrated that, during bed time, shortness of breath worsened upon lying flat. During physical examination, patient exhibited incoherent talk, responded to various questions with same answer repeatedly. Both the neck veins (JVD~ > 15mmH2O) and abdomen were highly distended. Chest auscultation demonstrated a ‘cardiac knock’, and both S 1 and S 2 were muffled. Abdominal palpation revealed gross ascites.

### Evolving therapeutic strategies for patients hospitalized with new or worsening heart failure across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction [^0c6a9c7e]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2 Therapeutic strategies in de novo AHF –time‐sensitive early stabilization

Akin to the time‐sensitive diagnostic and management strategies employed for both ST‐segment myocardial infarction and stroke, the clock for AHF management begins with the initial point of medical contact.,Urgent intervention at this early stage is imperative, as persistent neurohormonal activation, intravascular congestion, hemodynamic perturbations, and systemic inflammation may precipitate preventable myocardial injury and end‐organ dysfunction with implications for near‐ and long‐term death and disability.,However, expeditious diagnosis can be challenging owing to the clinically and hemodynamically protean manifestations of AHF.Major AHF phenotypes, diagnostic modalities, and common cardiac and noncardiac precipitants are discussed in detail elsewhere.

As over 80% of patients with AHF are clinically stable and without signs or symptoms of hemodynamic compromise (i.e. “warm and wet”) at presentation,,the cornerstone of initial therapy is decongestion. Intravenous loop diuretics are favored owing to their efficacy and rapid onset of action, and urgent therapy is critical. In the REALITY‐AHF registry, a door‐to‐furosemide time of <60 min was associated with 61% lower odds of in‐hospital mortality.Among patients not receiving loop diuretics at baseline, as is often the case in de novo HF, an initial trial dose of 20–80 mg of intravenous furosemide is typically recommended on the basis of expert opinion.To ensure attainment of decongestion targets, the diuretic response along with hemodynamic factors and serum electrolytes should be re‐evaluated every 4–8 hours, with adjustments made accordingly. Parallel attention to underlying triggers, complications, and comorbidities should also be given at this stage, as these may either inform or restrict concomitant therapeutic actions. Whenever possible, initial therapies should be directed to the underlying cause of AHF, if apparent.

Diuretic therapy (Figure 6)—in hospitalized heart failure, initiate IV loop diuretics early (ED or immediately after admission) with an initial dose usually 1-2.5 times total daily oral loop diuretic agent in furosemide equivalents, and prescribe IV diuretics every 8-12 hrs or continuous while measuring daily weights and urine output and monitoring vital signs and congestion; consider addition of SGLT inhibitors for chronic therapy and consider adjunct diuretic agent such as acetazolamide. For Adequate diuresis, continue diuretics with target relief of congestion and plan for transition to oral therapy. For Inadequate diuresis, usually increase loop diuretic agent dose by 50%-100% and consider other thiazides or additional diuretic agents. For Refractory to diuretics, change course by escalating diuretics, considering additional diuretic agents or other decongestion strategies, and consider hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy.

Key points
- Heart failure happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in your body.
- Certain medical conditions can increase your risk for heart failure. Overview Heart failure happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in your body. Heart failure is a serious condition, but it does not mean that the heart has stopped beating. Deaths from heart failure vary by geography Heart failure is more common in some areas of the United States than in others. Below is a map showing the rate of death from heart failure by county. Symptoms Common symptoms of heart failure include:
- Shortness of breath during daily activities.
- Trouble breathing when lying down.
- Weight gain with swelling in the feet, legs, ankles, or stomach.
- Generally feeling tired or weak.

Risk factors Certain medical conditions can increase your risk for heart failure, including:
- Coronary artery disease and heart attacks.
- Diabetes
- High blood pressure
- Obesity
- Other conditions related to heart disease
- Heart valve disease Unhealthy behaviors can also increase your risk for heart failure, especially for people who have one of the conditions listed above. Unhealthy behaviors include:
- Smoking tobacco.
- Eating foods high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium.
- Not getting enough physical activity.
- Excessive alcohol intake. Treatment and recovery Early diagnosis and treatment can improve quality and length of life for people who have heart failure. Treatment usually involves the following:
- Taking medicines.
- Reducing sodium in the diet.
- Drinking less liquids.
- Using devices that remove excess salt and water from the blood.
- Having heart transplant and other surgeries.
- Getting daily physical activity.

People with heart failure also track their symptoms each day so that they can discuss these symptoms with their health care team.

Diuretics in hospitalized heart failure: synopsis and supportive context. Intravenous loop diuretic therapy provides the most rapid and effective treatment for signs and symptoms of congestion leading to hospitalization for HF. Titration to achieve effective diuresis may require doubling of initial doses, adding a thiazide diuretic, or adding an MRA that has diuretic effects in addition to its cardiovascular benefits. A major goal of therapy is resolution of the signs and symptoms of congestion before discharge, as persistent congestion scored at discharge has been associated with higher rates of rehospitalizations and mortality. Most patients who have required intravenous diuretic therapy during hospitalization for HF will require prescription of loop diuretics at discharge to decrease recurrence of symptoms and hospitalization. As background, diuretic therapy with oral furosemide was the cornerstone of HF therapy for ≥20 years before construction of the modern bases of evidence for HF therapies.

### Management of heart failure in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review of the literature [^aad6b1df]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure (AHF) is a common presentation to the emergency department (ED), with the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to tailor treatments to the appropriate type of heart failure.

Objectives

This review provides an evidence-based summary of the current ED management of acute heart failure.

Discussion

Heart failure can present along a spectrum, especially in acute exacerbation. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease process, with guidelines focusing primarily on blood pressure and hemodynamic status. Treatment of patients with mild AHF exacerbations often focuses on intravenous diuretics. Patients with AHF with flash pulmonary edema should receive nitroglycerin and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, with consideration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, while monitoring for hypotension. Patients with hypotensive AHF should receive emergent specialty consultation and an initial fluid bolus of 250-500 mL, followed by initiation of inotropic agents with or without vasopressors. Dobutamine is the inotrope of choice in these patients, with norepinephrine recommended if blood pressure support is needed. If noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is required, providers should monitor closely for acute decompensation. Mechanical circulatory support devices may be considered as a bridge to further therapeutic intervention. High-output heart failure can be managed acutely with vasoconstricting agents, with focus on treating the underlying etiology. Disposition is not always straightforward, and several risk scores may assist in this decision.

Conclusion

AHF is a condition that requires rapid assessment and management. Understanding the appropriate management strategy can allow for more targeted treatment and improved outcomes.

### Loop diuretic resistance in heart failure: resistance etiology-based strategies to restoring diuretic efficacy [^90fe1f06]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Loop diuretics are a cornerstone of symptom management for nearly all patients with heart failure. Diuretic resistance is a clinical problem with similar presentation despite diverse and multiple etiologies. Although the exact incidence is not known, diuretic resistance occurs frequently and can increase the length of hospitalization. Despite the prevalence of loop diuretic prescription in heart failure and frequency of diuretic resistance, current heart failure guidelines provide nonspecific guidance on strategies to restore diuretic efficacy. Providers are left with many questions regarding the optimum diuretic titration strategy in the setting of diuretic resistance. In light of these highly prevalent uncertainties, we present a case vignette-structured literature review of the mechanisms of diuretic resistance and recommend therapeutic strategies based on the resistance etiology to improve diuretic response in acute decompensated heart failure.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^f0205bef]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Supplementary treatment was left to the discretion of the treating physician. All patients took angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and nitrates. No thiazide diuretics, nesiritide, or arginine vasopressin antagonists were administered during the hospitalization period. Hypertonic saline solution was administered to the patients who developed hyponatremia (serum Na values <128 mEq/L) during treatment with the goal of restoring plasma sodium values up to 134 mEq/L. For this reason Na concentration was monitored each day during the infusion period. The hypertonic saline solution consisted of 20 mEq of NaCl in 500 mL saline solutions (0.9% of NaCl). Infusion was administered at 80 cc/h once or twice a day, depending on the Na value. Dopamine infusions were administered to patients with systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg with the goal of restoring systolic values up to 100 mmHg maintaining diuretic infusion. Inotrope therapy was stopped when blood pressure values were sustained at approximately 105 mmHg during 12 sequential hours for four consecutive measurements.

The frequency of laboratory tests to evaluate electrolyte balance and renal function during hospitalization was at the discretion of the attending physician but was guided by a dose-escalation algorithm. This trial was approved by our hospital’s Institutional Review Board of Siena and all patients gave their signed informed consent. This trial was registered and regularly updated in ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier number: NCT01441245.

Inclusion criteria

Patients over age 18 years of age were screened if they met diagnostic criteria for ADHF due to systolic dysfunction and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% by exhibiting at least one of the following symptoms at rest: dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema or major fatigue and at least two clinical signs including rales, pulmonary congestion on chest radiography, jugular vein dilatation, or a third heart sound. Elevations in blood BNP >400 pg/mL were considered supportive for a diagnosis of ADHF.

Exclusion criteria

Patients were excluded if they had received more than two IV doses of furosemide or any continuous infusion of furosemide one month before randomization, if they had end-stage renal disease or the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or ultrafiltration), isolated diastolic dysfunction with LVEF >45% or recent myocardial infarction within thirty days of screening. Patients with a systolic blood pressure <80 mm Hg or with serum creatinine levels >4.0 mg/dL were also excluded, as well as patients who received recent intravenous iodinated contrast.

Respiratory distress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema)—prehospital pulmonary edema management states that nitroglycerin reduces left ventricular filling pressure primarily via venous dilation and at higher doses variably lowers systemic afterload and increases stroke volume and cardiac output; diuretics such as furosemide provide no immediate benefit for most patients and can cause significant harm with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with other disease processes; nitrates provide both subjective and objective improvement and might decrease intubation rates, incidence of MIs, and mortality, with high-dose nitrates reducing both preload and afterload and potentially increasing cardiac output and blood pressure; if available and trained, ultrasound is useful to distinguish pulmonary edema from other causes of respiratory distress (including pneumothorax); pulmonary edema due to irritant gas inhalation generally is best managed by supportive care and escalation of airway interventions once the patient is appropriately decontaminated, and early poison center consultation should be strongly considered for guidance; pulmonary edema due to high altitude should be managed as described in Altitude Illness Guideline.

After discussion with the patient, the SGLTi empagliflozin was started in 2021 on top of the only tolerated medical therapy. The patient was instructed about hygiene measures. The treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg daily was well tolerated. The treatment was associated with weight reduction within 1 month (−3 kg) and improvement of symptoms. The patient did not report night dyspnea and was able to walk 10 steps at home. The treatment with empagliflozin was associated with the reduced need of HFH. The baseline (before therapy), 1 month, and 12 months after the treatment with SGLT2i laboratory tests were available. The furosemide dose and spironolactone dose has not been changed during 12 months follow‐up.

The second patient was a 77‐years‐old nondiabetic male with HFpEF caused by an advanced stage of nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and permanent atrial fibrillation. The patient was referred to a tertiary care heart failure clinic 6 years ago because of worsening heart failure symptoms. The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was based on the echocardiography finding of severe septal hypertrophy of the left ventricle (20 mm) without obstruction of the left ventricular output tract. The patient had a normal coronary angiography finding, and cardiac magnetic resonance confirmed septal hypertrophy (22 mm at diastole), left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, and absence of late gadolinium enhancement. The patient met the criteria for ICD implantation in primary prevention (history of syncope and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia found out at 24 h Holter electrocardiography monitoring. The patient had NYHA class III symptoms and recurrent HFH because of symptoms at rest (NYHA IV). With the evidence of lungs and systemic congestion. The patient was not referred for advanced heart failure therapy because of age. At the last clinic visit before the therapy change, the patient reported dyspnea during regular daily activities (not at rest or at night), low tolerability of exercise, weakness, dizziness, postural vertigo, and leg swellings. After discussion with the patient, the SGLTi empagliflozin 10 mg daily was added to the medical therapy on top of other pharmacotherapy, including maximal tolerated dose of beta‐blocker (bisoprolol 5 mg daily), eplerenone (50 mg daily), and furosemide (187.5 mg daily). The treatment with SGLT2i was well tolerated. The patient's weight decreased by 3 kg within 1 months and exercise tolerability improved. The furosemide dose and the eplerenone dose has not been changed during 12 months follow‐up. The estimated glomerular filtration rate and creatinine level did not change, and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels increased in the first month after gliflozin therapy. The treatment with SGLT2i reduced the risk of HFH in the second patient too. Neither of the two patients received iron replacement therapy or blood transfusion. Neither patient reported any bleeding event during follow‐up.

### Furosemide (toxicology medicated collection system) [^9847ebea]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults

The usual initial dose of Furosemide tablets is 20 to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (eg, at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of Furosemide tablets may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving Furosemide tablets on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable. (See PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests.)

Geriatric patients

In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Pediatric patients

The usual initial dose of oral Furosemide tablets in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

Case presentation

A 68-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital in December 2008 with a fever, cough, right-sided chest pain, and swelling of both lower extremities. The patient stated that he had schistosomiasis 20 years previously, which resolved after administration of medication. His medical and family histories were otherwise unremarkable. The patient denied recent dental work and was on no medications at that time. On admission, his body temperature was 38°C and pulse was 105 bpm. Abnormal physical findings included bibasal lung crackles and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. He had normal heart sounds without a murmur. There were no dermatologic manifestations, nasopharyngeal abnormalities, or inflamed joints. Initial laboratory test results revealed a urine sediment protein of 1+ without blood cells or casts. His hemoglobin was 8.3 mg/dL. His biochemistry profile revealed a normal serum creatinine level and an albumin level of 3.1 mg/dL. Chest X-ray revealed right lower lobe pneumonia with minimal pleural effusion on both sides. He was thus diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusion. Appropriate antibiotic therapy was started immediately, after which the patient improved significantly and was discharged. However, the patient returned to our hospital 1 year later with intermittent bilateral lower extremity edema and skin rashes.

### A patient-centred, comprehensive model for the care for heart failure: the 360 ° heart failure centre [^3a57fda2]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Perhaps it is not surprising that ADHF accounts for over 1 million annual ED presentations in the USA.When a patient with ADHF presents to any of the above-mentioned clinical offices, there is a limited infrastructure and capabilities to address their acute needs. For a mild decompensation, oral diuretics may be adjusted with a plan for follow-up laboratories and phone calls. For a more severe decompensation, a patient may be directly admitted to the hospital or referred to the nearest ED. More than 90% of all patients with ADHF presenting to an ED are admitted to the hospital, for an average length of stay of 5 days.Even though inpatient admission for decongestion is the major throughput for ADHF care, there have not been significant changes in the ED or inpatient care of these patients for the past several decades. This is reflected in the most current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines from 2013 and subsequent update in 2017,which do not give guidance for risk stratification of ADHF, nor the appropriate care setting of therapy. What recommendations are available primarily focus on in-hospital management with decongestion with an intravenous diuretic, home HF medical therapy should be continued, and for discharge planning. Indeed, the high readmission and complications rates, including death, may be due to the lack of clinical trials data and standardised practices of ADHF management in the ED and as inpatients.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^cd58f9d2]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

INTERMACS profiles—advanced heart failure severity classification (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) defines seven clinical profiles with characteristic features: Critical cardiogenic shock is characterized by life-threatening hypotension with rapidly escalating inotropic/pressor support and critical organ hypoperfusion often confirmed by worsening acidosis and lactate; progressive decline describes patients “dependent” on inotropes with continuing deterioration or refractory volume overload when inotropes cannot be maintained because of tachyarrhythmias, clinical ischemia, or other intolerance; stable but inotrope dependent indicates clinical stability on mild–moderate intravenous inotropes or temporary circulatory support with repeated failure to wean; resting symptoms on oral therapy at home includes frequent congestion at rest or with activities of daily living with possible orthopnea, gastrointestinal symptoms, disabling ascites, or severe lower extremity edema; exertion intolerant patients are comfortable at rest but unable to engage in any activity and are housebound; exertion limited patients are comfortable at rest without fluid overload and can perform minor activities outside the home but develop fatigue within a few minutes or with any meaningful physical exertion; advanced NYHA class III patients are clinically stable with a reasonable level of comfortable activity, usually able to walk more than a block, but any decompensation requiring intravenous diuretics or hospitalization within the previous month should be classified lower. Modifier options include recurrent decompensations for Profiles 3 to 6 defined by frequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations (generally at least 2 in past 3 mo or 3 in past 6 mo) for intravenous diuresis, ultrafiltration, or brief inotropic therapy; if a Profile 7 patient meets these criteria, the patient should be moved to Profile 6 or worse; additional modifiers include recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias (eg, frequent ICD shocks or external defibrillation, usually more than twice weekly) or temporary circulatory support for hospitalized patients Profiles 1 to 3.

### Significance testing as perverse probabilistic reasoning [^d33c077b]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

However, medical reasoning frequently requires going beyond syllogistic reasoning. For example, consider the following argument type:

Of course, given the premise (A ⇒ B), the truth of B does not, strictly speaking, imply the truth of A, hence the use of the term 'plausible' to denote an implication that falls short of certitude. Arguments of this kind, which have been aptly called 'weak syllogisms', are indispensable in everyday medical reasoning. For example, it is reasonable to assert that patients with appendicitis will have abdominal pain, and we accept abdominal pain as grounds for suspecting appendicitis, though logically there are numerous other possible explanations for abdominal pain. In a similar vein, consider these additional typical case vignettes and possible diagnoses:

• 45 year old homeless alcoholic man brought in by police with confusion, disorderly behavior, and breath smelling of alcohol. Diagnosis: Ethanol intoxication.

• 75 year old nursing home resident with known heart failure presents with confusion and shortness of breath. Physical examination reveals rales, 3+ lower extremity pitting edema, labored breathing. Diagnosis: CHF exacerbation.

• 55 year old male presents to ED with acute onset substernal chest pain. Diagnosis: Gastric reflux.

Most physicians quickly assign rough degrees of plausibility to these diagnoses. However, in these cases it is reasonable to entertain alternative diagnoses, for example in the first case other intoxicants, or meningitis; and in the second case pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction. In the third case the stated diagnosis is only weakly plausible, and most physicians would doubt it at least until other possibilities (for example myocardial ischemia) are ruled out. In each case, there is insufficient information to make a certain (that is logically deductive) diagnosis; nevertheless, we are accustomed to making judgements of plausibility.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^b27b8516]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Treatment regimens for hypercalcemia of malignancy—initial measures include isotonic saline hydration, loop diuretics (furosemide), and calcitonin (CT). Isotonic saline hydration uses a bolus of 1 to 2 L then 200 to 500 mL/hour to maintain urine output at 100 to 150 mL/hour and during infusion lowers calcium by 1 to 1.5 mg/dL (0.25 to 0.375 mmol/L) over first 24 hours, with advice to carefully assess for volume overload. Loop diuretics have onset within 3 to 60 minutes and, after resolution of volume depletion, lower calcium by 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL (0.125 to 0.25 mmol/L), with cautions for volume depletion and worsening HCM and potential usefulness in patients at risk for volume overload/congestive heart failure. Calcitonin is dosed 4 to 8 units/kg intramuscular or SQ every 6 to 12 hours for 48 to 72 hours, has effects over 6 to 8 hours with rapid calcium reduction by 1 to 2 mg/dL (0.25 to 0.50 mmol/L), and tachyphylaxis may occur after 48 to 72 hours.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure (HF) clinical syndrome and etiologies—The cardinal manifestations are dyspnea and fatigue that may limit exercise tolerance and fluid retention leading to pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema, and the term heart failure is preferred over congestive heart failure because not all patients have volume overload at evaluation. The syndrome may result from pericardial, myocardial, endocardial, or great vessel disorders, with most symptoms due to impairment of left ventricular (LV) myocardial function, and HF may range from normal LV size with preserved ejection fraction (EF) to severe dilatation and/or markedly reduced EF. Coronary artery disease, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease are substantial causes, and as many as 30% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may have a genetic cause. HF is not equivalent to cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction; it is defined as a clinical syndrome with specific symptoms and signs, and there is no single diagnostic test because diagnosis is based on careful history and physical examination.

Case 2

A 72-year-old female patient was treated with osimertinib as a third-line therapy for advanced NSCLC harboring the EGFR L858R and T790M mutations. She had had a history of hypertension for 15 years, which was treated with amlodipine 5 mg daily. After 3 months of osimertinib, she presented with fatigue. Echocardiography revealed severe MR with mitral valve prolapse and LVEF of 74%, which was not detected by the echocardiography obtained before osimertinib treatment. Osimertinib was discontinued, and furosemide 20 mg, was started. After 1 month, her symptoms improved, but the MR persisted. Given the severity of MR, 250 mg of gefitinib was started as the fourth-line therapy. Four months after gefitinib therapy, her MR did not worsen, and her advanced NSCLC did not progress.

Case 3

A 68-year-old male was treated with osimertinib as the third-line therapy for advanced NSCLC harboring the EGFR Ex.19 del. and T790M mutations. He was previously treated with gefitinib and erlotinib for more than 7 years before osimertinib. He had a history of hepatitis B but no history of cardiovascular disease. After 3 months of osimertinib, he presented with fatigue and pitting edema of the lower extremities. ECG showed QTc prolongation, and serum laboratory tests showed severe hyponatremia (120 mEq/l). Echocardiography revealed severe tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) and mild pulmonary hypertension (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure: 45 mm Hg), which had not been observed before osimertinib administration. Osimertinib was discontinued, and tolvaptan 3.75 mg, and furosemide 40 mg daily, were initiated. After 1 month, fatigue and edema improved, but severe TR persisted. Because of the presence of the EGFR T790M mutation and lack of alternative EGFR-TKIs to consider, low-dose osimertinib (40 mg daily) was initiated with careful follow-up. After 6 months of re-administration of osimertinib, TR and NSCLC did not progress.

### Sinus arrest and cardiogenic shock precipitated by immune checkpoint inhibitors [^6d4e7c30]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old man presented with a chief complaint of lightheadedness and dizziness. Patient reported progressive fatigue throughout the prior 24 h causing him to lose consciousness and call emergency medical services. On initial evaluation, the patient was afebrile and saturating well on room air, bradycardic to 30 beats/min with a blood pressure of 84/42 mm Hg. Examination revealed bradycardia, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and a jugular venous pulsation that was elevated to 16 cm H 2 O, along with 2+ lower extremity pitting edema.

His past medical history was significant for a history of metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC) status post-unilateral nephrectomy status post-nivolumab cycle 5, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. The RCC diagnosis was made 2 years before. The patient was started on pazopanib, which was discontinued following development of proteinuria, leading to initiation of nivolumab in the setting of worsening metastatic lung disease. Three months before presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain in the setting of gross hematuria (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dl, reference range 13 to 17 g/dl), and was noted to have a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with normal ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormalities (WMAs). Angiography was not pursued at that hospitalization due to low-risk transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) features, acute kidney injury, and acute blood loss was felt to be the cause of his type II myocardial infarction event.

### Furosemide [^322f17d0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Parenteral therapy should be reserved for patients unable to take oral medication or for patients in emergency clinical situations.

Edema: Furosemide is indicated in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Furosemide is particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired.

Furosemide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in acute pulmonary edema. The intravenous administration of furosemide is indicated when a rapid onset of diuresis is desired, e.g., in acute pulmonary edema.

If gastrointestinal absorption is impaired or oral medication is not practical for any reason, furosemide is indicated by the intravenous or intramuscular route. Parenteral use should be replaced with oral furosemide as soon as practical.

Assessment of patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF—In patients hospitalized with HF, severity of congestion and adequacy of perfusion should be assessed to guide triage and initial therapy, and the common precipitating factors and the overall patient trajectory should be assessed to guide appropriate therapy. For patients admitted with HF, treatment should address reversible factors, establish optimal volume status, and advance guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) toward targets for outpatient therapy. Initial triage includes clinical assessment of the hemodynamic profile for severity of congestion and adequacy of perfusion.

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)—incidence, diagnosis, and treatment: HAPE can occur by itself or with AMS and HACE; incidence is roughly 1 per 10,000 skiers in Colorado, and ≤1 per 100 travelers at >4,300 m (>14,000 ft). Initial symptoms include chest congestion, cough, exaggerated dyspnea on exertion, and decreased exercise performance; if unrecognized and untreated, HAPE progresses to dyspnea at rest and frank respiratory distress, often with bloody sputum, with a typical progression over 1–2 days. Rales are detectable in most victims; pulse oximetry can aid in making the diagnosis and oxygen saturation values of 50%–70% are common, which are at least 10 points lower than in healthy people at the same altitude. In most circumstances, descent is urgent and mandatory; administer oxygen, if available, and exert the patient as little as possible; if immediate descent is not an option, the use of supplemental oxygen or a portable hyperbaric chamber is critical. Patients with mild HAPE who have access to oxygen might not need to descend and can be treated with oxygen over 2–4 days and bedrest at the current altitude; in field settings nifedipine can be used as an adjunct to descent, oxygen, or portable hyperbaric oxygen therapy; a selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor can be used if nifedipine is not available, but concurrent use of multiple pulmonary vasodilators is not recommended; descent and oxygen are much more effective treatments than medication.

### Chronic dyspnea: diagnosis and evaluation-AAFP (...) [^e242bc24]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Diseases of the pulmonary parenchyma, such as interstitial fibrosis and sarcoidosis, usually have a slow and progressive course with worsening dyspnea and impairment over time. Symptoms associated with illnesses affecting the airways, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, or bronchiectasis, may wax and wane with an increase in coughing and sputum production during flare-ups. In patients with cardiac disease, a history of symptoms consistent with heart failure should be elicited. 16 Postural or nocturnal sensations of dyspnea indicating upper airway inflammation may result from chronic sinusitis or gastric-reflux disease. 17 Iatrogenic causes of dyspnea should be considered, especially with recent additions to a patient's medication regimen.

For example, the use of beta blockers may aggravate asthma, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use has been shown to cause bronchoconstriction and fluid retention, and methotrexate use at any dose has been associated with interstitial pneumonitis. Pulsus paradoxus is associated with severe COPD, asthma, large bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary embolism, and subacute cardiac tamponade. 23 Neck examination may reveal a shift of the trachea, adenopathy, jugular venous distention, or an enlarged thyroid gland causing tissue congestion or mass effect giving rise to the sensation of dyspnea. Cyanosis, wheezing, diminished breath sounds, and distant heart sounds are consistent with a diagnosis of COPD, as are use of accessory muscles for respiration, a barrel chest, and decreased breath sounds with pursed lip breathing.

Rales, a positive hepatojugular reflex, hepatomegaly, and an S3 gallop, ascites, and jugular venous distention suggest heart failure as an underlying cause. An irregular rhythm on auscultation may indicate arrhythmias causative of chronic dyspnea. In palliative care settings, oral or nebulized opioids for dyspnea are an option; they should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. In cases of severe lung or heart disease, response to medical intervention for dyspnea can be monitored using the six-minute walk test.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^2f09be4f]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Grade recommendation justification

Despite the low quality of evidence for the majority of outcomes, and the results being driven largely by a single trial,conservative fluid management may be beneficial without evidence of harm. We therefore suggest that in adult patients with ARDS, clinicians consider the use of a conservative fluid strategy which uses fluid restriction, diuretics and possibly hyperoncotic albumin to avoid a positive fluid balance in preference to a liberal fluid strategy.

### Clinical effects and safety of different strategies for administering intravenous diuretics in acutely decompensated heart failure: a randomised clinical trial [^75128b12]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The mainstay of treatment for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is intravenous diuretic therapy either as a bolus or via continuous infusion.

Objectives

We evaluated the clinical effects and safety of three strategies of intravenous furosemide administration used in emergency departments (EDs) for ADHF.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, randomised, parallel-group study. Patients with ADHF were randomised within 2h of ED arrival to receive furosemide by continuous infusion (10mg/h, group 1) or boluses (20mg/6h, group 2; or 20mg/8h, group 3). The primary end point was total diuresis, and secondary end points were dyspnoea, orthopnoea, extension of rales and peripheral oedema, blood pressure, respiratory and heart rates, and pulse oximetry, which were measured at arrival and 3, 6, 12 and 24h after treatment onset. We also measured serum creatinine, sodium and potassium levels at arrival and after 24h.

Results

Group 1 patients (n=36) showed greater 24h diuresis (3705mL) than those in groups 2 (n=37) and 3 (n=36) (3093 and 2670mL, respectively; p<0.01), and this greater diuretic effect was observed earlier. However, no differences were observed among groups in the nine secondary clinical end points evaluated. Creatinine deterioration developed in 15.6% of patients, hyponatraemia in 9.2%, and hypokalaemia in 19.3%, with the only difference among groups observed in hypokalaemia (group 1, 36.3%; group 2, 13.5%; group 3, 8.3%; p<0.01).

Conclusions

In patients with ADHF attending the ED, boluses of furosemide have a smaller diuretic effect but provide similar clinical relief, similar preservation of renal function, and a lower incidence of hypokalaemia than continuous infusion.

Trial Registration Number

This randomised trial was registered in the European Clinical Trial Database (EudraCT) with the reference number 2008-004488-20.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Table 7—diuretic dosing in hospital: Loop diuretic agent examples include bumetanide 0.5-4 mg IV 1-3 times daily (12 mg/d) or 0.5-2 mg/h IV infusion (4 mg/h), with outpatient 0.5-2 mg orally once to twice daily (10 mg/d), and furosemide 40-160 mg IV 1-3 times daily (200 mg/dose) or 5-20 mg/h IV infusion (40 mg/h), with outpatient 20-80 mg orally once to twice daily (600 mg/d). Torsemide is not available commercially in IV form and is listed as 10-40 mg orally once daily (200 mg/d). Thiazide-type options include chlorothiazide 0.5-1 g IV once to twice daily (2 g/d) and metolazone 2.5-5 mg orally once to twice daily (20 mg/d) or 2.5-5 mg orally once daily (20 mg/d). Acetazolamide is presented as 500 mg orally/IV once daily or in divided doses.

### Enalapril maleate [^5f3c16c8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure

Enalapril maleate tablets are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In the placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated improved survival, patients were titrated as tolerated up to 40 mg, administered in two divided doses.

The recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg. The recommended dosing range is 2.5 to 20 mg given twice a day. Doses should be titrated upward, as tolerated, over a period of a few days or weeks. The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials was 40 mg in divided doses.

After the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.

Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction

In the trial that demonstrated efficacy, patients were started on 2.5 mg twice daily and were titrated as tolerated to the targeted daily dose of 20 mg (in divided doses).

After the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.

Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Heart Failure and Renal Impairment or Hyponatremia

In patients with heart failure who have hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 mEq/L) or with serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dL, therapy should be initiated at 2.5 mg daily under close medical supervision (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Heart Failure, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). The dose may be increased to 2.5 mg b.i.d., then 5 mg b.i.d. and higher as needed, usually at intervals of four days or more if at the time of dosage adjustment there is not excessive hypotension or significant deterioration of renal function. The maximum daily dose is 40 mg.

### Quality improvement guidelines for percutaneous management of acute lower-extremity ischemia [^48935a31]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Indications/patient selection—initial evaluation for acute lower-extremity ischemia centers on history, examination, and targeted testing, with emphasis on defining embolic versus thrombotic etiology. Patient selection “is determined by a number of clinical findings of the limb in question,” and “an appropriate history and physical examination and an evaluation of the patient for absolute and relative contraindications to thrombolytic therapy should be performed.” The history and exam “should focus on” pain, sensory and motor changes, pallor, and temperature, while laboratory tests “should be obtained to assess for renal function, baseline hematocrit and coagulation profile, and evidence of hyperkalemia and acidosis.” An “electrocardiogram may be obtained to ascertain if any cardiac arrhythmias are present and to assess for a recent myocardial infarction.” Etiologic assessment informs management; in embolic events, “the heart is the source in 80%–90% of cases,” and “arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, can have a 3%–6% annual risk of thromboembolic complications if they are not treated with anticoagulation.”

### Bridging the gap between evidence and practice in acute decompensated heart failure management [^f08a88e9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Registry data indicate a gap between evidence-based guidelines and current management of patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Bridging this gap is crucial given the frequency and cost of hospitalization for this disorder. Patients with ADHF require rapid assessment to determine appropriate treatment location and initial therapy. Patients with impending respiratory failure or cardiogenic shock should be managed in an intensive care setting, patients with congestion that is expected to require prolonged intravenous therapy should be admitted to the hospital, and patients with congestion that is likely to respond within 12-24 hours can be managed in an observation unit. Clinical status should guide selection of initial therapy. Initially, therapeutic response should be assessed every couple of hours. Once effective acute therapy has been established, it is important to implement strategies to improve long-term outcomes. These strategies include ensuring that care complies with established core performance measures, providing patient education in a manner suited to ensure comprehension and retention, and arranging for appropriate outpatient follow-up, ideally in a comprehensive heart failure disease management program. The purpose of this review is (1) to examine evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of ADHF, (2) to present a practical algorithm for patient assessment and treatment derived from these guidelines and personal experience, and (3) to discuss systems to enhance the ultimate transition of patient care from the inpatient to outpatient setting.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF)—volume overload and diuretic management—states that approximately 70% of patients with ADHF have signs and symptoms of elevated ventricular filling pressures, and that loop diuretics such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide are the mainstay of treatment for volume overload; HF specialists should select the most appropriate agent, dose, and route, recognize the deleterious effects of excessive diuretic use and select the lowest effective dose, and when resistance occurs must reassess the plan, adjust dose, use synergistic diuretics, and initiate therapies that augment cardiac output and renal blood flow, while balancing chronic neurohumoral blockade against hemodynamic derangements during ADHF.

### Decongestion in acute heart failure [^efbf6bac]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Congestion is a major reason for hospitalization in acute heart failure (HF). Therapeutic strategies to manage congestion include diuretics, vasodilators, ultrafiltration, vasopressin antagonists, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and potentially also novel therapies such as gut sequesterants and serelaxin. Uncertainty exists with respect to the appropriate decongestion strategy for an individual patient. In this review, we summarize the benefit and risk profiles for these decongestion strategies and provide guidance on selecting an appropriate approach for different patients. An evidence-based initial approach to congestion management involves high-dose i.v. diuretics with addition of vasodilators for dyspnoea relief if blood pressure allows. To enhance diuresis or overcome diuretic resistance, options include dual nephron blockade with thiazide diuretics or natriuretic doses of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Vasopressin antagonists may improve aquaresis and relieve dyspnoea. If diuretic strategies are unsuccessful, then ultrafiltration may be considered. Ultrafiltration should be used with caution in the setting of worsening renal function. This review is based on discussions among scientists, clinical trialists, and regulatory representatives at the 9th Global Cardio Vascular Clinical Trialists Forum in Paris, France, from 30 November to 1 December 2012.

### Loop diuretic therapy with or without heart failure: impact on prognosis [^aaece63b]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

About half of patients had been hospitalized in the year before initiation of loop diuretics, and many others attended hospital outpatients, usually for non-cardiovascular conditions. A few patients treated with loop diuretics had end-stage kidney disease, and some will have received loop diuretics for the treatment of resistant hypertension, but neither indication for loop diuretics appeared to account for their widespread use.On general medical and surgical wards, loop diuretics may have been initiated for symptoms and signs of HF, but appropriate investigations were not done or not recorded in patients’ medical records.When loop diuretics are listed as hospital discharge medications, primary care physicians may automatically repeat the prescription, trusting that their hospital colleagues have investigated appropriately. Patients admitted with, e.g. respiratory infections, may receive both antibiotics and loop diuretics due to diagnostic uncertainty. Even if antibiotics are responsible for the success of treatment, loop diuretics may be continued long term because no one decided to stop them.

Case Presentation

An 82-year-old man presented with 6 months of difficulties of falling asleep. He described a feeling of fading breath culminating in breathing arrest when he becomes drowsy. These recurrent events prevented him from falling asleep. Symptoms would only appear when he went to sleep but not during wakefulness. Medical history comprised several episodes of acute decompensated heart failure due to supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with need for hospitalization during the last 2 years. He additionally had two-vessel coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, and chronic kidney disease (stage 3). Medication included diuretics, sodium bicarbonate, angiotensin II receptor antagonist, beta-blocker, statin, clopidogrel, and phenprocoumon without sedatives or analgesics.

### A 63-year-old woman with rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease [^cad0d4f1]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 63-year-old Japanese woman with no medical history presented as an outside hospital transfer for further management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Per her family, the patient had developed a rash and intermittent shortness of breath 2 months prior to hospital presentation. The rash was described as an erythematous maculopapular rash located on her proximal arms, chest, and upper eyelids. She saw her primary care physician, who prescribed a course of oral and topical corticosteroids. Despite these symptoms, the patient had an excellent functional status and exercised several times per week without muscle weakness. Two months following the initial presentation, the patient progressively became lethargic, prompting her son to bring her to the hospital for admission and evaluation. While in the hospital, the patient had progressive shortness of breath and developed worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, her hypoxemia worsened, requiring intubation. She was subsequently started on 80 mg of IV methylprednisolone three times daily and transferred to our institution for further management. The patient arrived from the outside hospital receiving deep sedation and paralysis. Despite maximal ventilator settings, the patient remained hypoxemic and developed shock requiring multiple vasopressors.
