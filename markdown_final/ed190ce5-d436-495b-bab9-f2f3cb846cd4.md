## Question

A 23-year-old woman presents with a painful lesion in her mouth. She denies tooth pain, bleeding from the gums, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or previous episodes similar to this in the past. She states that her last normal menstrual period was 12 days ago, and she has not been sexually active since starting medical school 2 years ago. On physical examination, the patient has good dentition with no signs of infection with the exception of a solitary ulcerated lesion on the oral mucosa. The nonvesicular lesion has a clean gray-white base and is surrounded by erythema. Which of the following is correct concerning the most likely etiology of the oral lesion in this patient?
A. This lesion is highly contagious and is due to reactivation of a dormant virus.
B. This lesion is associated with an autoimmune disease characterized by a sensitivity to gluten.
C. This lesion is non-contagious but will most likely recur.
D. This lesion may progress to squamous cell carcinoma.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement is correct about a solitary, painful, nonvesicular oral ulcer with a clean gray-white base and erythematous halo in a 23-year-old woman with no prior similar episodes, focusing on the etiology, recurrence, contagion, autoimmune association, and malignant potential of the lesion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis based on morphology and history. Then, I should verify the key differentials that could mimic this and why they don't fit. Next, I will examine each answer option against the expected natural history and pathophysiology of that diagnosis. Finally, I will select the single best answer and double-check that it aligns with evidence on prognosis and recurrence patterns.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. The description of a solitary, painful, shallow ulcer with a clean gray-white base and an erythematous rim on nonkeratinized mucosa, in a young adult with no prior episodes, strongly fits a minor aphthous ulcer (recurrent aphthous stomatitis, RAS), especially as a first episode, and the absence of vesicles argues against herpetic disease, which typically begins with vesicles that rupture into ulcers [^112c8dvn] [^112Pi1FQ] [^1137Bkps] [^1113Q9ND].

> Wait, let me verify the differentials I need to exclude. Herpes simplex stomatitis usually presents with multiple vesicles that quickly rupture to irregular erosions and often systemic symptoms; that doesn't match a solitary, nonvesicular ulcer here, so HSV is unlikely as the primary diagnosis in this scenario [^1113Q9ND]. Erythema multiforme tends to be abrupt, often triggered by HSV or drugs, and may show target lesions or extensive mucosal erosions; a single, small, clean-based ulcer without systemic features or triggers makes EM less likely here [^112z9dZE]. Behçet disease requires recurrent oral ulcers plus additional systemic criteria; a first-ever, isolated ulcer doesn't meet that threshold, though I should keep complex aphthosis in mind if recurrences cluster or extraoral features emerge [^113jL4qE]. Oral lichen planus typically shows bilateral white reticulations or erosive disease and is chronic rather than a solitary acute ulcer, so it doesn't fit this first-episode presentation either [^1137Bkps].

> Now, I will examine Option A, which claims the lesion is highly contagious and due to reactivation of a dormant virus. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — RAS is not considered contagious, and there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission. Moreover, this is not a reactivation pattern like HSV, which would usually be preceded by vesicles and a history of prior HSV infection, neither of which is present here, so Option A is incorrect [^1113Q9ND].

> Next, I should review Option B, linking the lesion to an autoimmune disease with gluten sensitivity. Initially, I wondered if celiac-associated aphthae could explain this, but wait, I should verify — while aphthous-like ulcers can occur in gluten-sensitive enteropathy and other systemic diseases, this patient has no gastrointestinal symptoms, no prior episodes, and no serologic or dietary clues. Attributing a first, isolated minor aphthous ulcer to celiac disease would be premature and unsupported by the current data, so Option B is not the best choice here [^1151sL4a].

> I will now examine Option C, which states the lesion is non-contagious but will most likely recur. Let me think about this carefully — RAS is indeed non-contagious, and although this is a first episode, the lifetime recurrence risk is substantial, with prevalence estimates around 10–20% and many patients experiencing multiple episodes per year. Even without a prior history now, the natural history supports a meaningful likelihood of recurrence, so this option aligns with the disease course and is clinically sound [^112c8dvn] [^111iPghf].

> But wait, what if this were malignant — Option D suggests progression to squamous cell carcinoma. I should double-check red flags: solitary ulcers that persist beyond 2–3 weeks, have indurated or rolled margins, bleed easily, or are painless raise concern for oral cancer; this lesion is painful, acute, and described as clean-based without atypia, and in a 23-year-old without risk factors, malignant transformation is not expected for a typical aphthous ulcer, making Option D unlikely and overly alarmist in this context [^111CSgkm] [^113KSfsZ] [^114NXYvb].

> Putting this together, the morphology and history best fit a minor aphthous ulcer, which is non-contagious and has a well-documented propensity to recur. Therefore, the correct answer is C. I should confirm that management is supportive and that no urgent biopsy is indicated unless the ulcer fails to heal or atypical features develop, which is consistent with standard care for seemingly innocuous oral lesions in young adults [^112c8dvn] [^111CSgkm].

The most likely diagnosis is **recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)** [^112c8dvn], a common, non-contagious, self-limited oral ulcer with a clean gray-white base and erythematous halo [^112c8dvn]. RAS is **not contagious** [^112c8dvn] and typically recurs, often triggered by stress, trauma, hormonal changes, or certain foods [^1148ZadS]. It is not associated with gluten sensitivity or autoimmune disease, and it does not progress to squamous cell carcinoma [^notfound]. The correct answer is **C. This lesion is non-contagious but will most likely recur** [^112c8dvn].

---

## Clinical features of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)

RAS presents with the following **characteristics**:

- **Appearance**: Shallow, round or oval ulcers with a clean gray-white base and an erythematous halo [^112Pi1FQ].

- **Location**: Non-keratinized mucosa (buccal mucosa, labial mucosa, floor of mouth, ventral tongue) [^1137Bkps].

- **Symptoms**: Painful, especially with acidic or spicy foods; no systemic symptoms [^111BuBVZ].

- **Course**: Self-limited, healing in 7–14 days without scarring [^1148ZadS].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

The exact cause of RAS is unknown, but contributing factors include:

- **Local trauma**: Minor injury, dental procedures, or sharp foods [^1148ZadS].

- **Stress and hormonal changes**: Emotional stress, anxiety, and hormonal fluctuations (e.g. menstrual cycle) [^1148ZadS].

- **Dietary factors**: Acidic foods, citrus fruits, nuts, chocolate, and gluten-containing foods in susceptible individuals [^notfound].

- **Systemic conditions**: Nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin B12, folate), gastrointestinal diseases (Crohn's, celiac), and immunodeficiencies [^1151sL4a].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other conditions that can mimic RAS include:

| **Condition** | **Distinguishing features** |
|-|-|
| Herpes simplex virus (HSV) | - Vesicular lesions <br/> - Multiple ulcers <br/> - Gingival involvement <br/> - Systemic symptoms [^1113Q9ND] |
| Erythema multiforme | - Target lesions <br/> - Mucosal erosions <br/> - Often drug-induced or HSV-associated [^112z9dZE] |
| Behçet's disease | - Recurrent oral and genital ulcers <br/> - Ocular inflammation <br/> - Skin lesions [^113jL4qE] |
| Oral lichen planus | - White reticular lesions <br/> - Chronic course <br/> - Bilateral involvement [^1137Bkps] |
| Squamous cell carcinoma | - Persistent ulcer <br/> - Indurated margins <br/> - Non-healing [^111TAhDU] |

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

RAS is **benign and self-limited**, with a strong tendency to recur [^1137Bkps]. Recurrence varies — some patients have infrequent episodes, while others experience frequent or chronic ulcers [^111BuBVZ]. Recurrences are often triggered by stress, trauma, hormonal changes, or dietary factors [^1148ZadS].

---

## Treatment and management

Management focuses on **symptom relief** and **prevention**:

- **Topical therapies**: Corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide), anti-inflammatory agents (amlexanox), and antiseptic mouthwashes [^112c8dvn].

- **Systemic therapies**: For severe or refractory cases, systemic corticosteroids, immunomodulatory drugs, or antibiotics may be used [^112c8dvn].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Stress management, dietary adjustments, and avoidance of known triggers [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's lesion is most consistent with **recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)** [^112c8dvn], a common, non-contagious, self-limited oral ulcer that tends to recur. It is not associated with gluten sensitivity or autoimmune disease, and it does not progress to squamous cell carcinoma [^notfound]. The correct answer is **C. This lesion is non-contagious but will most likely recur** [^112c8dvn].

### Circinate oral and genital mucositis [^112Zbgom]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Answers:
A. Reactive arthritis – Correct. The patient presented with urethritis, arthritis, and mucosal oral and genital lesions. Typical mucocutaneous manifestations of reactive arthritis include circinate balanitis, keratoderma blenorrhagicum, and nail changes, similar to psoriatic nails with onycholysis, pitting, and subungual hyperkeratosis or periungual pustules. Oral lesions are uncommon and have been reported as red patches, painless erosions, and ulcers occurring on the tongue, palate, buccal mucosa and lips, glossitis, and geographic tongue. Previous investigators have described the oral lesions as psoriasiform or as ectopic geographic tongue because of its morphology, but images have been scarcely reported. There are no established diagnostic criteria for reactive arthritis, and its diagnosis relies on medical history and clinical findings. Patients rarely present with the classic triad of conjunctivitis, urethritis, and arthritis.
B. Lichen planus – Incorrect. Buccal mucosa and tongue are most often involved in oral lichen planus, with white streaks, often forming a lacework (reticular form) or white plaques. Male genitalia involvement often includes annular lesions or flat-topped papules affecting most frequently the glans penis. Oral ulcerative lesions are especially painful (patient's oral lesions were unnoticed) and can be surrounded by the reticular form on its edges.
C. Behçet syndrome – Incorrect. The typical lesions in Behçet syndrome are multiple and recurrent painful aphthous lesions over the mouth and genitals, along with eye involvement or skin involvement (pseudofolliculitis, erythema nodosum, acneiform lesions).
D. Herpes simplex infection – Incorrect. Herpes simplex infection occurs typically with painful ulcers along with swollen lymph nodes.
E. Secondary syphilis – Incorrect. Secondary syphilis would show a positive serologic test result for syphilis (treponemal and nontreponemal tests).

### Aphthous stomatitis… [^111BuBVZ]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

These ulcers occur periodically and heal completely between attacks. In the majority of cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth – i.e., anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate, and the dorsum of the tongue. However, the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition. Signs and symptoms Individuals with aphthous stomatitis typically exhibit no detectable systemic symptoms or signs.

Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may precede the appearance of any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often out of proportion to the extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks. Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable. Ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves. Ulceration episodes usually occur about 3–6 times per year. However, severe disease is characterized by virtually constant ulceration and may cause debilitating chronic pain and interfere with comfortable eating.

In severe cases, this prevents adequate nutrient intake, leading to malnutrition and weight loss. Stress has effects on the immune system, which may explain why some cases directly correlate with stress. It is often stated that in studies of students with the condition, ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened during periods of vacation. Alternatively, it has been suggested that oral parafunctional activities such as lip or cheek chewing become more pronounced during periods of stress. Hence, the mucosa is subjected to less trauma. Aphthous-like ulceration may occur in association with several systemic disorders. These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis, but this type of oral ulceration is not considered to be true aphthous stomatitis by some sources.

Some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal surfaces in addition to the mouth, such as the conjunctiva or the genital mucous membranes. Resolution of the systemic condition often decreases the frequency and severity of oral ulceration. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on the clinical appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature is a history of recurrent, self-healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history. Special investigations may be indicated to rule out other causes of oral ulceration.

### Oral ulcers as a presentation of secondary syphilis [^114FKaM1]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of syphilis is increasing, and it typically presents in patients with known risk factors, often to genitourinary physicians. Patients presenting to a dermatologist or ophthalmologist will more likely have secondary syphilis, with the potential for having the associated complications. Early recognition is therefore vital to limit both the disease and risk of further contact spread. In this review, we include two case histories demonstrating the value of recognizing oral signs. Additionally, we review the currently accepted diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations.

Question 3: Which of the following is true regarding the prognosis of this condition?
A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting
B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80%
C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases
D. Although commonly misdiagnosed, this condition has an excellent prognosis once proper endodontic therapy is performed
E. There is an overall poor prognosis of this condition, with the 5-year survival between 10% and 50%

Answers:
A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting – Incorrect. This refers to the prognosis of erysipelas, which is usually managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Importantly, hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics may be considered in severe cases affecting those who are immunocompromised, infants, and the elderly.
B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80% – Incorrect. There are 4 widely recognized types of KS; however, they differ in epidemiology and prognosis. The 5-year relative survival rate for KS, which compares people with the same type and stage of KS to people in the overall population, is 80%.
C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases – Incorrect. The prognosis described here is in reference to angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Although spontaneous regression may occasionally occur, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia tends to persist for years, with recurrence after treatment in more than 40% of cases. Early age of onset, long disease duration, multiple lesions, and symptomatic disease have been associated with higher recurrence rates.
D. Although commonly misdiagnosed, this condition has an excellent prognosis once proper endodontic therapy is performed – Incorrect. Cutaneous dental sinus tract is frequently misdiagnosed due to its rarity of occurrence and lack of associated symptoms. Once diagnosed, however, definitive treatment through oral therapy to eliminate the source of infection, whether it is through endodontic treatment or extraction, is effective and provides a cure.
E. There is an overall poor prognosis of this condition, with the 5-year survival between 10% and 50% – Correct. Angiosarcomas make up less than 1% of all sarcomas, with approximately 2 to 3 new cases per 1 million diagnoses yearly. Importantly, many angiosarcomas are highly aggressive, with a 5-year survival between 10% and 50% and a median overall survival ranging from 30 to 50 months. The clinical variability of these tumors contributes to delayed diagnosis, and that, coupled with their genetic heterogeneity, makes them difficult to treat. Surgical excision with wide margins is considered the mainstay of therapy in localized disease; however, the infiltrative and satellite foci often lead to difficulty in obtaining negative margins and frequent local recurrences. Thus, a multimodal approach, which often includes radiation, is often necessary. Our patient was treated with wide local excision followed by adjuvant radiation given positive margins. He remains without evidence of disease at 2 years.

### Severe manifestation of oral pemphigus [^115GdteT]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2010). Low credibility.

This article describes a case of pemphigus vulgaris in a relatively young patient with exacerbated characteristics, widespread lesions, and rapid evolution. A 40-year-old woman sought treatment, complaining about severe oral pain and dysphagia. Intraoral inspection revealed ulcerated lesions on the lips, buccal mucosa, and floor of the mouth. The number of lesions quickly increased and resembled erythema multiforme. She also presented blistering lesions on the back, abdomen, neck, and eyes. Incisional oral biopsy revealed pemphigus vulgaris. This report emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of an oral biopsy in systemic diseases and the management of the lesions.

### Acute oral ulcers [^116BNiLi]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

In general, a detailed history and examination of the patient provides sufficient information for diagnosis. The pattern, frequency, and natural history of ulcer episodes are helpful. The presence or absence of associated features and the site of oral involvement guides most physicians accurately in the diagnosis. Additional investigations, including blood tests, and occasionally the use of oral cultures or biopsy, are needed to make a definitive diagnosis. A multispecialty approach is often necessary to evaluate patients with other systemic features. Most acute oral ulcers heal spontaneously without specific therapy being necessary, but an understanding of the cause of the ulcer is reassuring to the patient and guides the clinician in management to prevent recurrent episodes of oral ulceration, or chronicity of ulcers.

### Mucosal-dominant pemphigus vulgaris in a 90-year-old woman [^111TUSWs]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Physicians should be sufficiently familiar with the oral manifestations of PV, such as gingivitis, even in the oldest older patients, and should involve specialists to ensure early diagnosis and treatment, thereby influencing the prognosis and course of this disorder.

Learning points

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) rarely affects the oldest-old population.
Refractory oral membrane erosions are the presenting signs of PV and should raise suspicion of this disease.
Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment with systemic glucocorticoids, the mainstay of therapy for PV, is usually highly effective for controlling the disease.

### Comprehensive management of major aphthous ulcer [^113gqHCN]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent aphthous ulcers are the most prevalent oral mucosal disease, but the subset major aphthous ulcer is a less frequent type. These ulcers are refractory, may persist for several weeks to months, and interfere with the normal state of health. The aetiology is multifactorial and so is the treatment. We present a case of an adolescent male patient reported with multiple oral ulcers. He developed three ulcers simultaneously and suffered for 10 months despite using topical medications prescribed by different dental practitioners. We executed a multidisciplinary treatment approach that resulted in a long-term disease-free state. The treatment methods followed in our case could be a successful model to implement by medical practitioners and oral physicians when the situation demands.

### Ecstasy abuse and its effects on the oral mucosa [^112aP7rK]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Ecstasy is an illicit drug that has been increasingly abused by young people. This synthetic drug has both stimulant and hallucinogenic effects and is usually consumed in a tablet. The side effects of ecstasy use include nausea, muscle cramping, fever, and symptoms mostly linked to muscular tension including jaw pain, facial pain, and headaches. There are few studies assessing the ecstasy effects on the oral mucosa, both clinically and histopathologically. The authors report 2 young women (22- and 27-year-old) who presented multifocal oral erosions and ulcerations. The lesions were painful and covered by a yellow-white pseudomembrane with a bright erythematous halo. By microscopy, it was observed superficial ulceration surrounded by acanthotic squamous epithelium with marked spongiosis, interstitial edema within the corion and perivascular lyphoid infiltrate, suggesting drug-induced oral mucositis. In conclusion, ecstasy use may be associated with the development of oral ulcers, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis when assessing multifocal oral ulcerations, especially in young people.

LE-Nonspecific Oral Ulcers

Aphthous Ulcers

An aphthous ulcer is described as a white to yellow painful ulcer with a surrounding red rim. The lesion is usually presented with multiple lesions or in a group, and tends to involve primarily lining tissue: the soft palate, buccal and labial mucosa. Aphthous ulcers are more common in JSLE patients than in adult SLE and usually occur when disease is active. There are four types of aphthous ulcer, classified as (a) minor ulcers, smaller than 1 cm, usually healing without scar; (b) major ulcers, larger than 1 cm, often healing with scar; (c) herpetiform ulcers, a group of small ulcers (more than ten lesions); and (d) severe ulcers, a continuous minor ulcer lasting months. In our observations, the most common type of aphthous ulcer in JSLE patients is multiple minor ulcers and less than ten lesions (Fig. 1 d).

Lupus Cheilitis

Lupus cheilitis is an inflammation of the buccal lips. The typical lesion is small or diffuse, erythematous and edematous, and may turn into crusty painful ulcers. Cheilitis often involves the vermilion zone of the lower lip (typical lupus cheilitis). As the lesion is found in the sun-exposed area, lupus cheilitis is usually associated with photosensitivity in JSLE patients. Extensive erosive lupus cheilitis that involves both upper and lower lips has also been reported in JSLE patients and appears in active disease (Fig. 1 e).

Other LE-Nonspecific Oral Lesions

Bullous SLE is a rare clinical manifestation developed by circulating antibodies against type VII collagen at the sub-epidermis. It typically presents with multiple tense bullae at the face, neck and trunk. Bullous LE at buccal mucosa has been reported in adult SLE and JSLE patients.

Recommendation 1 — initial approach to seemingly innocuous oral mucosal lesions: The panel suggests that for adult patients with a clinically evident oral mucosal lesion with an unknown clinical diagnosis considered to be seemingly innocuous or nonsuspicious of malignancy, or other symptoms, clinicians should follow up periodically with the patient to determine the need for further evaluation; if the lesion has not resolved and the clinical diagnosis of a PMD cannot be ruled out, clinicians should perform a biopsy of the lesion or refer the patient to a specialist (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence.).

### Differential diagnoses of solitary and multiple pigmented lesions of the oral mucosa: evaluation of 905 specimens submitted to histopathological examination [^111Acggo]. Head & Neck (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim was to analyze the frequency, clinical and demographic features of solitary and multiple/diffuse oral pigmented lesions submitted to histopathological examination, and to summarize the features that guide the clinical differential diagnosis.

Methods

Clinical and demographic data were retrieved from biopsy records and descriptive statistics were performed.

Results

Nine hundred and five (0.51%) oral pigmented lesions were retrieved among 177356 specimens, being 95.9% solitary and 4.1% multiple/diffuse lesions. Regardless the overlapping clinical presentation, age, site, association with amalgam restoration, and a nodular appearance may help in the clinical differential diagnosis of solitary oral pigmentations. Patient's habits, site, and systemic signs and symptoms are helpful in the clinical differential diagnosis of multiple/diffuse lesions.

Conclusions

Oral pigmented lesions are a rare diagnosis in oral pathology and solitary lesions are more commonly submitted to biopsy. Some key features help in the differential diagnosis, though biopsy can be warranted in doubtful cases.

### Aphthous ulcers: a difficult clinical entity [^115ZbKvT]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2000). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) are the most common oral ulcerative disease, affecting 10% to 20% of the population. There are 3 clinical subtypes-minor, major, and herpetiform. Minor aphthous ulcers are the most common subtype, representing 80% to 90% of all recurrent aphthous ulcers. Clinically, RAU present as extremely painful, shallow ulcerations with an erythematous halo on unattached oral mucosa. The primary differential diagnosis is oral herpes simplex. The etiology of RAU is unknown. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy.

### Oral lesions in autoimmune bullous diseases: an overview of clinical characteristics and diagnostic algorithm [^113fE8nN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware that oral lesions in AIBD may look similar, and might be the only manifestation of disease. A quick and proper diagnosis is necessary for adequate treatment, which may take place in a multi-disciplinary setting. Direct immunofluorescence on a biopsy from skin or mucosa combined with IIF and additional serological tests are the cornerstones for the diagnosis of AIBD. By following the described diagnostic algorithm, clinicians should be able to recognize and accurately diagnose AIBD affecting the oral mucosa.

### Oral ulcerations in a patient with autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) [^1162ngjK]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 23-year-old woman with autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome complicated by recurrent pneumonia and sinusitis presented with 1week of multiple painful oral ulcers unresponsive to empiric antiviral and antifungal treatment. Her ulcers progressively worsened and she required hospitalisation for intravenous hydration and pain control. PCR swab of an ulcer was positive for varicella-zoster virus. Her symptoms never fully resolved despite antiviral therapy, and within 2weeks, she relapsed with new and worsening ulcers. Biopsy revealed chronic active inflammation with no evidence of viral inclusion bodies or fungal hyphae. She was diagnosed with recurrent aphthous stomatitis and referred to a local dentist for CO 2 laser treatments with rapid resolution of her symptoms. This case highlights the broad differential for recurrent oral ulcers in people with a primary immunodeficiency. It also raises awareness of the benefits of laser therapy for aphthous stomatitis treatment and the importance of partnering with our colleagues in dentistry.

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^1118kGyS]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old otherwise healthy male presented to the dermatology clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a 2-day history of multiple painful, non-pruritic ulcers in the genital and facial regions, fever, odynophagia, headache, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed pustules and vesicles with central umbilication at the same stage of development and targetoid crusted ulcers on the right inguinal area (Fig 1), base of the penis, right gluteal region, and left cheek along with bilateral painful inguinal adenopathy. The oropharynx showed erythematous patches and erosions with white exudate.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, what is the most likely etiology of the patient's ulcers?
A. Treponema pallidum
B. Monkeypox virus
C. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
D. Candida albicans
E. Non-infectious inflammation

Answers:
A. Treponema pallidum – Incorrect. Primary syphilis infection is classically characterized by a painless genital ulcer, often associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serologies for syphilis were negative in this case.
B. Monkeypox virus – Correct. Upon further questioning, the patient reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with alternating male partners and recent contact with symptomatic partners. After 7 days, the patient developed additional lesions on the bilateral thighs, face, right anterior neck, and buttocks. Lesions evolved to erosions with overlying crusts, with spontaneous resolution of all lesions after 3 weeks. Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus. Beginning in May of 2022, a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases emerged. Historically, lesions began on the face and spread across the trunk and extremities. In the current outbreak, it has been observed that lesions begin primarily in the genital region in men who have sex with men.
C. HSV – Incorrect. Genital herpes presents as painful grouped vesicles or ulcers. Disseminated HSV could present as facial and genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient. Serologies for HIV were negative.
D. Candida albicans – Incorrect. Cutaneous candidiasis presents as bright red erythema surrounded by satellite pustules and papules in moist areas. Deep fungal infections can cause genital ulcers but C. albicans is not the typical pathogen.
E. Non-infectious inflammation – Incorrect. Behcet syndrome is characterized by recurrent oral apthae associated with genital ulcers. The precise etiology is unknown, but an autoimmune etiology has been proposed. The classic triad includes uveitis as well.

### Oral melanoacanthoma of the palate: an unusual presentation of an uncommon entity [^111mPtdB]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The first case of oral MA was reported by Tomich in 1978. Since his initial report, fewer than 100 cases of this entity have been documented. The etiology of oral MA is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a reactive process. A history of trauma has been documented in some cases. Clinically, oral MAs present as well-defined dark-brown to black, smooth, flat, or slightly elevated lesions. They are typically asymptomatic; however, in some cases pruritus, pain, or burning has been reported.MAs rapidly increase in size and can reach a diameter of several centimeters within a few weeks. Because of this alarming presentation, biopsies are often performed to rule out melanoma. On microscopic examination, the melanin-producing dendritic melanocytes, which are normally limited to the basal epithelial layer, are heavily scattered throughout the surface epithelium. It is the dispersal of melanocytes into epithelial layers other than the basal epithelium that causes the discoloration and facilitates diagnosis. Epithelial acanthosis, spongiosis, and increased numbers of basal melanocytes are also important microscopic findings. Once a diagnosis of MA is rendered, no additional treatment is required. MA often regresses spontaneously and has no malignant potential.

Although cutaneous MAs have also been observed, the cutaneous variant is distinctly different from its oral counterpart. Cutaneous MA, first described by Bloch in 1927, is a benign mixed proliferation of keratinocytes and melanocytes and is considered to be a variation of seborrheic keratosis. Most cases of cutaneous MA have been seen in middle-age white adults without a gender predilection. The trunk is the most frequently affected site, and lesions present with a roughened or papillary surface. This appearance is in contrast to that of oral MA, which frequently appears as a rapidly expanding flat or slightly elevated pigmented lesion, usually involving the buccal mucosa. Unlike cutaneous cases, oral MA favors African-American women, with a mean age of presentation in the fourth to fifth decades of life.

The clinical differential diagnosis for oral MA may include other pigmented mucosal lesions such as physiologic pigmentation, medication-induced pigmentation, mucosal (intraoral) nevi, focal melanosis, and most importantly, melanoma. Most of these entities can be excluded with an accurate history, as only oral MA will achieve such a rapid growth in size during a period of only a few weeks. However, in cases in which such a history cannot be ascertained or is unknown, the histologic examination provides the definitive diagnosis.

### White lesions of the oral cavity [^1133J4tN]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

White lesions are frequently found during the examination of the oral cavity. Although some benign physiologic entities may present as white lesions, systemic conditions, infections, and malignancies may also present as white oral lesions. An appreciation of the many clinical entities that white lesions may represent is necessary if a differential diagnosis of white lesions is to be elucidated. The appreciation of subtle clinical findings associated with white lesions of the oral cavity permits clinicians to better care for their patients.

### Burning pain on the upper labial mucosa [^117NwjPn]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 36-year-old pregnant woman presented with 1 week of burning pain on the upper labial mucosa and new onset headache. Six days prior, the patient's 3-year-old child tested positive for streptococcal pharyngitis after exposure at daycare and was treated with antibiotics. Physical examination was remarkable for pink thin plaques with white, polycyclic borders on the upper labial mucosa (Fig 1) that could not be wiped away. The patient was empirically treated for streptococcal pharyngitis with penicillin V owing to her symptoms and pregnancy status. Lip pain and rash began to improve within 3 days and resolved completely within 4 weeks.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Lichen planus
B. Candidiasis
C. Aphthous stomatitis
D. Geographic lip
E. Herpetic gingivostomatitis

Answers:
A. Lichen planus – Incorrect. Oral lichen planus may involve labial mucosa and can be associated with sensitivity to acidic or spicy food similar to geographic tongue. However, this condition presents more commonly with bilateral white reticulations, which are frequently associated with erythema and erosions and yellow fibrinous exudate.
B. Candidiasis – Incorrect. Although oral candidiasis may present with burning pain and can involve any mucosal surface, this condition classically presents as curd-like white papules and plaques that can be wiped off.
C. Aphthous stomatitis – Incorrect. This common condition affects approximately 20% to 50% of the population and favors labial mucosa but presents more commonly with ovoid ulcers with a white-to-yellow base and an erythematous rim.
D. Geographic lip – Correct. Geographic tongue is a benign, inflammatory disorder of unclear etiology that predominantly involves the dorsal and lateral tongue. Ectopic geographic tongue (in this case, geographic lip specifically) may involve any oral mucosa and classically presents as flattened or atrophic lesions varying from a few millimeters to several centimeters with a serpiginous white border.
E. Herpetic gingivostomatitis – Incorrect. Herpetic gingivostomatitis may involve the labial mucosa but frequently presents with vesicles at the vermillion border that break to form erosions and ulcers that subsequently crust.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis: a comprehensive review and recommendations on therapeutic options [^112c8dvn]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common chronic disease in the oral mucosa that affects about 20% of the population. It is characterized by solitary or multiple, recurrent, small ulcers with erythematous haloes and yellow/gray floors. RAS can be managed through a wide variety of preventative measures and therapies, intending to reduce ulcer pain, stimulate ulcer healing, and/or prevent ulcer recurrence. First-line treatment options include topical medications in the form of corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide), anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox), antibiotics (doxycycline), and antiseptics (lidocaine). In more severe cases of RAS where local treatment is insufficient, systemic drugs in the form of corticosteroids (prednisone), immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide), and antibiotics/antimicrobials (clofazimine) can prove effective. This review will summarize current treatment options for RAS with discussion of prevention, topical measures, natural treatments, systemic therapies, and new potential therapies. Furthermore, this review will provide recommendations on therapeutic options for RAS based on disease severity and patient circumstances.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis [^1151sL4a]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common acute oral ulcerative condition in North America. RAS is divided into a mild, common form, simple aphthosis, and a severe, less common form, complex aphthosis. Aphthosis is a reactive condition. The lesions of RAS can represent the mucosal manifestation of a variety of conditions. These include conditions with oral and genital aphthae such as ulcus vulvae acutum, reactive nonsexually related acute genital ulcers, and Behçet disease. The mouth is the beginning of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the lesions of RAS can be a manifestation of GI diseases such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn disease. Complex aphthosis may also have correctable causes. The clinician should seek these in a careful evaluation. Successful management of both simple and complex aphthosis depends on accurate diagnosis, proper classification, recognition of provocative factors, and the identification of associated diseases. The outlook for patients with both simple and complex aphthosis is positive.

### Oral GVHD post-cardiac xenograft valve replacement: a case report [^115GWaqy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Dental treatment plan

The patient was managed by detailed history recording, including questions about familial and/or immunity related diseases which were uneventful, reaching a preliminary diagnosis along the clinical presentations observed intra-orally. Upon examination; the oral lesions were non-scrapable, not painful, and with no history of remission and/or exacerbations and the absence of other areas involved, before the cardiac surgery. So, differential diagnoses as infectious, lichen planus or lupus erythematosus were excluded. A cardiology consultation was made, for the possibility of GVHD to occur from xenografts and the response was positive but rare, with the oral mucosa merely involved.

The case was managed by an oral hygiene visit including oral hygiene instructions (OHI) for the gingival inflammation observed with plaque accumulation. The patient was regularly monitored with Cardiology and periodically with Periodontics for almost a year. Also, an oral corticosteroid mouthwash was prescribed for the oral manifestations (leukoplakia, reticular features similar to lichen planus, marginal gingival inflammations), which did not much affect the lesions observed. A biopsy was planned and performed to confirm the diagnosis. The labial mucosal lining was very thin along ulcers observed, and upon soft tissue manipulation the areas readily bled and were easily torn. Also, periodic periodontal follow-ups were planned for monitoring of the oral lesions, a future biopsy may be required for any soft tissue changes and a referral to gastroenterology (GI) for further investigation.

### Clinical immunology review series: an approach to the patient with recurrent orogenital ulceration, including Behçet's syndrome [^113jL4qE]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with recurrent orogenital ulcers may have complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e.g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology for which there is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic.

### Mouth ulcer… [^113KSfsZ]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The two most common causes of oral ulceration are local trauma and aphthous stomatitis, a condition characterized by the recurrent formation of oral ulcers for largely unknown reasons. Mouth ulcers often cause pain and discomfort and may alter the person's choice of food while healing occurs. Pathophysiology The exact pathogenesis is dependent upon the cause. Simple mechanisms which predispose the mouth to trauma and ulceration are xerostomia and epithelial atrophy, making the lining more fragile and easily breached. Stomatitis is a general term meaning inflammation within the mouth, and often may be associated with ulceration.

Pathologically, the mouth represents a transition between the gastrointestinal tract and the skin, meaning that many gastrointestinal and cutaneous conditions can involve the mouth. Some conditions usually associated with the whole gastrointestinal tract may present only in the mouth, e.g., orofacial granulomatosis/oral Crohn's disease. Similarly, cutaneous conditions can also involve the mouth and sometimes only the mouth, sparing the skin. The different environmental conditions mean that some cutaneous disorders which produce characteristic lesions on the skin produce only nonspecific lesions in the mouth. Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can be indicative of an immunodeficiency, signaling low levels of immunoglobulin in the oral mucous membranes. Chemotherapy, HIV, and mononucleosis are all causes of immunodeficiency/immunosuppression with which oral ulcers may become a common manifestation.

Autoimmunity is also a cause of oral ulceration. Diagnosis Diagnosis of mouth ulcers usually consists of a medical history followed by an oral examination as well as examination of any other involved area. The following details may be pertinent: The duration that the lesion has been present, the location, the number of ulcers, the size, the color and whether it is hard to touch, bleeds or has a rolled edge. As a general rule, a mouth ulcer that does not heal within 2 or 3 weeks should be examined by a health care professional who is able to rule out oral cancer. If there have been previous ulcers that have healed, then this again makes cancer unlikely. An ulcer that keeps forming on the same site and then healing may be caused by a nearby sharp surface, and ulcers that heal and then recur at different sites are likely to be recurrent aphthous stomatitis.

Malignant ulcers are likely to be single in number, and conversely, multiple ulcers are very unlikely to be oral cancer. There may be nearby causative factor, e.g. a broken tooth with a sharp edge that is traumatizing the tissues. Otherwise, the person may be asked about problems elsewhere, e.g. ulceration of the genital mucous membranes, eye lesions or digestive problems, swollen glands in neck or a general unwell feeling. The diagnosis comes mostly from the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests microbiological swabs, or urinalysis. A biopsy with or without immunofluorescence may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a systemic disease is suspected.

Pigmented lesions are a common finding in the oral cavity. Oral pigmented lesions may range from solitary to multiple, pinpoint to diffuse, and have a variety of clinical implications. Nearly all solitary pigmented lesions require a biopsy to rule out mucosal melanoma. Oral mucosal melanoma has a grim prognosis and early discovery is of utmost importance. Multiple pigmented lesions in the oral cavity may indicate a systemic condition about which the patient may not be aware.

### Oral cancer… [^114NXYvb]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Oral cancer, also known as oral cavity cancer, tongue cancer or mouth cancer, is a cancer of the lining of the lips, mouth, or upper throat. In the mouth, it most commonly starts as a painless red or white patch, that thickens, gets ulcerated and continues to grow. When on the lips, it commonly looks like a persistent crusting ulcer that does not heal, and slowly grows. Other symptoms may include difficult or painful swallowing, new lumps or bumps in the neck, a swelling in the mouth, or a feeling of numbness in the mouth or lips. Risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use. Those who use both alcohol and tobacco have a 15 times greater risk of oral cancer than those who use neither. Other risk factors include betel nut chewing and sun exposure on the lip. HPV infection may play a limited role in some oral cavity cancers. Oral cancer is a subgroup of head and neck cancers.

Diagnosis is made by sampling of the lesion, followed by an imaging workup which can include CT scan, MRI, PET scan to determine the local extension of the tumor, and if the disease has spread to distant parts of the body. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of oral cancer depend on the location of the tumor but are generally thin, irregular, red and/or white patches in the mouth. The classic warning sign is a persistent rough patch with ulceration, and a raised border that is minimally painful. On the lip, the ulcer is more commonly crusting and dry, and in the pharynx it is more commonly a mass. It can also be associated with loose teeth, bleeding gums, persistent ear ache, a feeling of numbness in the lip and chin, or swelling. When the cancer extends to the oropharynx, there can also be difficulty swallowing.

Human papillomavirus Infection with human papillomavirus, particularly type 16, is a cause of oropharyngeal cancer. However, its role in the genesis of oral cavity cancers is a matter of debate. A 2023 meta-analysis observed that the HPV was present 6% of all oral cavity cancer cases, however without establishing a role of this virus in the oncogenesis of these tumors. The authors even reported that some base of tongue tumors may have been misclassified as oral cavity tumors, therefore mistakenly increasing the rate of HPV-positive oral cavity cancers. Premalignant lesions A premalignant lesion is defined as "a benign, morphologically altered tissue that has a greater than normal risk of malignant transformation. " There are several different types of premalignant lesion that occur in the mouth.

Some oral cancers begin as white patches, red patches or mixed red and white patches. Other common premalignant lesions include oral submucous fibrosis and actinic cheilitis. In the Indian subcontinent oral submucous fibrosis is very common due to betel nut chewing. This condition is characterized by limited opening of mouth and burning sensation on eating of spicy food. This is a progressive lesion in which the opening of the mouth becomes progressively limited, and later on even normal eating becomes difficult. Diagnosis Diagnosis of oral cancer is completed for initial diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. A complete history, and clinical examination is first completed, then a wedge of tissue is cut from the suspicious lesion for tissue diagnosis. This might be done with scalpel biopsy, punch biopsy, fine or core needle biopsy.

### Oral manifestations of erythema multiforme [^114F93mU]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is a reactive mucocutaneous disorder in a disease spectrum that comprises a self-limited, mild, exanthematic, cutaneous variant with minimal oral involvement (EM minor) to a progressive, fulminating, severe variant with extensive mucocutaneous epithelial necrosis (SJS and TEN). Significant differences exist among EM minor, EM major, SJS, and TEN with regards to severity and clinical expression; however, all variants share two common features: typical or less typical cutaneous target lesions and satellite-cell or more widespread necrosis of the epithelium. These features are considered to be sequelae of a cytotoxic immunologic attack on keratinocytes expressing non-self-antigens. These antigens are primarily microbial (viruses) or drugs and in rare instances histocompatibility antigens [5]. Although the precise pathogenesis is unknown, there is a tendency to consider EM both minor and major as part of one spectrum that is most often triggered by viral infections, and SJS and TEN as a separate one most often elicited by drugs with EM major and SJS representing a bridge in the continuum of EM. The oral manifestations of the spectrum of EM range from tender superficial erythematous and hyperkeratotic plaques to painful deep hemorrhagic bullae and erosions. Other mucosal surfaces including ocular, nasal, pharyngeal, laryngeal, upper respiratory, and anogenital may be involved. Scarring sequelae from ocular and pharyngeal involvement cause morbidity. The oral EM variant is an underrecognized form of EM. Most patients have chronic or recurrent oral lesions only, but one third have oral and lip lesions and one quarter have oral, lip, and skin lesions. This variant is a reaction pattern similar to EM minor, EM major, SJS, and TEN. The diagnosis of oral EM is one of exclusion. Careful clinical evaluation for other chronic mucocutaneous diseases, such as pemphigus, paraneoplastic pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and lichen planus, is a necessary component of the diagnosis. The value of a biopsy specimen studied by both routine histopathologic and immunopathologic methods is fundamental to excluding the other causes for this variant of EM.

### Case report: scabies invading gingival tissue [^1168pSSG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-plaque-induced lesions may occur on the gingiva as medical disorders or manifestations of systemic conditions. Scabies is a parasitic infection caused by Sarcoptes scabiei. Here, we present the first case of oral scabies reported in the literature located on the gingiva in a 43-year-old woman. She was admitted to the hospital complaining of an ulcerative lesion on the gingiva with unknown duration, with a suggestive diagnosis of pemphigoid. A diagnosis of scabies infestation was made based on the visualization of eggs and larvae/nymph forms. The treatment consisted of 100 mg of ivermectin (three times per day for 15 days), supplemental oral hygiene with chlorhexidine, and extensive cleaning. The follow-up was made 30 days after treatment with ivermectin. The patient did not report side effects, with skin and oral lesions completely healed. Based on this, we need to perform a thoughtful ectoscopy examination and be alert to signs that indicate unusual causes to diagnose correctly and choose the appropriate treatment.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of aphthous stomatitis [^1129nbRU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aphthous ulcers are the most common oral mucosal lesions in the general population. These often are recurrent and periodic lesions that cause clinically significant morbidity. Many suggestions have been proposed but the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is unknown. Several precipitating factors for aphthous ulcers appear to operate in subjects with genetic predisposition. An autoimmune or hypersensitivity mechanism is widely considered possible. Sometimes aphthous ulcers can be the sign of systemic diseases, so it is essential to establish a correct diagnosis to determine suitable therapy. Before initiating medications for aphthous lesions, clinicians should determine whether well-recognized causes are contributing to the disease and these factors should be corrected. Various treatment modalities are used, but no therapy is definitive. Topical medications, such as antimicrobial mouth-washes and topical corticosteroids (dexamethasone, triamcinolone, fluocinonide, or clobetasol), can achieve the primary goal to reduce pain and to improve healing time but do not improve recurrence or remission rates. Systemic medications can be tried if topical therapy is ineffective.

ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS ON PAGE 1

Answer to question 1: D

MIRM is characterised by mucositis, possibly but not necessarily associated with sparse cutaneous involvement, which occurs after an MP infection.

Canavan et al considered this condition a separate entity from SJS due to its distinctive epidemiology, morphology, pathophysiology and disease outcomes. For this reason, specific diagnostic criteria have been proposed (table 1). From an epidemiological point of view, patients with MIRM are usually young and predominantly male. The incidence of MIRM is closely related to the spread of MP, whereas around 25% of patients with this infection may have mucocutaneous eruption. Clinically, these subjects usually present prodromal respiratory symptoms, followed after 1 week by mucocutaneous rash. In particular, MIRM affects the oral mucosa in 94% of cases and often the urogenital region. These clinical features can help doctors distinguish MIRM from EM major, usually and predominantly characterised by skin involvement with acral targetoid lesions and minimal or absent mucosal implication.

Table 1
Proposed diagnostic criteria for classic cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae -induced rash and mucositis

This patient developed a lower degree of skin involvement than SJS, along with vesiculobullous and significant erosive mucosal eruptions that also involved the urogenital region, as part of a respiratory tract infection. The absence of widespread epidermal necrosis, and the extensive and centrally distributed lesions, along with the type of exposure to drug which is not causative of SJS, further helped to rule out a drug-induced reaction. Finally, a diagnosis of toxic epidermal necrolysis was unlikely due to the absence of extensive cutaneous detachment.

Herpetic gingivostomatitis was also improbable due to multiorgan involvement. Nevertheless, in the setting of a differential diagnosis, a viral culture and a PCR for herpes simplex virus (HSV) should always be considered to rule out a herpetic infection, which is the main immunological trigger for EM major and can lead to potential complications in immunocompromised patients.

A differential diagnosis is relevant not only due to the different treatment options and patient education but also to predict the course of the disease, which is usually milder compared with EM majorand SJS, with an overall good prognosis and rapid recovery.

### Melanin-associated pigmented lesions of the oral mucosa: presentation, differential diagnosis, and treatment [^11423KHt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Intraoral pigmentation is quite common and has numerous etiologies, ranging from exogenous to physiological to neoplastic. Many pigmented lesions of the oral cavity are associated with melanin pigment. The differential diagnosis of mucosal pigmented lesions includes hematomas, varices, and petechiae which may appear to be pigmented. Unlike cutaneous melanomas, oral melanomas are diagnosed late and have a poor prognosis regardless of depth of invasion. As such, the clinical presentation and treatment of intraoral melanoma will be discussed. Developing a differential diagnosis is imperative for a clinician faced with these lesions in order to appropriately treat the patient. This article will focus on the most common oral melanocytic lesions, along with mimics.

### Systemic tacrolimus in the treatment of recalcitrant mucosal lichen planus [^113Hfvm1]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case 3

A woman in her 70s presented with a 1.5-year history of generalized oral pain with difficulty swallowing. She was initially seen by her primary care physician for an oral ulcer and had tried chlorhexidine and steroid rinses, both resulting in no improvement. On physical exam, the patient had erythema of the anterior gingival and erosions on the buccal mucosa but no cutaneous involvement. She had difficulty tapering below 20 mg/d of systemic prednisone as monotherapy without experiencing an exacerbation. Over the next 3 years, the patient failed or had difficulty tolerating multiple topical and systemic agents (Table I).

The patient was subsequently given oral tacrolimus 0.5 mg twice a day and reported decreased gingival bleeding along with improved oral intake because of decreased pain. Physical examination at her 1-month follow-up showed a significant decrease in the gingival erythema along with complete healing of previous erosions and no new oral lesions. Tacrolimus was discontinued after 4 months by her primary admitting team to minimize the risk of infection during an unrelated prolonged hospitalization. The condition of the patient was under good control at the time, and she did not notice any adverse reaction to the tacrolimus besides fatigue.

### Treatment… [^1113Q9ND]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Gingivostomatitis is a combination of gingivitis and stomatitis, or an inflammation of the oral mucosa and gingiva. Herpetic gingivostomatitis is often the initial presentation during the first herpes simplex infection. It is of greater severity than herpes labialis which is often the subsequent presentations. Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is the most common viral infection of the mouth. Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis represents the clinically apparent pattern of primary herpes simplex virus infection, since the vast majority of other primary infections are symptomless. PHGS is caused predominantly by HSV-1 and affects mainly children. Prodromal symptoms, such as fever, anorexia, irritability, malaise and headache, may occur in advance of disease. The disease presents as numerous pin-head vesicles, which rupture rapidly to form painful irregular ulcerations covered by yellow–grey membranes.

Sub-mandibular lymphadenitis, halitosis and refusal to drink are usual concomitant findings. Signs and symptoms The symptoms can be mild or severe and may include:

- Not able to chew or swallow
- Sores on the inside of the cheeks or gums
- Fever
- General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling
- Very sore mouth with no desire to eat
- Halitosis. Herpetic gingivostomatitis infections can present as acute or recurrent. Acute infection refers to the first invasion of the virus, and recurrent is when reactivation of the latent virus occurs. Acute herpetic gingivostomatitis primarily occurs in children, particularly of those under the age of six years old. HSV-1 can very easily enter and replicate within epidermal and dermal cells through skin or mucosal surfaces which have abrasions.

This results in numerous small vesicles or blisters of up to 1–2mm on the oral mucosa, erosions on the lips, eventual hemorrhagic crusting and even ulceration, covered by a yellowish-grey pseudomembrane, surrounded by an erythematous halo. Diagnosis Histopathology The histological appearance of a herpetic infection on the mucosa includes degeneration of stratified squamous epithelial cells, the loss of intercellular connections and inflammatory infiltrate around the capillaries of the dermis layer. An intact herpetic vesicle presents as an intraepithelial blister histologically. This vesicle is caused by rupture and distension of the virally epithelial cells by intracellular oedema and coalescence of disrupted cells. Rupturing of the infected cells cause a great number of viral particles to be released, rendering them the ability to affect adjacent epithelial cells and even the sensory axons of the trigeminal nerve.

Histologically, these infected cells have an eosinophilic cytoplasm and large, pale vesicular nuclei, appearing swollen under the microscope. The cytoplasms of the infected cells fuse, collectively forming giant cells with many nuclei. The balloon cells and multi-nucleated giant cells can often be identified in smears taken from an intact vesicle or from one which has been recently ruptured. The lamina propria shows a variable inflammatory infiltrate, the density of which depends on the stage and severity of the disease, and inflammatory cells also extend into the epithelium. Differential diagnosis Diagnosis of HG is very much clinically based. Therefore, it is imperative to rule out other diseases that present similarly, bearing in mind the past medical history of the patient. Some differential diagnoses to bear in mind when considering herpetic gingivostomatitis are:

### Mouth ulcer… [^113roCFD]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The two most common causes of oral ulceration are local trauma and aphthous stomatitis, a condition characterized by the recurrent formation of oral ulcers for largely unknown reasons. Mouth ulcers often cause pain and discomfort and may alter the person's choice of food while healing occurs. Pathophysiology The exact pathogenesis is dependent upon the cause. Simple mechanisms that predispose the mouth to trauma and ulceration are xerostomia and epithelial atrophy, making the lining more fragile and easily breached. Stomatitis is a general term meaning inflammation within the mouth, and often may be associated with ulceration.

Pathologically, the mouth represents a transition between the gastrointestinal tract and the skin, meaning that many gastrointestinal and cutaneous conditions can involve the mouth. Some conditions usually associated with the whole gastrointestinal tract may present only in the mouth, e.g., orofacial granulomatosis/oral Crohn's disease. Similarly, cutaneous conditions can also involve the mouth and sometimes only the mouth, sparing the skin. The different environmental conditions mean that some cutaneous disorders which produce characteristic lesions on the skin produce only nonspecific lesions in the mouth. Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can be indicative of an immunodeficiency, signaling low levels of immunoglobulin in the oral mucous membranes. Chemotherapy, HIV, and mononucleosis are all causes of immunodeficiency/immunosuppression with which oral ulcers may become a common manifestation.

Autoimmunity is also a cause of oral ulceration. Diagnosis Diagnosis of mouth ulcers usually consists of a medical history followed by an oral examination as well as examination of any other involved area. The following details may be pertinent: The duration that the lesion has been present, the location, the number of ulcers, the size, the color and whether it is hard to touch, bleeds or has a rolled edge. As a general rule, a mouth ulcer that does not heal within 2 or 3 weeks should be examined by a health care professional who is able to rule out oral cancer. If there have been previous ulcers that have healed, then this again makes cancer unlikely. An ulcer that keeps forming on the same site and then healing may be caused by a nearby sharp surface, and ulcers that heal and then recur at different sites are likely to be recurrent aphthous stomatitis.

Malignant ulcers are likely to be single in number, and conversely, multiple ulcers are very unlikely to be oral cancer. There may be nearby causative factor, e.g. a broken tooth with a sharp edge that is traumatizing the tissues. Otherwise, the person may be asked about problems elsewhere, e.g. ulceration of the genital mucous membranes, eye lesions or digestive problems, swollen glands in neck or a general unwell feeling. The diagnosis comes mostly from the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests microbiological swabs, or urinalysis. A biopsy with or without immunofluorescence may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a systemic disease is suspected.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of potentially malignant disorders in the oral cavity: a report of the American dental association [^111TAhDU]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2017). Medium credibility.

Conventional visual and tactile examination (CVTE) — scope and lesion considerations include that CVTE is performed intraorally and extraorally after review of the patient's medical, social, and dental history with assessment of symptoms and lymph node and neck examination; a major purpose is to identify mucosal or submucosal abnormalities, which have been observed in as many as 10% of patients. Important considerations are that abnormalities most commonly manifest as leukoplakia, with possible speckled leukoplakia (erythroleukoplakia) or erythroplakia; biopsies in erythroplakia or persistently ulcerated lesions are more likely to indicate OSCC or moderate to severe epithelial dysplasia; not all leukoplakias show microscopic features of epithelial dysplasia; leukoplakia progression over time is inconsistent in predicting which lesions will progress and how quickly; dysplasia can be present in clinically normal mucosa; and oral cancer may arise from a number of cells in an area field of concentration that can lead to satellite lesions rather than from a single cell.

Stomatitis

Stomatitis, or oral mucositis, refers specifically to inflammatory diseases of the mouth, including mucosa, dentition, periapical abscesses, and periodontium. Such ailments can impair a patient's ability to eat, swallow, and talk and can cause significant pain. Stomatitis is characterized by ulceration in the oroesophageal mucosa, resulting in pain, erythema, dysphagia, and occasionally bleeding. Onset typically occurs early (≤ 1 month after treatment initiation) and is transient. The condition is also a common toxicity associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, occurring as nonspecific ulcerations for which localized palliative treatments and systemic analgesics are generally applied. In contrast to stomatitis associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, stomatitis associated with mTOR therapy has an inflammatory component often clinically mimicking aphthous stomatitis (commonly known as canker sores) and is differentiated from lesions of viral etiology by their localization to the nonkeratinized movable oral and oropharynx mucosa, as opposed to the mucosa of the palate, gingiva, or dorsal tongue surface. These differences also suggest that the aphthous-like lesions observed with mTOR inhibitors differ from the lesions observed with cytotoxic agents, so management strategies to prevent or treat mTOR inhibitor associated stomatitis also must be distinguished.

### Oral lesions in autoimmune bullous diseases: an overview of clinical characteristics and diagnostic algorithm [^111UAQns]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pemphigus diseases comprise mucocutaneous intra-epithelial blistering diseases that target desmosomal proteins, resulting in loss of cell adhesion between keratinocytes. The two main variants are pemphigus vulgaris (PV) with autoantibodies targeting desmoglein 3 (DSG3) and sometimes desmoglein 1 (DSG1), and pemphigus foliaceus with autoantibodies reactive to DSG1 only. Pemphigus vulgaris presents with mucosal lesions, and the skin may be involved, while in pemphigus foliaceus only the skin is affected. Other rare variants of pemphigus include pemphigus vegetans, pemphigus erythematosus, and fogo selvagem (endemic pemphigus foliaceus). The last two are clinical variants of pemphigus foliaceus with reactivity to DSG1 and present with only skin lesions. Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a different disease entity related to malignancies, especially hematological malignancies and Castleman disease, and is often life threatening. The clinical hallmark is painful oral mucosal lesions accompanied with morphologically heterogenous skin lesions. The pathomechanism of PNP is complex with involvement of both humoral and cellular autoimmunity.

Chronic oral lesions can be painful, and can seriously influence the quality of life, nutrition status, and dental health of patients. Poor dental cleaning due to painful lesions may result in periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the gingiva. If not managed adequately, patients are at risk of losing the surrounding teeth. Oral manifestations of MMP, PV, and PNP may seem identical; however, the health impact, treatment, and prognosis of the diseases differ substantially. Therefore, it is important that clinicians make a quick and correct diagnosis. In addition to clinical assessment of the patient, immunodiagnostic tests are essential to differentiate between the AIBD subtypes. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with a complete overview of the clinical features of AIBDs predominantly involving the oral mucosa, and to describe the diagnostic process.

Those experiencing intraoral pain associated with dental and oral diseases are likely to pursue treatment from medical and dental providers. The causes for intraoral pain include odontogenic, periodontal, oral mucosal, or contiguous hard and soft tissue structures to the oral cavity. Providers should be vigilant when diagnosing these, as they should be among the first in their differential diagnoses to be ruled out. This review provides brief overviews of frequently encountered oral/dental diseases that cause intraoral pain, originating from the teeth, the surrounding mucosa and gingivae, tongue, bone, and salivary glands and their causes, features, diagnosis, and management strategies.

Question 2: Tissue fungal culture was negative. Which is the best step in management for this patient?
A. Urine for antigen detection
B. Peripheral blood smear
C. Molecular-based polymerase chain reaction assay from tissue
D. Blood culture for fungus
E. Excision

Answers:
A. Urine for antigen detection – Incorrect. The sensitivity of Histoplasma capsulatum antigen detection in urine is 92%. A false negative result is presented in granulomatous patients. The sensitivity of penicilliosis is 94.6% to 100% with some false positive results. Urine antigen detection is sensitive in disseminated patients but may be negative in primary cutaneous infection.
B. Peripheral blood smear – Incorrect. In routine peripheral blood smear will sometimes show yeast-like organisms in neutrophils in especially disseminated patients and may not be detected in granulomatous group.
C. Molecular-based polymerase chain reaction assay from tissue – Correct. The molecular-based method is more rapid, has high sensitivity, and is accurate in diagnosis. The sensitivity of the test is 93.6%to detect fungus in fresh tissue.
D. Blood culture for fungus – Incorrect. The culture will be detected up to 6 weeks after specimen collection. In severe forms of histoplasmosis including disseminated type or pulmonary involvement will have the greatest yield for culture positivity. In milder form will usually remain negative.
E. Excision – Incorrect. There is no evidence of the benefit of surgery in histoplasmosis because histoplasmosis can be cured with medication.

### The lip in lupus erythematosus [^111Wcqm8]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Lupus erythematosus (LE) frequently compromises the skin, lips and oral mucosa. There is a large body of medical and dental literature about the cutaneous and mucosal lesions of LE, but very little has been written specifically about labial lupus. The lip has a peculiar anatomical and histological architecture, and LE lesions at this site may have some distinct features. This article reviews the existing data and adds some new concepts to the issue of labial lupus in all of its presentations, comparing such lesions to the well-established characterization of cutaneous LE (in acute, subacute and chronic lesions), and highlighting some special clinical features that may enable a better diagnosis and differential diagnosis of lip diseases.

### An asymptomatic draining lesion on the cheek [^111pRHqD]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 14-year-old boy presented to a medical mission clinic in the Dominican Republic for a several-year history of an asymptomatic draining lesion on his left buccal cheek. He reported a history of tooth pain in the past, which had resolved several months before his presentation. On physical examination, there was a several-centimeter, bound-down, erythematous plaque with central ulceration (Fig 1). Intraoral examination found a nonvital first permanent molar, tooth 19 (Fig 2). A radiograph showed a periapical radial lucency consistent with a periapical abscess (Fig 3).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Furuncle
B. Pyogenic granuloma
C. Cutaneous sinus of dental origin (dental sinus)
D. Squamous cell carcinoma
E. Osteomyelitis

Answers:
A. Furuncle – Incorrect. Furuncles are skin abscesses that typically involve hair follicles and surrounding tissue; red, tender swollen nodules usually appear. The centralization of the lesion around a periapical abscess makes this less likely.
B. Pyogenic granuloma – Incorrect. Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular tumor that occurs on both mucosa and skin and appears as an overgrowth of tissue due to irritation, physical trauma, and hormonal factors. It usually involves the gums.
C. Cutaneous sinus of dental origin (dental sinus) – Correct. Cutaneous sinus of dental origin presents with dimpling or retraction of the skin, and a cordlike tract attached to the underlying alveolar bone may be palpable. Expression of a purulent discharge with applied pressure confirms the presence of a sinus tract, and radiolucency at the apex of the infected tooth confirms the diagnosis.
D. Squamous cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Oral squamous cell carcinoma develops as an ulcer with fissuring or raised exophytic margins and may also present as a red (erythroplakia) or white plaque (leukoplakia). The absence of these findings intraorally, the young age of the patient, and the presence of a periapical abscess makes this less likely.
E. Osteomyelitis – Incorrect. Skin overlying an area of osteomyelitis can present with pain, erythema and swelling and can be associated with a draining sinus tract. There may be uniformly increased radiodensity related to the tooth or widened periodontal ligament space or periapical area.

### Oral lesions in autoimmune bullous diseases: an overview of clinical characteristics and diagnostic algorithm [^116uu6g5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune bullous diseases are a group of chronic inflammatory disorders caused by autoantibodies targeted against structural proteins of the desmosomal and hemidesmosomal plaques in the skin and mucosa, leading to intra-epithelial or subepithelial blistering. The oral mucosa is frequently affected in these diseases, in particular, in mucous membrane pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, and paraneoplastic pemphigus. The clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and may present with erythema, blisters, erosions, and ulcers localized anywhere on the oral mucosa, and lead to severe complaints for the patients including pain, dysphagia, and foetor. Therefore, a quick and proper diagnosis with adequate treatment is needed. Clinical presentations of autoimmune bullous diseases often overlap and diagnosis cannot be made based on clinical features alone. Immunodiagnostic tests are of great importance in differentiating between the different diseases. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy shows depositions of autoantibodies along the epithelial basement membrane zone in mucous membrane pemphigoid subtypes, or depositions on the epithelial cell surface in pemphigus variants. Additional immunoserological tests are useful to discriminate between the different subtypes of pemphigoid, and are essential to differentiate between pemphigus and paraneoplastic pemphigus. This review gives an overview of the clinical characteristics of oral lesions and the diagnostic procedures in autoimmune blistering diseases, and provides a diagnostic algorithm for daily practice.

### Lobulated capillary haemangioma: a common lesion in an uncommon site [^113cPdhb]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a well-known localised granulation tissue overgrowth. It remains an aetiopathological enigma, with trauma, inflammatory and infectious agents being the suspected causative factors. It is a relatively common benign mucocutaneous lesion occurring intraorally or extraorally and is more common in women in the second decade of their lives than in men. Although it is a common lesion it may present with varying clinical features that sometimes may mimic more serious lesions such as malignancies. The clinical diagnosis of such lesion can be quite challenging. This case report drives attention towards the uncommon location of PG of lobular capillary haemangioma type occurring on anterior palate. Surgical excision of the lesion was planned because of the discomfort attributed to large size of the lesion and hindrance in mastication.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum, peripheral ulcerative keratitis, and oral ulcers in a patient with inflammatory bowel disease [^112KTJfc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The diagnosis of PG met the Delphi consensus criteria (1 major and 6 minor). Given its similarity to infections, vasculitis, and vascular ulcers, and its potential malignancy association, a thorough work-up was performed to rule out these conditions. Given colitis on endoscopic and biopsy findings 7 months prior and the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms during the current admission, mild IBD was considered the most likely PG trigger.

EIMs of IBD can be classified by their relationship to intestinal disease activity. Some, like erythema nodosum and oral aphthous ulcers, parallel IBD flares, while others, such as uveitis and ankylosing spondylitis, progress independently. PG and PUK fall into a third category with an unclear association with IBD activity. Ocular manifestations of IBD are common, particularly anterior uveitis and episcleritis.PUK is rare but has been reported in IBD cases requiring immunosuppressive therapy. Oral manifestations occur in up to 37% of adult IBD patients, with aphthous stomatitis being the most common. Other manifestations include pyostomatitis vegetans, mucosal cobblestoning, and orofacial granulomatosis. Most of these oral manifestations follow the activity of gut disease, making them useful clinical markers for IBD exacerbation.

PG has been implicated as a cause of PUK and oral ulcers, particularly in the presence of IBD. The most common presenting sign of ocular PG is ulceration, PUK, and decreased visual acuity. Oral ulcers associated with PG are irregular, with necrotic or friable bases. Differentiating PG versus IBD-related mucosal lesions is challenging due to similar presentation and nonspecific biopsy findings. However, in this case, the timing of mucosal lesions paralleling PG rather than IBD activity suggests they were manifestations of PG. Moreover, PUK is more consistent with PG. Paraneoplastic syndromes can also occur and present similarly, but there was no evidence of hematologic or solid organ malignancy on work-up.

The first-line treatment for severe, refractory cases of PG is intravenous corticosteroids and tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists. Infliximab is an effective treatment for IBD-associated PG, which the patient's cutaneous, ocular, and oral manifestations responded to.

Distinguishing between IBD-related EIMs and PG mucosal lesions is clinically significant as it can potentially influence treatment decisions. While both conditions respond to systemic immunosuppression, ocular and oral PG may indicate a more severe, refractory disease course, warranting close monitoring and aggressive treatment. Recognizing and managing such cases requires a multidisciplinary approach involving ophthalmologists, dentists, and gastroenterologists.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of potentially malignant disorders in the oral cavity: a report of the American dental association [^112yfLqx]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2017). Medium credibility.

American Dental Association guideline — evaluation of oral potentially malignant disorders (PMDs) states that an expert panel conducted a systematic review and formulated clinical recommendations; the panel formulated 1 good practice statement and 6 clinical recommendations and concluded that no available adjuncts demonstrated sufficient diagnostic test accuracy to support their routine use as triage tools during the evaluation of lesions in the oral cavity. For patients seeking care for suspicious lesions, immediate performance of a biopsy or referral to a specialist remains the single most important recommendation for clinical practice. In exceptional cases, when patients decline a biopsy or live in rural areas with limited access to care, the panel suggested that cytologic testing may be used to initiate the diagnostic process until a biopsy can be performed (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Erythema multiforme [^112z9dZE]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Mucosal involvement

The typical primary lesion of the oral mucosa consists of vesicles, but they rupture easily, giving way to post-bullous erosions. The initial mucosal lesions are rarely visualized. The onset of the disease is often brisk, preceded by tingling sensations in the affected areas. Lesions preferentially occur on non-keratinized mucous membranes such as the lips, cheeks, ventral surfaces of the tongue and are often painful. The gum is typically spared, allowing the differential diagnosis of primary herpetic infection, which is accompanied by general signs and symptoms, fever, and painful cervical lymph nodes. Involvement of the vermilion of both lips is common, with the presence of hemorrhagic crusts. Skin rosettes are inconsistent. The intensity of oral involvement varies; it can be minimal with few lesions, or, conversely, extremely extensive, preventing any food intake with subsequent hospitalization. Mucosal lesions spontaneously resolve within two to three weeks without leaving a scar. Outbreaks of oral erythema multiforme can recur at an unpredictable rate. Some patients will have only one outbreak in their lifetime, while others will have one to two per year. Conversely, some patients will have frequent or even continuous outbreaks. The current body of research does not provide any evidence to explain why patients differ in the frequency of outbreaks from once in lifetime to annually or continuous EM flare-ups. In HSV-induced EM some patients will only have one episode while others will have recurrences every month. HSV lesions do not always precede EM. The diagnosis is confirmed when long term suppressive antiviral therapy reduces the EM flares. The prognosis of oral erythema multiforme is dominated by the frequency of these recurrences, making this condition sometimes disabling, warranting a preventive treatment.

Oral EM

Isolated oral EM is a subset of EM that presents with clinical features of multiple self-limited irregular oral ulcers. The disease can be recurrent. HSV is the most common triggering agent. The diagnosis is challenging and is based on the exclusion of other mucosal diseases such as auto-immune bullous diseases, erosive mucosal lichen planus, and SJS, rendering the biopsy a crucial step in management. The current epidemiologic data is not enough to support this phenotype but in our experience, cases of isolated oral EM lesions without any skin manifestations, in the absence of drug intake and after ruling out auto-immune bullous diseases and connective tissue diseases by serology and/or biopsy would be considered and treated as EM.

### Mucocutaneous manifestations in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a review of literature [^112hpJRS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Oral or nasopharyngeal ulcers There are two types of these ulcers: those with classical LE histological changes representing oral discoid lesions (Figure 2 D) and nonspecific ulcers in keeping with aphthous ulceration. The lupus specific lesions begin with solitary erythema and hemorrhaging patches before developing into discoid ulcers with a reticulate border. Typically, the lesions are painless and located on the hard palate (Figure 2 E). In contrast, the nonspecific aphthous ulcers are usually painful, with multiple lesions on the buccal mucosa, lips and nasal septum, whilst also having a tendency to bleed. Oral and nasopharyngeal ulcers are normally found during active disease and subside with disease remission in JSLE and adult SLE patients.

Diffuse non-scarring alopecia Alopecia often presents with generalized hair loss without signs of inflammation on the scalp. Diffuse, non-scarring alopecia in JSLE and adult SLE patients usually suggests active disease. However, it may occur three months after a severe lupus flare; e.g. Telogen effluvium, which is a nonspecific finding and can also occur after any significant systemic disturbance. Other forms of alopecia also found in JSLE patients include lupus hair (thin and weakened hair at the periphery of the scalp), patchy non-scarring alopecia (mild erythematous, scattered patchy hair loss) and alopecia areata.

Livedo reticularis These lesions present more commonly in both juvenile and adult patients who are diagnosed with anti-phospholipid syndrome. It is characterized by erythematous or cyanotic discoloration of the skin with reticulated (net-like) pattern, usually on the lower extremities. The etiology and correlation with systemic disease activity are unknown, but vascular obstruction and blood viscosity may be the cause.

Raynaud's phenomenon Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by the classic "triphasic" color changes limited to the digits; pallor (white or blanching) followed by the cyanosis (blue) then erythema (red or reactive hyperemia). This color change sequence results from excessive vasospasms triggered by cold exposure or emotional stress, and can often be reversed following re-warming. There is no evidence to suggest that this symptom correlates with systemic disease.

### Oral sarcoidosis aiding in diagnosis of underlying systemic disease [^114Yc1Xr]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic, multisystemic, granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology characterised by the formation of non-caseating granuloma. It shows slight female predominance and has a bimodal age distribution. Lungs, skin, eye and liver are commonly affected. The oral lesion, though uncommon, may present as submucosal nodule, papule or superficial ulceration. Occasionally, oral lesion may be the first manifestation of underlying systemic disease. This case is interesting because it emphasises that dental practitioners may play a key role in early recognition of the clinical presentation of this multifaceted disease, and thereby aid in the diagnosis of the systemic condition. The present report deals with a case of sarcoidosis affecting the buccal mucosa in a 48-year-old woman. The patient was treated with oral prednisolone and within 4 months of corticosteroid therapy, the oral lesion regressed with no recurrence or new lesion noted over a period of 1year.

### Successful treatment of oral Crohn's disease by anti-TNF-alpha dose escalation-a case report [^1151qvme]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's Disease (CD) is typically characterized by abdominal symptoms, however, besides gastrointestinal symptoms, CD patients may suffer from extraintestinal manifestations which are far less common and medical treatment can be challenging.

Case Presentation

We report about a 34-year-old Crohn's Disease (CD) patient in clinical remission under adalimumab therapy who presented in the clinic for Cranio-Maxillo Surgery due to severe pain in the mandibular area. Ulcerative lesions of the buccal-side mucosa of the right mandible were detected. To rule out malignancy, a biopsy was obtained and revealed ulcerative stomatitis with noncaseating granulomas consistent with oral CD. Shortening the adalimumab administration interval to weekly injections resulted in a complete healing of the oral CD lesions without residual inflammation.

Conclusion

The case presented here demonstrates that gastroenterologists should evaluate and consider oral CD lesions as a possible marker of disease activity in patients despite having quiescent intestinal CD.

### Erythema multiforme limited to the oral mucosa in a teenager on oral contraceptive therapy [^114Vjpnj]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Erythema multiforme has been linked to numerous drugs and infectious agents. A link to oral contraceptive use has been reported in the past in the adult population but thus far has not been reported in children or adolescents.

Case

We report the case of an 18-yr-old female who developed oral erosions consistent with erythema multiforme two and a half weeks after initiating therapy with an oral contraceptive agent. A thorough examination for other inciting factors was negative, and the lesions slowly resolved over the course of 3 weeks.

Conclusions

This case illustrates that erythema multiforme should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adolescents with oral erosions who have been prescribed oral contraceptives.

Oral Mucosal Toxicities

Oral Mucosal Toxicities of Targeted Therapies

Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitor-Associated Stomatitis

Oral mucositis is the most frequent dose-limiting toxicity observed with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus, temsirolimus, and sirolimus). It is characterized by aphthous-like lesions which are very different from the ones induced by chemo- and radiotherapy. These single or multiple well-circumscribed, round, superficial, painful ulcers are solely localized in the non-keratinized mucosa and occasionally surrounded by an erythematous halo. mTOR inhibitor-associated stomatitis occurs in about 30% of patients treated with monotherapy, mostly within the first 8 weeks of treatment; 5% are grade ≥ 3 toxicities. In addition, although usually self-limited, lesions can be very painful.

Early patient education is critical to prevent repeated trauma and avoid aggressive treatment modalities to the oral mucosa. Close follow-up by an odontologist is also essential. Early management consists of the promotion of good oral hygiene, including mouth washing with normal saline, sterile water, or sodium bicarbonate. A wide range of treatments can also be used, including low-level laser therapy, also known as soft laser therapy, pain management, and morphine mouthwash, but the first line of therapy should include topical corticosteroids. The SWISH trial demonstrated the efficacy of topical corticosteroids in post-menopausal women treated with everolimus and exemestane who prophylactically used dexamethasone-based mouthwash starting on the first day of treatment. After 8 weeks, the incidence of grade ≥ 2 stomatitis was only 2% compared with 33% in the historical BOLERO-2 (Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus-2) study (p < 0.0001), with no grade 3 toxicity.

Oral ulcers are commonly found in JSLE patients, and the typical lesion is a painless palatal erythematous ulcer at masticatory or keratinized mucosa, especially the hard palate. However, most ulcers including oral DLE and aphthous ulcers in JSLE patients appear at the lining tissue of the oral cavity (e.g. buccal mucosa, soft palate and tongue) and sometimes are unnoticed. Therefore, understanding of their clinical features and locations is very important. Clinical evaluation and follow-up is normally sufficient for making a diagnosis; however, lesional biopsy is needed particularly when other diseases (such as OLP or OLCL) cannot be ruled out. Topical corticosteroids remain the first-line treatment of oral ulcers, but the steroid-sparing agents (calcineurin inhibitors) can also be used in JSLE patients.

Oral mucositis/stomatitis

Previous relevant literature used general terms including "oral mucositis" or "oral stomatitis" to define oral mucosal irAEs. These terms refer to non-specific erosion and ulceration of the oral mucosa. It may manifest on a broad spectrum, from localized erythema to extensive ulceration. In this CPS, the presence of clinical non-specific oral erosion and ulceration, without typical white striae, or without a specific microscopic appearance, will be considered a distinct oral irAE entity rather than an OLP/OLR. Of note, with the resolution of the ulcers, a milder form of OLP/OLR may be revealed, which may re-define the diagnosis as OLP/OLR. Therefore, the characteristics of this entity may change as the literature focuses on its specific aspects.
The treatment aims to alleviate the symptoms and signs, primarily by accelerating the healing of mucosal erosion or ulceration and reducing its severity.
Unlike chemotherapy/radiotherapy-associated mucositis, the mainstay of treatment for immunotherapy-associated oral mucositis is topical steroids (Table 2). The selection of agent and its texture depends on the distribution of the lesions and the ease of applicability to the patient. If the symptoms are severe and oral intake is affected, systemic steroids may be required.
In patients with more extreme cases, the immunotherapy dose may need to be adjusted, temporarily withheld, or permanently discontinued.
For immunotherapy-induced non-specific oral mucositis, nonopioid topical agents are preferred for pain relief (Table 2). A second line of therapy may be topical morphine rinse (Table 2). Other topical analgesic agents may be used at the clinician's discretion if proved effective. Importantly, the efficacy of these agents has been confirmed through extensive research and clinical experience with managing oral ulcerative diseases and was not a subject of research on oral irAEs. If severe pain impairs oral intake, systemic pain medications may be administered according to the World Health Organization analgesic ladder. Non-pharmacologic pain management options may be considered (Box 1). Box 1 Non-pharmacologic treatment modalities for pain management that may be applied to oral immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated pain This list is based on evidence of pain management in other ulcerative oral lesions or in general pain conditions; evidence for their efficacy in irAEs is not present in the literature
The patient should be informed about the projection of this oral irAE and the expectations from the treatment, which is supportive rather than curative. The patient's understanding that oral irAEs will continue while receiving immunotherapy or even after discontinuing it is important for setting the correct expectations from the treatment.
Practicing good oral hygiene is important to reduce microbial load, reduce inflammation of gingiva, and prevent secondary infection.

### New-onset oral lichen planus and granulomatous cheilitis in a 66-year-old woman [^117CuVM4]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

OLP is an inflammatory condition, ranging from asymptomatic lesions to severe, painful ulcers. OLP usually presents in middle age with slight female predominance and can affect the buccal mucosa, gingiva, tongue, and vermillion border of the lip. Idiopathic OLP is believed to be a T- cell–mediated response toward an unknown antigen and may represent an autoimmune reaction. Spontaneous remission is rare, and therapy is directed toward dampening the inflammatory response using corticosteroids or immune modulators. Patients may be refractory to treatment, and although reduction in symptoms can be achieved, no definitive cure has been identified. OLP carries a significant risk for transformation into squamous cell carcinoma, requiring surveillance for malignant changes. On examination, classic OLP is often indistinguishable from oral lichenoid tissue reactions (OLTR), highlighting the importance of thorough history taking. OLTR may be caused by systemic drug effects, localized contact reactions, or graft-versus-host disease. Adding to the diagnostic challenge, idiopathic OLP and OLTR have an identical histologic appearance that includes liquefactive changes of the basal keratinocytes with a bandlike array of activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Histology isn't the diagnostic gold standard for OLP, and many infectious and immune-mediated diseases can induce oral lichenoid changes that mimic OLP. Oral lichenoid contact reactions (OLCR) likely represent a delayed hypersensitivity reaction and removal of the allergen can lead to complete resolution. Given the similarities, oral lichenoid contact reactions can be misdiagnosed as OLP, leading to improper disease management. This patient presented with a rare and unique set of findings. The simultaneous onset of OLP and GC in an otherwise healthy woman may very well indicate a common immunologic or inflammatory etiology for 2 uncommon diseases of the oral cavity.

Several dermatological conditions may manifest in the oral cavity, particularly those that are immune-mediated, and they must be distinguished from the various other types of oral ulcerations. This chapter discusses the clinical features, pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic features, including histology and immunofluorescence findings, as well as management of vesiculobullous diseases. These diseases include pemphigus Vulgaris, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. These diseases have a significant impact on the quality of life, as they can lead to serious complications, depending on the extent of the disease. Therefore, early recognition is crucial, helping to reduce disease-related morbidity, mortality and prevent life-threatening complications.

Main Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of erosive oral lesions include infectious agents, due to viruses and bacteria, drug-induced reactions, inflammatory conditions, and systemic diseases (Table 1). These conditions have some specific morphological features and overlapping clinical features, therefore histology is required for the diagnosis.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of oral blisters, ulcers, gingivitis, and stomatitis

SJS/TEN Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis

Oral lesions caused by infectious agents are usually transient. Primary infection with herpes simplex is the most common viral cause of erosions and blisters in the oral mucosa. Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe, mostly drug-induced reactions with an abrupt onset of erosive stomatitis and hemorrhagic cheilitis followed by widespread skin lesions (Fig. 1 j–l). The gingiva is rarely affected in Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Other mucosal involvement is frequently seen, such as ocular and genital involvement.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is the most frequent inflammatory condition of the oral mucosa with recurrent self-limiting ulcers affecting non keratinized mucosa. Multiple factors are involved in the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Behçet syndrome is a chronic multi-system condition characterized by diffuse aphthous erosions and ulcers on the labial, buccal, and lateral tongue mucosa. Ocular and genital involvement is also frequently seen.

Lupus erythematosus is a systemic autoimmune disorder with a wide variety of clinical features. Oral lesions in lupus erythematosus are usually multiple, located on the buccal mucosa, hard palate, lips, and gingiva. The distribution is asymmetrical with different morphological features ranging from plaques, erythema, and ulcerations.

Oral lichen planus is a chronic immune mediated disease with highly variable clinical features ranging from subtle white reticular patterns to erosions and ulcerations (Fig. 1 m–o). Lesions are usually symmetrically distributed in the oral cavity. Affected sites of the oral cavity include the buccal mucosa, tongue, and gingiva. Histopathologic biopsies of oral lichen planus often show sub-epithelial blistering without preservation of the basal cells, in contrast to pemphigoid.

### Disseminated histoplasmosis presenting as multiple oral ulcers [^111soy13]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 61-year-old female with a history of advanced HIV disease and chronic hepatitis B was presented with an 8-week history of painful oral ulcers. She appeared systemically well but examination revealed multiple well-demarcated clean-based ulcers on the tongue and hard palate. Biopsy of one of the lesions showed numerous histiocytes containing intracellular yeast forms consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum Fungal blood cultures subsequently grew H. capsulatum var. capsulatum, confirming a diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis. She was treated with intravenous amphotericin B for 2 weeks followed by a prolonged course of oral itraconazole, with which her ulcers resolved completely and have not recurred. This case exemplifies how oral ulcers may be a manifestation of an underlying systemic disease and demonstrates the utility of biopsy in establishing a diagnosis.

B. A 64-year-old woman from Malaysia
C. A 23-year-old woman from Germany
D. A 36-year-old man from the United States
E. A 25-year old man from China

Answers:
A. A 57-year-old man from Peru – Correct. ENKTL predominantly affects middle-aged men in the fifth and sixth decades, and age is a vital prognostic factor, with patients older than 60 years tending to have poorer prognosis. Cases are rare in the United States and Europe and are more commonly seen in Asia and in the South and Central Americas.
B. A 64-year-old woman from Malaysia – Incorrect. Although the patient is from Asia and fits the age demographic, she is a woman. A male patient of a similar age would be more likely.
C. A 23-year-old woman from Germany – Incorrect. This patient is from Europe, where cases of ENKTL are rare. Moreover, the patient is a woman, and her age is much lesser than the typical age at which patients present with ENKTL.
D. A 36-year-old man from the United States – Incorrect. Although a male, this patient is from the United States, where cases of ENKTL are rare. Moreover, his age is much lesser than the typical age at which patients present with ENKTL.
E. A 25-year-old man from China – Incorrect. Although a male and from Asia, this patient is not the best answer choice, given the observed typical demographic profile of patients with ENKTL.

### Exuberant oral lesions in an immunocompromised patient [^114Voo3g]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Squamous papilloma — Incorrect. Benign epithelial proliferating lesions. Usually pedunculated, colors range from white to pink/red and generally presenting as a solitary lesion, which are different from those in this case.
B. Condyloma accuminatum — Correct. Condyloma accuminatum in the oral cavity is a rare disease, it is sexually transmitted, and is most common in adults. It presents as pedunculated, sessile, solitary, or multiple lesions, and these can coalesce. It is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18. Histopathology shows an exophytic papillary architecture with a broad and evident base, parakeratosis, and acanthosis with robust rete ridges. Koilocytes may be observed in the upper spinous layer, and there is a chronic subepithelial inflammatory infiltrate and dilated capillaries in the lamina propria.
C. Heck disease — Incorrect. Rare and benign disease. Especially in children, it is characterized by flat, numerous, and extensive lesions, affecting the lips, tongue, and oral mucosa. The lesions tend to clear spontaneously. The HPV subtypes most commonly detected in Heck disease are 13 and 32.
D. White sponge nevus — Incorrect. Rare genodermatosis caused by mutations in the keratin 4 or 13 gene. Presenting in childhood as white, asymptomatic, diffuse, and bilateral plaques observed in the oral mucosa and tongue.
E. Common wart (verruca vulgaris) — Incorrect. Most common skin infection caused by HPV, occurring most often on fingers or hands. Intraoral manifestation is uncommon. Clinically, mucosal lesions are exophytic, typically solitary, white-to-rose/pink in color, sessile, and less than 1 cm in size.

### A patient with painful oral ulcers [^113BSJ6K]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 50-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with pale painful tongue ulcers and constitutional symptoms for 2 months. Her current medication included prednisolone 5 milligrams per day and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1 to 1.5 grams per day for 2 years. Examination revealed multiple painful ulcers at tip of tongue, lower lip, and painful ulcer deep to muscular layer at dorsal aspect of tongue (Figs 1 and 2). There was no regional lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Serology for HIV is negative. Histopathological, Grocott-Gomori's Methenamine Silver, and Periodic acid-Schiff stain results are shown in Fig 3, A - C.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Oral ulcer in systemic lupus erythematosus
B. Herpes simplex virus
C. Histoplasmosis
D. Giant cell arteritis
E. MMF – induced oral ulcer

Answers:
A. Oral ulcers in systemic lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Oral ulcers in systemic lupus erythematous typically present as nonpainful, nonspecific ulcers at palate, buccal mucosa, and fissure at tongue. The histopathological features show vacuolar interface dermatitis with deep, periadnexal, and perivascular infiltration.
B. Herpes simplex virus – Incorrect. The herpes simplex virus lesions typically present as scallop border ulcerations at keratinized mucosa and chronic, enlarging ulcerations involving nonkeratinized mucosa in immunocompromised setting. The histologic findingsare ballooning cells, multinucleated giant cells, and herpetic cytopathic effect including gray margination of the chromatin at the nuclear edge.
C. Histoplasmosis – Correct. Primary oral histoplasmosis is rare. The common oral areas are tongue, palate, buccal mucosa, and gingiva. Hematoxylin and eosin staining reveals 2 to 4 μm budding yeast organisms surrounded by clear space within the cytoplasm of macrophages. The organisms will be highlighted in Grocott-Gomori's Methenamine Silver and Periodic acid-Schiff staining.
D. Giant cell arteritis – Incorrect. Tongue necrosis is an atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis. However, the classic manifestations of giant cell arteritis are headache, jaw claudication, and visual loss. Temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis.
E. MMF – induced oral ulcer – Incorrect. Common presentations are major and minor aphthous ulcers. Histological analyses are nonspecific. The lesions will heal after MMF cessation for weeks.

### Features of oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal lesions in bullous pemphigoid [^116ozD2H]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune bullous disease characterized by skin lesions, with or without oral lesions. The occurrence of pharyngolaryngeal lesions is very rare in affected patients. We conducted a study to investigate the characteristics of oral and pharyngolaryngeal lesions in bullous pemphigoid. Our study population was made up of 6 consecutively presenting outpatients-2 men and 4 women, aged 40 to 83 years (mean: 68.2)-who had been referred to our department over an 11-year period. Presenting symptoms included sore throat in all 6 patients and oral pain in 3. The sites of mucosal lesions included the soft palate, epiglottis, gingiva, hypopharynx, tongue, nasal cavity, and buccal mucosa. These lesions appeared as erosions, erosions with white coating, erythematous patches, and/or blisters. Mucosal lesions preceded skin lesions in 2 patients, appeared after skin lesions in 1 patient, and appeared simultaneously with skin lesions in 3 patients. We conclude that bullous pemphigoid sometimes involves the mucosa, such as that of the laryngopharynx and the oral cavity, and it can manifest as skin lesions. In the differential diagnosis of refractory pharyngolaryngeal lesions, bullous pemphigoid should be considered.

Oral lesions in children encompass a wide range of etiologies, including idiopathic entities as well as those related to an underlying systemic illness. In addition, oral masses include benign entities harboring locally destructive behavior and even malignancies in rare cases. Thorough patient history and detailed and efficient physical examination are critical for determining which lesions can be closely observed versus those require further diagnostic work-up. Understanding normal oral cavity anatomy is crucial for performing appropriate evaluation. This review describes the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for oral cavity lesions and reviews the broad differential diagnosis of oral cavity masses.

### Palatal ulceration [^111WgaAV]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Palatal ulcers are a common presentation and can be conveniently divided into developmental and acquired causes, the latter of which is subdivided into acute and chronic causes. Most commonly seen dermatologic causes have associated skin manifestations. Acute and multiple ulcers are usually infectious or drug induced in origin. Recurrent ulcers are largely dominated by aphthosis, while chronic ulcers are seen in immunocompromised patients and can occasionally be malignant. It is essential to involve the oral and maxillofacial surgeons early in the therapeutic management to tackle the inevitable complications that may ensue in the chronic cases.

Squamous cell carcinoma makes up 90% of cases of oral cancer. However, a myriad of premalignant, inflammatory, and immune-based conditions can manifest as oral mucosal lesions. Biopsy of these lesions shares many of the principles of cutaneous lesions. Biopsy of oral mucosal lesions is a procedure that is safely performed in most cases in the outpatient ambulatory setting using local anesthesia. Special considerations should be taken depending on the presumed diagnosis based on physical examination. Its clinical relevance depends on a sound clinicopathologic assessment of the patient's condition. This article reviews specific considerations for biopsy of oral mucosal lesions.

### Treatment of oral lichen planus using deucravacitinib [^115uhZE9]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case study

A 52-year-old Caucasian woman presented with an approximately 12-year history of irregular, tender, maxillary, mandibular, and buccal mucosal lesions associated with dysphagia and sensitivity to acidic foods (Figs 1, A; 2, A; and 3, A). Treatment before presentation included topical steroids, steroid rinses, oral prednisone, and topical tacrolimus, with no relief. During the course of her disease, the patient underwent multiple biopsies of the buccal mucosa, which initially revealed atypical epithelial cells suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma, treated with carbon dioxide (CO 2) resurfacing. Despite these therapies, the patient continued to experience worsening symptoms. Diagnosis of OLP was then confirmed using a repeat biopsy of the lesional buccal mucosa.

### The association between minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), children's poor oral condition, and underlying negative psychosocial habits and attitudes towards oral hygiene [^1148ZadS]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Minor Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (minor RAS) represents a disease which is very difficult to prevent. It is a painful oral mucosal condition characterized by recurrent, multiple, small, round ulcers, surrounded by erythematous haloes, with a necrotic base.

A minor RAS episode is characterized by a group of 2–5 ulcers with a size of less than 1 cm in diameter. In a period of about 4–14 days the lesions disappear, and there aren't scars.

The scientific literature does not clarify the etiology of minor RAS, but it seems to be related to multifactorial causes, such as allergy, trauma, genetic predisposition, endocrine disorders, stress and anxiety, and microbiota in the mouth. Minor RAS episodes are often treated with drugs, topical and systemic, that are considered palliative. This treatment is mainly aimed to decrease inflammation and pain.

With respect to the psychosocial side of the issue, there is mounting empirical evidence showing that studies and considerations about oral health status, origins and consequences cannot be limited — any longer — only to clinical issues. Both actual and perceived oral health conditions do in fact heavily affect young patients' quality of life, especially in the form of social acceptance by peers. Outcomes of this kind become especially significant when one considers that research has repeatedly shown that parents tend to underestimate the influence of poor oral conditions on their children's emotional and social quality of life. This happens while oral health and dento-facial appearance actually play, instead, a pivotal role in contributing to children's self-esteem and proper social functioning — a finding established long time ago in social psychology and clearly relating to social acceptance, also known as the 'what is beautiful is good' stereotype. Children's self-confidence and smooth social functioning depend heavily on healthy (facial) appearance. Monitoring children's behavioral attitudes, habits and practices of (home) oral hygiene becomes, thus, of paramount importance, especially because young patients' attitudes, habits and (good/bad) practices of oral hygiene may all critically affect their actual oral status and, in turn, prompt or hinder the manifestation of precarious oral conditions, such as — for instance — those leading to unwanted episodes of minor RAS.

### Menstruation… [^116CKbeD]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Bleeding typically lasts two to seven days. Periods stop during pregnancy and typically do not resume during the initial months of breastfeeding. Lochia occurs after childbirth. Menstruation, and with it the possibility of pregnancy, ceases after menopause, which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. During their menstrual period, 38% of all women reported not to be able to perform all their regular daily activities. Symptoms in advance of menstruation that do interfere with normal life are called premenstrual syndrome. Some 20 to 30% of women experience PMS, with 3 to 8% experiencing severe symptoms. These include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability, and mood changes. Other symptoms some women experience include painful periods and heavy bleeding during menstruation and abnormal bleeding at any time during the menstrual cycle.

A lack of periods, known as amenorrhea, is when periods do not occur by age 15 or have not re-occurred in ninety days. The amount of iron lost in menstrual fluid is relatively small for most women. In one study, premenopausal women who exhibited symptoms of iron deficiency were given endoscopies. 86% of them actually had gastrointestinal disease and were at risk of being misdiagnosed simply because they were menstruating. Heavy menstrual bleeding, occurring monthly, can result in anemia. Debilitating period pain is not normal and can be a sign of something severe such as endometriosis. These issues can significantly affect a woman's health and quality of life and timely interventions can improve the lives of these women. Moods and premenstrual syndrome Premenstrual syndrome is a disruptive set of emotional and physical symptoms that regularly occur in the one to two weeks before the start of each menstrual period.

Symptoms resolve around the time menstrual bleeding begins. Symptoms vary, though commonly include one or more physical, emotional, or behavioral symptoms, that resolve with menses. The range of symptoms is wide, and most commonly are breast tenderness, bloating, headache, mood swings, depression, anxiety, anger, and irritability. To be diagnosed as PMS, rather than a normal discomfort of the menstrual cycle, these symptoms must interfere with daily living, during two menstrual cycles of prospective recording. PMS-related symptoms are often present for about six days. An individual's pattern of symptoms may change over time. PMS does not produce symptoms during pregnancy or following menopause. Diagnosis requires a consistent pattern of emotional and physical symptoms occurring after ovulation and before menstruation to a degree that interferes with normal life. Emotional symptoms must not be present during the initial part of the menstrual cycle.

A daily list of symptoms over a few months may help in diagnosis. Other disorders that cause similar symptoms need to be excluded before a diagnosis is made. The cause of PMS is unknown, but the underlying mechanism is believed to involve changes in hormone levels during the course of the whole menstrual cycle. Reducing salt, alcohol, caffeine, and stress, along with increasing exercise is typically all that is recommended for the management of mild symptoms. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be useful in some. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen may help with physical symptoms. In those with more significant symptoms, birth control pills or the diuretic spironolactone may be useful. Over 90% of women report having some premenstrual symptoms, such as bloating, headaches, and moodiness. Premenstrual symptoms generally do not cause substantial disruption, and only qualify as PMS in approximately 20% of pre-menopausal women.

Specifically, there have been more than 20 different strains of HPV implicated in EV. Some strains of HPV, namely HPV-5, -8, and -14, are associated with higher oncogenic potential of nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with EV. Skin lesions are thought to develop as a result of the cumulative cocarcinogenic effects of genetics, HPV, and ultraviolet radiation. Malignancy is usually observed approximately 20–30 years after the formation of benign lesions. The patient in this case was investigated for low-risk (6, 11, 40, 43, 44, 54, 69, 70, 71, E6/E7) and high-risk (16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 83, E6/E7) HPV strains using an in-situ hybridization assay. The results of these investigations were negative, and the patient was most likely infected with an alternative HPV strain that has been associated with EV.
B. Coxsackievirus – Incorrect. Coxsackieviruses are associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease. Typical cutaneous lesions include red vesicular macules, papules, and blisters on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the hands, and ulcerative oral lesions.
C. Poxviridae – Incorrect. Poxviridae are associated with molluscum contagiosum (ie, molluscum contagiosum virus). Typical cutaneous lesions include clusters of indurated, red, umbilicated papules that present in moist areas such as the intertriginous regions.
D. Herpes viruses – Incorrect. Herpes viruses are implicated in several diseases of the skin, including herpes zoster (shingles), and herpes simplex infection for example. Herpes zoster presents with typical vesicular cutaneous lesions confined to a dermatomal distribution. Non-genital herpes simplex infection typically presents with grouped vesicular and eroded cutaneous lesions around the mouth and face, as well as the anogenital region.
E. Polyomaviridae – Incorrect. Polyomaviridae have been associated with diseases of the skin, including Merkel cell carcinomas and trichodysplasia spinulosa. Merkel cell carcinoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging, red, solitary nodule, typically on the head and neck. Trichodysplasia spinulosa presents with skin-colored follicular papules with a central keratin spine, typically on the nose and forehead.
