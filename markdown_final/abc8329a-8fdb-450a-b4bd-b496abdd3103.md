## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the differential diagnosis of a 35-year-old woman with acute painful periungual swelling of the right middle finger, green discoloration, and purulent drainage after prolonged wet cleaning and chemical exposure, and to outline the differential, pathophysiology, diagnostics, and treatment plan step-by-step. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which findings are pathognomonic and how the green discoloration directs the diagnosis. Then, I should verify if the soft-tissue findings signify acute paronychia and whether abscess is present. Next, I will build a tiered differential and actively exclude mimics like herpetic whitlow and felon. After that, I need to check how prolonged wet work and irritants biologically predispose to this presentation. Finally, I will confirm evidence-based diagnostics and management, including when to drain, when to culture, when to use anti-pseudomonal therapy, how to address coinfections, and what preventive strategies to recommend.

> Let me first confirm the clinical clue that anchors the diagnosis. The greenish periungual discoloration is classic for green nail syndrome, or chloronychia, driven by Pseudomonas aeruginosa pigments pyoverdine and pyocyanin, with a strong association to moist environments, onycholysis, and irritant exposures, which fits her recent wet work and chemicals exposure precisely [^1134eVpc] [^115pqtGw].

> Wait, I should verify the soft-tissue component. The acute pain, tenderness at the nail fold, and expression of yellow purulence with pressure indicate acute bacterial paronychia complicating the GNS, which is common when the periungual barrier breaks and mixed flora invade the nail folds, while Pseudomonas persists on the nail plate surface or within onycholytic spaces [^11371u7S] [^1134eVpc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need a structured differential and to state why competing diagnoses are less likely. Initially, I briefly considered onychomycosis alone because of nail discoloration, but that would not explain acute purulence and pain, so that initial thought is insufficient here. Herpetic whitlow would present with grouped vesicles and severe neuropathic pain and is a contraindication to incision and drainage; the lack of vesicles and the presence of frank pus argue against it in this case [^1128Qzqw]. A felon would localize to the volar pulp rather than the nail fold; Kanavel signs would raise concern for flexor tenosynovitis, which is not described here; chronic neoplasms such as SCC of the nail unit or subungual melanoma would follow a more indolent, nonpurulent course and not abruptly appear after wet work [^114QvE1R] [^113Qj9y3] [^112gn25E].

> I will now examine how her cleaning weekend mechanistically led to this. Repeated immersion and detergents macerate the periungual barrier and disrupt the cuticle, while microtrauma from tools provides inoculation portals; Pseudomonas thrives in wet environments and colonizes onycholytic nail spaces, with secondary invasion of typical skin flora into the paronychial soft tissues producing abscess and purulence [^1134eVpc] [^11371u7S].

> Next, I should review what testing meaningfully informs management. I need to check for fluctuance or pointing that would compel incision and drainage; point-of-care ultrasound can confirm a drainable collection and guide the safest approach if depth or anatomy is uncertain [^112yiKox] [^116aPfHA]. I should confirm that routine cultures are not recommended for uncomplicated superficial hand infections because they rarely change outpatient management; moreover, GNS cultures can be falsely negative for Pseudomonas in a substantial proportion, so a negative culture does not exclude clinical GNS [^111XyN8H] [^115s6FgF].

> Let me think about first-line local management. For the GNS component, dilute sodium hypochlorite (Dakin solution) or similar antiseptic soaks, nail plate trimming, keeping the nail unit dry, and topical anti-pseudomonal agents are reasonable initial measures; if topical and local care fail, oral fluoroquinolone therapy such as ciprofloxacin has evidence in case series for GNS, though I need to ensure there is an appropriate indication before systemic therapy [^111Gwbop] [^113uG7DE] [^116GXbA7]. For the acute paronychia with abscess, I should confirm whether there is fluctuation; if present, incision and drainage is the primary therapy, with care not to extend incisions past the distal interphalangeal joint, followed by warm soaks and local wound care [^114QvE1R] [^114AQV9v].

> I should double-check antibiotic decisions. If an abscess is adequately drained and there is no spreading cellulitis or systemic risk, oral antibiotics are often unnecessary for acute paronychia; topical antibiotics plus a topical corticosteroid can shorten symptom duration when used for non-fluctuant early paronychia or post-drainage inflammation [^1113yMQi] [^1128NtSx]. But wait, what if there is significant surrounding cellulitis, immunocompromise, or treatment failure? In that scenario, I would consider systemic antibiotics tailored to likely organisms; for refractory GNS, oral ciprofloxacin targeting Pseudomonas has supportive evidence in case reports, while for general uncomplicated skin abscesses after I&D, there is a weak recommendation to add TMP-SMX or clindamycin to improve short-term cure, which should be weighed with shared decision-making [^111Gwbop] [^113uG7DE] [^1128NtSx].

> Let me reconsider possible coinfection and how it changes management. GNS frequently coexists with fungal onychomycosis, and coinfection rates above 60% have been reported; if the nail changes persist despite appropriate anti-pseudomonal measures or if there are classic features of onychomycosis, I should perform KOH or culture and then treat confirmed dermatophyte disease with guideline-based antifungals, while remembering that antifungals are not used to treat paronychia itself [^115s6FgF] [^114oMws9] [^1147QjSw] [^113FqpoU].

> I need to ensure I do not create harm by misclassifying mimics. Herpetic whitlow must be excluded whenever vesicles or a history consistent with HSV is present because I&D is contraindicated and may provoke complications; in such cases, PCR can confirm HSV and antivirals are used instead of drainage [^1128Qzqw]. If pulp tenderness and tense swelling dominate, I should rethink whether this is a felon and use an appropriate longitudinal or lateral approach if drainage is required, again avoiding incision beyond the DIP joint [^114QvE1R].

> Next, I should review prevention and follow-up. Keeping hands and nails dry, avoiding prolonged wet work and irritants, using protective gloves, minimizing trauma to the cuticle, and trimming onycholytic nail edges reduce recurrence risk; counseling on these measures is essential given Pseudomonas' preference for moist environments and the role of irritants in chronic periungual inflammation [^1134eVpc] [^11371u7S].

> Final synthesis and plan: The most likely diagnosis is green nail syndrome due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa with secondary acute bacterial paronychia of the right middle finger, precipitated by prolonged wet cleaning with chemical exposure; I will assess for fluctuance and drain if present, avoid routine cultures unless atypical or refractory, use local antiseptic soaks and topical therapy for GNS, reserve systemic antibiotics for cellulitis or failure of local measures, consider ciprofloxacin if refractory pseudomonal GNS, screen for fungal coinfection if nonresponsive, and provide prevention counseling to limit moisture and irritants, while keeping mimics like herpetic whitlow and felon in mind to avoid harmful procedures [^1134eVpc] [^113FqpoU] [^111XyN8H] [^114QvE1R] [^111Gwbop] [^113uG7DE] [^115s6FgF] [^1128Qzqw].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **acute paronychia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa** [^1134eVpc] (green nail syndrome) [^115pqtGw] due to recent water/cleaning exposure and green discoloration with purulent drainage [^11371u7S]. Other considerations include **Staphylococcus aureus paronychia** [^11371u7S], herpetic whitlow [^1128Qzqw], felon [^114QvE1R], onychomycosis [^1122j2LR], and rare entities like subungual melanoma [^112gn25E] or squamous cell carcinoma [^113Qj9y3]. Management is incision and drainage [^114AQV9v] [^11371u7S] with topical or oral antibiotics [^114nXAy1]; avoid antifungals unless fungal infection is confirmed [^113FqpoU].

## Infectious etiologies

### Bacterial infections

- **Acute bacterial paronychia**: Most common; typically Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species [^11371u7S]; recent water exposure and green discoloration suggest Pseudomonas aeruginosa (green nail syndrome) [^1134eVpc] [^115s6FgF].

- **Felon**: Pulp-space abscess [^114kxL9v]; usually Staphylococcus aureus; presents with severe fingertip pain, swelling, and erythema [^114QvE1R].

- **Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis**: Infection of the flexor tendon sheath; characterized by Kanavel's signs (fusiform swelling, pain on passive extension, tenderness along the sheath, and flexed posture) [^115az3qh].

---

### Fungal infections

**Onychomycosis** [^1122j2LR] is a fungal infection of the nail plate that typically presents with nail thickening, discoloration, and subungual debris; it is less likely to cause acute pain and purulent discharge.

---

### Viral infections

**Herpetic whitlow** [^1128Qzqw] is an HSV infection of the finger presenting with vesicular lesions, pain, and swelling; it typically contains clear fluid rather than purulent discharge.

---

## Non-infectious etiologies

**Traumatic injury** from recent cleaning and moving may have caused minor trauma leading to secondary bacterial infection [^11371u7S], whereas **inflammatory conditions** are less likely given the acute presentation and purulent discharge.

---

## Rare but serious conditions

**Subungual melanoma** is a rare malignancy presenting with pigmented nail lesions and a typically chronic course not associated with acute pain or purulent discharge [^112gn25E], whereas **squamous cell carcinoma** is a rare malignancy of the nail unit with a chronic presentation featuring nail dystrophy and mass formation [^113Qj9y3].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **Clinical examination**: Assess for erythema, swelling, fluctuance, and Kanavel's signs [^117Fh9Au].

- **Ultrasound**: Consider to differentiate abscess from cellulitis or deeper infections [^116aPfHA] [^112yiKox].

- **Culture**: Obtain purulent discharge culture if atypical presentation or treatment failure [^111XyN8H].

---

## Management

**Incision and drainage** [^114AQV9v] is the primary treatment for abscess formation [^11371u7S]. **Antibiotics** may be topical or oral, targeting Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; avoid antifungals unless fungal infection is confirmed [^113FqpoU].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **acute bacterial paronychia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (green nail syndrome)** [^1134eVpc], given the green discoloration, purulent discharge, and recent water exposure [^11371u7S]. Other considerations include Staphylococcus aureus paronychia, herpetic whitlow [^1128Qzqw], felon [^114QvE1R], and onychomycosis [^1122j2LR]. Management includes **incision and drainage** [^114AQV9v], antibiotics, and ultrasound if needed [^112yiKox].

## References

### Chloronychia caused by infection [^1134eVpc]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Green nail syndrome is caused by an infection of the nails that leads to greenish discoloration of the nail plate with onycholysis. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, an aerobic gram-negative bacillus, is a common causative pathogen, and its pigments, pyoverdine and pyocyanin, produce the characteristic greenish hue in the nails. *P. aeruginosa* preferentially colonizes in moist environments. Thus, affected patients usually have a history of prolonged exposure to water. Other predisposing factors include onycholysis, onychotillomania, microtrauma to the nail fold, chronic paronychia, long-term exposure to soaps or detergents, and associated nail disorders, such as psoriasis.

*Pseudomonas oryzihabitans* is a yellow-pigmented, gram-negative bacillus that can trigger sepsis, endophthalmitis, peritonitis, and bacteremia. It is an opportunistic pathogen, and thus individuals with major illnesses, including those undergoing surgery or with catheters, are vulnerable. At the time of writing, skin and soft tissue infections by *P. oryzihabitans* have been reported in the literature; however, nail infections have not been reported, to our knowledge. In the present case, the nail infection by *P. oryzihabitans* manifested as a yellowish-green discoloration, clinically consistent with green nail syndrome. However, unlike the dark green discoloration typically observed in green nail syndrome caused by *P. aeruginosa* infection, the patient's nail exhibited a light yellow-green hue, consistent with the yellow pigment production by *P. oryzihabitans*. Therefore, careful observation of the hue in discolored nails may aid in differentiating causative pathogens.

### "Hitting the nail on the head" [^112gn25E]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Subungual malignant melanoma is a rare form of malignancy that can present at an advanced stage. We describe a case that was diagnosed following a presentation to the emergency department for a traumatic injury of the affected area. Initial presentations of malignant disease and its complications form a relatively low proportion of the caseload of emergency doctors. In this case, a patient presented following a minor injury that had failed to recover; subsequent investigation of this injury led to the diagnosis of subungual malignant melanoma in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. This is a rare case which presented in an atypical fashion, with a confounding history of minor trauma. It is presented to highlight the differential diagnosis of destructive bone lesions.

### Rapidly enlarging growth of the proximal nail fold [^113Qj9y3]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nail unit is a rare but often underappreciated neoplasm. Treatment can be delayed due to confusion with paronychia and verruca. Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been associated with this malignancy.

- **Objective**: To describe the development of a superficially invasive SCC of the proximal nail fold in a patient infected with HIV, to report the association of a previously unrecognized HPV genotype, and to review key etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic points related to SCC of the proximal nail fold.

- **Results**: This is the first report of HPV 26 coinfection in monogamous sexual partners, both of whom are HIV-infected and have demonstrated lesions of malignant degeneration consistent with SCC.

- **Conclusion**: SCC must be considered in the differential diagnosis of nail fold neoplasm. An immunocompromised condition such as HIV/AIDS may predispose to malignant degeneration of lesions caused by infection with HPV.

### Management of finger felons and paronychia: A narrative review [^114QvE1R]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Finger felons and paronychias are common presentations to the emergency department with significant morbidity and long-term pain if not managed appropriately.

- **Objective**: This narrative review provides a focused summary of the management of finger felons and paronychias for emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: Finger felons consist of the accumulation of pus in the pulp space of the digit, which can lead to digital compartment syndrome if not adequately drained. Paronychias are an infection involving the proximal or lateral nail folds. Early felons and paronychias may be managed with antibiotics alone, whereas more advanced infections require incision and drainage. The preferred approaches for felon drainage are a longitudinal incision in the volar space if superficial or lateral space if deep, with careful attention not to extend past the distal interphalangeal joint space. Extension to a hockey stick or fish mouth incision may be indicated in select cases. For paronychia, a simple incision approach is preferred for simple paronychia with abscess, while single or double incision technique along the nail is preferred for more complex cases.

- **Conclusion**: It is essential for emergency physicians to be familiar with the management of finger felons and paronychias. We review the different approaches to management, with the goal of providing a resource for those interested in expanding their knowledge of felon and paronychia management.

### Case report: Palmar herpetic whitlow and forearm lymphangitis in a 10-year-old female [^1128Qzqw]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Here, we presented a case of a left palmar lesion caused by herpetic whitlow that was initially mistaken for a left palmar abscess caused by MSSA or MRSA. Classically, herpes infection of the hand in children is associated with finger sucking in asymptomatic salivary carriers. However, viral vesicles can involve any region of the hand. While reviewing her history, certain points hinted at this eventual diagnosis, including prodromal symptoms such as pain and itching in the affected area, a history of previous occurrence, palm sucking and biting, lack of leukocytosis, and lack of any significant or purulent drainage.

The palm sucking and biting behavior is unusual in a 10-year-old child, indicating that the patient may have had a behavioral disorder contributing to this habit. However, no documented evaluation was present in the patient's chart. Our diagnosis was confirmed by PCR, but our results were complicated by the fact that antibiotics were started at the outside hospital prior to the drawing of wound cultures.

Although the initial diagnosis was a bacterial abscess secondary to MSSA or MRSA, other causes of palmar lesions include herpetic whitlow (as in this case), cellulitis, coxsackieviruses, erythema multiforme, sporotrichosis, syphilis, rat bite fever, impetigo, or trauma. In cases of herpetic whitlow, incision and drainage are contraindicated due to the risk of viremia, secondary bacterial superinfection, and HSV encephalitis. While our patient did not experience any of these secondary complications, it is important to carefully consider treatment options.

The disease onychomycosis can be associated with a variety of factors and conditions:

- **Environmental and physical factors**: Prolonged exposure to wet environments, tight-fitting shoes, spores and hyphae on KOH wet mount

- **Medical conditions**: Chronic venous insufficiency, age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease (PAD), hyperhidrosis

- **Nail and skin abnormalities**: Brittle nails, nail pain, onycholysis, nail thickening, nail discoloration, subungual hyperkeratosis, yellow nail discoloration, onychodystrophy

- **Associated infections**: Athlete's foot, tinea manuum, tinea cruris, tinea capitis, tinea corporis, tinea pedis

- **Other conditions**: Psoriasis

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^11371u7S]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Paronychia is an inflammation of the folds of tissue surrounding the nail of a toe or finger. It may be classified as either acute or chronic.

- **Factors associated with acute paronychia**: The main factor is direct or indirect trauma to the cuticle or nail fold, enabling pathogens to inoculate the nail and resulting in infection.

- **Treatment options for acute paronychia**: These include warm compresses, topical antibiotics with or without corticosteroids, oral antibiotics, or surgical incision and drainage for more severe cases.

- **Chronic paronychia**: This is a multifactorial inflammatory reaction of the proximal nail fold to irritants and allergens. Patients should avoid exposure to contact irritants, and treatment of underlying inflammation and infection is recommended. This may involve using a combination of a broad-spectrum topical antifungal agent and a corticosteroid. The application of emollient lotions may also be beneficial.

- **Effectiveness of treatments for chronic paronychia**: Topical steroid creams are more effective than systemic antifungals. For recalcitrant chronic paronychia, en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold is an option. Alternatively, an eponychial marsupialization, with or without nail removal, may be performed.

### Infection and panniculitis [^112aawFB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Infection-induced panniculitis may result from several microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Viruses have also been implicated as a cause. This type of panniculitis can occur as a primary infection through the direct inoculation of infectious microorganisms into the subcutaneous tissue or secondarily via microbial hematogenous dissemination with subsequent infection of the subcutaneous tissue. Panniculitis is rarely viewed solely in terms of infectious causes. Additionally, subcutaneous infections are infrequently considered in terms of infection-induced panniculitis but rather as cutaneous infections with subcutaneous involvement.

Little information exists specifically on the subject of infection-induced panniculitis outside of case reports and case series. In this review, the present authors address panniculitis from the perspective of infectious causes, focusing on those microorganisms with reports of infection-induced panniculitis in the literature. Diagnosis and treatment are also discussed.

### Local and systemic nail plate abnormalities: A clinical review [^112pKEYW]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Nail disorders are often difficult to recognize and diagnose because of the subtlety of their presentation and their shared overlapping features that are common to several conditions. This challenge is compounded by the fact that specific training on the diagnosis of nail pathologies varies substantially across most residency programs and a majority of medical and surgical specialties. To distinguish these presentations from true, potentially deleterious nail disorders, clinicians should be familiar with the most commonly occurring nail pathologies and their associations, and use a systematic approach when examining or evaluating alterations in the nails. In the present study, we review the most common clinical disorders affecting the nail apparatus.

### Severe bacterial infections of the skin: Uncommon presentations [^116eCE3n]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Although most bacterial infections of the skin are minor in nature, a few dermatologic entities can be significant to the point of being fatal. Their progression can be extremely rapid and lead to dreadful complications. The mortality rate is usually between 30% to 50% and depends on the type of infection, underlying disease, and immune status. Patients suffering from these infections typically require hospitalization, sometimes in intensive care or burn units. They should be treated with systemic antimicrobial therapy along with aggressive supportive care.

The two life-threatening skin infections most commonly experienced are toxin-mediated staphylococcal and streptococcal disorders, which can overlap. Several other related entities will also be discussed.

### Flexor tenosynovitis of the hand caused by [^111Y1Dze]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

In recent years, questions about the optimal surgical and medical management of mycobacterial tenosynovitis have been raised. The definitive diagnosis and extent of the infection are often assessed intraoperatively, making the condition de facto a surgical issue, but the success of antibiotics alone has been documented in the literature. A series of 13 patients with tuberculosis of the hand found that all patients returned to full activity by an average of 4.8 months without surgical intervention. Antibiotic treatment in these patients, with or without surgery, typically includes quadruple antimicrobial drug therapy with isoniazid, ethambutol, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 3 to 4 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin only for an additional period of time, which was the case with our patient.

A recent review of the management of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis found similarly varied practices in treatment, ranging from surgery without antibiotics to antibiotics without surgery. This suggests that it may be time for the establishment of rigorous, evidence-based protocols for the management of mycobacterial tenosynovitis; however, this is extremely difficult because of the relative rarity of this condition. Our case highlights the importance of maintaining M. tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of a subacute presentation of flexor tenosynovitis or carpal tunnel syndrome of the hand, even in nonendemic areas and in the absence of past tuberculosis infection or exposure.

### Nail changes, lymphedema, and respiratory symptoms [^116QkQbv]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old man presented to our clinic with a 2.5-year history of progressive, painful yellow discoloration and deformation of his fingernails and toenails (Fig 1), accompanied by lower extremity lymphedema. The nail changes developed at the proximal nailfold and progressed distally. He concurrently had a history of recurrent sinusitis and a chronic cough. See Fig 2 for the chest computed tomography scan. Immunologic workup and nail fungal cultures were unrevealing. The patient was started on therapy, with complete resolution of nail signs and symptoms at 2 years (Fig 3).

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Chronic paronychia
	- B. Nail lichen planus
	- C. Nondermatophyte mold onychomycosis
	- D. Onychomadesis secondary to steal syndrome
	- E. Yellow nail syndrome (YNS)

- **Answers**:
	- A. Chronic paronychia – Incorrect. Chronic paronychia is a condition most likely caused by contact reaction to irritants and most commonly affects adult women. It is unlikely to affect all digits, as is the case in this patient.
	- B. Nail lichen planus – Incorrect. Nail lichen planus presents with a distinct set of clinical findings, which include nail thinning, longitudinal ridging and fissuring, and dorsal pterygium. None of these findings were present in this patient.
	- C. Nondermatophyte mold onychomycosis – Incorrect. Onychomycosis typically begins distally and spreads proximally, as opposed to this case in which nail symptoms began at the proximal nailfold. Proximal onychomycosis is uncommon and typically affects those with severely compromised immune systems.

### Subungual neuroma masquerading as green nail syndrome [^111Gwbop]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Traumatic neuromas are benign tumors of the peripheral sensory nerve tissue that develop secondary to injuries at sites such as the palmar aspect of the hand, upper and lower extremities, and the tongue. Their etiology may be explained by a disorganized repair of disunited nerve endings. Traumatic neuromas may also arise from chronic stimulation and friction. At the time of writing, only two cases of traumatic subungual neuromas have been reported. In both cases, subungual growth was suspected due to an obvious painful subungual nodule or band-like onychodystrophy. In our patient, the mass effect of the subungual neuroma led to chronic distal onycholysis, allowing for the development of persistent green nail syndrome and candidal onychomycosis.

Green nail syndrome, most commonly caused by P. aeruginosa, is a nail disease of infectious etiology that causes green chromonychia, onycholysis, and chronic paronychia. It is challenging to treat, and recommended therapeutic regimens vary. First-line treatment options consist of topical therapies, such as Dakin solution (0.5%-2% sodium hypochlorite) soaks, followed by two weeks of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic if these fail. Fungal and bacterial coinfections are common and may further complicate treatment. In a study by Ohn et al. in 2020, 65% of patients with green nail syndrome had fungal coinfection. In such cases, an extended course of antibiotics and antifungals has been used.

In cases of persistent green nail syndrome, a full spectrum of potential underlying causes of onycholysis should be considered. Examination of subungual lesions can be critical in diagnosis and managing the condition effectively.

### Chronic hand infections [^112UUVKH]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic infections of the hand are uncommon, requiring a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis. These infections can be grouped based on the microorganism involved.

- **Mycobacterial infections**: These include tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, and leprosy.
- **Other bacterial infections**: Examples include actinomycosis, cat-scratch disease, syphilis, tularemia, bacillary angiomatosis, and actinomycetoma.
- **Fungal infections**: These may be classified as cutaneous, which affect the skin, paronychia, or nail plate; subcutaneous, such as lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis and dermatiaceous infections; and deep fungal infections, each with a "classic" presentation.
- **Chronic viral infections**: Common examples affecting the hand include warts and orf.

### Clinical presentations of soft-tissue infections and surgical site infections [^112ya68j]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Skin and soft-tissue infections usually follow minor traumatic events or surgical procedures and are caused by a wide spectrum of bacteria. Less frequently, these infections occur spontaneously, which is often clinically confusing and leads to delays in diagnosis. Most infections are self-limited and easily treated with local measures and/or antibiotics. However, some are life-threatening and require prompt diagnosis and aggressive surgical debridement in addition to a wise choice of antibiotic agents to limit tissue loss and preserve life. Many survivors experience critical tissue losses that may require lifestyle changes as well as major reconstructive cosmetic surgery. The involvement of antibiotic-resistant gram-positive microorganisms in these infections increases the difficulty of their treatment and can significantly influence the ultimate outcome.

### Subungual neuroma masquerading as green nail syndrome [^113uG7DE]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 53-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of a green-colored right thumbnail. Examination was notable for a right thumbnail with onycholysis and dark green chloronychia of the distal nail (Fig 1). There was no history of preceding trauma or manipulation. The patient worked in the food service industry.

Previous treatment included oral fluconazole, oral terbinafine, oral ciprofloxacin for 1 week, vinegar soaks, topical gentamicin ointment, and topical efinaconazole solution without improvement. Bacterial culture of the fingernail revealed heavy growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fungal culture at this time was negative. The patient was started on oral ciprofloxacin with a plan for 5 weeks of treatment; however, she discontinued the medication prematurely due to concern for tendonitis after wrist surgery.

- **Dilute bleach soaks and doxycycline treatment**: The patient was subsequently treated with dilute bleach soaks of the fingernail biweekly and oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 2 months, with partial improvement. Fungal culture at this time showed moderate growth of Candida species, and fungal polymerase chain reaction detected Candida parapsilosis.

- **Itraconazole treatment**: Over the next 2 years, the patient was treated with several cycles of pulse itraconazole 200 mg twice daily for 1 week per month over 3 months, but had minimal improvement. Given the incomplete resolution of the green discoloration of the nail and persistent onycholysis, a punch biopsy of the distal nail bed was performed, including the most proximal lytic area of the nail bed. The distal half of the nail plate was avulsed for the biopsy.

### Case report: Palmar herpetic whitlow and forearm lymphangitis in a 10-year-old female [^114x78s3]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

After transfer to our institution, the patient was initially evaluated by orthopedic surgery, who described an erythematous, edematous, tender left palmar abscess with associated erythematous streaking up her forearm. There was no numbness, tingling, fever, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, with normal mental status. Her left upper extremity had full range of motion and appropriate strength, with no lymphadenopathy, and radial pulses were intact. Based upon these findings, no additional laboratory tests were performed.

X-rays of the left forearm and hand showed soft tissue edema with no acute osseous abnormalities. The lesion was surgically managed with an incision and drainage, during which "minimal drainage" was noted. Wound cultures were also obtained. After admission to the general pediatrics hospitalist service, the lesion was noted to appear vesicular from photos taken prior to surgical management. Thus, HSV infection was suspected and PCR samples were obtained from an unroofed left palmar vesicle. These samples confirmed the presence of HSV type 1, resulting in her diagnosis of herpetic whitlow.

The initial wound cultures had no growth after 5 days, further confirming that the palmar lesion was not due to a bacterial infection. However, the associated erythematous streaking up her forearm was identified as lymphangitis, indicating a possible bacterial infection secondary to HSV.

### Onychoheterotopia: Pathogenesis, presentation, and management of ectopic nail [^111VBTJK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Onychoheterotopia is an extremely rare condition in which the nail tissue grows outside the classic nail unit of the dorsal fingers and toes. It presents as either small outgrowths of a deviant nail or a complete double fingernail malformation. The histology of the onychoheterotopia matrix is often very similar to the normal nail matrix, although it plays a central role in diagnosis.

- **Objective**: We sought to review the literature on the clinical and histologic aspects of onychoheterotopia.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed to evaluate peer-reviewed articles on the topic.

- **Results**: Detailed reports have characterized many features of onychoheterotopia. The various etiology and treatment options are reviewed.

- **Limitations**: The study was limited to those articles in the English-language literature.

- **Conclusions**: In this article, we provide a review of the literature based on the understanding of onychoheterotopia, its diagnosis, and its management.

### Unilateral Beau's lines associated with a fingertip crushing injury [^113unGM6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Beau's lines are transverse depressions or ridgings of the nail surface that result from the temporary arrest of nail matrix formation. They can be caused by systemic diseases, local trauma, drugs, and infections. Generally, Beau's lines following a fingertip injury occur on only the affected finger, not on the unilateral extremity. In this report, we present the case of a 36-year-old man who developed transverse ridgings in the nail plates of all five fingers of the affected extremity following a fingertip (thumb) crushing injury. During follow-up, the growth rate of affected fingernails was normal. The transverse ridgings advanced with the linear growth of the nails and eventually disappeared. To the best of our knowledge, no association between unilateral Beau's lines and fingertip injury has been reported in the English literature.

### Non-healing arm wound with a discharging sinus in an elderly patient with diabetes [^111LDuFM]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

A 48-year-old Filipino female presented with unilateral acute onset of a painful red eye, blurred vision, and yellow discharge. On examination, she had a corrected visual acuity of 6/5 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye. There was left-sided periorbital swelling, with chemosis involving the bulbar conjunctiva on the temporal aspect. Ocular motility showed limitation of left-sided abduction with mild limitation of laevoelevation and laevodepression. She was afebrile, and systemic examination was unremarkable.

Her medical history included a diagnosis of Crohn's disease since the age of 20. She was on oral mesalamine 1 g for mildly active colitis. A full blood count was normal, but erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were raised. Blood culture and conjunctival swab were negative. A contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrated enlargement of the lacrimal gland.

She was managed conservatively with acetaminophen and codeine for pain and swelling. She recovered completely in two weeks with no sequelae.

Regarding medical management for Fournier's gangrene, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend initiating broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic therapy. Options include vancomycin or linezolid plus piperacillin/tazobactam or a carbapenem, or plus ceftriaxone and metronidazole, in patients with suspected or documented necrotizing fasciitis. This approach ensures coverage for aerobes, anaerobes, group A streptococci, and MRSA.

### Proximal nail fold swelling, pain, and granulation tissue [^1163VHcB]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of left great toe pain, swelling, erythema, and drainage. The patient was previously treated with a topical antifungal, oral antibiotics, and hot water soaks without improvement of symptoms. The patient's toe upon presentation is depicted in Fig 1 and after gentle washing in Fig 2. The patient's nail plate is depicted in Fig 3. What is the diagnosis?

- **A. Acute paronychia**: Incorrect. Acute paronychia is caused by a disruption in the seal of the nail fold and nail plate, allowing often polymicrobial infections to develop in the local periungual soft tissues.
- **B. Onychomycosis**: Incorrect. While onychomycosis can cause proximal onycholysis, it typically does not cause periungual inflammation and drainage.
- **C. Retronychia**: Correct. The diagnosis of retronychia is made clinically. Criteria for diagnosis are chronic inflammation of the proximal nail fold, granulation tissue protruding from under the proximal nail fold, and a thickened often doubled proximal nail plate. Retronychia occurs when the nail plate separates completely from the matrix and a new plate grows under the old plate. This pushes the nail plate upwards and causes inflammation to the proximal nail fold.
- **D. Squamous cell carcinoma**: Incorrect. Although the presentation of squamous cell carcinoma varies, it typically appears as a periungual friable, verrucous mass with associated nail dystrophy.
- **E. Ingrown nail**: Incorrect. Ingrown nails occur along the…

### Draining dorsal hand pustules, nodules, and ulcers in a patient with immunosuppression [^1148j7xi]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What is a potential treatment for this condition?
	- A. Topical corticosteroid
	- B. Azole antifungal or amphotericin
	- C. Cytotoxic chemotherapy
	- D. Meropenem
	- E. Supportive care

- **Answers**:
	- A. Topical corticosteroid – Incorrect. Immunosuppression, including systemic corticosteroids, is a risk factor for cutaneous protothecosis. Further immunosuppression would likely exacerbate this condition.
	- B. Azole antifungal or amphotericin – Correct. Protothecosis can be difficult to treat and may require multiple agents or months of therapy; optimal treatment for cutaneous disease is unclear, although patients with risk for disease spread should be treated more aggressively. Surgical excision or debridement is often beneficial for local cutaneous disease. For deeper or persistent infections, surgical management is combined with azole antifungals or intravenous amphotericin with a tetracycline. Left alone, disease will persist and potentially spread, although systemic or disseminated infection is rare. The prognosis for cutaneous infection is generally positive.
	- C. Cytotoxic chemotherapy – Incorrect. Cutaneous protothecosis is an infection and would not respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy.
	- D. Meropenem – Incorrect. This patient was treated with multiple antibiotic courses without resolution. Protothecosis infection is not a bacterial infection and would not respond to conventional antibiotics alone.
	- E. Supportive care – Incorrect. Cutaneous protothecosis requires treatment to reduce the likelihood of dissemination.

### Delusional infestation complicated by gangrene and osteomyelitis requiring finger amputation [^111Lh1UW]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Patients frequently attempt to extract the 'pathogen' or fibers and use a plethora of tools or agents to do so. Consequently, excoriations, prurigo nodularis, ulcerations, scars, and secondary infections develop. The manifestations may be asymmetrical due to the dominant hand effect. A large proportion of patients (25%-75%) try to demonstrate proof of their illness by collecting specimens and bringing them to physician visits. This scenario is known as the 'specimen sign', 'matchbox sign', or 'baggies sign', as patients may use different containers.

Non-cutaneous manifestations include psychiatric (depression and hallucinations), neurological (cognition problems), and general symptoms (fatigue and myalgia). Patients develop complex stories to explain their illness. They are often reluctant to be stigmatized by a diagnosis of mental illness, resulting in social isolation, loss of employment, and loss of custody of children. Therefore, delusional infestation may be underdiagnosed. The duration of the symptoms varies from less than one year to decades, and many patients become anxious due to the chronicity of delusional infestation, with some even developing suicidal behavior.

### Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis of the finger nail in a neonate: a rare case [^113w4S4V]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The parents brought a 28-day-old male child to the Dermatology outpatient department of Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal, with complaints of yellowish discoloration of the nail and slight swelling of the upper part of the middle finger of the left hand for one week. The mother reported that the baby had been suckling this finger since birth. The baby was well two weeks prior when he developed a slight yellowish discoloration of the middle finger of the left hand. The stain spread proximally with increasing thickness of the nail. There was no family history of fungal infections, psoriasis, lichen planus, Darrier's disease, or yellow nail syndrome. There were no other risk factors suggestive of HIV infection in the parents. The baby was delivered at 39 weeks of gestational age via normal vaginal delivery and weighed 3250 g. There was no history of perinatal hypoxia, and his developmental milestones were appropriate for his age.

On examination, the physical activities of the baby were as per his age. There was noticeable yellowish discoloration of the nail of the middle finger of the left hand distally, with yellowish subungual hyperkeratotic debris. Pitting or whitish deposits on the nail were not evident. Examination of the skin revealed no lesions suggestive of fungal infections, psoriasis, lichen planus, or Darrier's disease. The scalp hairs were healthy. Oral and genital surfaces were normal without any lesions suggestive of mucosal candidiasis. Systemic examination was within normal limits. It was provisionally diagnosed as onychomycosis. The nail was trimmed.

### Sporanox [^112beuJu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 73 total; 37 given SPORANOX® Capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course (pulse) of 200 mg of SPORANOX® Capsules b.i.d. This was followed by a 3-week period without SPORANOX®, and then a second 1-week pulse of 200 mg of SPORANOX® Capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated a mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent of patients were considered an overall success, and 47% of patients demonstrated both mycologic cure and clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. Notably, none of the patients who achieved overall success experienced a relapse.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: A clinical practice guideline [^115NkCAT]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

A skin abscess is an isolated collection of pus within the dermis and deeper skin tissues. Uncomplicated skin abscesses are collections of pus within the skin structures and are usually caused by bacterial infections. Careful history and clinical examination are usually sufficient to diagnose a skin abscess. Skin abscesses present as single or multiple tender, erythematous, indurated nodules, often surrounded by an area of erythema or swelling. Fluctuance beneath the skin often indicates a fluid-filled cavity. There may be a pustule at the area where the abscess is closest to the skin or spontaneous drainage of pus. The use of point-of-care ultrasonography can help differentiate an abscess from other soft tissue infections in the emergency department.

Skin infections are common. More than 4% of people seek treatment for skin infections annually in the United States. In European countries, it may be less common; in Belgium and the Netherlands, about 0.5–0.6% visit their general practitioner with bacterial skin infections each year.

### Acute gout following dermofasciectomy in a patient with Dupuytren disease [^111XDmPF]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man underwent uncomplicated dermofasciectomy of the right little finger. In the week after surgery, he presented with erythema, tenderness, reduced range of movement, and a chalklike discharge from the suture line. Investigations revealed a raised serum urate level accompanied by a borderline rise in inflammatory markers. A diagnosis of acute gout was made. The patient was managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of gout when patients present after surgery with redness, pain, and swelling, and also consider measuring urate levels before surgery. Initiating colchicine prophylaxis can be beneficial when there is a known diagnosis of gout before surgery. Accurate diagnosis may prevent unnecessary antibiotic use.

### Can paronychia cause a remote necrotizing soft tissue infection [^1171kDo4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Remote necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) resulting from paronychia is very unusual but potentially lethal. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman affected by this unusual infection. The paronychia completely resolved in less than 2 weeks; however, an NSTI involved the right chest and flank and the left thigh. The patient required intensive care and multiple surgical debridements. This recent experience and literature data suggest that paronychia can cause a remote NSTI that can rapidly spread and become life-threatening. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive surgical debridement are essential to a successful outcome.

### Flexor tenosynovitis of the hand caused by [^115JzJ5z]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The patient ultimately received a diagnosis of M tuberculosis tenosynovitis, and treatment was successful. Several factors likely contributed to the difficulty in identifying the correct etiology: (1) the patient had a medical condition (SLE) that offered a more probable explanation; (2) the progression of her symptoms was both mild and gradual, making infection, commonly caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, unlikely; (3) she had no personal history or exposure to M tuberculosis; (4) the low prevalence of tuberculosis in developed countries such as the United States generally lowers its rank on the differential diagnosis; and (5) she denied an exposure history suggestive of a specific infectious agent, such as aquatic activities (Mycobacterium marinum).

As the overall annual incidence of tuberculosis has decreased in the United States, from over 50 per 100,000 cases to less than 5 per 100,000 cases between the 1950s and early 2000s, the proportion of extrapulmonary tuberculosis infection has increased. Infections of the musculoskeletal system now account for 11.3% of extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases in the United States. The availability of effective and targeted treatments against M tuberculosis and the potential morbidity associated with untreated infection make timely diagnosis critical.

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^113UMTeu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally, topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one country.

### MDCT of hand and wrist infections: Emphasis on compartmental anatomy [^113DmfHc]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Hand and wrist infections can present with a spectrum of manifestations ranging from cellulitis to deep-space collections. The various infectious processes can be categorized as superficial or deep infections based on their respective locations relative to the tendons.

Superficial hand infections are located superficial to the tendons, comprising cellulitis, lymphangitis, paronychia, pulp-space infections, herpetic whitlow, and both volar and dorsal subcutaneous abscesses. Deep hand infections are situated deep to the tendon sheaths and include synovial space infections, such as infectious tenosynovitis, deep fascial space infections, septic arthritis, necrotizing fasciitis, and osteomyelitis. Knowledge of hand and wrist compartmental anatomy is essential for the accurate diagnosis and management of hand infections.

Although early and superficial infections of the hand may respond to non-surgical management, most hand infections are surgical emergencies. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), with its multiplanar reformation (MPR) and three-dimensional (3D) capabilities, is a powerful tool in the emergency setting for the evaluation of acute hand and wrist pathology. The clinical and imaging features of hand and wrist infections, as evident on MDCT, will be reviewed with emphasis on contiguous and closed synovial and deep fascial spaces. Understanding the compartmental anatomy of the hand enables accurate characterization of the infectious process and localization of the extent of disease in the acute setting.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: A clinical practice guideline [^114nXAy1]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

What role do antibiotics have in the treatment of uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision and drainage? A recent study suggested that, for small uncomplicated skin abscesses, antibiotics after incision and drainage improve the chance of short-term cure compared with placebo. Triggered by this trial, the Rapid Recommendation team produced a new systematic review. Relying on this review and using the GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid Recommendation process, an expert panel makes a weak recommendation in favor of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole) or clindamycin in addition to incision and drainage over incision and drainage alone.

For patients who have chosen to initiate antibiotics, the panel issues a strong recommendation for TMP-SMX or clindamycin rather than a cephalosporin and a weak recommendation for TMP-SMX rather than clindamycin. The infographic presents the recommendations together with other pertinent information, including an overview of the absolute benefits and harms of candidate antibiotics in the standard GRADE format.

- **Shared decision making**: The panel emphasizes shared decision making in the choice of whether to initiate antibiotics and in which antibiotic to use, because the desirable and undesirable consequences are closely balanced. Clinicians using MAGICapp will find decision aids to support the discussion with patients.

Box 1 shows the articles and evidence linked to this Rapid Recommendation. Table 2 below shows any evidence that has emerged since the publication of this article.

The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) 2014 guidelines address medical management for onychomycosis with systemic antifungals. It is recommended to offer terbinafine (250 mg/day for 6 weeks in fingernail infections and 12–16 weeks in toenail infections) as the first-line therapy in patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. Baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and a complete blood count (CBC) should be obtained in adult patients with a history of hepatotoxicity or hematological abnormalities.

### Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis of the finger nail in a neonate: a rare case [^117MoWnr]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The present case involved a 28-day-old healthy neonate with no predisposing conditions identified in either the mother or the neonate. The mother was immunocompetent and had no history of indwelling catheters. Furthermore, neither the mother nor the neonate received broad-spectrum antibiotics or parenteral alimentation. Neonatal onychomycosis has been sparsely reported and is mainly attributed to Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Trichophyton rubrum. The age range of reported cases with onychomycosis is 35 days to 10 weeks. Chun et al. reported onychomycosis (an isolated lesion of the nail plate without the involvement of the glabrous skin caused by C. tropicalis) in a 107-day-old infant. Our case had a clinical presentation similar to that documented by Chun et al, except for the younger age. Despite the discrepancies mentioned above in the clinical presentation and pathology, Candida could be considered an important cause of onychomycosis in the pediatric age group. In a survey of 46 cases of onychomycosis in children, Candida was identified as the second most common causative agent of onychomycosis, following dermatophytes. Hay et al. observed onychomycoses in subjects following chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and chronic paronychia. Carvalho VO et al. documented childhood onychomycosis due to Fusarium oxysporum, which was acquired in utero. It involved a progressing, ascending infection in an HIV-positive mother, affecting the placenta and nail as proven by molecular methods. Congenital candidiasis, acquired transplacentally, as shown in previous studies, might present with a skin rash but could also affect other areas.

The realm of nail unit surgery encompasses both the dermatologist and the hand surgeon. Complications in nail surgery may include allergy to anesthetic, infection, hematoma, nail deformity, and persistent pain and swelling.

- **Objective**: To review the pertinent literature regarding nail unit surgery complications.

- **Methods**: A Medline literature search was performed for relevant publications.

- **Results**: Nail unit surgery complications appear to be relatively infrequent. The majority of postoperative nail deformity complications result from nail matrix damage.

- **Conclusion**: Complications may be reduced to a minimum by preventive measures, such as careful patient selection, sterile technique, and gentle treatment of the nail matrix.

### Bedside ultrasound in the diagnosis of complex hand infections: a case series [^112yiKox]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The red, swollen, infected hand can be a diagnostically challenging presentation in the emergency department (ED). Hand infections are a relatively uncommon ED complaint, and diagnoses may range from simple cellulitis to deep space abscess, and even to suppurative flexor tenosynovitis. The accurate differentiation of these clinical entities is of paramount importance to the healing and recovery of function.

- **Case series**: In this case series, we review four patients with similar presenting complaints of a red, swollen hand, but with different diagnoses and eventual treatment strategies. We describe how ultrasound was used to assist in making the diagnosis and initiating the most appropriate therapy. Finally, we review techniques for sonographic evaluation of the hand and provide imaging tips to improve visualization and accurate diagnosis. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Bedside ultrasound may allow for a more rapid and accurate diagnosis of various hand infections when diagnosis by physical examination is unclear.

### Pincer nails complicated by distal phalangeal osteomyelitis [^1123W3Vh]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Besides the known cosmetic implications, pincer nails are often complicated by pain, chronic inflammation, and resuppurative infections. We report two such cases of chronic paronychia of the thumb secondary to pincer nails. Both cases were complicated by osteomyelitis. Although both cases eventually healed after excisional debridement, one case required elective amputation because the significant loss of bony support resulted in a painful, floppy fingertip and poor pinch. Regular radiographic assessments may be useful in the management of patients with chronic inflammation or reparonychias secondary to pincer nails to detect osteomyelitis.

### A snotty nose: More than just a cold [^116sWfcT]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A healthy 3-year-old girl presented with a 5-day history of right-sided cheek and eye swelling and pain, associated with right-sided green nasal discharge. Examination revealed diffuse erythematous swelling around the right cheek, jawline, and eye. Oral antibiotics for suspected periorbital cellulitis were ineffective. Blood inflammatory markers and ultrasound of her neck and parotid glands were normal. She was discharged as having viral parotitis. Antibiotics and nasal drops were later restarted for clinical sinusitis; however, she showed no improvement, now having 3 weeks of right-sided facial swelling with thick green and intermittently bloody nasal discharge. Further history revealed possible squint, mastication pain, and difficulty breathing through the right nostril.

Cranial imaging (figure 1) demonstrated a large central, but predominantly right-sided, nasopharyngeal tumor extending into the ethmoid sinuses and orbits (with medial recti distortion), infratemporal fossa and pterygoid muscles, and anterior and middle cranial fossae. There was accompanying skull base destruction.

- **Figure 1**: MRI axial T2-TSE (turbo spin echo) image showing the tumor filling the posterior nasal passages and nasopharynx, which erodes the anterior border of the clivus and extends into the anterior right middle cranial fossa. There is extension into the right orbit distorting the medial rectus muscle.

Staging and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of non-metastatic parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (PM-RMS). Chemoradiotherapy ensued. RMS is the most common type of childhood soft-tissue sarcoma.

### Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist: Diagnosis and treatment options [^112N4H8u]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Low credibility.

Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist are important clinical entities due to their rapidly progressive and potentially lethal nature. These infections encompass a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms, which can be subtle and nonspecific. If the brief prodromal period of these infections goes unrecognized, a local area of devitalized tissue can evolve into fulminant infection, multi-organ failure, and potentially death. Early recognition and treatment, including administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical débridement, are paramount to improving patient outcomes.

### Acute and chronic paronychia of the hand [^117Fh9Au]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic infections and inflammation adjacent to the fingernail, or paronychia, are common. Paronychia typically develops following a breakdown in the barrier between the nail plate and the adjacent nail fold and is often caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens; however, noninfectious etiologies, such as chemical irritants, excessive moisture, systemic conditions, and medications, can cause nail changes. Abscesses associated with acute infections may spontaneously decompress or may require drainage, local wound care, and a short course of appropriate antibiotics. Chronic infections have a multifactorial etiology and can lead to nail changes, including thickening, ridging, and discoloration. Large, prospective studies are needed to identify the best treatment regimen for acute and chronic paronychia.

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^117GE5bs]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Leukonychia, or white nails, is usually not an alarming sign, but it can sometimes unmask severe systemic disorders or congenital conditions. The white color can result from abnormalities in either the nail plate or the nail bed. Differentiating between these two is essential for the classification and interpretation of leukonychia. This article aims to guide clinical practice by reviewing data concerning several types of leukonychia, with particular reference to all clinical and dermoscopic features, associated medical conditions, pathogenesis, and necessary work-up.

### A hand surgeon's guide to common onychodystrophies [^112eTWej]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

The human fingernail contributes to the precise dexterity of the fingers, enhances sensibility, allows manipulation of fine objects, and shields the fingertip from traumatic injury. Nail abnormalities are a common incidental finding in the course of a hand surgeon's daily practice. These abnormalities may be clues to systemic, dermatologic, traumatic, and infectious processes that would benefit from further evaluation and treatment. The purpose of this review is to discuss common nail dystrophies and their related diagnoses.

### Clinical and cytologic features of antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia [^112aKPrB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute paronychia is typically treated as a bacterial infection, but antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia may be caused by other infectious and noninfectious issues.

- **Objective**: We sought to describe the clinical, etiologic, cytologic, and therapeutic features of antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of medical records and cytology was performed on 58 patients (age, 1 month-91 years; 36 children and adolescents [62%] and 22 adults [38%]) who had antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia.

- **Results**: Causes of paronychia included bacteria (25 patients [43%]), viruses (21 patients [36%]), fungi (5 patients [9%]), drugs (3 patients [5%]), pemphigus vulgaris (3 patients [5%]), and trauma (1 patient [2%]). Diagnostic cytologic findings were noted in 54 patients (93%); no diagnostic cytologic findings were present with drug-induced (3 patients) or traumatic (1 patient) paronychia. The most common predisposing factors were habits such as finger- or thumb-sucking (14 patients [24%]) and nail-biting (11 patients [19%]). Complications included id reaction with erythema multiforme in 3 patients (5%).

- **Limitations**: Limitations include the retrospective study design from one treatment center.

- **Conclusion**: Antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia may be infectious or noninfectious. Cytologic examination with Tzanck smear may be diagnostically useful and may prevent the unnecessary use of antibiotics and surgical drainage.

### Primary care management of skin abscesses guided by ultrasound [^116aPfHA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Primary care providers often manage skin abscesses in the outpatient setting. Estimating the size and depth of an abscess, and distinguishing an abscess from cellulitis by clinical examination, can be challenging due to surrounding firm tissue induration. Definitive treatment of an abscess requires incision and drainage, and the approach chosen may be altered by abscess size, depth, and surrounding neurovascular structures.

- **Methods**: For 31 consecutive patients seen in the primary care outpatient clinic, we prospectively compared the estimated size of skin abscesses by clinical examination with that determined by ultrasound. Prior to incision and drainage, a limited point-of-care ultrasound examination was performed, the abscess dimensions were measured, the depth was determined, and adjacent vascular structures were noted. Based on ultrasound findings, physicians reported whether the decision to perform the procedure or the techniques used to perform the procedure were altered by the scan.

- **Results**: The clinical examination was inaccurate for size estimation by more than 0.5 cm in 16 of 31 patients (52%). Ultrasound examination changed the physician's decision on whether incision and drainage should be performed in 7 patients (23%) and altered the technique/approach in an additional 10 patients (32%); thus, management was changed in 55% of cases. Physician confidence in performing the procedure was improved in 16 cases (52%).

- **Conclusion**: Outpatient procedural management of skin abscesses by primary care physicians was altered in more than half the cases by performing ultrasound-guided assessments.

### Chloronychia caused by infection [^116GXbA7]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old healthy Korean woman presented with an asymptomatic partial color change of the left third fingernail, noticed shortly after removing gel nail polish 4 days earlier. She denied any history of trauma or prolonged exposure to moist conditions. Physical examination and dermoscopy revealed light yellow-green discoloration of the middle to distal part of the left third fingernail adjacent to the lateral nail fold. Clinical findings suggested a diagnosis of green nail syndrome.

Microorganism stain with culture was implemented, and she was empirically treated with topical nadifloxacin cream. The culture revealed a ciprofloxacin-susceptible P. oryzihabitans infection. At the 2-month follow-up, the nail discoloration had resolved completely.

- **Clinical images**:
	- **Initial visit**: Light yellow-green discoloration of the left third fingernail.
	- **2-month follow-up**: Complete resolution of discoloration.

### Diseases mimicking onychomycosis [^114hfjyV]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of onychodystrophy has increased in dermatology consultations. This rise may be attributed to factors such as its esthetic effect, associated pain or disability, increased physician awareness for detecting the disease in the context of dermatologic or systemic conditions, or a general greater incidence. One of the primary differential diagnoses to consider when an onychodystrophic nail is observed is onychomycosis, which accounts for 50% of such cases.

### Curly fingernails as a potential new nail variant: A report of two cases [^115dkawC]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Curly nails are a clinical finding in which the distal nail plate grows in an undulating and wavy fashion. Although it is a benign nail condition, it may be underreported and cause distress due to limited functionality and an unsightly appearance. To our knowledge, only one case of curly fingernails has been reported at the time of writing by Oberlin et al. Here, we present two patients with curly fingernails who presented to our nail specialty clinic.

### Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma presenting as finger infection [^116NH8jN]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma (ADPA) is a rare tumor of sweat gland origin that may present in a nonspecific manner on the finger. The authors report a case of ADPA that was initially treated as a chronic finger infection, leading to a delay in diagnosis and definitive treatment. Failure of the wound to heal led to a biopsy of the lesion, which revealed ADPA. Due to the potential for aggressive local growth and distant metastases, amputation was indicated. This case demonstrates the importance of considering ADPA in the differential diagnosis of nonhealing wounds of the finger that have not responded to other forms of treatment. Wide local excision with clear margins and close surveillance for signs of recurrence or metastasis are indicated for this rare sweat gland neoplasm.

### In brief: Kanavel's signs and pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis [^115az3qh]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Understanding the common presentations of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis allows for timely diagnosis, facilitating prompt treatment. A useful clinical tool would also help clinicians exclude the diagnosis when it is not present, enabling the correct identification of other disorders that should be included in the initial differential diagnosis for a swollen or painful finger.

Conditions that mimic acute pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis include abscesses, felons, herpetic whitlow (a cutaneous infection caused by the herpes simplex virus, often presenting in medical and dental professionals with clear, painful vesicles coalescing into painful bullae over the fingertip), gouty arthritis, and septic arthritis involving the metacarpophalangeal or interphalangeal joints.

### Retronychia a little-known cause of paronychia: A report of two cases in adolescent patients [^116BqcYS]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Retronychia is a clinical condition resulting from the embedding of the nail plate into the proximal nail fold. We report two adolescent girls, aged 14 and 16 years, with a history of chronic proximal paronychia of the great toe, one of whom developed osteomyelitis. After the failure of treatment with several systemic antibiotics, nail avulsion was performed. This led to the diagnosis of retronychia and resulted in rapid and complete resolution of symptoms in both cases. Delay in the diagnosis of retronychia can lead to local complications and prolonged discomfort.

### Clinical analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-positive and -negative green nail syndrome cases: A single center retrospective analysis [^115s6FgF]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Green nail syndrome (GNS) is a paronychial infection primarily caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, characterized by green discoloration of the nail plate. Although the diagnosis of GNS may be straightforward due to its distinctive color change, clinical management of the disease can sometimes be confusing, especially when bacterial culture results are inconsistent. There is a lack of comprehensive reviews regarding the treatment of GNS in clinical settings.

In this retrospective review of 34 patients, we found that GNS mostly occurs on a single digit (79.4%), predominantly on the big toe or thumb (85.3%), with frequent concurrent fungal infection (67.6%). The prevalence of inconsistent bacterial culture results, with no evidence of P. aeruginosa, was unexpectedly high (n = 22, 64.7%), in which case coagulase-negative staphylococci were most frequently detected. The P. aeruginosa-negative group did not show any statistically significant differences compared to the P. aeruginosa-positive group and still responded well to typical topical and/or oral fluoroquinolone treatment. GNS without evidence of P. aeruginosa may be more common than reported in the literature, and it can be managed successfully with the same strategy employed for treating P. aeruginosa-positive cases. This may result from the low detection rate of P. aeruginosa due to the limited sensitivity of the test, or inadequate amount and/or contamination of the sample, warranting close scrutiny by clinicians.

### Common acute hand infections [^114kxL9v]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hand infections can result in significant morbidity if not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Host factors, location, and circumstances of the infection are important guides to initial treatment strategies. Many hand infections improve with early splinting, elevation, appropriate antibiotics, and, if an abscess is present, incision and drainage. Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated in patients who have at-risk infections.

- **Paronychia**: This is an infection of the epidermis bordering the nail, commonly precipitated by localized trauma. Treatment consists of incision and drainage, warm-water soaks, and sometimes oral antibiotics.

- **Felon**: Defined as an abscess of the distal pulp of the fingertip. An early felon may be amenable to elevation, oral antibiotics, and warm water or saline soaks. A more advanced felon requires incision and drainage.

- **Herpetic whitlow**: This is a painful infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Early treatment with oral antiviral agents may hasten healing.

- **Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist injuries**: These are more serious infections that often require surgical intervention.
	- **Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis**: This is an acute synovial space infection involving a flexor tendon sheath. Treatment consists of parenteral antibiotics and sheath irrigation.
	- **Clenched-fist injury**: Usually the result of an altercation and often involves injury to the extensor tendon, joint capsule, and bone. Wound exploration, copious irrigation, and appropriate antibiotics can prevent undesired outcomes.

### Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis of the finger nail in a neonate: a rare case [^1111cyNt]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common nail plate infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophytic molds, and yeasts. The prevalence of this condition is low in children compared to adults, and it is even rarer in newborns. Nevertheless, this diagnosis cannot be excluded in children and neonates presenting with nail plate disorders. Candida onychomycosis, most frequently caused by Candida albicans rather than any other Candida species, often clinically presents as paronychia, onycholysis, and onychorrhexis. Onycholysis as a pathological entity in children is more commonly caused by dermatophytes and usually presents with a single toenail infection featuring disto-lateral subungual onychomycosis. Distal lateral subungual onychomycosis due to Candida is extremely uncommon in neonates. We describe a case of dorsal lateral onychomycosis of a fingernail due to C. albicans in a newborn baby. This is the first reported case of neonatal onychomycosis in Nepal, and the case is presented for its extreme rarity.

### Melanonychia and subungual papule in a middle-aged man [^1159Z4tC]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old man with no personal or family history of skin cancer presented with a growing lesion on his left thumbnail for the past year. The area was painful and gradually became larger and darker, causing elevation of the nail plate. Upon examination, there was a 4 mm dark brown longitudinal band with a subungual papule and distal onycholysis (Fig 1, A and B). A nail clipping was submitted to histopathology (Fig 2).

- **Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?**
	- A. Dermatophytoma
	- B. Pigmented onychomatricoma
	- C. Pigmented onychopapilloma
	- D. Subungual melanoma
	- E. Subungual verruca

- **Answers**:
	- A. Dermatophytoma – Correct. Dermatophytoma are densely packed fungal masses in the subungual space in patients with distal onychomycosis. Dermatophytoma commonly present as opaque yellow, orange, or white patches or streaks in the nail plate. Histopathology of the nail clipping showed confluent growth of fungal organisms, and culture was identified as Candida parapsilosis (Fig 2). This is a rare, but established, cause of black or brown pigmentation of the nail or longitudinal melanonychia. The patient had substantial clinical improvement with fluconazole 200 mg once weekly after 4 weeks of use.
	- B. Onychomatricoma – Incorrect. Onychomatricoma is a benign proliferation of fibroepithelial cells originating from the nail matrix. It is rare and usually presents as a thickened nail plate with a honeycomb-like appearance of the distal nail plate. It is diagnosed via histologic examination of a nail clipping and will show filiform epithelial projections lined with matrix epithelium.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^1144ueM7]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Paronychia is one of the most common infections of the hand. Clinically, it presents as an acute or chronic condition. Paronychia is a localized, superficial infection or abscess of the paronychial tissues of the hands or, less commonly, the feet. Any disruption of the seal between the proximal nail fold and the nail plate can cause acute infections of the eponychial space by providing a portal of entry for bacteria.

Treatment options for acute paronychia include warm-water soaks, oral antibiotic therapy, and surgical drainage. In cases of chronic paronychia, it is important for patients to avoid possible irritants. Treatment options include the use of topical antifungal agents, steroids, and surgical intervention. Patients with chronic paronychia unresponsive to therapy should be checked for unusual causes, such as malignancy.

### Atypical infections versus inflammatory conditions of the hand: The role of imaging in diagnosis [^111K5b42]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical infections may manifest in settings of low clinical suspicion and, due to similarities with other inflammatory conditions in both clinical and imaging findings, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is not infrequent. This can lead to an elevated risk of severe bone and joint destruction, as well as increased morbidity. This review addresses the challenging subject of discussing the imaging characteristics of atypical infections and a variety of inflammatory conditions of the hand. It emphasizes the key points that assist in differentiating between the two broad clinical categories: infections versus inflammatory causes.

### The use of common salt for the treatment of pyogenic granuloma [^115qPcGF]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A 53-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with a rapidly growing tumor on the right middle finger, experiencing episodes of bleeding. She had a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient reported that the swelling started after self-induced trauma around 20 days prior to her presentation. She denied any recent changes in her medications and had no history of similar conditions. Examination revealed a solitary bright erythematous dome-shaped nodule with yellowish crusting superimposed over the dorsal periungual area of the right middle finger.

- **Figure 1**: Solitary bright erythematous dome-shaped nodule with superimposed yellowish crusting over the dorsal periungual area of the right middle finger. Henna stain over the fingernails is shown.

Based on the history and clinical appearance of the lesion, a diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma (PG) was made. Various treatment options were discussed with the patient, and she was offered treatment with sodium chloride (common salt). This treatment involved covering the entire lesion with salt after protecting the perilesional skin with white soft paraffin, followed by the application of a simple dressing. The patient was instructed to repeat the steps daily at home. After 3 weeks of daily salt application, the lesion resolved completely, and pain and movement restriction of the finger also resolved. The patient was satisfied with the result and reported no side effects.

- **Figure 2**: Complete resolution of the lesion within 3 weeks following daily application.

### Calcium deposits in the hand and wrist [^1161Y1s1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Calcium, or calcific, deposition disease in the form of acute calcific periarthritis of the hand and wrist is an uncommon entity that may be confused with more common crystalline or inflammatory arthropathies, as well as infection. It is important for the clinician to be aware of this disease process and to include it in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acutely painful, focal inflammation of the hand or wrist. Nonsurgical management is often sufficient; however, considering the self-limited nature of the disease, accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary antibiotic or surgical treatment.
