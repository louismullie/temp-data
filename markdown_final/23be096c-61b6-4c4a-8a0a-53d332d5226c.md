## Question

I have a 81 yo female with pulmonary fibrosis vs hypersenstivity after silicone breast implant leakage. What is the steroid dose for this?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate corticosteroid dose for an 81-year-old woman with suspected chronic pulmonary silicone embolism from ruptured breast implants, considering the differential diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the evidence base for corticosteroids in this entity. Next, I will review steroid dosing paradigms from related interstitial lung diseases and case series. After that, I need to tailor the regimen to an older adult, including taper, monitoring, and prophylaxis. Finally, I should consider the HP and IPF differentials, diagnostic confirmation, and adjunctive therapies, and then synthesize a practical recommendation with contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. Chronic pulmonary silicone embolism (CPSE) after implant rupture is strongly suggested by the history and typical clinical trajectory: dyspnea and cough years after rupture, often misdiagnosed as recurrent pneumonia, with imaging showing ground-glass opacities and consolidations and histology revealing silicone-laden macrophages and foreign-body giant cell reactions. Importantly, symptoms may persist despite prior implant removal due to established fibrosis, which fits this patient's profile [^116st4L2] [^114iJtEL] [^114C4HGi].

> Wait, let me verify the therapeutic signal for corticosteroids in CPSE. The literature consists largely of case reports and small series, but multiple reports document clinical improvement with systemic corticosteroids, including resolution of symptoms and stabilization of imaging in some cases, even when fibrosis is present. This supports a cautious trial of steroids while acknowledging the low-quality evidence base and the need for individualized risk–benefit assessment [^116st4L2] [^112pNY54] [^113o9yQy].

> I need to check dosing paradigms from analogous ILD contexts. In fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, observational cohorts commonly initiate prednisone around 0.5 mg/kg/day, with tapering over months based on response. Similarly, radiation pneumonitis guidelines recommend prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day (about 40 mg/day) for 2 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 4–6 weeks, which provides a pragmatic, moderate-intensity template that balances anti-inflammatory effect with toxicity risk in older adults [^113r44JW] [^116hmDpc] [^114h9XZK].

> Hold on, I should verify the implications of fibrosis on steroid responsiveness. In fibrotic HP, response to corticosteroids is attenuated compared with nonfibrotic disease; improvement is less frequent and slower, and some patients show no physiologic gains, so expectations must be tempered and treatment framed as disease-modifying attempt rather than reversal of established fibrosis, with close monitoring for futility or harm [^112Se7TD] [^114h9XZK].

> Let me consider the patient-specific risk profile. At age 81, the risks of high-dose steroids are magnified: infection, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, neuropsychiatric effects, and falls; therefore, I should avoid prolonged high-dose regimens and plan a relatively rapid taper once inflammation is controlled, while ensuring bone protection, glycemic monitoring, and infection prophylaxis where indicated [^1118jGvr] [^114vxrcX].

> I will now examine a practical starting regimen. For an estimated ideal body weight around 60 kg, prednisone 30 mg daily (approximately 0.5 mg/kg) is a reasonable starting dose. If the patient is frail or has significant comorbidities, I should consider 20–25 mg daily and titrate based on response and tolerability, recognizing that the evidence is extrapolated and individualized judgment is essential [^113r44JW] [^116hmDpc].

> Next, I should review the taper strategy and duration. A pragmatic approach is to continue the initial dose for 4–6 weeks if tolerated, then taper by about 5 mg every 2–4 weeks while reassessing symptoms, oxygen needs, and pulmonary function. Total duration often spans 3–6 months, with earlier taper if there is no clinical or physiologic improvement by 6–8 weeks, aligning with HP taper practices and the radiation pneumonitis schedule adapted to inflammatory ILD physiology [^116hmDpc].

> But wait, what if there is steroid-refractory disease or rapid progression. I should double-check the role of antifibrotics. In progressive fibrotic HP, nintedanib slows FVC decline and is FDA-approved for progressive fibrotic ILD; if the patient has progressive disease despite steroids or cannot tolerate them, adding or switching to nintedanib is reasonable, ideally after multidisciplinary discussion and with shared decision-making given modest absolute benefit and cost [^1139K4ZH] [^1113e9SQ].

> I need to ensure supportive care and safety measures are in place. Supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 88–90%, vaccination review, fall risk mitigation, and bone protection with calcium, vitamin D, and consideration of bisphosphonate if prolonged steroids are used are important. For patients on moderate-to-high dose steroids for more than a month, Pneumocystis prophylaxis should be considered in the appropriate risk context, balancing local epidemiology and comorbidities [^114vxrcX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the diagnosis without addressing the differential. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis remains in the differential, particularly if there are exposure clues or BAL lymphocytosis. However, the silicone exposure history, delayed presentation years after rupture, and pathologic evidence of silicone in reported cases strongly favor CPSE, and guidelines caution against relying on steroid responsiveness alone to confirm or exclude HP, reinforcing the need for careful exposure history and, when safe, tissue confirmation if uncertainty persists [^113tmsHK] [^114CqQy6] [^114iJtEL].

> Let me verify the role of biopsy in this scenario. If the diagnosis remains uncertain or management would change with confirmation, targeted lung biopsy demonstrating silicone-laden macrophages and foreign-body giant cell reactions would be decisive. Transbronchial cryobiopsy or surgical lung biopsy can be considered based on patient risk, distribution of disease, and local expertise, acknowledging the diagnostic yield trade-offs and procedural risks in an older adult [^115R6DdR] [^1118umt2].

> I should confirm the diagnostic workup elements that support CPSE versus HP. High-resolution CT with inspiratory and expiratory imaging helps characterize ground-glass and organizing features and exclude alternative processes; BAL may show macrophagic alveolitis with silicone-laden cells in CPSE, whereas lymphocytosis supports HP; serum HP antibody panels are low yield when exposure is unclear and should not delay management in this silicone-exposure context [^111yPU6P] [^116st4L2] [^112YWK5d] [^113zTtpx].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure the plan is coherent. For an 81-year-old with suspected CPSE, I recommend prednisone 30 mg daily for 4–6 weeks, then taper by 5 mg every 2–4 weeks over about 3–6 months if improving, with earlier discontinuation if no response by 6–8 weeks. Add bone protection, monitor glucose and blood pressure, and consider PJP prophylaxis if risk factors are present. If progression occurs despite steroids or steroids are contraindicated, discuss antifibrotic therapy with nintedanib and pursue confirmatory biopsy if the diagnosis remains uncertain and would alter management [^113r44JW] [^116hmDpc] [^1139K4ZH] [^115R6DdR].

---

For an 81-year-old woman with suspected silicone-induced pulmonary fibrosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis from breast implant leakage, **start prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day (typically 20–40 mg/day)** [^113r44JW] if there is active inflammation or hypersensitivity features, and taper over 3–6 months based on response [^114h9XZK] [^114vxrcX]. If fibrosis predominates without active inflammation, **avoid high-dose steroids** [^1118jGvr] and consider antifibrotic therapy (e.g. nintedanib) [^1139K4ZH]. Monitor closely for infections, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and psychiatric effects, and adjust therapy based on clinical, radiologic, and physiologic response [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Accurate diagnosis is essential to guide therapy; **silicone pneumonitis** presents with dyspnea, cough, and imaging showing ground-glass opacities, nodules, or fibrosis, often years after implant rupture [^114iJtEL] [^114C4HGi]. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis shows a lymphocytic alveolitis on BAL and granulomatous inflammation on biopsy [^112Hm4ff] [^11331GMJ]. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is suggested by a UIP pattern on HRCT and exclusion of other causes [^114nmeQV].

---

## Evidence for corticosteroid therapy

Corticosteroids are the mainstay for inflammatory ILDs, but **evidence in silicone-related lung disease is limited** [^1139K4ZH]. Case reports describe symptom and radiologic improvement with prednisone 20–40 mg/day tapered over months [^116st4L2] [^112pNY54]. In HP, prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day is commonly used, with better response in nonfibrotic disease and limited benefit in fibrotic HP [^112Se7TD] [^114h9XZK].

---

## Recommended corticosteroid regimen

Given the patient's age and comorbidities, a conservative, response-guided approach is prudent:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended corticosteroid dose** | **Duration and tapering** |
|-|-|-|
| Active inflammation or hypersensitivity features | Prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day (typically 20–40 mg/day) | - 3–6 months <br/> - Taper by 5–10 mg every 2–4 weeks based on response |
| Predominant fibrosis without active inflammation | Avoid high-dose corticosteroids | Consider antifibrotic therapy (e.g. nintedanib) |

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Regular monitoring is essential to assess **efficacy and adverse effects**. Assess symptoms, **lung function (FVC, DLCO)**, and imaging at **4–6 week intervals** initially, then space out as stable [^notfound]. Watch for **infections, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and psychiatric effects**, and adjust therapy accordingly [^notfound].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

If corticosteroids are contraindicated or ineffective, consider **antifibrotic therapy** — nintedanib slows FVC decline in progressive fibrotic ILD, including HP [^1139K4ZH] — or **immunosuppressive agents** such as mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine for persistent inflammation, though evidence is limited and toxicity is higher in older adults [^114h9XZK].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day (20–40 mg/day)** is reasonable if there is active inflammation or hypersensitivity features, with tapering over 3–6 months based on response [^113r44JW] [^114h9XZK].
- **Avoid high-dose corticosteroids** if fibrosis predominates without active inflammation; consider antifibrotic therapy [^1118jGvr] [^1139K4ZH].
- **Monitor closely** for adverse effects and adjust therapy based on clinical, radiologic, and physiologic response [^1137sgjB].

This approach balances potential benefit with the risks of corticosteroids in an older adult with silicone-related lung disease.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnostic triage and early steps — For patients with no current exposures who are male former smokers > 60 years old, the 2018 ATS/ERS/ALAT guidelines on the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) should be followed, with the initial steps including a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan followed by a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD). For all other patients with newly identified fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD), the decision which clinical practice guideline (CPG) to initially follow should be made on a case-by-case basis. Regardless of which CPG is followed, the initial steps are similar, and ongoing diagnostic evaluation may be redirected on the basis of the MDD. Clinicians should apply the recommendations within this CPG in the clinical context of each individual patient and should not consider any recommendations as mandates; no CPG or recommendation can consider all potential clinical circumstances.

Results

Baseline patient characteristics

The baseline characteristics were compared between the PDN group (n = 107) and the non-PDN group (n = 37), as shown in Table 1. Patients in the PDN group had worse pulmonary function, as reflected in a mean %FVC of 58.2% and a more rapid decline in %FVC before registration. All HP patients were instructed to avoid exposure to causative antigens. Corticosteroids were continuously administered from baseline over the observation period in all patients in the treatment group, with a mean initial dose of approximately 0.5 mg/kg daily and a physician-dependent tapering schedule. In the baseline HRCT findings (Table 2), traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing were more frequently present in the PDN group, and the PDN group also had higher maximum scores for GGA, reticulation, traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing. The baseline characteristics were compared after matching between the PDN group (n = 30) and the non-PDN group (n = 30) (Table 1). There were no significant differences in most baseline parameters, including pulmonary function, with a mean %FVC of approximately 70%, although the 12-month %FVC decline before registration was more rapid in the PDN group. In the HRCT analysis (Table 2), significant differences between the groups in the presence of HRCT findings and in the distribution of maximum scores in all HRCT findings disappeared after matching. Therefore, the baseline characteristics and HRCT scores were mostly adequately adjusted by PS matching.

Re-challenge of drug therapy in suspected cases of ILD

In the management of patients with NSCLC, it is often necessary to treat patients with an agent that has been previously associated with ILD. In this scenario, it is important to consider the patient's previous response to that therapy, the severity of the lung damage and the respiratory distress, the presence of fibrosis and the previous response to corticosteroid therapy. For some patients, the benefits may outweigh the risks and therapy may be re-instituted with concomitant low-dose prednisone (10–20 mg day −1); however, for some patients and/or agents the potential for causing further lung damage may be too great.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) definition and classification — HP is an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease affecting the lung parenchyma and small airways, and it typically results from an immune-mediated reaction provoked by an overt or occult inhaled antigen in susceptible individuals. Because the presence of radiographic or histopathological fibrosis is the primary determinant of prognosis, the guideline committee decided unanimously to categorize HP as either fibrotic (mixed inflammatory plus fibrotic or purely fibrotic) or nonfibrotic (purely inflammatory), and when patients have mixed features the categorization is determined by the predominance of features.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnostic workflow — steps: 1) form a hypothesis and estimate its likelihood, 2) decide how certain the HP diagnosis must be in the context of disease severity and behavior, 3) reassess the a priori probability of HP and choose an appropriate diagnostic test, 4) determine the posttest confidence of HP, and 5) determine if further testing or treatment is needed. This approach integrates the steps into the multidisciplinary assessment to establish the level of diagnostic confidence, and uses a provisional diagnosis reviewed at regular intervals, with recognition that the provisional diagnosis might change and that multidisciplinary team consultation can help confirm or reject the working diagnosis; the process is iterative and should be re-visited as additional data become available. The terms high or low confidence are used, with the goal of preventing inappropriate testing such as overutilization of TBC or VATS for diagnosis verification in patients with a provisional high confidence diagnosis. The diagnostic algorithm does not supersede clinical judgment regarding when to stop investigations and start treatment. The presented imaging and histopathological categories and the diagnostic approach do not capture each and every HP case and should be viewed as conditional and will evolve as new evidence becomes available.

### Patient perspectives on knowledge gaps in hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^1139K4ZH]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This study used the NGT to elicit the top questions about HP from the perspective of patients living with the disease. Our findings reveal the questions that are most important to patients and elucidate areas that require further attention from clinicians and researchers. Seven key themes emerged from the group interviews, highlighting stakeholder-identified areas that can be targeted to reduce knowledge gaps that are important to patients. Many patients' concerns centre around a lack of understanding about prognostication, aetiology and exposures, treatment options, and how to live well with HP.

A highly prioritised theme was current treatment options and therapeutic research. Participants expressed confusion about what the treatment protocol was for HP. This is an area of limited clarity for clinicians as well, as there are currently no clinical practice guidelines on pharmacological treatment for HP. While corticosteroids and immunosuppressants continue to be used for HP, this is mostly based on small studies and observational data, and there is no set guidance about the dosage, duration and long-term efficacy of these medications due to a lack of robust clinical trials. It may be challenging for clinicians to communicate this uncertainty effectively to patients. The only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for patients who have fibrotic HP is nintedanib, which has only been shown to slow the progression of the forced vital capacity in those with progressive fibrotic disease. The scarcity of effective medications and treatment guidelines points to the urgent need to prioritise the conduct of clinical trials on pharmacologic treatments for HP and their outcomes. Participants also had questions about whether there were alternatives to steroid medications, including herbal medications or supplements. Given the severe side effects of steroids that often have a significant impact on patients' quality of life, alternatives that have limited side effects need to be investigated.

Radiological Features of HP

The imaging features of HP are influenced by the histopathological stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. Our proposed approach reconciles the committee's preferred two-pattern description (i.e. nonfibrotic and fibrotic HP) with the three subtypes of HP previously considered (i.e. acute, subacute, and chronic forms). For nonfibrotic HP, we use consensus descriptions of the inflammatory and often reversible changes established in the literature. For fibrotic HP, we provide a novel approach that integrates 1) HRCT scan findings previously described as chronic HP and 2) recent data on the diagnostic impact of several radiological patterns. Fibrotic HP is widely recognized to have a variable radiological appearance, and the approach proposed here does not consider potential geographical specificities that may influence the most prevalent HRCT pattern.

The following descriptions are intended to provide a summary of HRCT findings that are 1) highly suggestive of HP, which we categorize as "typical HP"; 2) less frequently reported but compatible with HP, which we refer to as "compatible with HP"; or 3) "indeterminate for HP" when the HRCT findings are neither suggestive nor compatible with features of HP. Radiological terms related to the heterogenous lung attenuation are defined in Table 4.

Regarding medical management for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, BTS/ITS/TSANZ 2008 guidelines recommend to do not use high-dose corticosteroid monotherapy (0.5–1 mg/kg) in patients with IPF as it does not improve survival or otherwise modify the clinical course of the disease and is associated with significant morbidity.

Strength of recommendations — GRADE and ATS/JRS/ALAT definitions contrast Recommendation ("we recommend") with Suggestion ("we suggest"). For patients, a recommendation means "The overwhelming majority of individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small minority would not", whereas a suggestion means "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but a sizable minority would not". For clinicians, a recommendation indicates "The overwhelming majority of individuals should receive the recommended course of action… Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed… ", while a suggestion indicates "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients… Decision aids may be useful… Clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working toward a decision". For policy-makers, a recommendation "can be adapted as policy in most situations, including for use as performance indicators", while a suggestion means "Policy-making will require substantial debates… Policies are also more likely to vary between regions… Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation… has taken place". The panel adds thresholds: a recommendation "is the right course of action for > 95% of patients" and "may be an appropriate performance measure", whereas a suggestion "is the right course of action for > 50% of patients" and "is not appropriate for a performance measure".

### Early corticosteroid dose tapering in patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^1136h19D]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In this study, we showed that early tapering of corticosteroid dose is associated with a favorable prognosis. This may be biologically plausible because viral infection has been reported to be a common cause of AE-IPF, and the use of corticosteroids has been reported to delay viral excretion. In addition, long-term use of high doses of steroids increases the frequency of serious complications.

This study has two research implications. First, this was an observational study of two cohorts in which we examined the association between early tapering of corticosteroid dose and prognosis in patients with AE-IPF. A randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm our results. Second, we excluded patients with AE of non-specific IP (NSIP) or secondary IPs such as CTD-ILD or chronic/fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. However, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are widely used in the treatment of CTD-ILD of both acute and chronic onset, and these treatments may be more effective for AE of NSIP or secondary IP than AE-IPF. The feasibility of early tapering of corticosteroid dose in patients with AE of NSIP or secondary IP requires further investigation.

### Progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to cosmetic subcutaneous silicone injections in a patient with HIV-1 infection: case report and review of the literature [^112pNY54]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Silicone, commonly used in cosmetic procedures owing to its presumed inertness, can yield serious sequelae including acute embolization and pneumonitis. Chronic pulmonary sequelae in response to silicone injection have not been previously described. We report a case of chronic progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to subcutaneous silicone injections in a transgender male-to-female patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). After receiving silicone injections to the buttock, the patient developed rapid onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and chills. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse peripheral interstitial opacities. She responded symptomatically to prednisone with subsequent intermittent symptomatic flares. Four years later, she developed marked dyspnea and cough. Chest computed tomography showed progressive diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities. Lung biopsies demonstrated numerous spheroid silicone particles within the lung interstitium and small pulmonary vessels, surrounded by foreign body giant cells and nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation. We speculate that HIV-1-infected patients may be at risk for chronic, progressive granulomatous pneumonitis due to silicone injection years after their procedure owing to shifting levels of cell-mediated immunity.

Purpose Of Review

A recent international collaboration has updated the clinical definition and diagnostic recommendations for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, focusing on fibrotic and non-fibrotic phenotypes. However, how these transfer to clinical practice and their impact upon clinical management and prognosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is unclear. This review will focus on recent advances in the understanding of the clinical aspects of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, predominantly its epidemiology, diagnosis, classification and treatment.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a rare disease within the general population, with variable geographical incidence because of environmental, cultural and occupational factors. Confidence in diagnosis relies upon the presence of clinical features with a temporal relationship to an associated exposure, radiological and histopathological features, bronchiolo-alveolar lavage lymphocytosis and precipitating antibodies/specific immunoglobulin G to antigens. Although emerging evidence regarding nintedanib use in progressive fibrotic interstitial lung disease is promising, the majority of therapies (corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents) used traditionally in hypersensitivity pneumonitis lack a robust evidence base.

Summary

With a clear definition of fibrotic and nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis phenotypes now established, clinical research trials (predominantly randomized controlled trials) should clarify and resolve the discussion regarding antigen avoidance, corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive therapy and antifibrotic therapy in fibrotic and nonfibrotic subtypes of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

### Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: lessons from a randomized controlled trial in children [^117CwYK7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) in children is a severe interstitial lung disease and potentially, a chronic condition, if not treated appropriately. No evidence-based guidelines are available; in particular, the role of systemic glucocorticoid therapy is unclear.

Methods

The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, phase II trial in pediatric HP was to assess the outcome of HP in children after 6 months of treatment and to compare 3 months of treatment with oral prednisolone or placebo.

Results

After 1.5 years and the inclusion of only four children, we terminated the study prematurely. Two of the children randomized to prednisolone did not achieve the predefined response of FVC to normal. One child treated with placebo recovered to normal, similar to another child treated with prednisolone. All children treated with steroids developed drug-related side effects.

Discussion

This uncompleted study illustrates the urgent medical need for evidence-based treatment protocols for this condition. We discuss the hurdles which were specific for completion of this trial in a rare condition. Among other options, we suggest the inclusion of children into an all-age study of HP, as in adults the same questions are unanswered.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lymphocyte analysis — retrospective fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) cohort: In individuals with fibrotic ILD of unknown cause who are clinically suspected of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and have usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings, BAL cellular analysis may help separate IPF from fibrotic HP, and in a retrospective series of undiagnosed fibrotic ILDs with an indeterminate UIP pattern, the mean BAL lymphocyte percentage was higher in fibrotic HP than IPF (24.1 ± 15.4 vs 11.4 ± 6.2), with revaluation driven by BAL leading to a change in diagnosis in 14 patients (15%), most commonly from IPF to fibrotic HP in 11/14 [79%].

Committee discussion

There was general agreement that the diagnostic yield of TBBx was suboptimal, with only half of procedures resulting in a diagnosis and with the exact frequency depending on the population. However, the guideline committee was divided regarding the interpretation of the evidence. Some members argued that roughly half of patients who undergo TBBx will be spared an SLB, and other members contended that roughly half of patients will require two sampling procedures instead of one, with the former favoring TBBx and the latter arguing against TBBx. An additional concern is the potential for diagnostic misclassification based on potentially suboptimal TBBx specimens.

Notably, the guideline committee observed that the diagnostic yield was substantially higher among patients with DLD than among patients with ILD (68% vs. 37%). This was extrapolated to the notion that diagnostic yield may be higher among patients with suspected nonfibrotic HP than among patients with suspected fibrotic HP. This potential difference was supported by nonsystematic clinical observations that granulomas are more likely to be detected and to be diagnostic among patients with nonfibrotic HP than among patients with fibrotic HP. Thus, TBBx was judged to be worthwhile in patients with suspected nonfibrotic HP, but not in patients with suspected fibrotic HP.

The committee acknowledged that TBBx is safe, available in most institutions, minimally burdensome, and inexpensive and that most pulmonary clinicians have experience performing the procedure. The patient representative indicated that he would choose a TBBx in the hope of avoiding SLB, even with the knowledge that a second procedure would be necessary if the TBBx were nondiagnostic.

Recommendations

1.000000000000000e+00 For patients with newly identified ILD whose differential diagnosis includes nonfibrotic HP, the guideline committee suggests TBBx (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects). Voting results: recommendation for, 1; suggestion for, 20; no recommendation or suggestion, 4; suggestion against, 3; recommendation against, 0.
2. For patients with newly identified ILD whose differential diagnosis includes fibrotic HP, the guideline committee makes no recommendation or suggestion for or against TBBx. Voting results: recommendation for, 1; suggestion for, 13; no recommendation or suggestion, 6; suggestion against, 7; recommendation against, 1.

Question 5: Should patients with newly detected ILD on chest radiographs or a CT scan of the chest, with or without a history of exposure capable of causing HP, undergo transbronchial lung cryobiopsy to diagnose HP?

### Chronic pulmonary silicone embolism after breast implant rupture: an underdiagnosed cause of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia? [^111bXLST]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A woman in her mid-70s presented with worsening dyspnoea, cough and fatigue initially treated for pneumonia. Despite antibiotics, her condition deteriorated, prompting further investigation. Medical history included previous breast implants, the latter of which had ruptured years earlier and was subsequently removed prior to the current presentation. Imaging revealed bilateral lung consolidations and lymphadenopathy. Bronchoalveolar lavage indicated macrophagic alveolitis, while biopsies showed chronic inflammation and the presence of silicone. Diagnosis of chronic pulmonary silicone embolism was made, a rare condition linked to the migration of silicone particles into the lungs, causing inflammation. Treatment involved corticosteroids, leading to symptom resolution. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of silicone pneumonitis, which can manifest years after implant rupture and removal. Clinicians should be aware of this condition to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment, as symptoms may persist even after implant removal due to irreversible lung fibrosis.

Methods

A multidisciplinary (pulmonologists, radiologists, methodologists, pathologists, and patient) panel of experts from the ATS, JRS, and ALAT was composed to identify clinically important questions about diagnostic testing for HP among patients with newly identified ILD. The CPG was created in two parts. The first portion describes clinical, radiological, and pathological features of HP while proposing a definition, diagnostic criteria, and a diagnostic algorithm. It was approached in a consensus fashion and informed by a nonsystematic review of the literature. The second portion makes graded recommendations that answer questions about whether to perform a diagnostic intervention. It was informed by National Academy of Medicine–adherent guideline methodology, including a full systematic review for each question and the formulation, writing, and grading of recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. For a detailed description of the methods, see the online supplement.

Implications of the different degrees of recommendation are described in Table 1. Using the GRADE approach, each recommendation was rated as either a "recommendation" or a "suggestion". The meaning of a recommendation is the same as a strong recommendation in typical GRADE nomenclature, and the meaning of a suggestion is the same as a weak or conditional recommendation in typical GRADE nomenclature. Typical GRADE nomenclature was altered for this guideline to address prior criticism that the term "conditional" created uncertainty in the context of translation into non-English languages.

Summary of Recommendations

1 Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) must be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with newly identified interstitial lung disease (ILD).
2 The guideline committee categorized HP into two clinical phenotypes — nonfibrotic and fibrotic HP — and made separate recommendations for each: a. For patients with clinical and radiographic manifestations suggestive of nonfibrotic HP (i.e. patients without radiological and/or histopathological evidence of fibrosis), the guideline committee:

i. makes no recommendation or suggestion for or against the use of a questionnaire to identify potential HP inciting agents and sources; instead, the guideline committee recommends development and validation of a questionnaire. Remark: Pending the availability of a validated questionnaire, the guideline committee advocates that clinicians take a thorough history to identify potential exposures and sources in the patient's environment that are known to be associated with HP.
ii. suggests performing serum IgG testing that targets potential antigens associated with HP (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects).
iii. recommends obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for lymphocyte cellular analysis (recommendation, very low confidence in the estimated effects).
iv. suggests transbronchial forceps lung biopsy (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects).
v. makes no recommendation or suggestion for or against transbronchial lung cryobiopsy.
vi. suggests surgical lung biopsy only when all other diagnostic testing has not yielded a diagnosis (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects). b. For patients with clinical and radiographic manifestations suggestive of fibrotic HP (i.e. patients with radiological and/or histopathological evidence of fibrosis), the guideline committee: i. makes no recommendation or suggestion for or against the use of a questionnaire to identify potential HP inciting agents and sources; instead, the guideline committee recommends development and validation of a questionnaire. Remark: Pending the availability of a validated questionnaire, the guideline committee advocates that clinicians take a thorough history to identify potential exposures and sources in the patient's environment that are known to be associated with HP. ii. suggests performing serum IgG testing that targets potential antigens associated with HP (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects). iii. suggests obtaining BAL fluid for lymphocyte cellular analysis (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects). iv. makes no recommendation or suggestion for or against transbronchial forceps lung biopsy. v. suggests transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects). vi. suggests surgical lung biopsy; this recommendation is intended to apply when all other diagnostic testing has not yielded a diagnosis (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects).

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis update: reconciliation with hypersensitivity pneumonitis guidelines required? [^116tCnCe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Clinicians welcome the updated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) clinical practice guidelines recently published in the Journal. Raghu and a multidisciplinary group of experts did a great job at providing evidence-based recommendations and suggestions to guide clinicians in the diagnosis and management of IPF and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. However, the updated IPF guidelines do not emphasize the role of ruling out known causes of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or probable UIP patterns on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, as previous guidelines did. In particular, they do not address the role of BAL in the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), arguably the most important differential diagnosis of IPF. Furthermore, in the diagnostic algorithm proposed in the guidelines in Figure 10, the authors do not recommend or suggest any additional testing in patients with UIP or probable UIP pattern on HRCT to rule out HP.

Hence, how do current guidelines reconcile with recent HP guidelines, which suggest that, in patients with UIP or probable UIP pattern on HRCT (called indeterminate for HP pattern in the HP guidelines), BAL is required to define the diagnosis? It would have been very helpful if the current guidelines had provided further clarification on this matter.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113QnqzT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-pneumonitis — knowledge gaps regarding corticosteroids and steroid-sparing therapies are emphasized, as the efficacy and timing of steroid-sparing agents remain unknown, and it is similarly unknown whether infliximab, cyclophosphamide, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) would be useful in relapsing or steroid-dependent disease or adversely impact tumor response to ICIs. The statement notes that one could postulate that treatment with steroids may adversely impact the ICI antitumor response, and that steroids increase the risk of infection and may not affect progression to fibrotic lung disease, each of which could worsen patient outcomes. It further highlights that determining the additive effect of steroids versus withdrawal of therapy alone or targeted, steroid-sparing therapies would help answer these questions.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112Se7TD]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Panel discussion — hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) medical therapy outcomes are based on very low-quality evidence; small studies reported complete resolution of symptoms and radiologic abnormalities in 11 (52%) of 21 hot tub lung cases at a median follow-up of 5 months, new radiologic fibrosis in 6/86 (7%) over 60 months (5/6 from the prednisone group), and among 16 patients with imaging data, 8/16 (50%) HRCT normalization and 8/16 (50%) improvement. Collectively the data suggest that clinical improvement with medical therapy is much more common in nonfibrotic HP than in fibrotic HP, and for these reasons the guideline panel elected to suggest not making a clinical diagnosis of HP based on clinical improvement with medical therapy alone.

### Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: updates in evaluation, management, and ongoing dilemmas [^116TP9dx]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a heterogenous disease entity characterized by an aberrant immune response to inhalational antigens. Disease modification hinges on early antigen remediation with a goal to attenuate immune dysregulation. Disease severity and progression are mediated by an interface between degree, type and chronicity of exposure, genetic predisposition, and biochemical properties of the inducing agent. Guidelines have provided a standardized approach; however, decision-making remains with many clinical dilemmas. The delineation of fibrotic and nonfibrotic HP is crucial to identify the differences in clinical trajectories, and further clinical trials are needed to understand optimal therapeutic strategies.

The diagnostic criteria are presented in a way that explicitly conveys the diagnostic confidence associated with common combinations of specific features. We used an approach similar to the approach proposed by an international working group, which categorized ILD diagnoses on the basis of confidence. We categorized diagnoses as definite (≥ 90% confidence), high-confidence (80–89%), moderate-confidence (70–79%), and low-confidence (51–69%) diagnoses. This approach is supported by recent studies suggesting the potential therapeutic and prognostic utility of assigning diagnostic confidence in this manner.

Criteria and an algorithm for establishing a diagnosis of HP are provided in Figures 6 and 7, which may be applied to patients with a clinical presentation consistent with either fibrotic or nonfibrotic HP. Both were developed through iterative discussion and consensus by the full guideline committee on the basis of the evidence syntheses and recommendations presented below, supplemented by the guideline committee's collective clinical experience.

In chronic HP, relocation or remediation kept 10/14 patients stable without VC% decline at 12 months (0.8 ± 3.6%), whereas three of four with ongoing exposure (mean change −17.6 ± 11.0%) died of respiratory failure due to disease progression.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) clinical response to therapy — study evidence overview: The systematic review identified one randomized trial and nine observational studies that evaluated HP patients' responses to medical therapy. In a double-blind trial of acute nonfibrotic HP, 35 patients were randomized 19 to prednisone (starting at 40 mg/daily) and 16 to placebo for 8 weeks; the study reported a difference in mean DLCO after 1 month (P = 0.03), but at 5 years there were no significant between-group differences. In 19 children with nonfibrotic HP given monthly high-dose pulse methylprednisolone (median of 15 monthly courses), lung function increased at 3 and 6 months (P < .05) and 80% had normal HRCT on follow-up. In another pediatric series of 23 children (mean age of 10 years), 20 received systemic corticosteroids (mean 34 ± 22 weeks) and at 11.1 ± 1.0 years, outcomes were 17/23 healthy, 5/23 improved, and 1/23 worse. In adults, a study of 202 HP patients found 149 (74%) received corticosteroids for a median of 6.5 months; in nonfibrotic HP, corticosteroids reversed a monthly FVC% decline of 0.35% to an increase of 0.84% (P < .01) with no DLCO% change (P = 0.43), whereas fibrotic HP showed no significant changes (FVC%, P = 0.96; DLCO%, P = 0.59). In fibrotic HP, 131-patient data showed 93 (71%) received immunosuppressive therapy (41 prednisone only, 24 azathioprine, 28 mycophenolate mofetil); prednisone recipients had worse FVC% decline over 36 months (−1.0% vs −1.3%; p = 0.04), and prednisone-sparing therapy altered the monthly FVC decline (−0.7% vs −0.2%; P = 0.001) with overall 36‑month FVC% similar to prednisone (−9.4 ± 4.3% vs −11.5 ± 3.6%; p = 0.58). Chronic HP cohorts receiving mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine showed DLCO% gains: among 70 subjects (84% also on corticosteroids), DLCO% increased at 1 year (mean increase, 4.2%; 95% CI, 2.6–5.9; P < .01), and among 30 subjects (100% also on corticosteroids), DLCO% improved from −0.55 ± 0.96 to +0.31 ± 0.58.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111J2VgZ]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) probabilistic diagnostic categories — HP diagnoses are classified as confident (≥ 90% overall probability of a diagnosis), provisional high-confidence (70%-89%), or low-confidence (51%-69%), and the term "HP unlikely" is used when there is 50% confidence in HP as a leading diagnosis. The treatment threshold is the disease probability (eg, ≥ 90% for HP) at and above which further testing is unnecessary and treatment is prescribed, whereas the test threshold is the probability below which the diagnosis is unlikely and excluded without further testing; diagnostic testing is most helpful when the probability of HP is between these two extremes of certainty.

Introduction

HP is typically an immune-mediated disease that manifests as ILD in susceptible individuals after exposure to an identified or unidentified factor. Various alternative definitions of HP have been proposed, but agreement among experts regarding disease definition, diagnostic criteria, and diagnostic approach is lacking, despite efforts by international groups. Without a consensus definition, it is challenging to diagnose and research HP. Recent articles have highlighted substantial gaps in our knowledge about the epidemiology, pathogenesis, optimal diagnostic approach, classification, treatment, and follow-up of HP.

HP shares features of other acute and chronic pulmonary diseases; as a result, fibrotic/chronic HP can be misdiagnosed as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or another idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). Many inciting agents have been associated with HP since its recognition in 1700, but the antigen and exposure are not identified in up to 60% of patients with HP, despite a thorough history. This highlights the difficulty in identifying a culprit exposure and raises the possibility that HP can occur in the absence of an inhalational exposure. It also emphasizes the difficulty in making a definitive diagnosis of HP (particularly fibrotic/chronic HP), which is the reason that a diagnosis of HP requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes radiologists and pathologists. There are many questions about the identification, duration, quantity, frequency, intensity of exposure to the inciting agent and its source that is required to induce HP, and factors that may predispose people to develop HP.

Summary of evidence

A systematic search of the literature identified 501 potentially relevant articles. The full text of 56 articles was reviewed, and 34 nonrandomized studies were selected to inform the guideline committee (,–). One study enrolled patients with known or suspected HP, 27 enrolled patients with ILD, and 6 enrolled patients with DLD. All studies performed SLB and reported the diagnostic yield of the procedure; some also reported the frequency of adverse effects.

The diagnostic yields were 96% (95% CI, 90–100%), 98% (95% CI, 98–99%), and 96% (95% CI, 93–99%) among patients with known or suspected HP, ILD, and DLD, respectively. Among patients with known or suspected HP in whom a diagnosis was made by SLB, 91% (95% CI, 79.3–96.5%) were confirmed to have HP and 9% (95% CI, 3.5–20.7%) had an alternative ILD. Among patients with ILD (not specifically suspected or known to have HP) in whom a diagnosis was made by SLB, 9% (95% CI, 5.9–13.1%) were determined to have HP, 61% (95% CI, 54.3–66.4%) were found to have an alternative type of ILD, and 31% (95% CI, 25.1–36.6%) were determined to have a non-ILD diagnosis, such as an infection. Among patients with DLD in whom a diagnosis was made by SLB, 9% (95% CI, 8.1–10.3%) were determined to have HP, 61% (95% CI, 59.2–62.9%) were found to have an alternative type of ILD, and 30% (95% CI, 28.1–31.6%) were determined to have a non-ILD diagnosis.

### Management of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^1113e9SQ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent guidelines have updated the classification of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, stratifying by the presence or absence of fibrosis as either fibrotic or nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis represents up to 10% of interstitial lung disease in large cohort studies, and is occasionally even more common in some regions; however, there are many unknown aspects to the diagnosis and management. The goal of this review article is to summarize the management of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Recent Findings

Historically, the only treatment options for patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis were antigen avoidance and corticosteroids, although other immunosuppressive therapies are increasingly endorsed by experts in the field. There is accumulating evidence that antifibrotic medications can be useful as a second-line therapy in some patients with fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis who have progression despite immunosuppression. There remains no direct comparison of immunosuppressive vs. antifibrotic medication for the management of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but some clinical, radiological and pathological features may suggest greater likelihood of benefit from one option or the other.

Summary

We anticipate that future treatment of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis will consider a variety of patient features to suggest the most prominent underlying biology that will then be used to guide initial pharmacotherapy; however, additional data are still needed.

Diagnostic criteria and evaluation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis — Diagnosis of IPF requires exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and either the presence of the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or specific combinations of HRCT patterns and histopathology patterns in patients subjected to lung tissue sampling; patients with suspected IPF are initially evaluated for identifiable causes of ILD, and if a potential cause is found a thorough evaluation is undertaken to confirm or exclude hypersensitivity pneumonitis, connective tissue disease (CTD), pneumoconiosis, and iatrogenic causes, whereas if no specific diagnosis or cause is identified, clinical findings and HRCT are considered during MDD to either ascertain or exclude the diagnosis of IPF, and IPF is diagnosed if the appropriate combination of HRCT patterns and histopathological patterns are present.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis — role of clinical improvement with medical therapy: For patients with suspected HP, we suggest not relying solely on clinical improvement with medical therapy to confirm a diagnosis of HP or on the lack of clinical improvement with medical therapy alone to rule out the diagnosis of HP (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). Clinical improvement refers to improvement in physiologic and radiologic features, and failure to respond to medical treatment (eg, systemic corticosteroids) alone does not necessarily exclude the diagnosis of HP as the response rate to medical therapy can be highly variable. Clinical improvement with medical treatment appears to occur more frequently in nonfibrotic HP, while the lack of clinical improvement, regardless of therapy, is common in fibrotic HP, and clinical improvement with medical therapy supports but does not confirm the diagnosis of HP as other ILDs with similar presentations, such as idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, may also improve with immunosuppressive treatment.

### Integration and application of clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^116nezn1]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent clinical practice guidelines have addressed the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (fHP). These disease-specific guidelines were developed independently, without clear direction on how to apply their respective recommendations concurrently within a single patient, where discrimination between these two fibrotic interstitial lung diseases represents a frequent diagnostic challenge. The objective of this review, created by an international group of experts, was to suggest a pragmatic approach on how to apply existing guidelines to distinguish IPF and fHP. Key clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features described in previous guidelines are integrated in a set of diagnostic algorithms, which then are placed in the broader context of multidisciplinary discussion to guide the generation of a consensus diagnosis. Although these algorithms necessarily reflect some uncertainty wherever strong evidence is lacking, they provide insight into the current approach favored by experts in the field based on currently available knowledge. The authors further identify priorities for future research to clarify ongoing uncertainties in the diagnosis of fibrotic interstitial lung diseases.

### Chronic pulmonary silicone embolism after breast implant rupture: an underdiagnosed cause of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia? [^116st4L2]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

A woman in her mid-70s presented with worsening dyspnoea, cough and fatigue initially treated for pneumonia. Despite antibiotics, her condition deteriorated, prompting further investigation. Medical history included previous breast implants, the latter of which had ruptured years earlier and was subsequently removed prior to the current presentation. Imaging revealed bilateral lung consolidations and lymphadenopathy. Bronchoalveolar lavage indicated macrophagic alveolitis, while biopsies showed chronic inflammation and the presence of silicone. Diagnosis of chronic pulmonary silicone embolism was made, a rare condition linked to the migration of silicone particles into the lungs, causing inflammation. Treatment involved corticosteroids, leading to symptom resolution. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of silicone pneumonitis, which can manifest years after implant rupture and removal. Clinicians should be aware of this condition to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment, as symptoms may persist even after implant removal due to irreversible lung fibrosis.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) prognosis — fibrosis and lung involvement: In a study of 69 HP patients, the age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for mortality in patients with fibrosis was 4.6 (95% CI, 2.0–20.1). Mortality was highest in patients with > 40% lung involvement (5/6 patients died [83%]), followed by 10% to 40% involvement (3/6 patients died [50%]), then < 10% involvement (3/14 patients died [21%]), and was lowest in those with no lung fibrosis (1/43 patients died [2%]). IA identification was reported in 20 of the 26 (77%) fibrotic patients and 32/43 (74%) nonfibrotic patients, and duration of symptoms was similar in subjects who were alive (median 11 [3–44] months) and dead (median, 24 [11–42] months) after the study follow-up period.

Discussion

We present the case of a patient with subacute, worsening dyspnoea, inflammatory syndrome associated with radiologically progressive multifocal pneumonitis leading to respiratory failure, several years after a documented rupture of a breast prosthesis and its removal before the onset of symptoms. To our knowledge, only seven cases of pathologically confirmed pneumonitis due to CPSE have been reported.

In USA, it is estimated that 1% of women have breast implants, which represents 3.5 million people. It is the second most frequently performed plastic and reconstructive surgery procedure, and it is estimated that 2.2 million breast augmentations were performed worldwide in 2023. Silicone implants are widely used for cosmetic and reconstructive purposes because of the presumed benign nature of the substance and its lack of immunogenicity. Safety of silicone implants became a concern after the first case of silicone pneumonitis reported in 1976. Concerns about their safety are rising as the prevalence of all-type complications (auto-immune diseases, hypersensitivity reactions, granulomas, lymphadenopathy) is approximately 20%, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The actual incidence of pulmonary silicone pneumonitis is unknown. The main pulmonary vascular complication is acute or chronic pulmonary silicone particles embolization.

The majority of pulmonary complications associated with silicone injection are due to acute pulmonary silicone embolism. This rare but well-known entity occurs within 72 hours of the injection of subcutaneous liquid silicone, which is currently prohibited by the FDA.

CPSE is even rarer and occurs years after implants' insertion, most often in patients with a history of prosthetic rupture, as in our patient's case. The prevalence of CPSE in women with breast augmentation is unknown. These pulmonary complications are a real diagnostic challenge since the clinical and radiological manifestations occur years after initial implantation and diagnosis is often delayed. The clinical presentation (dyspnoea, cough and possibly fever) is not specific. In most cases, infectious pneumonia is first suspected, and silicone pneumonitis is later considered after several courses of antibiotics and multiple investigations. Imaging often reveals diffuse ground-glass opacities with condensations, also opening the way to a broad differential diagnosis, including infections and organising pneumonia. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of silicone surrounded by inflammation on lung biopsy.

Diagnostic thresholds and confidence categories for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) state that test thresholds are ∼ 51% for low-confidence or ∼ 70% for high-confidence and treatment thresholds are ∼ 69% for low-confidence or ∼ 89% for high-confidence, and these are a function of test properties, prognosis, and treatment; when considering VATS for suspected nonfibrotic provisional cases, the test threshold may be higher because of invasiveness and risks, and clinicians may choose to monitor a patient closely and treat empirically after MDD. To standardize confidence levels, the terms typical-HP, compatible-HP, or indeterminate-HP are used, and per this diagnostic approach a confident diagnosis of HP is made when there is an identifiable exposure and CT findings are typical of HP.

### Efficacy of treatment with corticosteroids for fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis: a propensity score-matched cohort analysis [^1148N3h9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an immune-mediated lung disease caused by repeated exposure to a sensitized antigen. HP is traditionally classified as acute or chronic. Currently, the classification is described more specifically as nonfibrotic HP or fibrotic HP, given the clinical-radiologic-pathologic correlation that is linked to clinical outcomes. Compared with nonfibrotic HP, which has a favorable prognosis, the clinical behavior of fibrotic HP may mimic that of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, resulting in high mortality.

Corticosteroids serve as the main pharmacological treatment for fibrotic HP. Given the pathogenesis of HP as an immune-mediated disease, corticosteroids as anti-inflammatory agents are a reasonable treatment option. However, the evidence guiding treatment for fibrotic HP with corticosteroids is still based on observational data and expert opinions. The effectiveness of corticosteroids has been reported only for the treatment of acute farmer's lung. A recent report regarding the effectiveness of corticosteroids for the treatment of fibrotic HP failed to demonstrate clinical benefits with regard to pulmonary function and survival in patients treated with corticosteroids compared with untreated patients. In that study, differences in the underlying characteristics between the treated and untreated groups may have affected the comparison of treatment outcomes. It remains unclear whether corticosteroids change the clinical course of fibrotic HP.

Therefore, this study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of treatment for fibrotic HP with corticosteroids by matching the baseline characteristics of patients treated and not treated with corticosteroids and comparing the clinical outcomes. We aimed to identify the patients with fibrotic HP who could benefit from treatment with corticosteroids.

### Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in adults. An official ATS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^114nxMnm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Definition

HP is an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease affecting the lung parenchyma and small airways. It typically results from an immune-mediated reaction provoked by an overt or occult inhaled antigen in susceptible individuals.

HP was historically termed "extrinsic allergic alveolitis" and categorized as acute, subacute, or chronic. However, these categories are not easily demarcated, and their delineation has been variable and arbitrary in many studies. Because the presence of radiographic or histopathological fibrosis is the primary determinant of prognosis (,–), the guideline committee decided unanimously to categorize HP as either fibrotic (i.e. mixed inflammatory plus fibrotic or purely fibrotic) or nonfibrotic (i.e. purely inflammatory), given the greater clinical utility of this stratification. Some patients may have mixed features; in such circumstances, the categorization is determined by the predominance of features.

Although HP is characteristically associated with an inhaled antigen, exposures may not be identified, despite a thorough evaluation in patients with otherwise typical features of HP (some experts have used the term "cryptogenic HP" or "HP of undetermined cause"). It is unknown whether these situations represent unidentified exposure or whether these patients instead have features of HP that are primarily due to an independent, intrinsic/primary process. Although virtually all diseases occur in "susceptible individuals", this phrase was included in the definition of HP to emphasize the critical importance of sensitization in the pathogenesis of HP.

### Guidelines or guidance for better idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis management? [^114AtRGF]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Evidence-based guidelines summarize the available evidence using a comprehensive literature research approach and provide unbiased recommendations reflecting this evidence. However, this emphasis on methodology eventually results in a lack of practicability and guidance in areas with a dearth of evidence. The empirical approach based on expert advice can provide guidance, especially in areas with little or no formal evidence, but is vulnerable to biased recommendations. Thus, both approaches may adversely affect patients. A synthesis of these potentially complementary approaches seems appropriate to provide optimal guidance in the treatment of all patients.

Conclusions

This single-center study demonstrated that corticosteroids may favorably alter the clinical course of fibrotic HP in a population without extensive fibrosis. Patients with an early stage of fibrotic HP with observed fibrotic progression may benefit from treatment with corticosteroids in terms of survival and fibrotic progression. We believe these findings will serve as a guide for the initiation of treatment with corticosteroids in clinical practice.

### Phenotypic subtypes of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis identified by machine learning consensus clustering analysis [^1121yRm4]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

As discussed, cluster analysis not only identifies distinctive presenting characteristics inherent to a particular group but may also derive guidance for tailoring appropriate treatment according to associated disease progression or survival outcome. Our study found that patients in Cluster 2 had more favorable outcomes with nearly 30% abstaining from any medical treatment. In contrast, patients in Cluster 3 experienced worse survival despite nearly all receiving initial corticosteroids and half going on to long-term steroid-sparing agents. The earlier use of antifibrotics when meeting criteria for progressive pulmonary fibrosis (as suggested for Cluster 3) may be an appropriate treatment strategy.

Our study has several limitations. First, selection bias is possible with the use of a single tertiary referral center and patients evaluated over a decade or more of clinical experience. Despite the systematic use of recent international consensus criteria to align diagnostic uncertainty, historical practices and their evolution over time may limit the availability of all clinical parameters. Original multidisciplinary team discussions were not documented for all patients; however, extensive clinical, HRCT, and pathological reports were available for defining diagnostic confidence levels according to the 2020 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guideline. Excluded patients who did not have baseline PFTs (N = 41) were also younger with a higher proportion of 'definite' HP diagnostic confidence levels (supplement Table S1), which might impact the current analyses if included. While a broad range of clinical variables were included in the cluster analysis, there may still be unaccounted or unknown factors that may impact or change current phenotypic characterizations, including timing of symptom onset. Finally, an all-cause mortality endpoint may not entirely represent the direct impact of disease progression from f-HP but contribution from other unrelated comorbidities or complications. We attempted to account for this with the inclusion of selected comorbidities in the clustering model, of which none appeared to be distinguishing.

### Spectrum of chronic complications related to silicone leakage and migration [^113o9yQy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Medical silicone is widely used as implants and free injections, but the spectrum of complications related to migration or embolization of silicone remains unclear.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 79 patients with silicone migration as confirmed on pathology between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2016. The presenting clinical and imaging features, diagnostic testing, treatment, and outcome were assessed.

Results

Nearly all patients were women, and 43% had a history of breast cancer. Sixty-three cases (80%) consisted of localized silicone granulomas, including 1 patient who developed severe hypercalcemia related to the granulomatous reaction. The remaining 16 cases (20%) involved migration of silicone to regional lymph nodes or distant tissue and included 1 case of chronic silicone pneumonitis. These complications were detected many years (median, 22 years; range, 1–40 years) after initial silicone placement. Only magnetic resonance imaging, dual-energy computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography demonstrated specificity for detection of silicone in lymph nodes and soft tissues. Other modalities including positron emission tomography, single-energy CT, and mammography detected only nonspecific abnormalities. Excisional biopsy of symptomatic lymphadenopathy or masses usually led to resolution of symptoms. The patient with silicone pneumonitis improved with corticosteroid therapy.

Conclusions

Chronic complications related to silicone extravasation and migration can present with local or distant manifestations, typically encountered many years after the original silicone placement. Magnetic resonance imaging, dual-energy CT, and ultrasonography are helpful for noninvasive diagnosis.

ATS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline — diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in adults — classified hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) into nonfibrotic and fibrotic phenotypes and set specific diagnostic suggestions. The need for a thorough history and a validated questionnaire to identify potential exposures was agreed on, and serum IgG testing against potential antigens associated with HP was suggested to identify potential exposures. For patients with nonfibrotic HP, a recommendation was made in favor of obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for lymphocyte cellular analysis, and suggestions for transbronchial lung biopsy and surgical lung biopsy were also made. For patients with fibrotic HP, suggestions were made in favor of obtaining BAL for lymphocyte cellular analysis, transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, and surgical lung biopsy. Diagnostic criteria were established, and a diagnostic algorithm was created by expert consensus.

How to Use These Guidelines

There are many similarities in the initial presentation of patients with fibrotic ILD. This similarity lends itself to the question, "When should clinicians use these guidelines and when should they use the 2018 ATS/European Respiratory Society (ERS)/JRS/ALAT guidelines on the diagnosis of IPF ?" because both guidelines address patients with newly identified fibrotic ILD.

Most patients with fibrotic ILD present with an insidious onset of cough, exertional dyspnea, and bibasilar crackles with radiological evidence of fibrosis in lower lobes. Both CPGs are applicable to such patients. Additional history is the first step in evaluating such patients and is essential to deciding which guideline to follow. If the patient has a potential culprit exposure, this CPG should be followed, which means that the initial steps include a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan and BAL fluid lymphocyte cellular analysis, followed by a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD). If the patient has no culprit exposures and is a male former smoker > 60 years old, the 2018 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines on the diagnosis of IPF should be followed, which means that the initial steps include an HRCT scan followed by an MDD. For all other patients with newly identified fibrotic ILD, the decision of which CPG to initially follow should be made on a case-by-case basis. Regardless of which CPG is followed, the initial steps are similar, and ongoing diagnostic evaluation may be redirected on the basis of the MDD.

It should be emphasized that clinicians should apply the recommendations within this CPG in the clinical context of each individual patient, considering the patient's values and preferences, and should not consider any recommendations as mandates. No CPG or recommendation can consider all potential clinical circumstances.

Radiological Features

Chest HRCT Scanning Protocol

The scanning protocol for the evaluation of suspected HP is identical to the protocol described in the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT diagnosis-of-IPF guidelines (Table 3). It is based on high-resolution volumetric scanning of the chest, with special attention to the selection of parameters ensuring creation of motion-free images and adequate image quality at a reduced radiation dose. In both fibrotic and nonfibrotic HP, two series of images acquired in the supine position are obtained: one at deep inspiration and a second after prolonged expiration. All features of lung infiltration can be depicted on the inspiratory images, except for air trapping, which is an expiratory HRCT finding. Analysis of lung changes at expiration may increase diagnostic confidence in nonfibrotic HP and is necessary for better characterization of heterogeneous lung attenuation in both forms of the disease. Owing to the widespread distribution of lung changes in HP, a third acquisition in the prone position is usually not necessary. The optimal chest HRCT scan for characterizing HP should be a noncontrast examination, except in the context of acute respiratory decline, in which case CT angiography may be justified to detect acute pulmonary embolisms. CT angiography should be preceded by a noncontrast chest HRCT scan to detect new ground-glass changes that raise the probability of acute exacerbation in the absence of pulmonary embolisms.

Silicone breast implants are widely used for both cosmetic enhancement and reconstructive surgery, with millions of procedures performed globally each year. Despite their popularity, concerns regarding the long-term safety of silicone implants have emerged, including complications such as chronic pulmonary silicone embolism (CPSE). This condition, while rare, can develop years after implant rupture and removal, leading to significant respiratory issues that are often misdiagnosed.

CPSE presents a unique challenge for physicians, as its symptoms — including dyspnoea, cough and fever — are non-specific and may mimic other pulmonary diseases. The diagnosis is complicated further by the delayed onset of symptoms, often occurring years after the initial surgical procedure. This case underscores the importance of recognising the potential for silicone-related lung complications in patients with a history of breast implants, especially when conventional treatments fail.

The key message of this manuscript is the need for heightened awareness among clinicians regarding CPSE as a potential cause of respiratory disease in patients with a history of breast implants. Early consideration of this diagnosis may facilitate timely management and improve patient outcomes.

### Managing pulmonary toxicities associated with immunotherapy: a case discussion [^114vxrcX]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy has changed the field of oncology around the world with the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for a number of tumor types over the last 5years. However, immune-mediated adverse events can be challenging and difficult to treat, with one of the most dire consequences being immune-mediated pneumonitis. KEY POINTS: Rapid intervention and aggressive management for grade 3 or greater pneumonitisSlow taper of steroids and also recommend pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxisMonitor carefully for a pneumonitis flare with steroid taper, which can occur in the absence of resuming anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) [1], and do not resume anti-PD-1 therapy until completely off steroids and no clinical or radiologic evidence of recurrenceConsider observation without anti-PD-1 resumption-in this case, durable response was maintained even without resuming anti-PD-1 therapy.

### Study of silicone breast implant rupture and health in a… [^116x9uJn]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Protocol
- Three hundred and forty-four women with silicone gel breast implants responded to an FDA questionnaire in which they were asked whether they had persistent symptoms including joint pain, swelling, or stiffness; rash on the breast or chest; or fatigue.
- Women were also asked whether a doctor diagnosed them with any of a list of illnesses such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or other connective tissue disease not already listed.
- After the questionnaire was completed, women underwent a magnetic resonance imaging examination of their breasts to detect whether their current implants were intact or ruptured. The MRI examination can also tell whether silicone gel has leaked outside of the fibrous scar capsule that forms around the breast implant. Results.
- Women with MRI diagnosed breast implant rupture were no more likely than women with intact implants to report that they had either persistent symptoms or doctor-diagnosed illnesses that were listed.
- Women with MRI-diagnosed extracapsular silicone gel were 2. 8 times more likely to report that they had the soft tissue syndrome, fibromyalgia. This association remained statistically significant after taking into account other factors including whether women thought their implants were ruptured, implant age, and implant manufacturer. Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.
- Women with MRI-diagnosed extracapsular silicone gel were 2. 7 times more likely to report that they had "other connective tissue disease, " a category that included a diverse group of illnesses such as dermatomyositis, polymositis, and mixed connective tissue disease.

This association did not remain statistically significant after taking into account other factors including whether women thought their implants were ruptured, implant age, and implant manufacturer. Strengths of this Study This is the first study in which the status of all women's breast implants, with respect to rupture, has been known. Conclusions The data suggest an association between extracapsular silicone gel and fibromyalgia. If other studies are consistent with these findings, women should be informed of the potential risk of developing fibromyalgia if their breast implants rupture and silicone gel escapes the fibrous scar capsule.

The pathophysiological hypothesis of silicone pneumonitis is the migration of microdroplets through the blood and lymphatic circulation to the lungs, creating inflammation around foreign bodies, mimicking interstitial lung disease. The histo-pathological features are clear, non-birefringent globules characteristic of silicone emboli, silicone plaques or translucent vacuolated globular deposits of silicone. In our case, histo-pathological examination showed a foreign body type gigantocellular reaction, partly on the material of exogenous, globular, transparent appearance suggesting silicone, consistent with findings in the literature (figure 3).

The diagnosis of silicone pneumonitis can easily be missed. The distribution of silicone in the lung is probably not homogeneous, and biopsy may reveal only an aspecific inflammatory reaction, which would be classified as idiopathic fibrosis. We believe that this diagnosis should be considered in patients with a history of prosthesis presenting with unclear pulmonary disease.

Treatment is based on corticosteroid therapy and ventilatory support with oxygen therapy when necessary. In most cases described in the literature, the silicone implants have been removed, with no improvement in symptoms due to the irreversible fibrotic process that had set in.

Patient's perspective

So first I had breast cancer, which left me devastated and tired, and for which I had a long course of treatment and surgery. Then I was hospitalised for pneumonia.

I couldn't eat, I was breathless without getting out of bed and I couldn't make any effort, I even needed oxygen to breathe. First, I had antibiotics, which had no effect on the illness.

I didn't know that the silicone in my implants could be the cause of my symptoms and my illness. I would have liked to have been warned of this risk when the prostheses were implanted. Nobody told me.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, more specifically with respect to lung biopsy, ALAT/ATS/JRS 2020 guidelines recommend to consider performing surgical lung biopsy after alternative diagnostic options have been exhausted in patients with newly identified ILD if differential diagnosis includes non-fibrotic or fibrotic HP.

Histopathological features of HP — Lung biopsy often plays a pivotal role in diagnosis. The findings that make a diagnosis of HP likely apply to both nonfibrotic (cellular) and fibrotic variants, differing by the presence or absence of a fibrotic pattern that may overlap histologically with fibrotic IPF. For nonfibrotic, or cellular, HP, a confident histopathological diagnosis requires typical features including: 1) a cellular interstitial pneumonia accentuated around small airways ("bronchiolocentric") with 2) a cellular chronic bronchiolitis, 3) a distinctive pattern of granulomatous inflammation, and 4) no histopathological features to suggest a more likely alternative.

CHEST grading system — Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence states that benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa; methodologic certainty is, "Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect", and the implication is, "Recommendation can apply to most patients in many circumstances. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect and may well change the estimate".
