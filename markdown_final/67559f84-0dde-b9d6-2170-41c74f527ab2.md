## Question

R side facial swelling and r ear pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating right-sided facial swelling with right ear pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate red flags and triage. Then, I should verify the focused history elements that separate emergent from urgent versus routine causes. Next, I will examine the physical exam priorities, including the ear, TMJ, parotid, oral cavity, and cranial nerves. After that, I need to construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and map it to initial testing. Finally, I will outline management pathways, follow-up checkpoints, and when to escalate to imaging or specialty referral, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines or high-quality evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm the red flags that mandate urgent evaluation: fever with toxicity, rapidly progressive swelling, trismus or severe jaw pain suggesting deep space infection, diplopia or ophthalmoplegia indicating orbital or cavernous sinus involvement, vesicles in the ear canal or on the face suggesting Ramsay Hunt, and focal neurologic deficits or severe headache raising concern for intracranial extension or vasculitis. I should not delay imaging or specialty input if any of these are present, as they change management and prognosis substantially [^65d2b5d4] [^7b5b22aa] [^95df07ac] [^88eec0fa].

> Wait, let me verify the key history elements I must elicit to narrow the differential: onset and tempo (hours to days versus weeks to months), pain quality and triggers (movement, chewing, touch), associated symptoms (fever, nasal obstruction, discharge, dental pain, visual changes, dysphagia, otalgia characteristics), recent infections or trauma, dental procedures, piercings, immunization status for mumps, and systemic features (weight loss, night sweats, arthralgias, rashes). I also need to ask about diabetes, immunocompromise, and travel or animal exposures that could shift pretest probabilities toward entities like malignant otitis externa, melioidosis, or Lyme disease [^749b773d] [^88eec0fa] [^f14427e5] [^8e440801].

> I will now examine the ear carefully, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: I should inspect the external auditory canal for edema, erythema, debris, granulation, vesicles, and whether the pinna is tender to pull or the tragus tender to push, because diffuse AOE typically shows canal edema/erythema with tragal/pinnal tenderness, whereas vesicles in the canal or on the pinna point toward herpes zoster oticus. If the canal is normal, I should consider secondary otalgia sources and remember that a normal ear exam with significant otalgia is a red flag for referred pain or serious disease [^07830105] [^9675d658] [^95df07ac].

> Next, I should review the face and TMJ: I need to palpate the TMJ for tenderness or crepitus with jaw motion, assess the parotid for swelling or pus at Stensen's duct, and examine the oral cavity for dental caries, periapical abscess, or pharyngeal infection that could refer pain to the ear. I should confirm whether the facial swelling is diffuse versus localized, whether it involves the preauricular area, cheek, or jaw, and whether there is warmth, erythema, or fluctuance suggesting abscess or cellulitis [^749b773d] [^c41db8d8].

> I need to check cranial nerves, especially facial nerve function, because acute unilateral facial weakness with ear pain raises concern for Bell's palsy versus Ramsay Hunt, and I should look for vesicles to distinguish them. Hyperacusis, taste disturbance, and decreased tearing support facial nerve involvement. If there is diplopia or lateral gaze palsy, I should consider Gradenigo's syndrome from petrous apex disease, and if there are multiple cranial neuropathies or nonresolving deficits, I should reconsider neoplastic or granulomatous etiologies and escalate imaging [^592a4238] [^95df07ac] [^7b5b22aa] [^280cfdab].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis in tiers. Emergent causes include deep space infection such as Ludwig's angina or infratemporal abscess, malignant external otitis in diabetics, Gradenigo's syndrome, and intracranial extension from otitis or sinusitis. Urgent causes include Ramsay Hunt, parotitis or parotid abscess, dental abscess with cellulitis, and early Bell's palsy. Routine but important considerations include TMJ disorders, AOE, sinusitis, relapsing polychondritis, and neoplasms such as parotid or nasopharyngeal tumors. I should double-check that each suspected entity aligns with the history and exam before committing to a pathway [^88eec0fa] [^7b5b22aa] [^95df07ac] [^38abaddf] [^b8ac1929].

> For initial testing, I should confirm that basic labs include CBC, inflammatory markers, and glucose, especially if malignant otitis externa or diabetes is suspected. If there is facial nerve palsy or atypical features, I should add Lyme serology in endemic areas. If there is parotid swelling, I should obtain mumps testing when appropriate. And if there is suspected deep space infection or nonresolving disease, I should obtain contrast-enhanced CT of the face and neck or MRI depending on the suspected compartment, reserving MRI for suspected intracranial, perineural, or skull base disease [^88eec0fa] [^8e440801] [^67931bb4] [^3b5f89e9].

> Hold on, I should verify management pathways by diagnosis. For diffuse AOE, topical fluoroquinolone drops with aural toilet are first-line and systemic therapy is reserved for severe disease or extension. For Ramsay Hunt, prompt acyclovir plus corticosteroids improves outcomes. For Bell's palsy, corticosteroids within 72 hours are standard, with antivirals considered controversial but commonly used. For malignant external otitis, aggressive antipseudomonal therapy and diabetes control are essential, with early ENT involvement. For abscess or deep space infection, surgical drainage and IV antibiotics are indicated. For TMJ disorders, conservative measures and dental referral are appropriate. For relapsing polychondritis, systemic corticosteroids are foundational. And for suspected neoplasm, urgent ENT referral and tissue diagnosis are critical [^07830105] [^95df07ac] [^01b725c2] [^88eec0fa] [^38abaddf] [^b8ac1929].

> I should confirm follow-up and safety-netting: for Bell's palsy, reassess at about 3 months and refer if recovery is incomplete or new neurologic findings emerge. For AOE, reassess in 48 to 72 hours to ensure improvement. For any patient with red flags or nonresolving symptoms, maintain a low threshold for imaging and specialty referral. I need to ensure eye care instructions for corneal protection in facial palsy and clear return precautions for worsening pain, fever, dysphagia, dyspnea, or visual changes [^38b99a2c] [^07830105].

> But wait, what if the ear exam is normal and the facial swelling is preauricular with pain on chewing? I should reconsider TMJ dysfunction, dental pathology, or even Eagle syndrome if there is limited mouth opening with lateralizing pain, and I should palpate the styloid region and obtain panoramic imaging if suspected. Conversely, if the swelling is fluctuant and tender in the parotid region with trismus, I should think parotitis or abscess and obtain ultrasound or contrast CT to evaluate for drainable collections and guide management [^7fd2d45f] [^749b773d].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, reference-aware approach: triage red flags first, anchor on history and exam to separate primary otalgia from secondary otalgia and local from systemic disease, use imaging selectively when the course is atypical or worsening, and apply diagnosis-specific therapies promptly while arranging appropriate follow-up and referrals. This balances the need to catch serious disease early without overtesting low-risk presentations [^749b773d] [^3b5f89e9] [^07830105].

Right-sided facial swelling with right ear pain most commonly reflects **otitis externa** or **otitis media** with extension to adjacent soft tissues, or **dental infection** causing secondary otalgia and facial cellulitis [^07830105] [^749b773d]. Other considerations include parotitis, TMJ disorders, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and malignancy. Immediate evaluation should include a focused ENT and dental exam, with **urgent imaging (contrast-enhanced CT)** if there is concern for deep space infection, abscess, or malignancy [^3b5f89e9]. Management is cause-specific: topical antibiotics for otitis externa, systemic antibiotics for cellulitis or otitis media, antivirals for Ramsay Hunt, and drainage for abscess; prompt treatment prevents complications such as mastoiditis, intracranial spread, or airway compromise [^07830105] [^88eec0fa].

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

- **History**: Onset, duration, pain characteristics, fever, dental pain, trauma, recent infections, immunization status, systemic symptoms.
- **Physical examination**: Inspect the ear canal and tympanic membrane, palpate the parotid gland, TMJ, and facial structures, assess cranial nerves (especially facial nerve), and perform an intraoral examination for dental pathology [^a988a6d6].

---

### Imaging studies

Order **contrast-enhanced CT** of the temporal bone, paranasal sinuses, and neck when deep space infection, abscess, mastoiditis, or malignancy is suspected [^3b5f89e9]. Use **MRI** for suspected intracranial extension, perineural spread, or soft tissue detail when CT is inconclusive or malignancy is suspected [^280cfdab].

---

### Laboratory tests

Obtain **CBC, ESR, and CRP** to assess inflammation or infection, and perform **mumps serology** if parotitis is suspected. In endemic areas, test for **Lyme disease** if facial palsy is present [^8e440801].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Otitis externa**: Topical antibiotics (ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin) with or without corticosteroids; ear canal cleaning and aural toilet [^notfound].
- **Otitis media**: Systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate); myringotomy if severe or refractory.
- **Mastoiditis**: Intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone or ampicillin-sulbactam); surgical intervention if abscess or bone involvement.
- **Parotitis**: Supportive care, hydration, analgesics; antibiotics if bacterial infection suspected.
- **Dental abscess**: Dental drainage, antibiotics, and dental follow-up.
- **Ramsay Hunt syndrome**: Acyclovir or valacyclovir plus corticosteroids [^95df07ac].
- **TMJ disorders**: Conservative management, NSAIDs, soft diet, dental referral.
- **Malignancy**: ENT referral, biopsy, oncologic management.

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or improperly managed conditions can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Intracranial extension**: Meningitis, brain abscess, venous sinus thrombosis.
- **Permanent facial nerve injury**: Facial paralysis, synkinesis.
- **Hearing loss**: Conductive or sensorineural.
- **Airway compromise**: Ludwig's angina, deep neck space infections.
- **Chronic infection**: Osteomyelitis, chronic otitis.

---

## Indications for urgent ENT consultation

Urgent ENT consultation is warranted for **severe or rapidly progressive swelling**, suspected deep space infection or abscess, facial nerve palsy, suspected malignancy, or failure of initial medical management [^b8ac1929].

---

Right-sided facial swelling with right ear pain has a broad differential, but **prompt, cause-directed evaluation and treatment** are essential to prevent serious complications. Use clinical assessment to guide imaging and labs, and escalate care when red flags are present.

### Relapsing polychondritis: an unusual cause of sore throat, painful ear swelling and bilateral costal margin pain [^38abaddf]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 54-year-old Chinese woman presented with a 3-month history of sore throat and dry cough, which was treated as chronic pharyngitis with minimal improvement. One month ago, she presented with painful right ear swelling without signs or symptoms of otitis media or otitis externa. She was treated with antibiotics and antiviral drugs without any improvement. Two weeks prior to her presentation to hospital, she developed bilateral costal margin pain with raised C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), mild chronic pharyngitis and painful right ear swelling. All other investigations including bloods and imaging were non-specific. Her painful right auricle swelling prompted the diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis (RP), which was supported by clinical improvement with high-dose corticosteroids. RP is a clinical diagnosis with non-specific inflammation of affected cartilage. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and early diagnosis can be made by the most common presenting feature of auricular chondritis.

Periorbital swelling is frequently encountered in ear, nose, and throat practices and, as it may be secondary to acute sinusitis, delayed diagnosis may lead to significant morbidity. We describe the case of a 24-year-old man with acute ethmoid-maxillary sinusitis and ipsilateral facial swelling particularly involving the periorbital area. We also discuss the workup that led to the formulation of an unusual diagnosis.

### A snotty nose: more than just a cold [^e5ae2b28]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Description

A healthy 3-year-old girl presented with a 5-day history of right-sided cheek and eye swelling and pain, associated with right-sided green nasal discharge. Examination revealed diffuse erythematous swelling around the right cheek, jawline and eye. Oral antibiotics for suspected periorbital cellulitis were ineffective. Blood inflammatory markers and ultrasound of her neck and parotid glands were normal. She was discharged as having viral parotitis. Antibiotics and nasal drops were later restarted for clinical sinusitis; however, she showed no improvement, now having 3 weeks of right-sided facial swelling with thick green and intermittently bloody nasal discharge. Further history revealed possible squint, mastication pain and breathing difficulty through the right nostril.

Cranial imaging (figure 1) demonstrated a large central but predominantly right-sided nasopharyngeal tumour, extending into the ethmoid sinuses and orbits (with medial recti distortion), infratemporal fossa and pterygoid muscles and anterior and middle cranial fossae. There was accompanying skull base destruction.

Figure 1
MRI axial T2-TSE (turbo spin echo) image showing the tumour filling the posterior nasal passages and nasopharynx which erodes the anterior border of the clivus and extends into the anterior right middle cranial fossa. There is extension into the right orbit distorting the medial rectus muscle.

Staging and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of non-metastatic parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (PM-RMS). Chemoradiotherapy ensued.

RMS is the most common type of childhood soft-tissue sarcoma, mainly affecting boys at 4–6 years of age. Approximately 20% of RMS are PM, involving sites around the meninges (eg, nasopharynx, middle ear). Symptoms are variable and correspond to the disease site. Pain may coexist.

Diagnosing and treating PM-RMS is challenging as it is poorly visualised and can invade critical structures. Although the PM site previously carried an unfavourable prognosis, advances in multimodality management have improved childhood survival rates.

Learning points

Clinicians should consider nasopharyngeal malignancy in persistent unilateral rhinorrhea, among other symptoms.
Para-meningeal rhabdomyosarcoma may invade critical facial and intracranial structures and hence diagnosis should not be delayed.

### Diagnosis of ear pain | AAFP… [^c41db8d8]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Common Causes of Ear Pain ABNORMAL EAR EXAMINATION Otitis externa generally leads to swelling and redness of the ear canal. There is often debris in the ear canal or covering the tympanic membrane. 8 Subtle otitis externa can be difficult to identify on inspection, but it usually causes tenderness when the examiner pulls on the auricle or presses on the tragus. NORMAL EAR EXAMINATION TMJ syndrome is characterized by pain and crepitus with talking or chewing, and tenderness or crepitus on palpation of the TMJ joint. 11 It causes ear pain, especially with chewing. 11 However, TMJ crepitus is prevalent, and its presence should not prematurely halt further investigation into other causes of otalgia.

1. Pharyngitis and tonsillitis often cause referred pain to the ear. In some patients with pharyngitis, ear pain can be the primary complaint even when the ear is normal.

Idiopathic otalgia is common, but patients and physicians can be uncomfortable with this diagnosis. Ramsay Hunt syndrome typically causes ear pain, facial paralysis, and vesicles in the external auditory canal. Other symptoms can include hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, taste disturbance, and decreased tearing. 15 The syndrome is caused by herpes zoster involving the geniculate ganglion, and it often involves cranial nerves V, IX, and X in addition to the facial nerve. Relapsing polychondritis is a systemic disease that involves cartilage. It can affect many organs, including the eyes, nose, heart, kidneys, and nervous system, but the most commonly affected organ is the ear. 17 Relapsing polychondritis often affects both ears, producing a red or violaceous auricle. Sparing of the earlobe, which lacks cartilage, helps distinguish auricular chondritis from cellulitis. It is diagnosed by its relapsing course and typical appearance.

2 Sphenopalatine neuralgia results in pain around the eye and nose in addition to the ear and mastoid. 2 Bell's palsy is characterized by the sudden onset of upper and lower facial paralysis. Postauricular pain occurs in about 25 percent of patients. 23 Patients may also have hyperacusis, taste disturbances, and decreased tearing.

Annotations to algorithm — symptoms suggestive of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) include listed prominent symptoms, and specific red flags require urgent evaluation. Prominent symptoms include nasal congestion, purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, facial or dental pain, headache, throat clearing, and cough. Any patient with orbital swelling or pain, swelling of the forehead, and/or diplopia should be urgently evaluated.

### Ear pain: diagnosing common and uncommon causes [^749b773d]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Otalgia (ear pain) is a common presentation in the primary care setting with many diverse causes. Pain that originates from the ear is called primary otalgia, and the most common causes are otitis media and otitis externa. Examination of the ear usually reveals abnormal findings in patients with primary otalgia. Pain that originates outside the ear is called secondary otalgia, and the etiology can be difficult to establish because of the complex innervation of the ear. The most common causes of secondary otalgia include temporomandibular joint syndrome and dental infections. Primary otalgia is more common in children, whereas secondary otalgia is more common in adults. History and physical examination usually lead to the underlying cause; however, if the diagnosis is not immediately clear, a trial of symptomatic treatment, imaging studies, and consultation may be reasonable options. Otalgia may be the only presenting symptom in several serious conditions, such as temporal arteritis and malignant neoplasms. When risk factors for malignancy are present (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, diabetes mellitus, age 50 years or older), computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or otolaryngology consultation may be warranted.

### Nasion swelling as the presenting symptom of lung adenocarcinoma [^27f6fed1]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Metastasis to the paranasal sinuses from lung cancer is extremely rare. Here, we reported a patient of lung adenocarcinoma presenting with nasion swelling because of metastasis to the paranasal sinuses. A review of the literature from 1966 to 2008 yielded another 15 patients. Adenocarcinoma was the most commonly encountered histologic subtype, and modern combination chemotherapy was probably the most effective treatment modality. Headache, visual disturbance, facial mass, and facial pain were the symptoms frequently associated with paranasal sinus metastasis; however, all of them were nonspecific for a metastatic tumor. A thorough history taking, ear, nose, and throat examination, and laboratory investigations are of paramount importance to achieve a correct diagnosis.

### Facial swelling for the emergency radiologist-typical and atypical causes [^3b5f89e9]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and cystic lesions which may lead patients to seek acute care for facial swelling. Computed tomography (CT) has become the mainstay for imaging in the urgent/emergent setting. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also serve as a powerful problem solving tool in the modern era. As volume continues to increase, a wide variety of facial pathology will be encountered by the emergency radiologist. Recognition of both common and uncommon pathology will assist in diagnosis and value-based care. This article serves as an image-rich review of the many causes of facial swelling with an emphasis on key imaging findings and possible complications.

### Luc's abscess and temporomandibular joint septic arthritis: two rare sequelae of acute otitis media [^94fecccf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

A 5-year-old previously healthy child presented with right-sided otalgia, right facial and temporal swelling, and right jaw pain in the setting of 6 days of low-grade fever. The child had no trauma, vomiting, or prior dental treatments. On physical examination, the patient had facial swelling, erythema, and tenderness over the right temporal region along with trismus, as well as pain on palpation of the right temporomandibular joint (TMJ). A computed tomography scan revealed otitis media, Luc's abscess, and TMJ septic arthritis requiring surgical drainage and intravenous antibiotics. The patient responded well to treatment and recovered without sequelae. Dr. Cardwell Luc first described Luc's abscess in 1913 as a rare complication of middle ear infection leading to an abscess in the infratemporal space. To our knowledge, our case is the first documented case of concurrent Luc's abscess and TMJ septic arthritis in a previously healthy child as complications of acute otitis media. This case highlights 2 rare complications of a common medical condition that pediatric emergency care providers should recognize due to the need for surgical intervention, without which there may be longstanding sequelae.

### Ramsay hunt syndrome type II [^95df07ac]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old man developed 3 days of left facial pain and swelling with left-sided hearing loss followed by a painful, unilateral, erythematous, and vesicular rash on the left anterior two-thirds of the tongue, external auditory canal, lip, and face typical of varicella-zoster virus reactivation (figure). Reactivation in the geniculate ganglion or facial nerve is uncommon and typically causes tongue and auricular lesions or facial palsy and was described by Hunt in 1907.(1) The patient received IV acyclovir and oral prednisone with rapid improvement in pain and resolution of lesions and improvement of hearing over 1 month.

### Otolaryngology fantastica: the ear, nose, and throat manifestations of Munchausen's syndrome [^3e437f49]. The Laryngoscope (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Munchausen's syndrome (MS) is a form of severe, chronic, factitious disorder with physical symptoms. Some essential features define MS, such as recurrent, feigned, or simulated illness; peregrination (traveling or wandering); pseudologia fantastica; and drug abuse. Munchausen's syndrome by proxy (MSBP) classically involves a parent or other caregiver who inflicts injury or induces illness in a child. The aim of the present study was to summarize and study the main ear, nose, and throat (ENT) manifestations of MS and MSBP.

Study Design

A systematic literature review carried out in a tertiary university referral center.

Methods

An appropriate string was run on PubMed to retrieve articles dealing with ENT manifestations of MS and MSBP. A double cross-check was performed on citations and full-text articles found using selected inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results

In total, 24 articles were finally included in the study, describing 30 cases of MS or MSBP involving the ENT region; 15/30 (50%) cases involved the face, most often presenting as facial pain or facial swelling; and 7/30 (23.3%) cases presented with symptoms involving the ear. Six cases out of 30 (20%) were MSBP.

Conclusions

MS and MSBP may present with symptoms involving the head and neck area, particularly the face and external ear canal. The ENT specialist should suspect MS in patients with strange and long-lasting symptoms, so as to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatments that waste time and money in the healthcare sector.

### Disseminated melioidosis in the head and neck [^f14427e5]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 35-year-old man was admitted to an intensive care unit with unilateral facial swelling and septic shock after multiple presentations to the emergency department with non-specific unilateral pain over the parotid area. A CT scan of his neck showed diffuse right-sided facial soft tissue infection, mastoid effusion and temporal lobe cerebritis. The upper lobes of his lungs had cannonball lesions that were suggestive of septic lung metastases. Blood cultures and ear canal swabs were positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei The temporal lobe cerebritis eventually developed into an abscess, necessitating a cortical mastoidectomy, craniectomy and temporal lobectomy. After the surgical interventions, antibiotic therapy was continued for a further 6months. The patient remained well and had no signs of recurrence up to 7months after the initial presentation.

### Facial extention of ear pathology: infected cholesteatoma causing a parotid abscess [^6a72c95c]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A man in his early 30s presented with right-sided preauricular swelling and facial oedema. He had a history of acid injury to his right ear as a child resulting in pinna deformity and subsequent blind sac closure of the external auditory canal. Imaging showed abnormal ear anatomy and abnormal density of the right parotid gland. Antibiotic therapy prevented progression but did not resolve the symptoms. Therefore, the infected area was surgically drained. This showed an underlying cholesteatoma, a benign but locally destructive condition where keratinising squamous epithelium grows in the middle ear and mastoid. The infected region was drained and the cholesteatoma was excised. This led to full resolution of the infection. The patient is awaiting a follow-up diffusion-weighted MRI. This case was unusual as the disease had extended beyond the ear and we therefore wish to alert clinicians to cholesteatoma as a possible cause of facial swelling.

### Gradenigo's syndrome [^a2e309a6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The syndrome of constant otorrhea, headache, and diplopia, which is attributed to inflammation of the petrous apex, is known as Gradenigo's syndrome. It is often the result of chronic otitis media with long-standing purulent otorrhea. It has traditionally been treated surgically, but recent advances in imaging, allied with improved antibiotic treatment, have allowed for consideration of non-surgical management of these cases. A 60-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 7 days of right-sided headache, facial pain, and diplopia. She awoke with the headache and facial pain 7 days earlier. She was without any preceding infectious symptoms including ear pain, sinus congestion, sore throat, and cough, and she denied fevers and chills. Examination demonstrated a right eye lateral gaze palsy and reproducible diplopia. Computed tomography studies demonstrated the possibility of fluid in the petrous apex of the temporal bone. A follow-up magnetic resonance imaging study confirmed a moderate amount of fluid in the right petrous apex consistent with Gradenigo's syndrome. Imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance is an important tool in the evaluation of petrous apex lesions. Gradenigo's syndrome is a rare condition that does not always present with the classical triad of otorrhea, headache, and diplopia. Appropriate management requires antibiotic treatment and possible surgical intervention.

### Rare encounter: facial vein thrombosis and thrombophlebitis as a complication of acute submandibular sialadenitis [^5019643d]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Thrombosis and thrombophlebitis of the facial vein represent exceptionally rare diagnoses, particularly when occurring as complications of acute sialadenitis of the submandibular gland. This case report details the experience of a middle-aged man initially presenting at a tertiary care ear, nose and throat department with right submandibular gland sialadenitis. Despite initiating outpatient treatment involving oral antibiotics and sialagogues, the patient returned after a week with persistent and worsening pain, accompanied by swelling of the right submandibular gland and cheek. Using ultrasound, the accurate diagnosis was promptly identified, revealing thrombosis in the facial vein. The patient underwent a comprehensive treatment regimen involving anticoagulation and intravenous antibiotics. With a subsequent reduction in pain and swelling, the patient was discharged, continuing oral anticoagulation and antibiotics. Outpatient follow-up revealed a complete recovery 3weeks later. This case underscores the importance of timely and precise diagnostic measures in managing rare complications associated with sialadenitis.

### Red ear syndrome: a review of all published cases (1996–2010) [^482e9fd5]. Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Red ear syndrome is characterised by episodic unilateral erythema of the ear associated with pain and burning sensation.

Patients and Methods

We describe the case of a young woman with daily, frequent, recurrent episodes of red ear syndrome in the absence of any structural lesions, primary headache disorder or obvious triggers. We review all previously described cases and discuss postulated mechanisms for this syndrome.

Conclusions

The exact cause of this rare headache disorder remains unknown and treatment options vary considerably.

### Temporary resolution of hemicrania continua following ipsilateral ear piercing [^50aa47b1]. BMJ Neurology Open (2021). High credibility.

Case report

A 30-year-old female patient was referred to a neurology clinic for refractory headache since the age of 16 consisting of a burning sensation over the periorbital region extending posteriorly across the scalp. The pain was exclusively left sided with sharp demarcation at the midline, and which she described as 'splitting her head down the middle'. Her headache was constant but punctuated by severe exacerbations lasting from days to weeks with an average frequency of four exacerbations per month. There was no light or sound sensitivity, but she reported a 'droopy' left eyelid, periorbital swelling and rhinorrhoea during exacerbations. The patient provided written informed consent to publish her case.

The patient's headaches did not respond to acute therapy with paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including ibuprofen up to 800 mg daily and celecoxib 400 mg daily) or aspirin 800 mg. She used regular propranolol 20 mg two times per day over many years for migraine prophylaxis, which was ineffective. The headaches profoundly disrupted the patient's quality of life, and she was unemployed at the time of review. She lived in a regional setting with limited specialist access and had never previously seen a neurologist.

The patient had no other medical history and her only regular medication was propranolol. Her mother suffered from migraine without aura, but no first-degree relatives experienced headaches with similar characteristics to the patient. Cranial nerve, funduscopy and upper and lower limb neurological examinations were normal. An MRI of the brain and angiogram did not demonstrate any cerebral or vascular abnormalities. After researching alternative treatment options for migraine, the patient underwent Daith piercing of the left ear 12 months before neurology review. She noticed a rapid and dramatic symptom improvement: her severe exacerbations resolved and her background pain improved to the extent that she did not require analgesia for a 2-month period. Due to this therapeutic response, the patient then elected to undergo Daith piercing of the right ear, which provided no symptom benefit.

### Unilateral facial paralysis caused by ramsay hunt syndrome [^0b169e06]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a rare disease caused by an infection of the geniculate ganglion by the varicella-zoster virus. The main clinical features of the syndrome are as follows: Bell palsy unilateral or bilateral, vesicular eruptions on the ears, ear pain, dizziness, preauricular swelling, tingling, tearing, loss of taste sensation, and nystagmus. We describe a 23-year-old white woman, who presented with facial paralysis on the left side of the face, pain, fever, ear pain, and swelling in the neck and auricular region on the left side. She received appropriate treatment with acyclovir, vitamin B complex, and CMP nucleus. After 30 days after presentation, the patient did not show any signs or symptoms of the syndrome. At follow-up at 1 year, she showed no relapse of the syndrome.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^280cfdab]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — imaging indications and modality: Routine imaging at the time of initial diagnosis is discouraged, but there is a distinct role for imaging when suggestive history or physical findings are present or if paralysis fails to recover or worsens; any presentation inconsistent with Bell's palsy should be further evaluated by imaging. Features atypical of Bell's palsy include a second paralysis on the same side, paralysis of isolated facial nerve branches, other cranial nerve involvement, or no sign of recovery after 3 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire facial nerve course, with and without contrast, is the imaging test of choice in these circumstances; imaging should include the internal auditory canal (IAC) and face, and if MRI is contraindicated, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) can be used.

### Secondary otalgia: referred pain pathways and pathologies [^51733141]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Otalgia is very common, and when the cause of ear pain is not identified on otoscopy and physical examination, cross-sectional imaging is routinely used to evaluate for potential sources of referred ear pain (secondary otalgia). Innervation of the ear structures is complex, involving multiple upper cervical, lower cranial, and peripheral nerves, which transit and innervate a large anatomic territory involving the brain, spine, skull base, aerodigestive tract, salivary glands, paranasal sinuses, face, orbits, deep spaces of the neck, skin, and viscera. Interpreting radiologists must be familiar with these neural pathways and potential sources of secondary otalgia. The purposes of this review are to detail the currently proposed mechanisms of referred ear pain, review the salient neuroanatomy of the complex pathways responsible for secondary otalgia, highlight important benign and malignant etiologies of referred ear pain, and provide a structured search pattern for approaching these challenging cases on cross-sectional imaging.

### Bell palsy: rapid evidence review [^592a4238]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Bell's palsy:

- **Definition**: Bell's palsy, also known as idiopathic facial paralysis, is an acute-onset, isolated, unilateral, lower motor neurone facial weakness/paralysis.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown; however, reactivation of herpes virus at the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve has been postulated.
- **Disease course**: The likely vascular distension, inflammation, and edema with ischemia of the facial nerve results in Bell's palsy, which presents with clinical manifestations of unilateral weakness/paralysis of upper and lower facial muscles, drooping of ipsilateral eyelids, dry eye due to inability to close eyes completely, epiphora, drooping of the corner of the mouth, ipsilateral impaired/loss of taste sensation, difficulty in eating, dribbling of saliva, altered sensation on the affected side of the face, pain in or behind the ear, hyperacusis on the affected side if stapedius muscle is involved. Spontaneous complete recovery occurs in 70–75% of untreated patients.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Bell's palsy is not associated with an increased risk of mortality.

### Granulomatosis with polyangiitis presenting with unilateral facial nerve palsy and nasal septum perforation [^08fe24e6]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 17-year-old female patient with a known case of bronchial asthma was admitted to the Department of Neurology, King Saud Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for an acute onset of seizure and headache that persisted for 5 days. Brain CT revealed no abnormality, and anti-epileptic agents were started. The doctors consulted the Department of Rheumatology because the patient had a history of joint pain and skin rash.

The patient's history was retrospectively explored. She further reported the following findings: history of fatigue, right-side facial palsy and right lower limb numbness for approximately 1 year; history of runny nose, nasal ulcers, epistaxis, tinnitus and unilateral right ear pain with a yellowish discharge for the last 6 months; history of productive cough with yellowish sputum and haemoptysis on one occasion and no fever or chest pain during the last 6 months; 7% weight loss (body mass index = 28) and poor appetite over the last 6 months; history of haematuria for the last 2 months and history of multiple joint pain involving the hips, knees and small joints of the hands associated with skin rash over the dorsum of the right foot. There was no family history of similar condition or any hereditary disease. Social history revealed that she is single, living with her family with good socioeconomic status, good academic performance and no history of smoking, alcohol or any substances abuse.

### Melkersson-rosenthal syndrome: recurrent facial swelling and food refusal [^d96c29a9]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis of MRS is extensive, including other causes of facial palsy; idiopathic, congenital (eg, Moebius syndrome, hemifacial microsomia), infection (eg, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, otitis media, mycobacterial infections), autoimmune (eg, Guillain-Barré), neoplastic, iatrogenic; as well as causes of orofacial oedema (angioedema, allergy, atopy, infections, rheumatological). Investigations should be targeted to exclude differential diagnoses and may include otorhinolaryngological evaluation, neuroimaging and histological examination. In the absence of the characteristic triad, the presence of two of the classical features is sufficient to make a diagnosis once other possible differentials have been excluded. In its monosymptomatic form, a mucocutaneous biopsy identifying a non-caseating granuloma is diagnostic.

Differential diagnosis for an antalgic gait in the paediatric population is broad and includes transient synovitis, myositis, bacterial infections (septic arthritis, osteomyelitis), oncological causes, trauma including non-accidental injury and referred pain. In this case, the antalgic gait resolved during the initial overnight admission and did not recur. An aetiological diagnosis was not achieved.

In the case discussed, the presence of the pathognomonic triad of features (recurrent facial palsy with orofacial swelling and a fissured tongue) led to a diagnosis of MRS on the fourth presentation.

### Sinogenic facial pain: diagnosis and management [^e742f916]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Most patients who present to an otorhinolaryngology clinic with facial pain and headaches believe they have sinusitis. There is an increasing awareness that neurologic causes are responsible for a large proportion of patients with headache and facial pain. If facial pain and pressure is the primary symptom, it is unlikely to be caused by sinus disease in the absence of any nasal symptoms or signs. Patients with facial pain who have no objective evidence of sinus disease are unlikely to be helped by surgery. Most patients with pain caused by sinusitis respond to medical therapy.

### Malignant melanoma of the middle ear: case report [^c536cdf8]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

We present a case of malignant melanoma in the middle ear in a 63-year-old woman who presented with severe pain on the right side of her face and head, tinnitus, photophobia, and hemorrhagic discharge from the right ear, as well as right facial nerve paralysis. After more than two years of conservative treatment for otitis media and sclerotic mastoiditis, a pathologically enlarged lymph node on the right side of the neck appears. It is removed, and the histopathological examination reveals that it is metastatic malignant melanoma. Imaging examinations reveal a tumoral lesion in the middle ear with bone infiltration. The right middle ear is operated on, and the tissue sent for testing reveals melanoma. The patient was treated with Nivolumab after the operation and is now in sustainably good condition.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^07830105]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Statement 1 — differential diagnosis for acute otitis externa (AOE) specifies that clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal, with a Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over risk; the action statement profile lists aggregate evidence quality Grade C observational studies and Grade D reasoning from first principles, level of confidence in evidence high, benefit improved diagnostic accuracy, risks/harms/costs none in following the recommended action, benefits-harm assessment preponderance of benefit over harm, value judgments importance of accurate diagnosis, intentional vagueness none, role of patient preferences none regarding the need for a proper diagnosis, and exceptions none. Supporting text notes symptoms including otalgia (70%), itching (60%), or fullness (22%), with or without hearing loss (32%) or ear canal pain on chewing; identifies a hallmark sign of diffuse AOE as tenderness of the tragus when pushed and the pinna when pulled, or both; and states that otoscopy will reveal diffuse ear canal edema, erythema, or both, with or without otorrhea, and material in the ear canal. It also warns that AOE can mimic the appearance of acute otitis media (AOM) and emphasizes that distinguishing AOE from AOM is important because the latter may require systemic antimicrobials.

### Extranodal natural killer / T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, of the orbit mimicking recurrent orbital cellulitis [^e2345b14]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is a rare type of lymphoma that is endemic to East Asia and parts of Central and South America. Most patients present with nasal obstruction, sinusitis, ulcer, and epistaxis due to a destructive mass involving the midline facial tissues. The patient visited our clinic approximately 1 year ago; she had right-sided orbital swelling and pain. The patient was sent to the department of ear, nose, and throat (ENT), and computed tomographic scan was performed. Computed tomographic imaging showed a soft tissue density in the right frontal, maxillary, and ethmoidal sinus and demonstrated fungal sinusitis in the right maxillary sinus. Then, she underwent the operation at ENT; her symptoms seemed to have disappeared. After 6 months, however, she had visited our clinic again because of a left-sided orbital cellulitis that seemed to be similar to the previous right-sided symptoms 1 year ago. She received treatments immediately and the operation again at ENT. In addition, a biopsy of left ethmoid sinus tissue was performed. The biopsy result revealed "chronic inflammation". However, unfortunately, the patient had a relapse of almost the same symptoms in a month. An excisional biopsy was performed for histopathologic diagnosis again. The left ethmoid sinus biopsy results were consistent with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. The patient then transferred her care to the department of internal medicine for chemotherapy. The authors demonstrate how the progressive-staging extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma can present in a similar fashion as a recurrent orbital cellulitis.

### Rosai-dorfman as a clinical mimicker of relapsing polychondritis [^89a55e2c]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 49-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of pain and swelling of the cartilaginous portion of the ears, swelling of the nasal bridge, and dyspnea. Medications included oral methotrexate 20 mg weekly and mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily for presumed relapsing polychondritis. Examination was notable for bilateral swelling of the ear helices, with overlying red-brown nodules, nasal bridge swelling, and mild stridor (Fig 1). Because of the unusual clinical presentation, a punch biopsy from an ear nodule was obtained, which showed a nodular to diffuse infiltrate of vacuolated S100-positive histiocytes demonstrating emperipolesis with admixed lymphocytes and plasma cells (Fig 2). Stain results for mycobacteria, fungi, and bacteria were negative. Thus, a diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease was rendered. Given the patient's radiographic findings and respiratory symptoms, a systemic evaluation was pursued. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography demonstrated low-level hypermetabolism of the ears, as well as of pleural-based nodules, periaortic soft tissues, and the right side of the maxillary sinus, suspicious for additional sites of disease involvement. The patient underwent removal of a subglottic nodule of Rosai-Dorfman disease partially obstructing her airway, with significant improvement of her breathing and resolution of inspiratory stridor (Fig 3). In considering further treatment, the UCSF 500 Cancer Gene Panel was completed to assess for any targetable mutations; this was unrevealing. Mycophenolate was discontinued and methotrexate was increased to 25 mg subcutaneous weekly, with resultant decreased swelling of the nasal bridge and pinnae.

### Eagle syndrome: an unusual cause limited mouth opening and surgical management [^7fd2d45f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome, defined "stylalgia", occurs when an elongated styloid process or calcified stylohyoid ligament causes dysphagia, facial pain recurrent throat pain or foreign body sensation, also associated symptoms such as neck or throat pain with radiation to the ear. The symptoms related to this condition can be confused or misdiagnosed to a wide variety of facial neuralgias. The incidence of Eagle syndrome varies among population. Usually asymptomatic, it occurs in adult patients, and can be diagnosed by physical examination and radiologically. A 30-year-old male patient presented to the maxillofacial unit of Sulaimaniyah Teaching Hospital with a complaint of pain in the right side of face interfering with mouth opening and causing deviation to the right side of mouth for 6 months duration. The elongated styloid process of the right side was resected surgically by the intra-oral approach. The patient was asymptomatic and comfortably followed up for 5 months.

### Pain, swelling and irritability in the sun: what is the diagnosis? [^b242d164]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented with a 24-hour history of severe burning pain affecting both hands that had started within minutes of playing outdoors. His mother reported that he had been running his hands under cold water and shaking his hands and head to try and relieve the pain. On examination, there was swelling of his hands, eyelids and cheeks. His parents mentioned that his hands and face had 'swollen in the sun' every summer from the age of 2years. A 3-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of left upper limb swelling following a day of prolonged sun exposure. Examination revealed non-pitting oedema extending from her left shoulder to hand with no associated tenderness, erythema or rash. Her mother reported six previous episodes of irritability following sun exposure during which she would cry and flap her hands 'for hours'. Oral steroids and antihistamines were prescribed in both cases with little effect. Findings of routine baseline investigations were normal in both cases. A radiograph of the upper limb in the second patient disclosed nothing abnormal.

### Huge middle ear adenoma with delayed facial nerve paralysis [^8d364ff4]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Middle ear adenoma is a rare disease that arises from the mucosa of the middle ear. Only a few cases of associated facial nerve paralysis have been reported. Facial nerve involvement is most likely related to nerve compression rather than tumor invasion of the nerve. We describe a case of a huge middle ear adenoma in a 63-year-old man. He presented with a 1-month history of right-sided otalgia, otorrhea, and facial palsy; he also had a 10-year history of right-sided hearing loss. A tympanomastoidectomy was performed. Intraoperatively, the tumor was found to fill the middle ear cavity as well as the entire diameter of the external auditory canal. The tumor had eroded the wall of the facial canal at the second genu, and it was tightly adherent to the epineurium. Focal inflammation around the tumor was observed at the exposed facial nerve. The tumor was removed and the facial nerve was decompressed. Immediately after surgery, the patient's aural symptoms resolved. The final pathology evaluation established the diagnosis of a middle ear adenoma. At the 3-year follow-up, the ear cavity was completely healed and facial nerve function was improved.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 60-year-old man, long time smoker, presents with a one month history of marked pain and swelling of the left side of his neck. The pain radiated to the left ear and to the sternum area. In the neck, there was a hard, painful tumour, about 6 cm in diameter. The patient denied any other symptoms, including fever and dyspnoea. Three weeks earlier, the patient was diagnosed with SAT by an internal medicine specialists at an outpatient clinic. The diagnosis was based only on the neck pain and ESR up to 84 mm/h. Neither US nor other additional diagnostic procedures were performed. A treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) was started, but no improvement of the patient's condition was achieved. Thus, the patient decided to come to the emergency room of our hospital. The laboratory results obtained in our Department are presented in Table 1.

### Intracranial cholesteatoma: a case report and review [^aa2bfaeb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

A cholesteatoma can be a complication of ear infection, eustachian tube dysfunction, prior ear surgery, or tympanic membrane perforation. It is typically associated with otorrhea and conductive hearing loss; sensorineural hearing loss, dysequilibrium, facial nerve paralysis, and altered mental status signify advanced disease. The treatment is surgical and recurrences are common. A case of cholesteatoma is presented that was associated with extension into the posterior fossa and presented with only a headache and localized pain.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3faa3002]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Other causes of otalgia or otorrhea that may mimic acute otitis externa — differential and evaluation: Furunculosis is the presence of an infected hair follicle on the outer third of the ear canal, sometimes referred to as localized otitis externa; clinical findings include acute otalgia, otorrhea, localized tenderness, focal swelling, and pustular lesions, and treatment may include local heat, incision and drainage, or systemic antibiotics that cover S aureus. Complaints of otalgia in the absence of swelling of the ear canal and without apparent middle ear disease should arouse suspicion of pathology outside the ear, and perhaps the most common cause of referred otalgia is temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. A complete head and neck examination with visualization of the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck, assessment of any neck masses, and palpation of the tongue base is recommended. Other potential etiologies include dental pathologies, tonsillitis, peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, carotidynia, styloid process elongation, angina, intrathoracic aneurysms, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and geniculate neuralgia. Although otorrhea may accompany AOE, other causes should be considered; cholesteatoma may be mistaken for AOE or chronic external otitis but is typically painless.

### History of facial pain diagnosis [^e027e16b]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Facial pain is pain localised to the face, and the diagnosis of facial pains has puzzled clinicians for centuries. Some of the confusion is related to the delimitation of the facial structure and how pain is classified. The face is here defined as the part of the head that is limited by the hairline, by the front attachment of the ear and by the lower jaw, both the rear edge and the lower horizontal part of the jaw. The face also includes the oral and nasal cavity, the sinuses, the orbital cavity and the temporomandibular joint. Pain in the facial region can be classified in multiple ways, for example according to underlying pathology (malignant vs. non-malignant), the temporal course (acute vs. chronic), underlying pathophysiology (neuropathic, inflammatory or idiopathic), localisation (superficial vs. deep), the specific structure involved (the sinus joint, skin etc), and underlying etiology (infection, tumour etc). In some instances, the diagnosis of facial pain focuses on the involved structure, for example temporomandibular joint disorder, in other cases it is the underlying pathology (sinusitis), and in others it is the specific character of the pain that will dictate the diagnosis (e.g. trigeminal neuralgia).

Facial pains, like other pains, are purely subjective and for some painful conditions there are no obvious objective signs, so the diagnosis very much relies on the descriptive characteristics of the pain. We will limit the discussion in this paper to four major types of facial pains: Trigeminal neuralgia, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs), persistent idiopathic facial pain (atypical facial pain), and temporomandibular disorders and summarise a few historical aspects of diagnosing these conditions.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^58b4bdee]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — diagnostic evaluation emphasizes that a minority of facial paresis/paralysis cases have identifiable causes and should not be treated as Bell's palsy; approximately 70% of facial nerve palsies are Bell's palsy and 30% have other causes, so clinicians should take a comprehensive history, confirm the acute onset of symptoms, document other cranial nerve function, inquire about viral prodrome or hyperacusis and underlying conditions (e.g., prior stroke, brain or parotid tumors, skin cancers of the head/face, trauma, recent infections), and perform a comprehensive physical examination including inspection of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, parotid gland, and head/face/cheek skin, ruling out ear infection, cholesteatoma, and vesicular rashes; atypical presentations (including bilateral facial nerve paresis/paralysis) may warrant additional specialized and more extensive laboratory testing, and clinicians should consider infrequent causes such as Lyme disease in endemic areas, sarcoidosis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, and leprosy; Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion and Table 7 outlines categories and distinguishing features of other causes, with disproportionate presentation among pregnant women and people with diabetes, influenza, a cold, or other upper respiratory illness.

Diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE) — diagnostic elements require rapid onset within the past 3 weeks plus both symptoms and signs of ear canal inflammation. Required features are: rapid onset (generally within 48 hours) in the past 3 weeks; symptoms including otalgia (often severe), itching, or fullness, with or without hearing loss or jaw pain; and signs including tenderness of the tragus, pinna, or both, or diffuse ear canal edema, erythema, or both, with or without otorrhea, regional lymphadenitis, tympanic membrane erythema, or cellulitis of the pinna and adjacent skin. Pain in the ear canal and temporomandibular joint region is intensified by jaw motion.

### Delayed diagnosis of locally acquired Lyme disease, central north carolina, USA [^33d6e1f6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Ten days later, the patient returned to her PCP for follow-up and was seen by the on-call provider. She still reported pain in her ears and that the pain in the left ear was more severe than the right. She was now experiencing diffuse pruritis, which was thought to be caused by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The antibiotic was discontinued because the rash appeared to be resolving. However, she also noted more dyspnea with exertion. Additional laboratory testing was ordered, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was slightly elevated (Table). The patient was prescribed erythromycin drops for otitis media. A referral to cardiology was placed for evaluation of the exertional dyspnea.

After that visit, the patient became increasingly forgetful, withdrawn, and unable to perform basic cognitive tasks (e.g. simple calculations), which was noticed by her adult children. Two weeks later, ≈1 month after the rash began, she had onset of a left-sided facial droop. On evaluation, her PCP noted that she was unable to close her left eye and her smile was asymmetric on the same side. She was diagnosed with Bell's palsy and prescribed a 1-week course of prednisone and valacyclovir. The facial nerve symptoms slowly improved and eventually resolved over the next week.

### Acoustic neuroma with orofacial paresthesia: description of an atypical presentation [^c5c8a25e]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acoustic neuroma (AN) usually manifests with asymmetric hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness and sense of disequilibrium. About 10% of patients complain of atypical symptoms, which include facial numbness or pain and sudden onset of hearing loss. Patients with atypical symptoms also tend to have larger tumours due to the delay in investigation. We report a particularly interesting case of a patient presented to us with numbness over her right hemifacial region after a dental procedure without significant acoustic and vestibular symptoms. Physical examination and pure tone audiometry revealed no significant findings but further imaging revealed a cerebellopontine angle mass. The changing trends with easier access to further imaging indicate that the presentation of patients with AN are also changing. Atypical symptoms which are persistent should raise clinical suspicion of this pathology among clinicians.

Infectious examples include Ramsay Hunt syndrome from herpes zoster virus with a pronounced prodrome of pain and vesicular eruption in the ear canal or pharynx; Lyme disease due to the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi that may be bilateral with rash and arthralgias; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated with fever, malaise, and CD4 count; and otitis media from bacterial pathogens with gradual onset, ear pain, fever, and hearing loss. Inherited heritable disorders show autosomal dominant inheritance with family history as high as 4%, and may have other neurologic disorders. Neoplastic causes such as facial nerve tumor, skin cancer, and parotid tumors involve multiple carcinomas of the head and neck and may involve only select branches of the facial nerve or other cranial nerves, presenting as multiple cranial neuropathies. Neurovascular stroke involves ischemia or hemorrhage with forehead sparing most often and extremities often involved. Traumatic injury to the facial nerve is tied to trauma, including forceps delivery, with timing of injury coinciding with the trauma.

### Red ear syndrome: perspectives for the otolaryngologist [^f6a059f1]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Red ear syndrome (RES) is an unusual, often unrecognized condition that has rarely been reported in the otolaryngology literature despite the presence of symptoms and associated disorders of relevance to the otolaryngologist. When present, RES may have diagnostic value when uncertainties arise in cases of sinus headache and referred otalgia. Despite the appearance of a distinctive red ear, as well as symptoms and associated disorders relating to otolaryngology, discussion of RES is generally limited to neurology-based publications. A red ear is typically the one constant finding in RES while clinical presentation, rate of occurrence, duration, manner of onset, and response to treatment vary on a case-by-case basis. RES may have value as a diagnostic tool in cases of sinus headache and referred otalgia. In recognizing that RES is commonly associated with migraine and not sinus-related headaches, the presence of RES could help confirm a diagnosis of migraine and remove sinus headache from consideration. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder and cervical pathology are commonly encountered in both RES and referred otalgia. When identifying the cause of referred otalgia proves problematic, the presence of RES should prompt the clinician to concentrate on either TMJ or cervical pathology as the more likely diagnostic possibilities.

### Head-and-neck swelling: an under-recognized feature of giant cell arteritis. A report of 37 patients [^14d60a00]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the frequency of occurrence and characteristics of head-and-neck swelling (HNS) in temporal (giant cell) arteritis (TA).

Methods

We analyzed the charts of patients with HNS retrieved from a single department series of 260 consecutive patients with TA and reviewed the published French-English literature. Patients with a swelling limited to the temporal fossa were excluded.

Results

A history of HNS was elicited in 17 patients in our series (i.e. 6.5%) and in 20 previously published patients. The swelling was an inaugural feature in most cases and was often transient. Ear-nose-and-throat (ENT)symptoms were observed in 80% of the cases, including jaw claudication or pain upon opening mouth in 22, causing trismus in 10. Two patients had permanent visual impairment and 1 had sudden hearing loss. The temporal artery biopsy yielded giant cell arteritis (GCA) in all the patients but 2. The HNS was often painful and mainly involved mainly the orbital region and face, particularly the lower part of the cheeks and maxillae, less often the neck and, rarely, the forehead and tongue. Concurrent localized limb swellings were also observed in 3 patients. The HNS disappeared in all the patients, either spontaneously or under steroid treatment, and recurred only in 6 patients.

Conclusion

HNS is not exceptional in untreated TA and is strongly associated with ENT symptoms and a positive TAB, but not with visual loss or stroke. Such characteristics imply in these cases a prominent, widespread involvement of the external carotid artery system by giant cell arteritis.

### Facial paralysis in otitis media due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^f0b86357]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly Wegener's granulomatosis, commonly presents primarily with otitis media and hearing loss, as well as upper and lower respiratory symptoms. However, facial nerve paralysis is a rare manifestation of this uncommon necrotizing vasculitis. We report a patient with facial paralysis accompanied by otitis media. In further studies, our patient was diagnosed with GPA, which was neglected before. In such a presentation, acute suppurative otitis media is the most likely cause of the facial paralysis, but GPA must also be considered, especially in cases with new-onset, painful serous otitis, acute otitis media, or pale granulation tissue in the middle ear, in adults with no previous history of Eustachian tube dysfunction.

### Gradenigo's syndrome: a common infection with uncommon consequences [^7b5b22aa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is a common diagnosis encountered by emergency medicine providers. With appropriate antibiotic treatment, patients with otitis media, in general, have minimal long-term sequela from their underlying infection (Limb et al., 2017 [1]). However, untreated cases can develop life-threatening complications that require prompt intervention. We report a case of an 8-year-old that developed Gradenigo's syndrome, a condition characterized by the triad of otitis media, facial pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, and abducens nerve palsy (Yeung and Lustig, 2016; Janjua et al., 2016; Kantas et al., 2010; Motamed and Kalan, n.d.; Vita Fooken Jensen et al., 2016 [2–6]). Signs and symptoms are often subtle, so a high-level of suspicion is required in order not to miss this potentially fatal process.

### Management of the sodium hypochlorite accident: a rare but significant complication of root canal treatment [^1730fb2d]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 66-year-old female patient presented to the accident and emergency department, 3 h following a dental appointment. Significant right-sided facial swelling, bruising and pain were present. The patient had been sent by her general dental practitioner with a covering letter explaining that a hypochlorite accident had occurred during root canal treatment of the upper right first premolar tooth. An iatrogenic perforation was suspected. The patient was admitted under the care of the maxillofacial team and intravenous antibiotics, analgesia and steroids were administered. The patient was prepared for the possibility of requiring surgical intervention under a general anaesthetic. No nerve injury was encountered and the periorbital tissues were spared. A full recovery was made by the patient with no surgical intervention required but significant bruising and swelling were present up to 4 weeks following the incident.

### Hemicrania continua: a clinical study of 39 patients with diagnostic implications [^171b6e30]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Hemicrania continua is an uncommon primary headache disorder, characterized by continuous unilateral pain, where pain exacerbations are associated with cranial autonomic features. The hallmark of this condition is the absolute response to indometacin. We describe the phenotype of this condition in a large series of patients. Thirty-six (92%) patients had side-locked pain and 3 (8%) had side-alternating pain. The majority (82%) of the patients had the chronic (unremitting) form and the severity range of background pain was 1–10 out of 10 on verbal rating scale, with a mean of 6.5. Thirty-eight (97%) of the patients rated the painful exacerbations between 6.5 and 10 with a mean of 9 and 28 (71%) described their severe pain as excruciating. Of the cohort, 97% had at least one cranial autonomic feature during exacerbations: 73% had lacrimation, 51% nasal congestion, 46% conjunctival injection and 40% ptosis and facial flushing. Other cranial autonomic features included rhinorrhoea, forehead/facial sweating, itching eye, eyelid oedema, sense of aural fullness and periaural swelling, miosis, mydriasis and swelling of the cheek and face. Thirty-one (79%) had phonophobia, which was unilateral in 14 (48%); 29 (74%) had photophobia, which was unilateral in 14 (48%); and 27 (69%) had motion sensitivity. In addition, about two-thirds were agitated or restless, or both, and about one-quarter were aggressive, mainly verbally, with severe pain. All patients had a positive placebo-controlled indometacin test (100–200 mg intramuscularly) or a positive oral indometacin trial, or both. We suggest the International Headache Society criteria be revised to remove the absence of side-shift pain as a criterion. Furthermore, revised criteria should encompass a more extensive range of cranial autonomic features and consider pain as fluctuating with moderate, severe and very severe intensity. Currently the sine qua non for hemicrania continua is a response to indometacin. Since there is no reliable clinical marker of that response, we recommend an indometacin test, either orally or by injection, for any patient with unilateral pain, with or without cranial autonomic symptoms.

### A 13-year-old male with left eye swelling [^ef07cf41]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old male presented with a 10-day history of left eye swelling and pain. These symptoms prompted presentation to the emergency department. He had no significant past medical history and no preceding fevers or chills. He was found on examination of the eyes and the orbit to have left supraorbital erythema, edema, and pain with upward and medial gaze. Examination of the globe, fundus, and visual fields were normal. His white blood cell count was 6.2 (×1000/mm³) with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 4 (mm/hr). Diagnostic endoscopic biopsy was performed. Here we present this case alongside clinical reasoning and diagnostic evaluation with relevant input from respective experts. This case discussion reviews the final diagnosis, as well as the corresponding evaluation and management. Diagnostic algorithms based on literature review and clinical experience are also included.

### Adolescent and young adult tattooing, piercing, and scarification [^1b7a2049]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Adolescent and young adult auricular perichondritis — presentation, pathogens, and antibiotic management are detailed: it "presents as painful swelling, warmth, and redness in a portion of the auricle that often spares the earlobe", and "The most common pathogens (ie, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S aureus, and S pyogenes) often respond well to fluoroquinolone antibiotic treatment (eg, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin)". For localized infections, "Treatment with mupirocin ointment or oral antistaphylococcal antibiotic agents may be warranted", whereas "Oral antibiotic agents, such as the first-generation cephalosporins (eg, cephalexin or cefadroxil and penicillinase-resistant penicillins), are appropriate treatment options for more extensive but uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections". When community methicillin resistance is a concern, "Alternative antibiotic agents (ie, clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) may be more appropriate", and "Guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S aureus, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, also suggest doxycycline or linezolid might also be appropriate". If an abscess develops, "surgical incision and drainage often are necessary", and after clinical resolution "An earring can be replaced, or the ear can be repierced 6 to 8 weeks after resolution of local swelling and tenderness".

Naltrexone Implant Patient Information

What is Naltrexone Implant?

Naltrexone blocks the effects of narcotic medicines and alcohol.
Naltrexone implants are used to treat addiction to alcohol or narcotic drugs. It is also used to prevent narcotic addiction relapse.
Naltrexone Implants prevents the reward effects of opioids and alcohol with subsequent use.
Craving decrease substantially in those people on naltrexone, and that this craving reduction occurs very quickly, from the beginning of treatment (first 2–3 weeks) and doesn't seem to return after that. There are certainly people who continue to have cravings, but this is a rather small proportion and usually occurs only after coming off medication. Those who maintain treatment with naltrexone have no cravings, and some believe that combining naltrexone with personal recovery work in a 12-step based program is especially effective.
Naltrexone implants may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.

What are the possible side effects of naltrexone implant?

Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:

Blurred vision or eye problems
Fast heartbeat
Wheezing, difficulty breathing
Mood changes, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things), confusion, thoughts of hurting yourself
Nausea, stomach pain, low fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
Ear pain, ringing in your ears
Feeling light-headed, fainting
Skin rash or itching
Pain, redness, bruising, itching, swelling, oozing, skin changes, or a hard lump where the medication was implanted

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^29c44215]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis — history of rhinosinusitis identifies that acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is suspected in patients whose upper respiratory infection (URI) has persisted beyond 7 to 10 days or is worsening after initial improvement, and symptoms lasting 5 to 10 days are the most difficult to assess because they may reflect an ongoing viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or the beginning of a bacterial infection. In adults, prominent symptoms include nasal congestion, obstruction, anterior and/or posterior purulent rhinorrhea, and facial pain or pressure, and a history of persistent purulent rhinorrhea and facial pain appear to have some correlation with increased likelihood of bacterial disease; in children, symptoms often also include increased irritability, even more prolonged cough, and vomiting that occurs in association with gagging on mucus. In contrast to ABRS, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone and can be subdivided into CRSsNP and CRSwNP; patients with CRSwNP generally present with periodic exacerbations with increased facial pain or pressure and increased drainage, and fever is absent or low grade with persistence of some sinonasal symptoms between episodes that distinguishes CRS from recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS), in which the patient is asymptomatic between ABRS episodes.

### Malignant external otitis: what the diabetes specialist should know – A narrative review [^88eec0fa]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

MEO most commonly presents with non-resolving nocturnal ear pain, followed by exudate, hearing impairment and temporomandibular joint. Otoscopic findings include edema of the external ear canal with granulation tissue at the osseocartilaginous junction and more rarely only edema or aural polyps.

Palsies of the cranial nerves on the side of MEO are not unusual. Clinical evaluation should include examination of the cranial nerves, specifically the facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), accessory (XI) and hypoglossal (XII) nerves. The facial nerve is most commonly while the hypoglossal nerve most rarely affected. It has been reported that facial nerve paralysis increases mortality by 50%. Facial nerve paralysis is considered to occur in 75% of individuals with Aspergillus infection, while only in 34% of those with Pseudomonas infection.

Blood inflammatory markers, such as white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP), should be obtained. The two latter measurements are usually elevated, while the white blood cell count usually is normal or slightly elevated. The inflammatory markers can be used for disease monitoring and correspondence to treatment. Diabetes tests, such as blood glucose and HbA1c levels, are very important, since sufficient glucose and inflammation controls are milestones in the treatment of the disease. Patients without a known history of diabetes should, nevertheless, be tested. Fasting plasma glucose and glucose tolerance tests should be performed after reduction of the inflammation. Renal and liver function should also be monitored.

Next, culture of ear secretions should be obtained before initiation of antibiotics to assess both the pathogen and its resistance to treatment. A biopsy of the granulation tissue should also be performed for differential diagnosis among MEO, tumor and cholesteatoma. Culture of a superficial swab of the external auditory meatus is most commonly conducted, while deep biopsies can be selected in cases of refractory MEO or probable fungal infections.

### A 59-year-old man with a rash and hearing loss [^f3c683f9]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 59-year-old man who initially had a sore throat, a truncal rash, and fever. Two weeks later, arthralgias and abrupt bilateral hearing loss developed. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

Natural history and therapies — most patients with Bell's palsy show some recovery without intervention within 2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptoms and completely recover within 3 to 4 months; even without treatment, facial function is completely restored in approximately 70% of patients with complete paralysis within 6 months and as high as 94% of patients with incomplete paralysis, with as many as 30% not recovering completely; corticosteroids and antiviral medications are the most commonly used medical therapies, and the benefit of surgical decompression of the facial nerve remains relatively controversial.

### Surgical interventions for the early management of Bell's palsy [^c7e68dac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bell's palsy is an acute unilateral facial paralysis of unknown aetiology and should only be used as a diagnosis in the absence of any other pathology. As the proposed pathophysiology is swelling and entrapment of the nerve, some surgeons suggest surgical decompression of the nerve as a possible management option; this is ideally performed as soon as possible after onset. This is an update of a review first published in 2011, and last updated in 2013. This update includes evidence from one newly identified study.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgery in the early management of Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

On 20 March 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP. We handsearched selected conference abstracts for the original version of the review.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving any surgical intervention for Bell's palsy. Trials compared surgical interventions to no treatment, later treatment (beyond three months), sham treatment, other surgical treatments or medical treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was complete recovery of facial palsy at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were complete recovery at three and six months, synkinesis and contracture at 12 months, psychosocial outcomes at 12 months, and side effects and complications of treatment.

Main Results

Two trials with 65 participants met the inclusion criteria; one was newly identified at this update. The first study randomised 25 participants into surgical or non-surgical (no treatment) groups using statistical charts. One participant declined surgery, leaving 24 evaluable participants. The second study quasi-randomised 53 participants; however, only 41 were evaluable as 12 declined the intervention they were allocated. These 41 participants were then divided into early surgery, late surgery or non-surgical (no treatment) groups using alternation. There was no mention on how alternation was decided. Neither study mentioned if there was any attempt to conceal allocation. Neither participants nor outcome assessors were blinded to the interventions in either study. There were no losses to follow-up in the first study. The second study lost three participants to follow-up, and 17 did not contribute to the assessment of secondary outcomes. Both studies were at high risk of bias. Surgeons in both studies used a retro-auricular/transmastoid approach to decompress the facial nerve. For the outcome recovery of facial palsy at 12 months, the evidence was uncertain. The first study reported no differences between the surgical and no treatment groups. The second study fully reported numerical data, but included no statistical comparisons between groups for complete recovery. There was no evidence of a difference for the early surgery versus no treatment comparison (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 11.11; P = 0.84; 33 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and for the early surgery versus late surgery comparison (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.03 to 6.60; P = 0.58; 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We considered the effects of surgery on facial nerve function at 12 months very uncertain (2 RCTs, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, the second study reported adverse effects with a statistically significant decrease in lacrimal control in the surgical group within two to three months of denervation. Four participants in the second study had 35 dB to 50 dB of sensorineural hearing loss at 4000 Hz, and three had tinnitus. Because of the small numbers and trial design we also considered the adverse effects evidence very uncertain (2 RCTs, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-certainty evidence from RCTs or quasi-RCTs on surgery for the early management of Bell's palsy, and this is insufficient to decide whether surgical intervention is beneficial or harmful. Further research into the role of surgical intervention is unlikely to be performed because spontaneous or medically supported recovery occurs in most cases.

### Ear pain: diagnosing common and uncommon causes… [^2942b733]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

10 Finding vesicles in the ear canal or on the external ear may indicate herpes zoster oticus. If the auricular examination is unremarkable, a complete head and neck examination should also be performed, paying special attention to the TMJ and the nasal and oral cavities. TMJ syndrome commonly presents with discomfort or crepitus on palpation of the TMJ. Primary Otalgia Primary otalgia can be further delineated into pain originating from the external ear, ear canal, or middle ear. 5, 7 External ear pain can be due to several factors, including trauma, sunburn, acute folliculitis, contact dermatitis, shingles, and other skin conditions. When trauma is suspected, the temporal and parietal regions of the skull should be assessed and appropriate imaging ordered. Disorders of the external auditory canal that may cause pain include cerumen impaction, foreign bodies, and, most commonly, infection of the canal.

Otitis externa is caused by bacterial infections and fungal infections. 17 Bullous myringitis is uncommon, but occurs when serous or hemorrhagic blisters form in the ear canal or on the lateral tympanic membrane; symptoms generally include sudden onset of severe ear pain and hearing loss. 16 Pain often decreases after bullae rupture and drain. Uncommon causes of primary otalgia include infectious, neoplastic, and inflammatory etiologies. Mastoiditis, an infection in the air cells of the skull behind the ear, is a rare complication from acute otitis media. This diagnosis is based on physical examination findings of tenderness, erythema, edema, and warmth in the mastoid region. 19 Herpes zoster oticus is caused by reactivation of latent herpes zoster infection from the geniculate ganglion, but also can involve cranial nerves V, IX, and X.

Symptoms include ear pain and facial paralysis while the patient has vesicles in the external auditory canal.
5. 5 Relapsing polychondritis is a rare systemic disease involving the cartilage of many organs, but most commonly the ears. It is characterized by a relapsing, bilateral, erythematous or violaceous appearance on the external ear, sparing the ear lobes. 2.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^38b99a2c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — patient follow-up: Clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: High, Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and Policy level: Recommendation. Rationale includes that based on the natural history of Bell's palsy most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset, that failure to recover completely within 3 months warrants reevaluation to reconsider the initial diagnosis, and that the 3-month timeframe is an appropriate window to identify other causes.

### Other facial neuralgias [^a5dea104]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Premise In this article we review some lesser known cranial neuralgias that are distinct from trigeminal neuralgia, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, or trigeminal neuropathies. Included are occipital neuralgia, superior laryngeal neuralgia, auriculotemporal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal and nervus intermedius neuralgia, and pain from acute herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia of the trigeminal and intermedius nerves. Problem Facial neuralgias are rare and many physicians do not see such cases in their lifetime, so patients with a suspected diagnosis within this group should be referred to a specialized center where multidisciplinary team diagnosis may be available. Potential solution Each facial neuralgia can be identified on the basis of clinical presentation, allowing for precision diagnosis and planning of treatment. Treatment remains conservative with oral or topical medication recommended for neuropathic pain to be tried before more invasive procedures are undertaken. However, evidence for efficacy of current treatments remains weak.

### Clinical and organizational factors in the initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^aa614342]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer intrathoracic spread — structures within the thorax are susceptible to tumor invasion either by local extension or by lymphatic spread, and the most common sites of spread are the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Although nodal metastases rarely cause symptoms, bulky adenopathy in the hila can cause extrinsic airway compression with airway symptoms, and in the subcarinal area, they can compress the midesophagus with resultant dysphagia. More common, symptoms relate to invasion or compression of other structures, including the pleura, nerves, blood vessels, and chest wall, and extension of the primary tumor into the pleura or chest wall causes more localized pain, which may be severe; invasion of the chest wall can cause painful soft tissue masses or rib destruction. Pleural effusion may be related to direct extension of the primary tumor, to implantation of tumor metastasis, or from mediastinal lymphatic obstruction and is typically heralded by dyspnea or chest pain. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy typically is seen in left-sided tumors; the resultant vocal cord paresis causes hoarseness and may predispose to coughing and aspiration, and the right-side recurrent laryngeal nerve is less commonly involved. Superior sulcus tumors are classically associated with some or all the manifestations of Pancoast syndrome. Lung cancer is the most common cause of the superior vena cava syndrome, and patients typically experience facial and neck swelling and, less commonly, may describe dysphagia, cough, headache, dizziness, and blurred vision. The pericardium is the most common site of cardiac involvement by lung cancer either by direct extension or by lymphatic spread, and pericardial effusion, occasionally presenting as pericardial tamponade and arrhythmias, may result.

### Metastatic ethmoidal alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma presenting as a scalp nodule in an adult woman [^b69b0169]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 67-year-old woman admitted for inpatient chemotherapy for ARMS presented with a scalp nodule. The patient noticed the enlarging, asymptomatic nodule 3 months ago on the parietal aspect of the right side of the scalp (Fig 1). She denied any history of similar lesions. She had been diagnosed with right ethmoidal ARMS 9 months previously after experiencing months of sinus symptoms, facial swelling, numbness, and pain. Her symptoms worsened to right-sided vision difficulties and occipital head and neck pain. She presented to the emergency department where magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits showed an enhancing mass with the epicenter in the right ethmoid air cells, with extension into the right side of the maxillary sinus, right side of the orbital apex, anterior aspect of the right side of the cranial fossa, middle aspect of the right side of the cranial fossa, and right side of the cavernous sinus. Otolaryngology performed a right maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and sphenoidotomy. Pathologic analysis of surgical specimens revealed diffusely infiltrative neoplasm composed of clusters and sheets of small round neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for desmin, myoD1, and myogenin. A PAX3-FOXO1 fusion was identified on a gene fusion panel. Altogether, these findings were consistent with a diagnosis of ARMS. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 9 months previously had revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. She received 2 rounds of a chemotherapy regimen consisting of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide. After completing the second round 4 months previsouly, magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits showed significant resolution of the previously identified mass. Radiotherapy was then performed 2 months later. Another magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits was ordered 1 month previously, which showed a 9 × 6-mm focus of abnormal enhancement and abnormal restricted diffusion in the frontal aspect of the right side of the scalp.

### A case report of refractory postherpetic neuralgia after ramsay hunt syndrome treated with tympanic nerve neurectomy [^56014c19]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a facial nerve palsy that arises from herpes zoster infection. In rare cases, postherpetic neuralgia is a complication following Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Pain management to address postherpetic neuralgia includes facial nerve blocks, medications such as gabapentin, carbamazepine and botulinum toxin injections, and pulsed radiofrequency. Despite the reported benefits for patients with glossopharyngeal nerve pain, neurectomy as a treatment has rarely been described. A 45-year-old patient visited our ENT clinic for chronic right-sided facial, ear, and jaw pain that persisted for 9 years following the development of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. She trialed multiple medications including gabapentin, carbamazepine, and botulinum toxin injections with minimal relief to her symptoms. The patient underwent a diagnostic myringotomy with topical application of lidocaine to the tympanic nerve. This resulted in temporary relief of her pain until the effects of the lidocaine subsided. The patient was subsequently offered lysis of the right tympanic nerve for more definitive management. The patient experienced significant pain reduction after the right tympanic neurectomy procedure. Chronic postherpetic neuralgia following Ramsay Hunt syndrome can cause significant impairment in a patient's quality of life. For patients with ear pain refractory to conservative management, a tympanic neurectomy can be considered.

### Anterior transpetrosal approach and microsurgical resection of a petrous tentorial meningioma: 3-dimensional operative video [^38d154ba]. Operative Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Tentorial meningiomas are challenging tumors because of its complex relationship with vital neurovascular structures. We present the case of a 41-yr-old female with a history of right-sided facial numbness associated with pain around the ear. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a lesion in the right tentorium edge closely related with the porus trigeminus, suggestive of a meningioma. Because of worsening of symptoms the patient underwent surgery for tumor removal. A standard temporo-zygomatic craniotomy was performed, followed by an extradural peeling of the middle fossa; the petrous apex was drilled allowing access to the posterior fossa dura. Dural opening was carried connecting the temporal and posterior fossa, and the tentorium was then cut to the incisura. The tumor was identified and completely removed reaching Simpson grade I resection. Postoperatively, the patient presented a right dry eye in the first days that fully improved, and also a right-sided facial paralysis (House-Brackmann grade IV) and diplopia, both recovered completely after 4 mo. We believe that facial paralysis was the result of an undesired traction of the geniculate ganglion, or upon the nerve itself. To avoid such complication, dissection over the GSPN must be carried parallel to that nerve. Facial numbness and pain improved with no neurological other deficits. Tentorial meningiomas are complex deep-seated lesions that can be successfully approached through an anterior transpetrosal route in selected cases. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this operative video. Anatomical images were a courtesy of the Rhoton Collection, American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Neurosurgical Research and Education Foundation.

### Cranial neuropathies as the presenting symptom of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [^8fea3b58]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case series

Case 1

A 75-year-old man with no history of skin cancer presented with a 2-year history of right facial neurologic symptoms. History of herpes zoster without neuralgia was noted more than 20 years prior. He reported eye tracking difficulty and progressive numbness that spread gradually from his temple to the right hemiface over a 1-year period. He was evaluated by 4 different neurologists, with workup including nondiagnostic lumbar puncture, computed tomography (CT), MRI, and a magnetic resonance angiogram. Gabapentin and prednisone offered mild improvement. Two years after initial presentation, he had shooting "electrical" pain on the right hemiface, right facial palsy, and induration over the right temple without epidermal change (Fig 1). Skin biopsy found desmoplastic and infiltrative cSCC. A repeat MRI of the brain, this time with perineural protocol, found enhancement and enlargement of all 3 branches of the right trigeminal nerve into the cavernous sinus and Meckel cave and enhancement of the pterygopalatine fossa. Additionally, multiple muscles of mastication showed enhancement and denervation. Positron emission tomography/CT found invasion of 2 level-2 lymph nodes and denervation with atrophy of the pterygoid and masticator muscles.

Fig 1
Right facial palsy (A) and indurated region on the right temple (B).

Case 2

A 92-year-old man presented with right hemifacial paralysis and eye and ear pain. His neurologist determined him to have Bell palsy. On examination, ulceration at the right retroauricular sulcus was noted, and he was referred to a dermatologist (Fig 2). His only prior history of skin cancer was squamous cell carcinoma at the triangular fossa of the right ear treated with Mohs micrographic surgery 3 years prior. Results of a biopsy of the retroauricular sulcus were interpreted as fibrosing dermatitis. Six months later, a second dermatologist performed a repeat biopsy that found invasive cSCC with PNI. CT scan of the neck without contrast found abnormal soft tissue from the skin at the level of the retroauricular sulcus extending medially to the right stylomastoid foramen, bony destruction of the distal mastoid, and focal ulceration at the retroauricular sulcus. A staging positron emission tomography/CT was negative for cervical lymph node involvement.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy executive summary [^94fbafa1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the new Clinical Practice Guideline: Bell's Palsy. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 11 recommendations developed encourage accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitate patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy; some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, there are numerous diagnostic tests available that are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have an unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

### The midfacial segment pain: little known disorder in need of scientific evaluation [^9ee5ee84]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite its inclusion in the International Classification of Orofacial Pain, tension-type orofacial pain has little support in the scientific literature. However, a similar-in-phenotype orofacial pain perceived in the middle segment of the face has been described by few case series from mostly ear, nose and throat clinics. The authors of these descriptions used the term 'midfacial segment pain'. Patients had no significant sinonasal disorder in these studies, but experienced symmetrical pain perceived mostly over the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. No aura or autonomic symptoms were present apart from mild nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea in some individuals. This description appears similar to tension-type headache, but with midfacial location. In this viewpoint, we indicate a need to fill this gap in scientific knowledge and propose a multicentre interdisciplinary study that would give a detailed description of this type of orofacial pain.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum with complications of severe trigeminal neuralgia [^0407b678]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 69-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a few weeks' history of severe progressive neuropathic pain of the right medial cheek, right nasal sidewall, and jaw, leading to difficulty with eating. Upon interview and examination, it was notable that she had a 2-year history of a chronic ulceration of yet to be determined etiology, of the right auricle and retro-auricular area extending to the angle of the mandible. The ulcer was characterized by a lack of intact auricular cartilage, crusted serosanguinous debris with underlying purulence covering the ulceration, which upon gentle debridement revealed undermined borders along the margins (Fig 1). The patient's presentation to the hospital was because of severe new onset pain wherein there was no visible cutaneous pathology, on the right medial cheek and right nasal sidewall, consistent with a V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve. The severity of pain in these areas was debilitating, leading to an inability to sleep, and subsequent weight loss of 10 pounds from the inability to eat. Notably, 1 month before this presentation, the patient had visited an outpatient dermatology office where a 1.3 cm × 0.7 cm × 0.3 cm excisional biopsy of the right scapha and shave biopsy of an ulcerated region of the superior right side of the neck was performed due to concerns for a basal cell carcinoma. Histology of both sites revealed ruptured epidermoid cysts with neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammation. Two weeks later, with a worsening wound, the patient was reevaluated, and another shave biopsy was performed on the back of the ear with differential diagnosis of PG. Biopsy results showed brisk granulomatous inflammation, with sheets of neutrophils without vasculitis (Fig 2). Significant medical history included bilateral seronegative arthritis of patellofemoral joints and hips, Charcot-Marie-Tooth deformity, muscular dystrophy, and previous history of lower extremity ulcers that had healed with antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

### Melkersson-rosenthal syndrome: recurrent facial swelling and food refusal [^a5e506d0]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Lingua plicata occurs more commonly in adults with MRS, compared with that of the paediatric population. It is also seen in between 0.5 and 5% of the general population. Other clinical features that have been reported are migraines, headache, tinnitus, dizziness and dysgeusia.

This case demonstrates the pathognomonic presentation of MRS with a typical delayed diagnosis, demonstrating the diagnostic challenges and possible sequelae from this delay, including severe symptoms of micronutrient deficiency and delayed oromotor skills. The patient appeared to respond well to systemic steroids, with resolution of symptoms in 48 hours compared with episodes without treatment that resulted in resolution over multiple days to weeks. The evident developmental delay has not been discussed in this presentation and is not felt to be related.

Learning points

Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is a rare syndrome that can be difficult to diagnose due to the heterogeneous nature of the condition. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis for children with recurrent orofacial oedema and/or paralysis, usually associated with a fissured tongue.
Investigations should be targeted at excluding other causes of facial paralysis and orofacial oedema, including Bell's palsy or a space-occupying lesion, before pursuing a diagnosis of MRS.
A course of corticosteroids is the most common management strategy; however, clear guidelines remain lacking for this condition.

### COVID-19 myocarditis and postinfection Bell's palsy [^4fa6bde1]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Here we present the case of a 37-year-old previously healthy man who developed fever, headache and a unilateral, painful neck swelling while working offshore. He had no known contact with anyone with COVID-19; however, due to the ongoing pandemic, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, which was positive for the virus. After transfer to hospital for assessment his condition rapidly deteriorated, requiring admission to intensive care for COVID-19 myocarditis. One week after discharge he re-presented with unilateral facial nerve palsy. Our case highlights an atypical presentation of COVID-19 and the multifaceted clinical course of this still poorly understood disease.

Case presentation

A 37-year-old man presented with complaints of left sided facial numbness and sensation of warmth in left face associated with new right-sided hemiparesis. He was working at his computer when he developed sudden numbness of his left lip and simultaneous feelings of right sided weakness. He then began to feel a sensation of warmness of his left face, starting in the ear and travelling to the rest of the face. On neurological examination, he had right-sided and left-sided weakness, with no changes in speech or mentation. The patient also reported a rash on the abdomen and right elbow for 1 week; he had been in urgent care and started on a prednisone taper. He was also diagnosed with colitis after left abdominal pain and was taking ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.

The patient had a history of chronic essential hypertension, hypothyroidism and Hodgkin lymphoma of left side of neck without metastasis at the age of 10, which was treated with radiation of neck and chest as well as splenectomy; and sleeve gastrectomy complicated by bilateral ischaemic strokes 1 year ago with residual left arm and leg weakness. He had 180 lb weight loss after surgery. Patient was on aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily since the stroke.

### Paroxysmal hemicrania: a prospective clinical study of 31 cases [^ad35380f]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal hemicrania is a rare syndrome characterized by repeated attacks of strictly unilateral, severe, short-lasting pain occurring with cranial autonomic features. The hallmarks of this syndrome are the relatively short attacks and the exquisite response to indometacin. We describe the phenotype of this condition in a series of 31 patients. The mean duration of attack was 17 min. The mean attack frequency was 11. The distribution of the pain was orbital and temporal in 77% of the patients, retro-orbital in 61%, frontal in 55%, occipital in 42%; although pain was also reported in the vertex, second division of trigeminal nerve, neck, nose, jaw, parietal region, ear, teeth, eyebrow, shoulder (ipsilateral and bilateral), arm and third division of trigeminal nerve. Of the cohort, 87% had lacrimation, 68% had conjunctival injection, 58% rhinorrhoea, 54% nasal congestion, ptosis and facial flushing. Other cranial autonomic features include eyelid oedema, forehead/facial sweating, sense of aural fullness and periaural swelling, miosis, mydriasis and swelling of the cheek. The majority of the patients (80%) were agitated or restless, or both, with the pain and 26% were aggressive. All patients had positive placebo control indometacin test (100–200 mg intramuscularly), or a positive oral indometacin trial or both. We suggest the International Headache Society criteria be revised to remove specification of attack site, and to include the full range of cranial autonomic features. Currently, the sine qua non for paroxysmal hemicrania is a response to indometacin. Since there is no reliable clinical marker of that response we recommend an indometacin test, either orally or by injection for any patient with lateralized discrete attacks of head pain with associated cranial autonomic symptoms.

### Trigeminal cephalgias and facial pain syndromes associated with autonomic dysfunction [^3f5cda19]. Cephalalgia (2005). Low credibility.

Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias (TACs) include a spectrum of primary headache syndromes associated with cranial autonomic dysfunction. Other types of headache and facial pain syndromes can be associated with marked localized facial or ear autonomic changes. We report on a group of patients suffering from episodic migraine with cranial autonomic features, patients with different presentations of the 'red ear syndrome' (RES), cluster headache with prominent lower facial involvement and crossover cases. In our experience crossover between TACs and migraine, RES and cluster headache is not uncommon. We propose that all these conditions belong to the same group and a unifying causative mechanism is proposed.

### History of facial pain diagnosis [^74817c6d]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Duration of pain attacks

The current diagnostic criteria state that attacks last from a few seconds to two minutes. But as has been noted in Andre's classical description, the periodic pain became so frequent that she " rarely had five or six minutes of peace in an hour ". Krause in 1913 pointed out that in later stages the attacks begin to last longer and longer, " I have repeatedly seen that the pain free intervals in their duration, completely recede in comparison to the terrible attacks, so much so that strictly speaking one is hardly warranted in speaking of attacks ". Henderson highlights that the pain lasts for seconds but then goes on to say that " a series of rapidly recurring spasms may be described as continuous pain lasting an hour or longer ". Rasmussen in his dissertation also emphasised the short duration of attacks (less than two minutes). He also presented graphic illustrations of trigeminal neuralgia in patients, demonstrating both the duration of individual attacks, the duration of series of attacks and length of pain free intervals. It was suggested that drawings might be used as a tool to distinguish TN from atypical facial pain. This could support the idea that patients may have different types of pains, ranging from single attacks to a series of prolonged attacks, and that these can vary over time. A refractory period i.e. the inability to elicit an attack immediately after another attack, was described in 1959 by Kugelberg and Lindblom and was considered to be a distinguishing feature of TN.

Location of pain and trigger zones

The right side of the face has been reported to be more commonly affected than the left side, and Harris attributed the excess of right-sided cases to the fact that oral hygiene in right-handed patients was worse on the right side. Henderson pointed out that triggers could precipitate pain in another division and he described two trigger zones: One around the mouth and one at the lower end of the nose. This is in agreement with Kugelburg and Lindblom, who pointed out similar trigger areas. Stookey and Ransohoff attribute the description of trigger areas to Patrick, writing in 1914 " sometimes these zones are particularly restricted: A spot no larger than a finger nail " and Kugelberg and Lindblom observed that the area can be as small as 1–2 mm², but in others trigger areas can be diffuse and large.

### Clinical features of mumps… [^67931bb4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Parotitis usually lasts on average 5 days and most cases resolve after 10 days.
- Mumps infection is most often confused with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck.
- Reinfection after natural infection and recurrent parotitis can occur in mumps patients.
- Mumps infection may also present only with nonspecific or primarily respiratory symptoms; or may be asymptomatic. Clinical presentation Nonspecific prodromal symptoms may precede parotitis by several days, including:

- Low-grade fever which may last 3 to 4 days
- Myalgia
- Anorexia
- Malaise and headache. Common signs Mumps usually involves pain, tenderness, and swelling in one or both parotid salivary glands. Swelling usually peaks in 1 to 3 days and then subsides during the next week. The swollen tissue pushes the angle of the ear up and out. As swelling worsens, the angle of the jawbone below the ear is no longer visible.

One parotid may swell before the other, and in 25% of patients, only one side swells. Other salivary glands under the floor of the mouth also may swell but do so less frequently. Parotitis usually lasts on average 5 days and most cases resolve after 10 days. Differential diagnosis Mumps infection is most often confused with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck. Lymph node swelling can be differentiated by:

- The well-defined borders of the lymph nodes.
- Their location behind the angle of the jawbone.
- Lack of the ear protrusion or obscuring of the angle of the jaw. While not a common symptom of flu, swelling of their salivary glands has been reported in persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Complications Mumps complications include orchitis, oophoritis, mastitis, meningitis, encephalitis, pancreatitis, and hearing loss.

Complications can occur in the absence of parotitis and occur less frequently in vaccinated patients. Some complications of mumps are known to occur more frequently among adults than children.

### Interesting case of base of skull mass infiltrating cavernous sinuses [^3ce72439]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A man aged 35 years presented with chronic headache and earache of 1-year duration. He had progressive vision loss and diplopia since last 9months. He also had pain over the face and episodic profuse epistaxis. On examination, perception of light was absent in the right eye and hand movements were detected at 4m distance in the left eye. Imaging revealed a lobulated mass in the nasopharynx extending into the bilateral cavernous sinuses and sphenoid sinus with bony erosions. Biopsy of the nasopharyngeal mass revealed pathological features which are characteristic of IgG4 disease. His serum IgG4 levels and acute inflammatory markers were also elevated. The patient was started on oral corticosteroid therapy. Fever, headache and earache resolved early and there was gradual improvement in the vision of the left eye. After 6months, visual acuity in the left eye was 6/9, but right eye visual acuity had no change. Follow-up imaging revealed a significant reduction in the size of the mass.
