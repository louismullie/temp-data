## Question

What is cardiac resynchronization therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify standard patient selection criteria and key guideline indications. Next, I will consider device types (CRT-P vs CRT-D) and the evidence behind each. After that, I should quantify expected benefits and acknowledge real-world limitations. Finally, I will integrate current guideline recommendations and briefly review emerging directions like conduction system pacing and adaptive algorithms, making sure I double-check each claim against high-credibility sources.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic concept. CRT is a device-based treatment for heart failure that uses biventricular pacing to correct pathologic electrical and mechanical dyssynchrony, typically caused by conduction delay such as left bundle branch block; it times stimulation of the right and left ventricles — often with a right ventricular lead and a left ventricular lead via the coronary sinus — to restore more synchronous contraction and improve pump performance, reverse remodeling, and long-term outcomes; it has also been termed atrio-biventricular pacing, which I should note to avoid confusion with conventional pacing [^1173XuBv] [^112dfxgc] [^116RGZiS] [^117EB45r].

> Wait, let me verify the canonical eligibility profile before I overgeneralize. Guidelines and trials converge on symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, typically LVEF ≤ 35%, plus prolonged ventricular depolarization on ECG; importantly, the 2021 ESC guidelines advise against CRT when QRS duration is < 130 ms unless there is an independent pacing indication such as high-degree AV block, and they emphasize considering CRT "upgrade" in patients with worsening heart failure and substantial right ventricular pacing burden after a prior pacemaker or ICD, often operationalized as > 20% RV pacing, all on top of optimal medical therapy [^111C8iMU] [^11192AsQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptom class. Early practice focused on NYHA III–IV, and I initially thought CRT was broadly recommended even in asymptomatic class I patients; but I should correct myself — while trials like MADIT-CRT enrolled patients with mild symptoms and showed fewer heart failure events with CRT added to ICD therapy, contemporary guidelines primarily anchor CRT use in NYHA II–IV with appropriate QRS criteria rather than routine use in class I, so I need to be precise about evidence versus guideline endorsement [^114GVogC] [^112hB2CB] [^111rDrdY] [^11192AsQ].

> I will now examine the hardware platforms because device choice colors both benefits and risks. CRT can be delivered as CRT-P (pacing only) or CRT-D (pacing plus defibrillator); CRT-D offers sudden death protection but is larger, more expensive, and associated with higher late complication rates, whereas CRT-P has smaller form factor and fewer late device-related issues; however, there is no head-to-head randomized trial proving CRT-D superiority over CRT-P, and observational comparisons are confounded by patient selection, so I should be careful not to overstate an ICD advantage without context [^111oB4Vi] [^114K6nkg] [^114FFGCR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what does the aggregate outcomes evidence really show for CRT as a therapy, regardless of defibrillator back-up. Randomized trials and patient-level meta-analyses show that CRT reduces all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations in appropriately selected patients; for example, MADIT-CRT reduced heart failure events in mild HF, RAFT reduced death or HF hospitalization versus ICD alone, and pooled patient-level analyses of advanced HF trials show significant reductions in death or HF hospitalization and a consistent signal for mortality reduction; overall, a patient-level synthesis estimates roughly a 23% relative reduction in all-cause mortality with an NNT near 8 over three years when added to optimized medical therapy, while reverse remodeling is common among responders and strongly linked to improved outcomes [^114GVogC] [^112hB2CB] [^113HybcN] [^114myLZv] [^115Xn4nY] [^115azoHr].

> I should double-check the specific question of ICD back-up because it's often conflated with CRT itself. Some meta-analyses and re-analyses suggest CRT-D may lower mortality versus CRT-P, particularly in ischemic cardiomyopathy, but these data are limited by confounding, and other analyses underscore that excess mortality among CRT-P recipients is often non-sudden due to older age and comorbidities; importantly, the DANISH trial's non-ischemic subgroup with CRT did not show a mortality difference for CRT-D over CRT-P, and contemporary ESC guidance recommends individualized decision-making rather than defaulting to CRT-D [^1114NoDm] [^112b6jSp] [^111UAQmB] [^111ByKNb] [^114FFGCR].

> But wait, what about real-world challenges that could blunt efficacy. Approximately 20–40% of patients do not demonstrate clear clinical or echocardiographic response, owing to factors like suboptimal selection in nonspecific conduction delays, challenging coronary sinus anatomy and LV lead placement, or non-optimized programming; there is also persistent underuse in women and minoritized populations, and the addition of a defibrillator increases late device-related complications, while economic barriers, particularly the higher cost of CRT-D, constrain access in many settings [^111qnSPH] [^113K1RNf] [^113DvpnK] [^114K6nkg] [^1158oztY].

> Next, I should review guideline synthesis to ensure my practical summary is aligned. The ESC 2021 heart failure and pacing/CRT guidance supports CRT for patients with symptomatic HF (generally NYHA II–IV) with LVEF ≤ 35% despite optimal therapy and QRS ≥ 130 ms, preferably LBBB morphology, discourages CRT when QRS < 130 ms unless pacing is otherwise indicated, and advises considering CRT "upgrade" in those with substantial RV pacing who develop worsening HF; critically, device type selection should be individualized based on sudden death risk, comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preference, not mandated as CRT-D for all [^11192AsQ] [^111C8iMU] [^114FFGCR].

> I need to ensure I capture evolving strategies because they may reshape "what CRT is" in practice. Conduction system pacing — His-bundle or left bundle branch pacing — offers a physiologic resynchronization alternative and shows comparable or possibly superior outcomes in early studies, while LV-only fusion pacing and adaptive algorithms aim to exploit intrinsic conduction; yet, large trials like AdaptResponse have not demonstrated clear superiority over standard CRT, so these approaches remain promising but not universally adopted pending more definitive outcome data [^111qnSPH] [^112Ckb9k] [^112uN95A] [^115gCi9A] [^115Xn4nY].

> Hold on, I should verify if timing of implantation matters in acute care settings. Observational registry analyses suggest that implanting CRT during a heart failure hospitalization is associated with lower post-discharge mortality and fewer HF readmissions compared with deferral, but because these are nonrandomized data, I must be cautious and frame this as hypothesis-generating rather than prescriptive guidance for all patients [^115ckCU7] [^1175o7XZ].

> Stepping back, my final check is that I've answered the original question succinctly and accurately: CRT is a biventricular pacing-based device therapy that restores ventricular synchrony to improve symptoms, reverse remodeling, and survival in appropriately selected heart failure patients with reduced LVEF and prolonged QRS, delivered as either CRT-P or CRT-D with device choice individualized; benefits are robust across multiple trials and meta-analyses, tempered by nonresponse and implementation challenges, and guided by ESC 2021 criteria, with emerging physiologic pacing strategies under active evaluation [^1173XuBv] [^11192AsQ] [^111C8iMU] [^113HybcN] [^114FFGCR].

---

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a device-based therapy for **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction** and electrical dyssynchrony, delivered via biventricular pacing [^1173XuBv] to improve ventricular synchrony and function. CRT is indicated for patients with **LVEF ≤ 35%**, **NYHA class II–IV symptoms** despite optimal medical therapy, and **QRS ≥ 130 ms** (especially LBBB) [^11192AsQ], but is not recommended when QRS < 130 ms without a pacing indication [^111C8iMU]. CRT **reduces mortality** and **heart failure hospitalizations** [^113HybcN], and improves quality of life, with the greatest benefit in LBBB and QRS ≥ 150 ms [^114GVogC]; however, about 30% do not respond [^113K1RNf], often due to suboptimal selection or lead placement [^111qnSPH]. CRT-D is preferred in **ischemic cardiomyopathy** [^113DvpnK] or **higher arrhythmic risk** [^1114NoDm], whereas **CRT-P** may be chosen in nonischemic disease, older age, or high comorbidity burden [^111oB4Vi] [^114FFGCR]. Emerging alternatives, such as conduction system pacing [^111qnSPH] and wireless LV stimulation, are under study for nonresponders or challenging anatomy [^113K1RNf] [^112uN95A].

---

## Mechanism of action

CRT works by **synchronizing ventricular contraction** via biventricular pacing [^1173XuBv], improving cardiac output, reducing mitral regurgitation, and promoting reverse remodeling [^11192AsQ]; collectively, these effects enhance symptoms, reduce hospitalizations [^111qnSPH], and improve survival [^112hB2CB].

---

## Indications and patient selection

According to the **2021 ESC guidelines**, CRT is indicated for patients with:

- **LVEF ≤ 35%** and NYHA class II–IV symptoms despite optimal medical therapy [^11192AsQ].
- **QRS duration ≥ 130 ms**, particularly with LBBB morphology [^11192AsQ] [^114GVogC].
- **Upgrade from pacemaker/ICD**: Consider if LVEF ≤ 35%, worsening HF despite optimal therapy, and significant RV pacing burden [^11192AsQ] [^111KWRCB].

CRT is not recommended for patients with **QRS duration < 130 ms** without a pacing indication [^111C8iMU].

---

## Clinical benefits

CRT provides **significant clinical benefits**, including:

- **Reduced mortality**: 23% reduction in all-cause mortality [^115Xn4nY] [^113HybcN].
- **Reduced hospitalizations**: 41% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations [^115Xn4nY] [^114GVogC].
- **Improved quality of life**: Enhanced functional status and quality of life [^11192AsQ] [^111rDrdY].

The **greatest benefits** are observed in patients with **LBBB morphology and QRS duration ≥ 150 ms** [^114GVogC] [^112hB2CB].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its benefits, CRT has **limitations**:

- **Nonresponse rate**: Approximately 30% of patients do not respond clinically [^113K1RNf].
- **Patient selection**: Suboptimal selection and characterization of conduction disease [^111qnSPH] [^114zKnM3].
- **Procedural constraints**: Technical difficulties in lead placement and device programming [^111qnSPH] [^113K1RNf].
- **Complications**: Lead dislodgement, infection, and device-related complications [^114K6nkg].

---

## CRT-P vs. CRT-D

CRT can be delivered as a **pacemaker (CRT-P)** or with **defibrillator backup (CRT-D)**. CRT-D is preferred in patients with **ischemic cardiomyopathy** or **higher arrhythmic risk**, providing additional protection against sudden cardiac death [^1114NoDm] [^113DvpnK], whereas **CRT-P** is considered in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, older age, or significant comorbidities where arrhythmic risk is lower [^111oB4Vi] [^114FFGCR].

---

## Emerging technologies and future directions

Emerging technologies aim to improve CRT outcomes with **conduction system pacing** (His-bundle and left bundle branch area pacing), a physiological alternative to traditional biventricular pacing [^111qnSPH] [^113K1RNf], and with wireless LV stimulation designed to overcome anatomical and technical limitations [^113K1RNf]. Advanced imaging seeks to improve patient selection and optimize lead placement strategies [^111qnSPH] [^1146YJvv].

---

CRT is an effective therapy for selected heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and electrical dyssynchrony, **improving survival and reducing hospitalizations** [^113HybcN] [^112hB2CB]. Ongoing research and emerging technologies aim to address nonresponse and optimize outcomes [^111qnSPH].

CRT‐P recipients are older and have more advanced heart failure and comorbidities than those receiving CRT‐D. These differences notwithstanding, the addition of the ICD is associated with a relative reduction in the risk of all‐cause mortality in CRT patients, especially in the context of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The benefit of CRT‐D compared with CRT‐P in those with non‐ischemic cardiomyopathy is less clear.

### Evolving indications, challenges and advances in cardiac resynchronization therapy for heart failure [^111qnSPH]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) via biventricular pacing has markedly improved heart failure outcomes over the past two decades. However, some patients show no clinical improvement or evidence of reverse remodeling following device implantation. Challenges include suboptimal patient selection, limitations in the characterization of conduction disease (especially nonspecific interventricular conduction delays), procedural constraints, inappropriate device programming, and delayed referral. Moreover, there remains no formal consensus on evaluating and characterizing CRT efficacy. Underuse persists among women and minoritized racial and ethnic groups. Targeted research addressing unmet needs has led to evolving guideline indications.

Novel electrocardiographic and imaging techniques are continually being developed to improve patient selection, and alternative pacing strategies have emerged. Conduction system pacing may allow for a more physiological approach to CRT. Observational studies and small clinical trials have shown comparable or superior efficacy of conduction system pacing over traditional biventricular pacing; however, more studies are needed.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy using a pacemaker or a defibrillator: Patient selection and evidence to support it [^111oB4Vi]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment for patients with heart failure (HF), myocardial dysfunction, and prolonged ventricular depolarization on surface electrocardiogram. CRT can be delivered by a pacemaker (CRT-P) or a combined pacemaker-defibrillator (CRT-D). Although these two types of devices differ significantly in size, function, and cost, published guidelines do not distinguish between them, leaving the choice of which device to implant to the treating physician and the informed patient.

In this paper, we review the published CRT clinical trial literature with a focus on the outcomes of HF patients treated with CRT-P versus CRT-D. We also attempt to provide guidance regarding the appropriate choice of CRT device type, in the absence of randomized prospective trials geared to answer this specific question.

### Alternative left ventricular pacing approaches for optimal cardiac resynchronization therapy [^113K1RNf]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves mortality, morbidity, and quality of life in selected heart failure patients with severe left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction impairment. However, between 20% and 40% of device recipients do not benefit clinically from CRT. Indeed, some anatomical and technical difficulties are related to the coronary venous implantation site via the coronary sinus (CS). Additionally, electrical constraints have been described, and CS does not always correspond to the optimal LV lead position. In the last decade, engineers and physicians have worked together to overcome the challenging LV lead implantation, and various biventricular pacing alternatives have been developed to improve CRT response. In this review, we discuss the evolution from CS pacing to wireless LV stimulation and His-bundle pacing.

### Future research prioritization in cardiac resynchronization therapy [^1146YJvv]. American Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Although cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is effective for some patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF), evidence gaps remain for key clinical and policy areas. The study aimed to review the data on the effects of CRT for patients with HFrEF receiving pharmacological therapy alone, or pharmacological therapy combined with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Informed by a diverse group of stakeholders, the study sought to identify evidence gaps, prioritize them, and develop a research plan.

- **Methods**: Relevant studies were identified using PubMed and EMBASE, with ongoing trials sourced from clinicaltrials.gov. A forced-ranking prioritization method was applied by stakeholders to reach a consensus on the most important questions. Twenty-six stakeholders, including key investigators from existing randomized controlled trials and others representing patients, the public, device manufacturers, and policymakers, contributed to an expanded list of evidence gaps.

- **Results**: Among the 18 top-tier evidence gaps identified, 8 were related to specific populations or subgroups of interest. Seven gaps focused on the comparative effectiveness and safety of CRT interventions or comparators, while 3 were associated with the outcomes of CRT treatment. The association of comorbidities with CRT effectiveness ranked highest, followed by questions concerning the effectiveness of CRT among patients with atrial fibrillation and the relationship between gender, QRS morphology and duration, and outcomes.

### Pathobiology of cardiac dyssynchrony and resynchronization [^1173XuBv]. Heart Rhythm (2009). High credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) represents the major new advance for the treatment of heart failure since the start of the new millennium. With this therapy, failing hearts with discoordinate contraction due to conduction delay are subjected to biventricular stimulation to "resynchronize" contraction and improve chamber function. Remarkably, CRT was mostly developed and tested in patients first, and the speed at which the concept was translated to an approved clinical therapy was unusually quick. At the time of writing, CRT is the only heart failure treatment that can both acutely and chronically improve the systolic pump performance of the failing human heart, while also enhancing long-term survival.

This situation underscores the importance of understanding how CRT works at the molecular and cellular levels, as these insights might shed light on new approaches to treating heart failure more generally. Over the past seven years, my laboratory and others at Johns Hopkins have developed novel animal models for addressing this question, and new results are revealing intriguing insights into the mechanisms of CRT. This review, presented on the occasion of the Fourth Annual Douglas P. Zipes Lecture at the 2009 Scientific Sessions of the Heart Rhythm Society, highlights these advances and new directions in CRT research.

### Implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy [^111rDrdY]. The Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) have become standard treatments for heart failure. Results from trials have provided ample evidence that CRT, in addition to its proven benefits for patients with symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III), might also reduce morbidity and mortality in those with mildly symptomatic heart failure (NYHA class II). As a result, the 2010 European Society of Cardiology guidelines now recommend CRT for both patient populations.

In this review, we summarise and critically assess the landmark randomised clinical trials REVERSE, MADIT-CRT, and RAFT. Furthermore, we discuss the rationale and available evidence for other emerging indications of CRT, including its use in patients with a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (> 35%), in those with a narrow QRS complex (≤ 120 ms), and in those with concomitant bradyarrhythmic pacemaker indications. We also focus on patients who do not respond to CRT and on CRT optimisation.

### Optimizing resynchronization therapy: Can we increase the number of true responders [^111TVQdb]? Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy is now considered a standard therapy for patients with cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and interventricular conduction delay. Despite the demonstrated benefits in multiple large-scale trials, there is a clear nonresponder rate. This brief review will address some of the issues associated with maximizing the benefit of biventricular pacing and examine whether advances in programming of such devices will increase the number of true responders.

### Echocardiography for cardiac resynchronization therapy selection: Fatally flawed or misjudged [^114zKnM3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

After the publication of the PROSPECT (Predictors of Response to CRT) trial, the use of echocardiography for the assessment of mechanical dyssynchrony, and as a possible aid for selecting patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy, has been heavily criticized. Calls have been made to adhere to the guidelines and implant according to the entry criteria of recent major trials. However, although this approach is currently recommended, the attempt to identify patients who will not benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy and whose clinical condition may be worsened should continue. Devices are not analogous to drugs; initial costs are higher, complications are significant, and the device cannot readily be withdrawn. Professional resources and the costs to society are high and wasted if devices are implanted inappropriately. Rather than discarding the attempt to identify the most suitable patients pre-operatively, further work is needed to refine the techniques and conduct new clinical trials. A combination of methods, including locating the site of latest mechanical activation, myocardial scar localization, and assessing venous anatomy pre-operatively, may help to identify those who will not derive any benefit or may be potentially worsened.

### Outcomes following cardiac resynchronisation therapy in older people [^114VVwJE]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

**Key points**: Symptomatic or echocardiographic improvements following implantation with cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) were consistent in older people (≥ 80 years). At baseline, older individuals had worse symptomatic status and were more likely to have co-morbidities. On an individual level, the absence of improvement following cardiac resynchronisation therapy does not always represent a lack of treatment effect.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy or atrio-biventricular pacing-what should it be called [^116RGZiS]. Nature Clinical Practice. Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Reduced cardiac efficiency caused by suboptimal synchronization of the heart's normal contraction might contribute to the development of or exacerbate heart failure. Conceptually and in practice, cardiac dyssynchrony is complex. Recent studies have shown that atrio-biventricular pacing can improve cardiac synchrony in many patients and enhance cardiac function, alleviate symptoms, increase exercise capacity, and significantly reduce morbidity and mortality.

Randomized controlled trials, however, indicate that the severity of cardiac dyssynchrony, as conventionally measured, is a poor guide to treatment benefit, and that correction of dyssynchrony accounts for only part of the benefit of atrio-biventricular pacing. Although some of the benefits of atrio-biventricular pacing might be mediated by cardiac resynchronization, much of the benefit could be mediated by mechanisms that are as yet unknown. Withholding atrio-biventricular pacing in patients who do not exhibit cardiac dyssynchrony on imaging but otherwise fulfill the entry criteria used in randomized controlled trials of this therapy could be unwise.

Here, we examine the evidence that cardiac resynchronization is indeed the mechanism by which atrio-biventricular pacing exerts its effects.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy is an important advance in the management of congestive heart failure [^117EB45r]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an emerging therapy that improves symptoms and exercise tolerance in patients with advanced heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and intraventricular conduction delay. By correcting the AV, interventricular, and intraventricular dyssynchrony induced by conduction disorders, controlled studies have shown that CRT improved functional status, decreased heart failure hospitalization rate, and might have a positive effect on left ventricular remodeling. Recent and preliminary data from the COMPANION trial suggest that CRT alone or in association with defibrillator capacity significantly reduced total mortality and hospitalization, and that total mortality was significantly reduced only in the CRT plus implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) group. Many questions remain unanswered, particularly the selection of responder patients.

### Incidences and clinical outcomes of patients with a single or dual chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator developing an indication for cardiac resynchronization therapy [^112gezwB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Low credibility.

While studies have shown worse clinical outcomes in patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) who underwent an upgrade to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) compared to de novo CRT implantations, little is known about the clinical trajectory of these patients prior to upgrading to CRT.

This single-centre retrospective study included patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy with a QRS duration < 130 ms who underwent ICD implantation between 2010 and 2022. By reviewing the evolution of QRS duration, QRS morphology, and right ventricular pacing (RVP) percentages, it was assessed whether the patients developed an indication for CRT according to contemporary European Society of Cardiology guidelines during the follow-up.

A total of 517 patients were included: the median age at implant was 63.8 years (range 55.5–70.2 years), 17.8% were female, 29.4% received implants for secondary prevention, 65.2% had ischaemic cardiomyopathy, and 53.8% had single-chamber or subcutaneous ICD implants. Over a median follow-up of 6.6 years, 132 (25.5%) patients developed an indication for CRT, corresponding to an incidence of 4.52% per year, of which only 46 (34.8%) actually underwent an upgrade to CRT.

Independent predictors of developing an indication for CRT were baseline QRS duration (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06/ms; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.07) and age at implant (HR 1.04/year; 95% CI 1.02–1.06). An upgrade to CRT was associated with lower all-cause mortality, heart transplant, or assist device implant (log-rank p = 0.002) compared to patients who developed a CRT.

### Geographic and temporal variation in cardiac implanted electric devices to treat heart failure [^111ByKNb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Several device-based therapies are used to supplement pharmaceutical treatment for systolic heart failure, primarily cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), either alone (CRT-P) or in combination with defibrillator back-up (CRT-D). These devices are increasingly common in the United States, with estimated implant rates in patients with heart failure diagnoses or hospitalizations for sudden cardiac arrest ranging from 24% to 38%. For patients potentially eligible for CRT, CRT-D devices appear to be the "default" device in the United States. In a US national registry, patients who met trial eligibility for CRT (i.e. left ventricular ejection fraction 120 ms, and New York Heart Association class III/IV), the overwhelming proportion (80%) received a combined CRT-D device. A re-analysis of the 74 patients randomized to CRT-P in the REVERSE trial (compared to 345 with CRT-D) found lower long-term mortality in CRT-D patients.

While some argue that any patient treated with CRT should also receive defibrillator backup, others counsel restraint in adding additional device functions. A recent cohort study adjudicated cause of death for patients with CRT-P versus CRT-D and found that the vast majority of excess mortality in CRT-P patients was non-sudden death, weakening the argument for default defibrillator backup. Preventing sudden cardiac death with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is distinct from improving heart failure symptoms, and not every patient views these as necessarily linked. Only the COMPANION trial has directly addressed this issue.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112b6jSp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015).

These observations are not disputed by the inherent limitations of this meta‐analysis. However, the conclusion that the addition of the defibrillator to CRT reduces mortality risk should be taken cautiously. In fact, our main findings are not entirely unexpected when one considers the significant baseline differences between patients currently receiving CRT‐D versus CRT‐P, as highlighted in Table 4. In the CERTITUDE cohort study, the higher all‐cause mortality rate in CRT‐P patients was almost entirely due to a much higher number of heart failure‐related or non‐cardiac deaths, while SCD was only slightly more frequent. By cause‐of‐death analysis, 95% of the excess mortality among CRT‐P subjects was related to an increase in non‐sudden death. This surprising finding is easily explained by the fact that CRT‐P patients were older, had more advanced heart failure, and a higher number of comorbidities.

In fact, these findings suggest that, in the context of primary prevention, the addition of the ICD to CRT‐P patients, as currently selected in daily clinical practice, may be futile in some cases, as SCD only represents a minority of the additional number of deaths in CRT‐P patients. On the other hand, a very recent study by Gold et al. extrapolated lifelong treatment‐specific all‐cause mortality rates of CRT patients with mild heart failure enrolled in the REVERSE trial and concluded that, compared with CRT‐P, CRT‐D offered 2.77 additional life‐years. Given the high degree of matching between CRT‐D and CRT‐P patients in the REVERSE trial, this provided support towards the belief that CRT-D could be more beneficial for certain patient populations.

### 20 years of cardiac resynchronization therapy [^1135aZ46]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an accepted treatment for patients with heart failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV) function, and a wide QRS complex. It has been revolutionary for patients with advanced HF whose only previous option was cardiac transplantation, and it is now a realistic option for patients with mild HF. The development of CRT has also united the previously disparate cardiological subspecialties of electrophysiology and heart failure. This review, written on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the first clinical use of CRT for HF, takes a historical perspective on CRT's evolution from "bench to bedside". We also comment on the task faced by electrophysiologists and heart failure specialists as they make this life-saving therapy available to an increasing number of eligible patients.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy: State of the art 2013 [^112dfxgc]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is currently an established device therapy for heart failure (HF) patients. Cumulated knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms, implantation techniques, advancement of device-based technologies, and clinical trial experience has significantly impacted this evolving therapy in the last few years. This article addresses the updated CRT guideline and potentially new indications of CRT, such as patients with New York Heart Association Class I, normal QRS duration, and non-HF patients with pacing indications.

Furthermore, important but unresolved issues are also discussed:

- **Impact of QRS morphology and QRS duration on CRT response**: Examination of how QRS characteristics influence the effectiveness of CRT.
- **New approaches for placement of left ventricular (LV) lead**: Advances in techniques for optimal LV lead placement to enhance patient outcomes.
- **Multisite LV pacing**: Exploration of the benefits of pacing at multiple sites within the left ventricle.
- **Role of HF disease monitoring program**: The significance of monitoring programs in managing heart failure in patients undergoing CRT.

### Rationale and design of the AdaptResponse trial: a prospective randomized study of cardiac resynchronization therapy with preferential adaptive left ventricular-only pacing [^115gCi9A]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is recommended by guidelines for the treatment of patients with symptomatic heart failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) displaying evidence of electrical dyssynchrony, with established effects on morbidity and mortality. However, despite the overall beneficial effects of CRT, approximately 30% of CRT recipients do not exhibit early clinical improvement.

While CRT is most commonly delivered using biventricular (BiV) pacing, meta-analysis suggests that LV-only pacing can be at least as efficacious as BiV pacing, with no observed differences in mortality. In patients with sinus rhythm and normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction, pacing only the left ventricle with appropriate AV delays — synchronized to the right ventricle to produce fusion of left and right ventricular (RV) activation — can result in superior LV and RV function compared to standard BiV pacing.

- **Optimization of intervals**: Optimization of the AV and interventricular (VV) intervals during BiV pacing is another option to maximize the positive effects of CRT. This optimization is usually accomplished using echocardiography or other in-office modalities.
	- However, these methods have not consistently shown benefit, can be resource-intensive, often require patient–physician contact, and only a minority of clinicians routinely optimize AV and VV delays. Recent developments using a proprietary peak endocardial acceleration sensor on the atrial lead have shown promising results.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113DvpnK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In summary, despite the unequivocal benefit of CRT alone compared with medical treatment in reducing morbidity as well as mortality through reduction in both heart failure death and SCD, a percentage of deaths in CRT‐P patients are sudden. The addition of the ICD may constitute an appropriate complement to CRT therapy in patients in NYHA class II and III, but probably not those in ambulatory NYHA class IV, very elderly patients, and those with advanced comorbidities. The decision to implant a CRT‐D versus CRT‐P also requires an exact understanding of the long‐term risk of complications (higher in those with CRT‐D [16, 18, 60, 61]), the preference and expectations of the patients and the 3‐fold higher cost of CRT‐D compared with CRT‐P.

- **Cardiac resynchronization therapy: With or without a defibrillator?** Several observations can be made from the results of this meta‐analysis. First, CRT‐D patients as currently selected in daily clinical practice have significantly lower all‐cause mortality rates compared with those who receive CRT without a defibrillator. There was one fewer death in every 10 CRT‐D patients compared with the same number of CRT‐P patients. Secondly, the lower mortality rate in CRT‐D patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy is clear but seems of lower magnitude in the context of non‐ischemic cardiomyopathy. A higher number of CRT‐D devices needs to be implanted in patients with non‐ischemic cardiomyopathy for one fewer death to be reported compared with CRT‐P patients. Thirdly, CRT‐P recipients are often older and have more advanced heart failure and higher…

### Device complications with addition of defibrillation to cardiac resynchronisation therapy for primary prevention [^114K6nkg]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

In patients indicated for cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT), the choice between a CRT-pacemaker (CRT-P) versus a defibrillator (CRT-D) remains controversial, and indications in this setting have not been well delineated. Apart from inappropriate therapies, which are inherent to the presence of a defibrillator, whether adding a defibrillator to CRT in the primary prevention setting impacts the risk of other acute and late device-related complications has not been well studied and may bear relevance for device selection.

- **Methods**: An observational multicentre European cohort study of 3008 consecutive patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and no history of sustained ventricular arrhythmias, undergoing CRT implantation with (CRT-D, n = 1785) or without (CRT-P, n = 1223) defibrillator. Using propensity score and competing risk analyses, we assessed the risk of significant device-related complications requiring surgical reintervention. Inappropriate shocks were not considered except those due to lead malfunction requiring lead revision.

- **Results**: Acute complications occurred in 148 patients (4.9%), without significant difference between groups, even after considering potential confounders (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.00, p = 0.47). During a mean follow-up of 41.4 ± 29 months, late complications occurred in 475 patients, giving an annual incidence rate of 26 (95% CI 9 to 43) and 15 (95% CI 6 to 24) per 1000 patient-years in CRT-D and CRT-P patients, respectively. CRT-D was independently associated with an increased occurrence of late complications (HR = 1.68, 95% CI.

### Synchronization of repolarization after cardiac resynchronization therapy: A combined clinical and modeling study [^116xFKRE]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a nonpharmacological therapy recommended by clinical practice guidelines for heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and QRS duration > 130 ms. CRT significantly reduces mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. This beneficial effect is clearly linked to the resynchronization of electrical activation, recoordination of contraction, and the accompanying improvement in pump function and cardiac reserve.

Electrocardiographic changes in depolarization after CRT have been studied in considerable detail; in contrast, less is known about changes in repolarization caused by CRT. A few studies in both animal tissues and humans have reported an increased dispersion of repolarization during CRT, possibly suggesting an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. On the other hand, large clinical trials and multiple registries showed a significantly lower risk of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in CRT patients, particularly in those who show significant reverse remodeling. These clinical observations suggest that adaptations in ventricular repolarization may occur after CRT. However, little is known about the longitudinal changes of ventricular repolarization and their relation to reverse remodeling induced by CRT.

To address this gap in evidence, a multimodality approach including electrocardiography (ECG), vectorcardiography (VCG), and echocardiography, supplemented by patient‐specific modeling, was considered. In the present study, we investigated a cohort of consecutive CRT patients.

### Survival of patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without defibrillator: the RESET-CRT project [^114FFGCR]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is one of the main treatment pillars for heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and conduction abnormalities with broad QRS complex. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is delivered by biventricular pacemakers (CRT-P) or by biventricular pacemakers with additional defibrillator capability (CRT-D).

The need for the defibrillator capability in this setting is debated. Cardiac resynchronization therapy reduces, per se, the risk of sudden cardiac death. In addition, modern pharmacologic heart failure treatment further reduces that risk, leading to a substantial overall decline of sudden cardiac death and a decrease in the expected benefit of the defibrillator.

There is no randomized clinical trial (RCT) with a head-to-head comparison between CRT-P and CRT-D. The COMPANION study compared CRT-P and CRT-D devices with optimal medical therapy, but there was no direct comparison between CRT-D and CRT-P. In the DANISH trial in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, no benefit for CRT-D over CRT-P devices could be shown in the large trial subgroup that received a CRT device. The evidence from observational studies is also ambiguous. As a result, recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines and a recent position statement recommend individual decision-making for the choice of the type of CRT device in patients undergoing CRT implantation, based on parameters that are considered to be associated with the risk for sudden cardiac death and the competing risk for dying from other causes.

### Implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with left ventricular dysfunction: randomized trial evidence through 2004 [^114f9sua]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Although many studies have shown that implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy improves the survival of patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction, the magnitude of effectiveness of ICD therapy in clinically defined subgroups remains uncertain. Similarly, although studies have shown an improvement in patients' hemodynamics and quality of life with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), there is continuing uncertainty about the effect of CRT on patients' survival and the magnitude of improvement in quality of life with this therapy.

On August 24, 2004, an ad hoc group of experts representing clinical cardiovascular medicine, biostatistics, economics, and health policy were joined by representatives of the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Baltimore, Md), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Rockville, Md), and the device industry for a one-day round table to review the available clinical trial evidence on the effect of ICD therapy in the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death and the effect of CRT in patients with congestive heart failure. The meeting was organized by the Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC, and funded in part by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

This document summarizes the evidence reviewed at that meeting and the discussions of that evidence.

### Left ventricular-only fusion pacing versus cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure patients: A randomized controlled trial [^112uN95A]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves cardiac function and clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic heart failure with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and prolonged QRS duration (QRSd), preferentially left bundle branch block (LBBB). The underlying mechanism is the resynchronization of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) activation. However, the CRT pacing modality does not consider the utilization of intrinsic RV conduction and dynamic changes in atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Recently, LV-only pacing is proposed as an alternative approach to achieve resynchronization by the fusion of LV pacing with intrinsic RV conduction.

Although acute and short-term investigations suggested comparable benefits of LV-only pacing and conventional biventricular pacing (BVP), varying AV conduction may still lead to electrical dyssynchrony during various daily activities or due to the changes in disease state over a longer period of time. Therefore, an adaptive algorithm is developed to optimize the fusion by continuously adjusting LV pacing timing to leverage intrinsic RV conduction and achieve dynamic and more physiological pacing. The purpose of this study is to assess mid-term cardiac function and clinical outcomes during adaptive LV-only fusion pacing (LVP) in comparison with conventional BVP in a selected group of CRT-indicated patients with intact AV conduction.

### Outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy by New York Heart Association class: A patient-level meta-analysis [^114N3XLh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We conducted a patient-level prospective meta-analysis of the CRT trials involving patients in NYHA classes III or IV: MIRACLE, MIRACLE-ICD (Multicenter InSync Implantable Cardioversion Defibrillation Randomized Clinical Evaluation), and COMPANION trials. Notably, no literature search was performed to identify these trials for this meta-analysis. Instead, we collected patient-level data directly from individual cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator device vendors. Ultimately, only trials with participants in NYHA class III and IV were included in the primary analysis, focusing on the three trials mentioned.

- **Data sources**: Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained from Duke University to perform the analyses in this study. The original trials were fully IRB-approved, and all patients provided informed consent.

These trials compared patients receiving CRT against a control group consisting of either optimal medical therapy or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) without CRT. All included trials involved patients in NYHA functional class III and IV. In the MIRACLE trial, all participants underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemaker implantation, but only the treatment group had the biventricular pacing function activated.

Due to space constraints, not all details are included here. Please refer to the supplementary materials for Table 1, which outlines the landmark CRT trials for which patient-level data were acquired.

### Timing of cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation in heart failure patients and its association with outcomes [^115ckCU7]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

When used in appropriately selected heart failure (HF) patients, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduces mortality and hospitalization. It is not understood whether CRT implantation during hospitalization for HF is associated with similar benefits.

- **Hypothesis**: Timing of CRT implantation relative to hospitalization for HF is associated with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: This analysis included patients eligible for CRT and discharged alive between January 2005 and December 2012 from 388 hospitals in the Get With The Guidelines‐HF program. Participants were linked with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data to evaluate outcomes of all-cause mortality and HF re-hospitalization based on CRT status (present on admission, placed during hospitalization, and prescribed at discharge; reference = no CRT).

- **Results**: Of 15,619 CRT-eligible HF patients, 2,408 (15%) had CRT on admission, 1,269 (8%) underwent CRT implantation during hospitalization, and 643 (4%) had CRT prescribed at discharge. Compared with patients without CRT, mortality was lower in those who received CRT implantation during HF hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.63; P < 0.0001) and those prescribed CRT at discharge (adjusted HR 0.78; P = 0.048). A reduction in HF re-hospitalization was observed in patients with CRT implanted during hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.64; P < 0.0001), but not in those who were prescribed CRT at discharge (adjusted HR 1.02; P = 0.77).

- **Conclusion**: CRT implantation during HF hospitalization was associated with lower rates of mortality and HF re-hospitalization.

### Cardiac rhythm devices in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction - role, timing, and optimal use in contemporary practice. European Journal of Heart Failure expert consensus document [^115Xn4nY]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Low credibility.

In a patient‐level meta‐analysis of 6,264 patients from eight pivotal CRT trials, CRT was associated with a 23% reduction in all‐cause death. In terms of number needed to treat (NNT) for 3‐year all‐cause mortality, the benefits of CRT, when given on top of optimal medical therapy, are comparable with those of HF medications such as beta‐blockers and MRA, with NNTs of 8 for CRT when given in addition to medical treatment, 9 for beta‐blockers, and 6 for MRA.

A recently completed trial highlights the valuable research still being conducted in this therapeutic arena. With over 3,600 patients randomized in 27 countries, AdaptResponse is the largest global RCT of CRT conducted at the time of writing. It compared standard CRT and adaptive CRT with timed left ventricular stimulation in patients with HF, LBBB, and intact atrioventricular conduction, a population expected to achieve significant disease modification after CRT. At the 5‐year follow-up, adaptive CRT did not significantly reduce the incidence of all‐cause death or interventions for HF decompensation compared with standard CRT, but the overall mortality (16.5% over 5 years) was much lower than reported in previous CRT trials and remained low during follow-up. This reflects a high percentage of optimized HF and the relatively young mean age of the trial participants. Higher mortality rates reported in previous CRT trials may not indicate a lack of disease modification but rather reflect different patient populations and medical treatments.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112g49xh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

A total of 272 entries were retrieved for analysis of titles and abstracts. Of these, 259 were excluded as they were either duplicates or deemed unsuitable for the purpose of our meta-analysis — case reports, editorials, letters, reviews, meta-analyses, or original papers with no comparison between CRT-D and CRT-P. The remaining 13 entries were considered adequate for inclusion in our meta-analysis. A careful review of their reference list provided 2 more entries that were selected after revision of the full text, and 1 additional entry was retrieved after reviewing the reference lists of these 2 studies. Manual searches also provided 2 entries: 2 abstracts. Experts in the field suggested the inclusion of a further article. There was complete agreement between investigators on the inclusion of the selected studies.

- **Results and study characteristics**: The design of selected trials and baseline data are summarized in tables. The final population for this meta-analysis included 12,378 patients (7030 receiving CRT-D and 5348 receiving CRT-P) and 29,799 patient-years of follow-up. One study was a randomized controlled trial, while 2 were sub-analyses of randomized controlled trials. The remaining studies were observational and/or registries. Eight studies were multi-center. Quality assessment of the included studies is shown in tables. All randomized controlled studies had fewer than 6 Delphi criteria, and only 2 cohort studies had a Newcastle-Ottawa score of 7 or higher. Important patient selection biases were observed.

### Cardiac-resynchronization therapy for the prevention of heart-failure events [^114GVogC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The trial was designed to determine whether cardiac-resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacing would reduce the risk of death or heart-failure events in patients with mild cardiac symptoms, a reduced ejection fraction, and a wide QRS complex.

- **Methods**: During a 4.5-year period, 1820 patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 30% or less, a QRS duration of 130 msec or more, and New York Heart Association class I or II symptoms were enrolled and followed. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive CRT plus an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (1089 patients) or an ICD alone (731 patients). The primary endpoint was death from any cause or a nonfatal heart-failure event (whichever came first). Heart-failure events were diagnosed by physicians aware of the treatment assignments, but they were adjudicated by a committee that was unaware of assignments.

- **Results**: During an average follow-up of 2.4 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 187 of 1089 patients in the CRT-ICD group (17.2%) and 185 of 731 patients in the ICD-only group (25.3%) (hazard ratio in the CRT-ICD group, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.84; P = 0.001). The benefit did not differ significantly between patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The superiority of CRT was driven by a 41% reduction in the risk of heart-failure events, a finding that was evident primarily in a prespecified subgroup of patients with a QRS duration of 150 msec or more.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113C2pzC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

We performed searches on MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane databases (from inception to May 31, 2015) using the following search string: "cardiac resynchronization therapy" AND "implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"; "CRT" AND "ICD"; "CRT-D" AND "CRT-P"; "CRT" AND "CRT-D"; "biventricular pacemaker" AND "defibrillator". Reference lists of all accessed full-text articles were searched for sources of potentially relevant information, and experts in the field were contacted about further potentially eligible studies. Authors of full-text papers and congress abstract authors were also contacted via email to retrieve additional information.

Only longitudinal studies performed in humans and written in English were considered for inclusion using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) approach. The population of interest included patients with guideline indication for CRT, and the intervention was CRT implant with or without a defibrillator. Comparisons were performed between patients receiving CRT-D versus CRT-P. The primary outcome was total all-cause mortality, evaluated at the longest follow-up available. In studies with significantly different follow-up durations between device groups, the primary outcome was assessed at the longest follow-up available for both groups simultaneously.

To be eligible, studies should present a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months. Registries, observational studies, and randomized trials were considered eligible for analysis.

### A metric for evaluating the cardiac response to resynchronization therapy [^115azoHr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the response to cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) in patients with mildly symptomatic heart failure (HF) is more favorable than the commonly referenced figure of 70%. This study involves the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT) study population in which paired echocardiograms from baseline and 1-year follow-up were available in 621 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator-treated patients and 749 patients treated with CRT-D. We prespecified CRT-D responders as the patients who, at 1-year follow-up, had a reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) that corresponded to the top (best) quintile of LVESV reduction in the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator-treated patients, that is, a ≥ 17% reduction in LVESV.

Using this metric, 88% of patients treated with CRT-D and 91% of the patients treated with CRT-D with left bundle branch block (LBBB) were identified as cardiac resynchronization therapy responders. Landmark multivariate Cox model analyses revealed a significant interaction (p = 0.038) involving LVESV (responders vs nonresponders) and LBBB (present vs not present) in risk reduction for HF or death. The interaction finding indicates that cardiac resynchronization therapy responders with LBBB have a significantly lower risk for HF or death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.24) than patients without LBBB (HR 0.62). In the patients treated with CRT-D, LVESV response was associated with reduction in the risk of death (HR 0.20, p < 0.001).

### Outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy by New York Heart Association class: A patient-level meta-analysis [^114myLZv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

In this meta-analysis of patient-level data from randomized controlled trials, CRT appeared to be beneficial in improving the time to all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization (HFH), as well as all-cause mortality alone, in patients in NYHA class III as well as those in NYHA class IV. However, given the relatively small number of patients in NYHA class IV, these results highlight the need for further studies on patients in NYHA class IV that are reflective of contemporaneous CRT devices, implantation techniques, and medical therapy for advanced heart failure.

### Cardiac-resynchronization therapy for mild-to-moderate heart failure [^112hB2CB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac-resynchronization therapy (CRT) benefits patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and a wide QRS complex. Most of these patients are candidates for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). We evaluated whether adding CRT to an ICD and optimal medical therapy might reduce mortality and morbidity among such patients.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% or less, and an intrinsic QRS duration of 120 msec or more or a paced QRS duration of 200 msec or more to receive either an ICD alone or an ICD plus CRT. The primary outcome was death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure.

- **Results**: We followed 1,798 patients for a mean of 40 months. The primary outcome occurred in 297 of 894 patients (33.2%) in the ICD-CRT group and 364 of 904 patients (40.3%) in the ICD group (hazard ratio in the ICD-CRT group, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.87; P < 0.001). In the ICD-CRT group, 186 patients died, as compared with 236 in the ICD group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.91; P = 0.003), and 174 patients were hospitalized for heart failure, as compared with 236 in the ICD group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.83; P < 0.001). However, at 30 days after device implantation, adverse events had occurred in 124 patients in the ICD-CRT group, as compared with 58 in the ICD group (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Among patients with NYHA class II or III heart failure, a wide QRS complex, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, CRT in addition to an ICD and optimal medical therapy was associated with a reduction in mortality and morbidity; however, there were more adverse events within 30 days post-implantation in the ICD-CRT group.

### 2021 ESC guidelines on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy [^112tgvJX]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for syncope, specifically in the context of managing reflex syncope through cardiac pacing, the 2021 ESC guidelines recommend performing dual-chamber pacing to reduce syncope recurrence in patients over 40 years old who experience severe and unpredictable syncope. The guidelines apply to patients with any of the following conditions:

- **Spontaneous documented symptomatic asystolic pauses**: Greater than 3 seconds, or asymptomatic pauses greater than 6 seconds, due to sinus arrest or AV block.
- **Cardioinhibitory carotid sinus syndrome**.
- **Asystolic syncope during tilt testing**.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111UAQmB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

We have also shown that the potential benefit of the ICD in CRT patients is not homogeneously seen across different etiologies. Although ischemic cardiomyopathy CRT patients seemed to benefit from the addition of the ICD, such benefit was less clear in those with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Additionally, our meta-regression confirmed an association between ischemic cardiomyopathy and a stronger benefit of the CRT-D. This is a relevant finding, as in our meta-analysis, patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy receiving CRT-P were generally older and had more advanced heart failure and a higher number of comorbidities than non-ischemic CRT-D patients. We would therefore expect a higher mortality in CRT-P patients in both etiologies.

It is known that patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy tend to respond better to CRT. As previously discussed, response to CRT predicts a lower risk of all-cause mortality, ventricular arrhythmias, and by inference, a lower risk of SCD. The same rationale may help explain the association seen in our meta-regression between male gender and a larger benefit of CRT-D compared with CRT-P. Women are known to respond better to CRT than men, and therefore their arrhythmic risk may be lower. This corroborates the results of a previous meta-analysis, which has shown that the benefit of ICD on mortality is significantly higher in men but does not reach statistical significance in women.

- **Limitations**: Several limitations are commonly linked to the methodology of meta-analyses and cross-comparisons, in particular.

### A comparison of cardiac resynchronization by sequential biventricular pacing and left ventricular pacing to simultaneous biventricular pacing: Rationale and design of the DECREASE-HF clinical trial [^111aaAZx]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2005). Low credibility.

The first generation of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices approved for the treatment of heart failure used simultaneous biventricular (BiV) pacing to achieve ventricular resynchronization. Left ventricular pacing alone and sequential BiV pacing also show promise as alternative ways to deliver CRT, but have not been studied together in a large randomized trial.

- **Methods**: The Device Evaluation of CONTAK RENEWAL 2 and EASYTRAK 2: Assessment of Safety and Effectiveness in Heart Failure (DECREASE-HF) Trial is a randomized, double-blind, 3-arm study of patients in New York Heart Association Class III or IV with an ejection fraction of 35% or less and a QRS duration ≥ 150 ms. Patients are randomized to receive either left ventricular pacing, simultaneous BiV pacing, or sequential BiV pacing.

- **Conclusion**: The study uses a novel composite endpoint that combines peak oxygen consumption and left ventricular end systolic dimension, thus combining a measure of symptomatic improvement (peak oxygen consumption) with a physiologic measure of ventricular reverse remodeling (left ventricular end systolic dimension) into a single composite score. Additionally, the safety and effectiveness of the CONTAK RENEWAL 2/4/4HE/EASYTRAK 2 system will be evaluated using heart failure-related adverse events, system-related complications, left ventricular lead-related complications, detection time of induced ventricular fibrillation, and left ventricular lead performance (pacing threshold, pacing impedance, and R-wave amplitude).

### Outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy by New York Heart Association class: A patient-level meta-analysis [^115fPaW8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Data on the benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with severe heart failure symptoms are limited. We investigated the relative effects of CRT in patients with ambulatory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV versus III functional class at the time of device implantation.

- **Methods and results**: In this meta-analysis, we pooled patient-level data from the MIRACLE (Multicenter InSync Randomized Clinical Evaluation), MIRACLE-ICD (Multicenter InSync Implantable Cardioversion Defibrillation Randomized Clinical Evaluation), and COMPANION (Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart Failure) trials. Outcomes evaluated were the time to the composite endpoint of the first heart failure hospitalization or all-cause mortality and the time to all-cause mortality alone. The association between CRT and outcomes was evaluated using a Bayesian hierarchical Weibull survival regression model. We assessed if this association differed between NYHA III and IV groups by adding an interaction term between CRT and NYHA class as a random effect. A sensitivity analysis was performed by including data from RAFT (Resynchronization-Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure). Our pooled analysis included 2309 patients. Overall, CRT was associated with a longer time to heart failure hospitalization or all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.79 [95% credible interval, 0.64–0.99]; posterior probability or P = 0.044) with a similar association with time to all-cause mortality (aHR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.59–1.03]; P = 0.083).

### Cardiogenic shock shortly after initial success of cardiac resynchronization therapy [^113d7cao]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to improve symptoms, exercise capacity, and left ventricular function, as well as reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. Failures following the initial success of this treatment are mostly related to lead dislodgement. Another entirely different reason is presented in this case study.

### How should we optimize cardiac resynchronization therapy [^115Fy5qx]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Optimization of cardiac resynchronization therapy is increasingly performed. Numerous methods have been proposed, many being echocardiographic. Both the technique and the timing of optimization are contentious. Whether acute haemodynamic benefits translate into long-term improvements in remodeling, symptoms, or prognosis is unknown.

Recent guidelines from the American Society of Echocardiography advocate routine optimization. Here, we objectively review the principles, methods, timing, and evidence supporting optimization. Despite limited validation, optimization was included in landmark clinical trials and is inherent in evidence-based practice. Randomized controlled trials comparing methods are needed, with long-term clinical endpoints. For now, optimization should be performed using the iterative method, according to the CARE-HF protocol.

### A randomized double-blind comparison of biventricular versus left ventricular stimulation for cardiac resynchronization therapy: the Biventricular versus Left Univentricular Pacing with ICD Back-up in Heart Failure Patients (B-LEFT HF) trial [^112Ckb9k]. American Heart Journal (2010). High credibility.

Biventricular (BiV) stimulation is the preferred means of delivering cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), although left ventricular (LV)-only stimulation might be as safe and effective. The B-LEFT HF is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study aimed to examine whether LV-only is noninferior to BiV pacing regarding clinical and echocardiographic responses.

- **Methods**: B-LEFT HF randomly assigned 176 CRT-D recipients, in New York Heart Association class III or IV, with an LV ejection fraction or = 130 milliseconds, to a BiV (n = 90) versus LV (n = 86) stimulation group. Clinical status and echocardiograms were analyzed at baseline and 6 months after CRT-D implant to test the noninferiority of LV-only compared with BiV stimulation.

- **Results**: The proportion of responders was in line with literature on CRT, with improvement in heart failure composite score in 76.2% and 74.7% of patients in BiV and LV groups, respectively. Comparing LV versus BiV pacing, the small differences in response rates and corresponding 95% CI indicated that LV pacing was noninferior to BiV pacing for a series of response criteria (combination of improvement in New York Heart Association and reverse remodeling, improvement in heart failure composite score, reduction in LV end-systolic volume of at least 10%), both at intention-to-treat and at per-protocol analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Left ventricular-only pacing is noninferior to BiV pacing in a 6-month follow-up with regard to clinical and echocardiographic responses. Left ventricular pacing may be considered as a viable alternative.

### Gender differences in cardiac resynchronization therapy device choice and outcome in patients ≥ 75 years of age with heart failure [^112bgZqJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established therapy for heart failure and can be delivered through a CRT pacemaker (CRT-P) or a CRT defibrillator (CRT-D). CRT-P devices are smaller, less expensive, have better battery longevity, and have been subject to fewer recalls and advisories, but cannot deliver high-energy shocks to terminate potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. As published guidelines do not distinguish between CRT-P and CRT-D indications, we examined the practice of prescribing these devices in older women and men with heart failure.

A total of 512 CRT recipients (age ≥ 75 years, 26% women, 21% CRT-P) were included in this analysis. Baseline characteristics were collected on all patients, and overall survival was compared by gender and type of CRT device implanted. Women were more likely to receive CRT-Ps than men (26% vs. 19%). Men with CRT-Ps were significantly older than women with CRT-Ps and both men and women with CRT-Ds (p = 0.04). In addition, women had lower all-cause mortality compared with men (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75, confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.99, p = 0.04), mainly among CRT-P recipients (HR 0.48, CI 0.26 to 0.8, p = 0.02). However, this association was attenuated after adjusting for differences in patient characteristics (HR 0.56, CI 0.26 to 1.18, p = 0.13).

In conclusion, women are more likely to receive CRT-Ps than men. Whether this difference is driven by patient preference or physician biases remains unclear. Women with CRT, particularly CRT-Ps, have a better overall survival than men. These differences, which may be driven by unbalanced patient characteristics between groups, warrant further investigation.

### Predictors of clinical outcomes after cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients ≥ 75 years of age: a retrospective cohort study [^113nXEhQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy has been shown to benefit selected patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Older patients have been underrepresented in randomized trials. This study was conducted to determine whether predictive factors for cardiac resynchronization therapy outcomes differ in patients older and younger than 75 years of age.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients who received a cardiac resynchronization device between 2013 and 2016 in our center were retrospectively included in this cohort study. The primary endpoint was cardiac resynchronization therapy effectiveness, defined as survival for one year with no heart failure hospitalization and improvement by one or more NYHA class. The secondary endpoints were mortality, complications, and device therapies.

- **Results**: Among the 243 patients included, 102 were ≥ 75 years old. Cardiac resynchronization therapy effectiveness was observed in 70 patients (50%) < 75 years old and in 48 patients (47%) ≥ 75 years old (p = 0.69). NYHA class ≥ III (OR = 6.02; CI95% [1.33–18.77], p = 0.002) was a predictive factor for cardiac resynchronization therapy effectiveness only in the ≥ 75-year-old group, while atrial fibrillation was independently negatively associated with the primary endpoint in the < 75-year-old group (OR = 0.28; CI95% [0.13–0.62], p = 0.001). The one-year mortality rate was 14%, with no difference between age groups. Rescue cardiac resynchronization therapy and atrial fibrillation were independent predictive factors for mortality in both age groups.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114CAFKm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

- **Rationale for the use of the ICD in CRT patients**: Before the era of heart failure (HF) management, patients more often died of sudden cardiac death (SCD) at an earlier phase of their disease. State-of-the-art treatments have led to delayed HF progression and a reduced risk of death from both progressive pump dysfunction and SCD. However, although the proportion of sudden death relative to the overall mortality decreases with increasing HF severity, the risk of SCD in HF patients remains significant. The prophylactic implantation of the ICD seems the logical step to further reduce all-cause mortality through a reduction in arrhythmic mortality. It is noteworthy, though, that sudden death may still account for 7% to 20% of all deaths among ICD and CRT-D patients. Some cases are the result of nonarrhythmic causes such as cerebrovascular events, pulmonary embolism, or an occlusive coronary thrombus; others may result from postshock pulseless electrical activity, incessant or refractory ventricular arrhythmias, and shock failure. In SCD-HeFT, 20% of total deaths in the ICD group were classified as sudden deaths presumed to be ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but the ICD was still able to prevent approximately 60% of all sudden deaths compared with placebo, a similar reduction to that achieved in the Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart Failure (COMPANION) trial.

With or without a defibrillator, treatment with a CRT device has been shown to decrease both morbidity and mortality risk in patients with NYHA Class II-IV heart failure.

### Review of eligibility for cardiac resynchronization therapy [^112Z48z9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is underused. Recent guidelines have expanded indications for CRT to include less severe symptoms but now favor left bundle branch block morphology in patients with moderate QRS prolongation. The prevalence of CRT eligibility according to historical criteria and guidelines is uncertain. The aim of this review was to identify and synthesize all existing published research reporting the prevalence of CRT eligibility.

A systematic review of electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, was performed. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients eligible for CRT according to historical criteria and guidelines. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of eligibility: ejection fraction, symptoms, and QRS duration and morphology. Eligibility estimates were pooled using random-effects models due to marked heterogeneity in between-study variance.

Thirty studies were identified. No study used guideline criteria. Based on historical criteria, 11 ± 3% of ambulatory and 9 ± 3% of hospitalized patients are eligible for CRT. However, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II in guidelines is at least as frequent as NYHA III or IV. Approximately one-third of patients have QRS prolongation, two-thirds of whom have left bundle branch block. Only a few patients have non-left bundle branch block with QRS duration < 150 ms. Medical contraindication or ineligibility was rarely assessed.

In conclusion, estimates of need are outdated. Inclusion of milder symptoms is potentially indicated.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation: results from the Resynchronization for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) [^114yryFQ]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) prolongs survival in patients with systolic heart failure and QRS prolongation; however, most trials excluded patients with permanent atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods and results**: The Resynchronization for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) randomized patients to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or ICD+CRT, stratified by the presence of permanent atrial fibrillation. Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation were randomized to CRT-ICD (n = 114) or ICD (n = 115). Patients receiving a CRT-ICD were similar to those receiving an ICD in terms of age (71.6 ± 7.3 versus 70.4 ± 7.7 years), left ventricular ejection fraction (22.9 ± 5.3% versus 22.3 ± 5.1%), and QRS duration (151.0 ± 23.6 versus 153.4 ± 24.7 ms). There was no difference in the primary outcome of death or heart failure hospitalization between those assigned to CRT-ICD versus ICD (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.65–1.41; P = 0.82). Cardiovascular death was similar between treatment arms (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.55–1.71; P = 0.91); however, there was a trend for fewer heart failure hospitalizations with CRT-ICD (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–1.01; P = 0.052). The change in 6-minute hall walk duration between baseline and 12 months was not different between treatment arms (CRT-ICD: 19 ± 84 m versus ICD: 16 ± 76 m; P = 0.88). Patients treated with CRT-ICD showed a trend for a greater improvement in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure score between baseline and 6 months (CRT-ICD: 41 ± 21 to 31 ± 21; ICD: 33 ± 20 to 28 ± 20; P = 0.057).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation who are ot (Note: Text appears truncated in original; unable to complete.)

### Timing of cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation in heart failure patients and its association with outcomes [^1175o7XZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The primary finding of this analysis is that CRT implantation during heart failure (HF) hospitalization is associated with lower all‐cause mortality and reduced HF re-hospitalization rates compared with patients who do not receive CRT. Clinical benefit is greater when CRT is implanted during HF hospitalization compared with when it is prescribed at discharge. These data suggest that a CRT utilization strategy that does not delay implantation to the post-discharge period following HF hospitalization may be appropriate.

Patients who require hospitalization for HF despite having CRT already in place had worse outcomes compared with patients with no CRT. This observation is likely explained by these patients representing a particularly high-risk subgroup.

Landmark trials and clinical practice guidelines do not address the optimal timing of CRT implantation relative to hospitalization for HF. Randomized trials should aim to identify the appropriate timing of CRT implantation relative to HF hospitalization, as well as specific characteristics that may affect patients' ability to derive the intended benefits of CRT.

### Can cardiac resynchronization therapy be used as a tool to reduce sudden cardiac arrest risk [^116CiRY7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with cardiomyopathy and reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction are at risk of heart failure (HF) symptoms and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). In selected HF patients, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) provides LV reverse remodeling and improves cellular and molecular function. However, controversial results have been published regarding the effect of CRT on the residual ventricular arrhythmia risk. Indeed, the decrease in SCA risk is inconsistent, and some factors strongly influence the residual post-implantation arrhythmic risk. Conversely, a proarrhythmic effect of CRT has been previously described.

In this review, we aim to describe the relationship between CRT implantation and the SCA risk decrease. We also discuss the patients who only require cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemaker and those who need a concomitant implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

### Appropriateness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator device implants in the United States [^112CAfqg]. Heart Rhythm (2024). High credibility.

The appropriate use criteria (AUCs) are a diverse group of indications aimed to better evaluate the benefits of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy. The purpose of this study was to quantify the proportion of ICD and cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) implants as appropriate, may be appropriate (MA), or rarely appropriate (RA) on the basis of the AUC guidelines.

- **Methods**: This is a multicenter retrospective study of patients within the National Cardiovascular Data Registry undergoing ICD implantation between April 2018 and March 2019 at over 1500 U.S. hospitals. The appropriateness of ICD implants was adjudicated using the AUC.

- **Results**: Of 309,318 ICDs, 241,438 were primary prevention implants (78.1%) and 67,880 secondary prevention implants (21.9%); 243,532 (79%) were mappable to the AUC. For primary prevention, 185,431 ICDs (96.4%) were appropriate, 5660 (2.9%) MA, and 1205 (0.6%) RA. For secondary prevention, 47,498 ICDs (92.7%) were appropriate, 2581 (5%) MA, and 1157 (2.3%) RA. A significant number of RA devices were implanted in patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure who were ineligible for advanced therapies (53.9%) and those with myocardial infarction within 40 days (18.1%). The appropriateness of the pacing lead was more variable, with 48,470 dual-chamber ICD implants (62%) being classified as appropriate, 29,209 (37.4%) MA, and 448 (0.6%) RA. Among CRT-D implants, 63,848 (82.2%) were appropriate, 9900 (12.7%) MA, and 3940 (5.1%) RA.

### Upgrades from a previous device compared to de novo cardiac resynchronization therapy in the European Society of Cardiology CRT Survey II [^111KWRCB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, there are no data from randomized controlled studies on the benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) when implanted as an upgrade in patients with a previous device as compared to de novo CRT. In the CRT Survey II, we compared the baseline data of patients upgraded to CRT (CRT-P/CRT-D) from a previous pacemaker (PM) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to de novo CRT implantation.

- **Methods and results**: In the European CRT Survey II, clinical practice data of patients undergoing CRT and/or ICD implantation across 42 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) countries were collected between October 2015 and December 2016. Out of a total of 11,088 patients, 2,396 (23.2%) were upgraded from a previous PM or ICD, and 7,933 (76.8%) underwent de novo implantation. Compared to de novo implantations, upgraded patients were older, more often male, more frequently had ischaemic heart failure aetiology, atrial fibrillation, reduced renal function, worse heart failure symptoms, and higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Upgraded patients were more often PM-dependent and less frequently received CRT-D. Total peri-procedural, in-hospital complications and length of hospital stay were similar. Upgraded patients were less frequently treated with heart failure medication at discharge.

- **Conclusion**: Despite a lack of evidence-based data, close to one-quarter of all CRT implantations across 42 ESC countries were upgrades from a previous PM or ICD. Despite older age and worse symptoms, the CRT implantation procedures in upgraded patients were equivalent to those of de novo implantations.

### Keys to successful cardiac resynchronization therapy [^115pGmvW]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves functional status in selected groups of patients with heart failure and has achieved widespread use. However, approximately one-third of patients fail to benefit from CRT. Many of these failures can be attributed to improper patient selection, suboptimal left ventricular lead placement, device programming, and inadequate medical therapy. This article addresses these issues and proposes an approach to improving the results of CRT.

### Comparative cost analysis of implanting devices in different cardiac resynchronization therapeutic strategies [^1158oztY]. Clinical cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is considered an effective treatment for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), broad QRS duration, left bundle branch block (LBBB) QRS morphology, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%. CRT based on conventional biventricular pacing (BVP) has been studied in many clinical trials and is associated with improved hospitalization and mortality rates among heart failure (HF) patients. BVP can achieve cardiac electromechanical resynchronization and is the cornerstone of CRT.

Although BVP-based CRT is widely accepted, the implant rate of CRT in HF patients who are indicated for CRT and successfully treated is very low. Lars and colleagues reported that only 21.4% of HF patients accepted CRT (841 patients accepted CRT among 3,935 patients who were indicated for CRT) according to results from the Swedish Heart Failure Registry. In addition to the technical difficulty of BVP-based CRT operation, the high cost of triple-chamber pacemakers is also an important factor that limits their application. Unfortunately, many economically disadvantaged patients have to give up reasonable treatment due to their inability to afford the high cost of CRT. In the end, they have to endure the suffering caused by heart failure or even death.

Fortunately, the His-Purkinje system pacing (HPSP), developed recently, has been proven to achieve cardiac resynchronization. More importantly, it can achieve ventricular synchronous contraction by using conventional pacemakers (dual-chamber or single-chamber pacemakers).

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114S7Xsv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a widely used treatment for patients with heart failure, interventricular conduction delay, and optimized medical therapy. With or without a defibrillator, CRT has been shown to decrease both morbidity and mortality in selected patients with heart failure and severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has also been shown to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in both ischemic and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Patients with an indication for CRT typically also fulfill the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) inclusion criteria and are therefore candidates for an ICD.

Although we would expect CRT-Ds to be advantageous because SCD is frequently a cause of death in patients with heart failure, data from randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and registries have not provided clear support for the advantage of CRT-Ds over CRT-Ps in that setting. Among other possible issues, lack of statistical power may be one of the possible causes of this uncertain benefit.

An adequately powered randomized controlled trial on CRT-D versus CRT-P is very unlikely to be performed in the near future, and therefore, a meta-analysis is the most adequate method to address this subject. The meta-analysis by Jiang et al. provided valuable insight, but several studies comparing CRT-D with CRT-P have been published since its publication.

### Established and evolving indications for cardiac resynchronisation [^114dQ6CD]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

Randomised trials involving a large number of patients have demonstrated the benefits of cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) in patients with heart failure who have failed optimal medical treatment. Echocardiography plays an important role in defining dyssynchrony, which is key to optimal patient selection. The electrocardiographic criteria for patient selection is supplemented by the finding of dyssynchrony on Doppler myocardial imaging, and echocardiography with Doppler myocardial imaging may eventually replace the electrocardiographic criteria for selecting patients who derive benefit from CRT.

### Effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy with implantable cardioverter defibrillator versus cardiac resynchronization therapy with pacemaker on mortality in heart failure patients: Results of a high-volume, single-centre experience [^114nu63s]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

This may be the reason why several meta-analyses comparing the efficacy of CRT-D over CRT-P in patients with a primary indication for CRT have failed to show an incremental benefit of adding defibrillation therapy to CRT. The risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death may be sufficiently reduced with CRT-P alone. Furthermore, CRT-D devices have a significantly higher cost, and their widespread use remains limited, especially in emerging countries that have fixed budgets for healthcare and where healthcare utilization is based on cost–benefit analysis. In addition, the complex design of defibrillator leads presents additional challenges, including a higher risk of lead failure in the CRT-D systems.

Despite these concerns, there is currently no consensus on which patients could be considered for CRT-P alone. Physicians need to estimate costs, benefits, and risks based on individual patients. Clinicians in many countries face challenges in reimbursement of CRT devices, and expected future healthcare reforms will lead to additional scrutiny of expensive medical device therapies. Until clinical guidelines or consensus statements become available, our results may help clinicians identify patients in whom CRT-P alone may be sufficiently effective in reducing adverse outcomes.

Our results are novel and provocative, suggesting that CRT-D does not have an incremental benefit over CRT-P in the reduction of all-cause mortality in non-ischemic patients. Only patients with ischemic etiology of cardiomyopathy showed a significant reduction in mortality with an implanted CRT-D.
