Low lymphocytes

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing low lymphocyte counts, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true lymphopenia and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should classify severity and consider age-specific reference intervals. Next, I will build a prioritized differential diagnosis, followed by targeted diagnostic testing. After that, I need to assess prognostic implications across conditions. Finally, I will outline management strategies, monitoring, and special-population considerations, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and key studies as I go [^notfound].

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its severity; I should verify that the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is truly low on repeat testing, because transient fluctuations and lab variability are common, and I need to ensure I am using the correct units and reference ranges, typically ALC < 1.5 × 10^9/L in adults, while remembering that older adults may have lower normal values and fixed cutoffs can misclassify healthy elderly as lymphopenic, so I should consider age-specific intervals when interpreting a borderline result [^11199VgT] [^116jWczt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should exclude spurious causes before labeling someone as lymphopenic, including hemodilution from IV fluids, sample handling issues, and transient stress-related redistribution, and I should double-check for medications that deplete lymphocytes such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, mycophenolate, cladribine, and dimethyl fumarate, as well as recent vaccinations or acute infections that can transiently lower counts, because correcting these factors may resolve the abnormality without further workup [^1131MS8g] [^114xQdKa] [^112taEiX] [^112MfAko] [^112gmNu4] [^114rdiXE].

> Next, I should review the clinical context carefully; I need to check for symptoms and signs of immunodeficiency such as recurrent or opportunistic infections, constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and autoimmune features, and I should confirm timing relative to acute illness, recent procedures, or new medications, because this frames pretest probabilities and guides the urgency of evaluation and the breadth of the differential [^114GHXNU].

> I will now examine severity stratification; mild lymphopenia is commonly 1.0–1.5 × 10^9/L, moderate 0.5–1.0 × 10^9/L, and severe less than 0.5 × 10^9/L, and I should confirm that persistent lymphopenia, especially severe, carries greater clinical significance and may warrant more aggressive evaluation and monitoring, including consideration of prophylaxis in select contexts [^notfound].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis systematically; primary hematologic causes include HIV infection, primary immunodeficiencies such as SCID or idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia, and lymphoproliferative disorders like CLL, secondary causes include viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2, CMV, EBV, and hepatitis, autoimmune diseases like SLE and sarcoidosis, medications as above, nutritional deficiencies, and bone marrow failure syndromes, and I should prioritize HIV testing, medication review, and infection screening early because they are common and actionable [^112vVCye] [^111nWLyo] [^114ajrsU] [^115HgEi7] [^116jWczt] [^113rv6Jb].

> Wait, let me verify the approach to HIV-related lymphopenia; CD4 T-cell lymphopenia is the hallmark, and I should confirm HIV status and, if positive, stage disease by CD4 count and percentage, recognizing that CD4 counts are variable and that percentage may be more stable in settings like splenectomy or HTLV-1 coinfection, and I need to remember that persistent low CD4 despite viral suppression increases risks of AIDS and non-AIDS events, guiding prophylaxis and close monitoring [^116kZkpy] [^116hhFGf] [^113Ztuz3] [^114ajrsU].

> Next, I should review targeted diagnostic testing; I need to ensure HIV testing with confirmatory assays, obtain a peripheral smear to look for abnormal lymphocyte morphology or blasts, consider flow cytometry for lymphocyte subsets when primary immunodeficiency or lymphoproliferative disease is suspected, and add targeted labs such as ANA for SLE, ACE and chest imaging for sarcoidosis, and viral serologies as indicated, while avoiding low-yield tests unless the pretest probability is meaningful [^114GHXNU] [^115HgEi7] [^113rv6Jb].

> I should double-check prognostic implications across conditions; in sepsis, lymphopenia correlates with severity and mortality and persistent low counts predict worse outcomes, in COVID-19, lower lymphocytes track with severity and mortality, in heart failure cohorts, low lymphocyte count independently predicts mortality and adverse events, and in the general population, lymphopenia associates with higher long-term mortality even after adjusting for traditional risk factors, so I need to communicate risk and align follow-up intensity accordingly [^112s5yLD] [^113H5Veo] [^111t6zFG] [^113z3i4m] [^111Ge6pq] [^114UMVyP] [^112mA54Y] [^114bcCGH] [^114Saihn].

> Hold on, I should verify management principles; the cornerstone is to treat the underlying cause, such as initiating ART for HIV, stopping or substituting offending drugs like dimethyl fumarate or cladribine when feasible, managing autoimmune disease activity, and correcting nutritional deficits, and I need to ensure supportive care with infection precautions, vaccination updates, and antimicrobial prophylaxis when indicated, especially for patients with severe lymphopenia or HIV with low CD4 counts [^1176iZ19] [^114ajrsU] [^114xQdKa] [^1131MS8g] [^114dGBCj].

> Let me think about monitoring; I should confirm that for drug-induced lymphopenia, recovery can be slow and dose dependent, with dimethyl fumarate–associated lymphopenia taking weeks to months to normalize after discontinuation, so I need to continue CBC monitoring until recovery and individualize decisions about rechallenge, and for HIV, I should monitor CD4 responses to ART and adjust opportunistic infection prophylaxis as counts recover [^114xQdKa] [^112gmNu4] [^112taEiX] [^112MfAko] [^111kZAK7].

> But wait, what if the patient is on immune checkpoint inhibitors; I should confirm that low-grade lymphopenia generally does not require stopping therapy, whereas grade 4 lymphopenia warrants continuing ICPI and initiating MAC and Pneumocystis prophylaxis with CMV screening and HIV testing if not done, and I should also consider secondary hypogammaglobulinemia during B-cell–targeted therapies and monitor immunoglobulins and infections accordingly [^1117VWXr] [^114H1a8p].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed; in older adults, I should apply age-specific reference intervals to avoid overdiagnosis, in pediatrics, persistent T-cell lymphopenia detected on newborn screening mandates prompt evaluation for SCID, and in pregnancy, low CD4 counts are common in HIV and may necessitate integrated PMTCT and opportunistic infection planning, so I should tailor thresholds and actions to age and context [^11199VgT] [^1111CzUh] [^115mQCVt].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure nothing is missing; confirm true lymphopenia on repeat testing, exclude spurious causes, classify severity with attention to age, build a prioritized differential with early HIV testing and medication review, pursue targeted diagnostics based on pretest probability, communicate prognostic implications to guide follow-up intensity, treat the cause with supportive care and prophylaxis when indicated, and monitor recovery with attention to drug-specific kinetics and HIV CD4 responses, adjusting plans as new data emerge [^116kZkpy] [^114ajrsU] [^114xQdKa].

Low lymphocytes, or lymphopenia, are defined as an **absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < 1,000/µL in adults** [^115kR8jN] and reflect reduced immune competence. Common causes include viral infections (notably HIV, COVID-19 [^113z3i4m], hepatitis), autoimmune diseases (SLE, sarcoidosis), malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia), and medications (chemotherapy, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants) [^112vVCye]. Persistent lymphopenia increases **risk of infections** [^114ajrsU], including opportunistic pathogens, and correlates with worse outcomes in sepsis [^113H5Veo], COVID-19 [^113z3i4m], and cancer [^116ZBYMJ]. Evaluation should include CBC with differential, HIV testing, autoimmune screening, and medication review; management targets the underlying cause, with supportive care and infection prophylaxis as indicated [^1117VWXr].

---

## Definition and normal ranges

Lymphopenia is defined as an ALC < 1,000/µL in adults; normal ranges are **1,000–4,800/µL** [^115kR8jN]. Severity is often categorized as mild (800–999/µL), moderate (500–799/µL), and severe (< 500/µL).

---

## Causes of low lymphocyte count

Lymphopenia has diverse etiologies, including:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infections | - HIV <br/> - COVID-19 [^113z3i4m] <br/> - hepatitis B/C <br/> - tuberculosis <br/> - sepsis [^113H5Veo] |
| Autoimmune diseases | - systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [^113rv6Jb] <br/> - sarcoidosis [^115HgEi7] <br/> - rheumatoid arthritis [^114XkHCx] |
| Malignancies | - lymphoma <br/> - leukemia <br/> - multiple myeloma |
| Medications | - chemotherapy <br/> - corticosteroids <br/> - immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate, mycophenolate) [^116jWczt] <br/> - dimethyl fumarate [^114xQdKa] |
| Nutritional deficiencies | - protein-calorie malnutrition <br/> - zinc deficiency |
| Genetic disorders | - severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) [^1111CzUh] <br/> - DiGeorge syndrome <br/> - telomere biology disorders [^114DWDCo] |
| Other causes | - radiation therapy <br/> - stress/exercise <br/> - aging [^11199VgT] |

## Clinical significance and health implications

Lymphopenia reflects impaired adaptive immunity, increasing susceptibility to infections — particularly opportunistic pathogens — and is associated with worse outcomes in multiple conditions:

- **Increased infection risk**: Higher susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, including opportunistic pathogens [^112vVCye].
- **Poor prognosis in critical illness**: Linked to worse outcomes in sepsis [^113H5Veo], COVID-19 [^113z3i4m], and cancer [^116ZBYMJ].
- **Autoimmune disease association**: Common in SLE [^113rv6Jb] and sarcoidosis [^115HgEi7], reflecting immune dysregulation.
- **Malignancy risk**: Persistent lymphopenia may signal hematologic malignancies (e.g. lymphoma, leukemia).

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach includes:

- **Confirm lymphopenia**: Repeat CBC with differential to verify persistent low ALC [^notfound].
- **Infection screening**: HIV testing, hepatitis serologies, COVID-19 testing, tuberculosis screening.
- **Autoimmune evaluation**: ANA, anti-dsDNA, rheumatoid factor, ACE (sarcoidosis) [^notfound].
- **Medication review**: Identify lymphocyte-lowering drugs (e.g. corticosteroids, immunosuppressants) [^116jWczt].
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray/CT for sarcoidosis, lymphoma, or tuberculosis.
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Consider if malignancy or marrow infiltration is suspected.

---

## Management strategies

Management centers on **treating the underlying cause**:

- **Treat underlying condition**: Initiate ART for HIV, immunosuppression for autoimmune disease, or chemotherapy for malignancy.
- **Medication adjustment**: Stop or modify lymphocyte-lowering drugs when feasible [^114xQdKa].
- **Supportive care**: Provide infection prophylaxis (e.g. Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis) and vaccinations as indicated [^1117VWXr].
- **Monitoring**: Track ALC and clinical status regularly; persistent severe lymphopenia may warrant hematology referral.

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the cause, severity, and treatment response. Persistent severe lymphopenia (< 500/µL) confers **high infection risk** and poor outcomes in critical illness and malignancy, whereas correction of the underlying cause and immune recovery improve prognosis.

---

Low lymphocytes reflect reduced immune competence and require a structured evaluation to identify and treat the cause, with supportive measures to reduce infection risk and improve outcomes.

### Lower lymphocyte count is associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease [^116t98XM]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

PD is known to have a long latency between biological onset and clinical presentation. As such, a proportion of the incident PD cases included may have been clinically incident hut biologically prevalent at the time of recruitment. We cannot be certain that lymphopenia precedes biological disease onset and it could therefore be a marker of preclinical PD. Alternatively, the association might arise as a result of a shared, potentially genetic, cause. Hence, we are limited in our ability to conclude that lower lymphocyte count mechanistically drives PD pathogenesis from this study. Nonetheless, there is evidence to support a mechanistic link between lower lymphocyte count and PD. Studies in patients with PD have demonstrated blood–brain barrier compromise in the vicinity of the midbrain and increased T-cells infiltrating affected brain regions.CD4 + T-cell counts in the amygdala correlate with activated microglia and alpha-synuclein pathology, suggesting a causative role for infiltrating T-cells in propagating neurodegeneration. Thus, reductions in peripheral lymphocyte counts in incident PD may reflect migration of T-cells into the central nervous system (CNS).

### Low eosinophil and low lymphocyte counts and the incidence of 12 cardiovascular diseases: a CALIBER cohort study [^111nxGqW]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main findings

In a general population without pre-existing cardiovascular disease, we found that low eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were associated with increased short-term incidence of heart failure, unheralded coronary death and ventricular arrhythmia/sudden cardiac death as the initial presentation of cardiovascular disease, and of non-cardiovascular death. Previous studies have suggested such associations among patients with pre-existing heart failure, but our study is the first to demonstrate them in a healthy population. We also demonstrated lack of association with other cardiovascular diseases such as angina, non-fatal MI and stroke.

Possible explanations

Eosinophils and lymphocytes are two different classes of immune cells with very different functions, so it seems remarkable that they have a similar pattern of association with specific cardiovascular diseases. As this is an observational study, residual confounding cannot be excluded, but low eosinophil and low lymphocyte counts were not associated with major cardiovascular disease risk factors (table 1, see online supplementary tables S4 and S5) and our associations were robust to a range of multivariable adjustments. Reverse causation (eg, patients developing low eosinophil count as a consequence of undiagnosed heart failure) is also an unlikely explanation for our findings, because we obtained consistent results in a sensitivity analysis excluding patients on loop diuretics. One explanation for our findings is that low eosinophil and lymphocyte counts may be markers of frailty, malnutritionor immune suppression, which increase the risk of specific cardiovascular diseases and non-cardiovascular death. Another potential explanation is that high levels of endogenous mineralocorticoids increase the risk of heart failure via sodium retention, and also suppress eosinophil and lymphocyte counts (adrenal insufficiency may be associated with eosinophiliaand lymphocytosis). A third explanation involves interleukin-5 (IL-5), which mediates the release of eosinophils into the bloodstreamand is involved in differentiation of B lymphocytes to immunoglobulin-secreting cells. Variants in the IL-5 gene are associated with coronary artery disease, and in mouse studies macrophage-specific overexpression of IL-5 led to increased secretion of IgM antibodies that inhibit uptake of oxidised low-density lipoprotein, with consequent inhibition of atherosclerosis. In cross-sectional studies, blood levels of IL-5 were strongly associated with eosinophil countsand decreased subclinical atherosclerosis, and cohort studies among critical care patients found that higher IL-5 was associated with better outcomes. We are not aware of any longitudinal cohort studies among the general population which have investigated the association of IL-5 and cardiovascular events; we hypothesise that such an association exists.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114ajrsU]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Prevention of clinical consequences — persistently low CD4 counts despite viral suppression: With continuous ART and viral suppression, life expectancy for people with HIV is approaching that of people without HIV; however, persistently low CD4 counts despite ART-mediated viral suppression are associated with higher rates of both AIDS and non–AIDS-related morbidity and mortality over the long term, so reducing AIDS- and non–AIDS-related morbidity and mortality remains a cornerstone of HIV treatment and is especially important for people with suboptimal CD4 recovery; risk for opportunistic infections (OIs) is generally low for people on ART with viral suppression, but some primary or secondary prophylaxis may need to be extended for certain OIs among people who do not experience CD4 recovery above certain thresholds.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113Ztuz3]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Clinical consequences — persistently low CD4 counts on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) are linked to adverse outcomes, with cohorts showing that individuals with CD4 counts ≤ 200 cells/mm3 despite at least 3 years of suppressive ART had a 2.6-fold greater risk of mortality, and a multicenter cohort found those whose counts remained < 200 cells/mm3 after 2 years of ART had a 4.6-fold greater risk of mortality than those with CD4 > 500 cells/mm3; people with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 despite at least 1 year of suppressive ART are at increased risk of AIDS-related and non–AIDS-related events, including infection-related cancers where people with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 had a 3.5-fold higher risk compared to CD4 ≥ 500 cells/mm3, and CD4 count < 350 cells/mm3 was associated with non–AIDS-defining, smoking-related, and other malignancies.

### Is frequent CD4 + T-lymphocyte count monitoring necessary for persons with counts ≥ 300 cells / μ L and HIV-1 suppression? [^117YNJmc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), those with HIV-1 RNA < 200 copies/mL and CD4 counts ≥ 300 cells/µL had a 97.1% probability of maintaining durable CD4 ≥ 200 cells/µL for 4 years. When non-HIV causes of CD4 lymphopenia were excluded, the probability rose to 99.2%. Our data support less frequent CD4 monitoring during viral suppression.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^112s5yLD]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphopenia is also hypothesized to be a potential cause or consequence of CAP, potentially associated with chronic illnesses, critical illnesses, lymphocyte adherence to vascular endothelium, or extensive migration to the lungs. A lymphocyte count below 1,000/µL may be an independent biomarker for a 30-day mortality rate in CAP patients. For patients in the L-CAP study, a lymphocyte count under 724/mm³ doubled the risk of in-hospital death within 30 days. Therefore, lymphopenia markedly correlates with higher ICU admission risks and in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates in CAP patients compounded with sepsis. Early identification of lymphopenia may facilitate pinpointing CAP septic patients who are in urgent or impending need of intensive care. A significant correlation was observed between a lymphocyte count below the usual lower limit and the mortality rate in a study involving 3099 COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the lymphocyte count was exceedingly low (less than 5% of white blood cells) in deceased individuals. In contrast, it remained within normal ranges (more than 20% of white blood cells) in survivors with moderate illness.

L-CAP is characterized by CD4 depletion, a higher inflammatory response, and low IgG2 levels that correlate with greater severity at presentation and worse prognosis. Earlier, both reduced T-lymphocyte counts and reduced IgG levels were reported to be associated with the poor prognosis of severe CAP. In addition, the researchers also found that the severity of CAP was associated with decreased serum immunoglobulin levels (including total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2) and that low levels of immunoglobulins were independently associated with ICU admission and 30-day mortality. Lymphopenia leading to reduced immunoglobulin levels is predictable. A recent study found that TNF-α was significantly lower in gradable lymphopenia compared to non-lymphopenia and that a lower TNF-α baseline may lead to a reduced number of B-cells and immature B-cells, which can result in lower immunoglobulin levels. Immunoglobulin deficiency is also an indicator of severity in COVID-19 patients, and i.v. administration of IgG can mitigate virus-induced immunosuppression and provide passive immune protection against a broad range of pathogens.

The results of the above studies collectively show that lymphopenia is strongly associated with higher mortality rates, substantiating its role as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients. Notably, in studies significantly correlated with the probability of death on day 28, over 30% of patients exhibited lymphopenia, correlated with aggravated prognosis associated with profound T-cell lymphopenia.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^113H5Veo]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis, a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection damages host tissues and organs, imposes a substantial global pathological burden. Recent estimates suggest that sepsis affects nearly 50 million people worldwide each year, leading to high mortality rates and huge healthcare costs. Despite substantial advances in medical science, sepsis continues to represent a significant public health challenge, necessitating innovative strategies to mitigate its global impact.

Lymphopenia, alternatively termed lymphocytopenia, delineates a pathological state characterized by a diminished concentration of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The etiology of lymphopenia encompasses a range of factors, including infections, autoimmune disorders, pharmacological interventions, and exposure to radiation therapy. The relationship between lymphopenia and sepsis has been extensively studied, and in particular, sepsis-induced lymphopenia is gradually being recognized as an essential factor in the prognosis of sepsis. Sepsis-induced lymphopenia is usually defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of less than 1,000 cells/µL. Several studies have also provided individualized threshold data, e.g. the persistence with the lymphopenia cut-off value (< 760 cells/µL) > 3 days in non-viral infection-related sepsis indicates a higher 28-day mortality rate, and severe lymphopenia in sepsis was previously defined as an ALC of less than 500/µL. However, despite the significant progress in this field, numerous unresolved issues still require urgent attention (Table 1). In addition, altering myeloid cell numbers during sepsis is a relatively complex and diverse process. This issue has been discussed by others and is beyond the scope of this review.

Table 1
Established knowledge and unanswered questions about sepsis-induced lymphopenia

Notably, sepsis-induced lymphopenia has been associated with worse outcomes, including increased risk of secondary infections, multiple organ failure, and death. Given the widespread role of lymphopenia in sepsis, there is a growing recognition of the potential practical significance of treatments that address lymphopenia. The main controversies and challenges faced by the medical community in addressing these questions include the complexity of the immune response in sepsis, the difficulty of distinguishing cause and effect in observational studies, and the lack of specific treatments. Moreover, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the scenario, resulting in an increased incidence of sepsis cases. This rise is coupled with the pandemic's tendency to cause lymphopenia, which merits additional investigation to unravel the intricate pathophysiological pathways in sepsis.

### Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia [^112vVCye]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A severe decrease of CD4 T cells predisposes humans to opportunistic infections. In adults, HIV is certainly the most common cause of CD4 lymphocytopenia, but other causes, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive therapy, lymphoma and idiopathic forms need to be considered. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the poorly understood syndrome of idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia.

Recent Findings

Little research has tried to systematically dissect this probably heterogeneic syndrome after its initial description in 1992. Numerous cases presenting with opportunistic infections have been reported. Disturbed differentiation of stem cell precursors may contribute to CD4 lymphocytopenia. Because infections and lymphoma may also cause CD4 lymphocytopenia, the distinction between cause and effect may evolve only during follow-up.

Summary

The manifestation of opportunistic infections calls for the evaluation of the immune system for CD4 lymphocytopenia. The differential diagnosis of this condition in adults comprises primarily HIV infection and less often other diseases or drugs. Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is very rare. The clinical significance of low CD4 cell counts in HIV negative patients still awaits its systematic analysis. Prophylaxis of opportunistic infections is oriented at the recommendations of HIV-infected individuals and causal treatment remains experimental.

### Age-related decline in lymphocyte counts: establishing age-specific reference intervals for clinical practice [^11199VgT]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Applying a fixed lymphocyte count reference interval to all adults, potentially misclassifying healthy elderly individuals as lymphopenic and contributing to unnecessary investigations and anxiety.

### Low eosinophil and low lymphocyte counts and the incidence of 12 cardiovascular diseases: a CALIBER cohort study [^114rdiXE]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Exposure

The main exposures were eosinophil and lymphocyte counts as recorded in primary care. If a patient had more than one measurement on a given day, the values were aggregated by taking the mean. We analysed eosinophil and lymphocyte counts as categorical variables in order to avoid presuming a particular shape for the association with cardiovascular diseases. There were no clinically obvious cutpoints or consistent definitions of 'normal' lymphocyte or eosinophil counts in the literature. In the absence of a clear rationale for choosing specific cutpoints, we chose to study quintiles; however, the number of decimal places varied between laboratories (units: cells×10 9 /L) and the absolute values of eosinophil counts were small relative to the precision of recording (see online supplementary figure S1). In order to avoid biasing the category allocation by precision, we manually adjusted the eosinophil category boundaries, so that the second decimal place was 5, thus ensuring that any values recorded to two decimal places would end up in the same category if they were recorded to only one decimal place. We derived quintile-based categories for lymphocyte counts by a similar method. All category intervals were closed at the lower bound and open at the upper bound, that is, '0.05 to 0.15' includes 0.05 but not 0.15.

Eosinophil and lymphocyte counts can be affected by many factors such as infections, autoimmune diseases, medication and haematological conditions. We sought to differentiate between a patient's long-term 'stable' leucocyte profile and results obtained when the patient had an 'acute' condition which may alter leucocyte counts. We used other information in the electronic health record to assess whether the patient was clinically 'acute' or 'stable' at the time of the blood test, adapting a set of criteria proposed by the eMERGE consortium(electronic Medical Records and Genomics) for studying genetic determinants of the stable leucocyte counts: in hospital on the date of blood test, vaccination in the previous 7 days, anaemia diagnosis within the previous 30 days, symptoms or diagnosis of infection within the previous 30 days, prior diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, prior diagnosis of haemoglobinopathy, cancer chemotherapy or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) within 6 months before index date, or the use of drugs affecting the immune system such as methotrexate or steroids within the previous 3 months. Patients with HIV, splenectomy or on dialysis were excluded from this study, as their leucocyte counts may be difficult to interpret.

### Low eosinophil and low lymphocyte counts and the incidence of 12 cardiovascular diseases: a CALIBER cohort study [^111CKLxU]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Eosinophil and lymphocyte counts are commonly performed in clinical practice. Previous studies provide conflicting evidence of association with cardiovascular diseases.

Methods

We used linked primary care, hospitalisation, disease registry and mortality data in England (the CALIBER (CArdiovascular disease research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) programme). We included people aged 30 or older without cardiovascular disease at baseline, and used Cox models to estimate cause-specific HRs for the association of eosinophil or lymphocyte counts with the first occurrence of cardiovascular disease.

Results

The cohort comprised 775231 individuals, of whom 55004 presented with cardiovascular disease over median follow-up 3.8years. Over the first 6months, there was a strong association of low eosinophil counts (< 0.05 compared with 0.15–0.25×10(9)/L) with heart failure (adjusted HR 2.05; 95% CI 1.72 to 2.43), unheralded coronary death (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.69), ventricular arrhythmia/sudden cardiac death and subarachnoid haemorrhage, but not angina, non-fatal myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage or abdominal aortic aneurysm. Low eosinophil count was inversely associated with peripheral arterial disease (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.89). There were similar associations with low lymphocyte counts (< 1.45 vs 1.85–2.15×10(9)/L); adjusted HR over the first 6months for heart failure was 2.25 (95% CI 1.90 to 2.67). Associations beyond the first 6months were weaker.

Conclusions

Low eosinophil counts and low lymphocyte counts in the general population are associated with increased short-term incidence of heart failure and coronary death.

### Early decrease in blood lymphocyte count is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^116C8498]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the most severe infectious disease outbreak this century, causing millions of infections and deaths worldwide. While the pandemic has primarily abated in many regions, seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics remain a constant threat and cause significant mortality. Until today, COVID-19 infection can cause many complications, some may deteriorate and even die, especially in high-risk patients. Therefore, early identification of high-risk patients is crucial to ensure prompt and appropriate treatment for COVID-19 patients.

Dysregulation of the immune system is directly linked to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk for COVID-19-associated mortality due to immunologic deficits that limit the virus's clearance. Zhao et al. reported that neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, low CD4 + T cells, and decreased C3 could predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis reported that lymphocyte count reduction correlated with illness severity in COVID-19 patients. Although several studies have investigated the relationship between lymphocyte count and severity in COVID-19 patients, there is still limited information on the dynamic changes in lymphocyte count over time in COVID-19 patients, which is more important for determining patients' conditions. In the present study, we aim to investigate the trends of lymphocyte count during the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients.

### Laboratory clues to immunodeficiency; missed chances for early diagnosis? [^114GHXNU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency is seen in an estimated one in 1200 people, and secondary immunodeficiency is increasingly common, particularly with the use of immunosuppresion, cancer therapies and the newer biological therapies such as rituximab. Delays in the diagnosis of immunodeficiency predictably lead to preventable organ damage. Examples of abnormal pathology tests that suggest immunodeficiency from all laboratory specialities are given, where vigilant interpretation of abnormal results may prompt earlier diagnosis. If immunodeficiency is suspected, suggested directed testing could include measuring immunoglobulins, a lymphocyte count and T-cell and B-cell subsets.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^1152VqXb]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and prospects

Lymphopenia is a prevalent phenomenon during the progression of sepsis. It serves as an index for assessing the severity and prognosis of sepsis associated with a heightened risk of secondary infections. Numerous epidemiological studies have subsequently affirmed the direct correlation between peripheral lymphopenia and increased ICU admissions and mortality rates, particularly emphasizing the substantial decrease in T-lymphocytes. These findings catalyzed an extensive exploration of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced lymphopenia in hopes of illuminating potential therapeutic avenues.

Current studies have preliminarily elucidated several underlying potential mechanisms, yet a deeper investigation into the dynamic changes and mutual regulation relationships of different stages and lymphocyte subgroups is imperative. The two underlying mechanisms of lymphopenia that can be generalized from the dynamics of lymphocyte reduction to recovery after sepsis are apoptosis and impaired proliferation. Apoptosis is thought to be the leading cause of the dramatic decrease in the absolute number of lymphocytes due to sepsis. In contrast, lymphocyte redistribution illuminates a relative decrease in lymphocyte count in the peripheral circulation. Sepsis survivors tend to show signs of recovery of lymphocyte counts quickly, whereas nonsurvivors ultimately fail to recover lymphocyte counts. Therefore, inadequate or untimely recovery of lymphocyte counts after sepsis is associated with poor outcomes, and the underlying factor affecting the recovery of lymphocyte numbers may be the relative lack of proliferative capacity.

From a therapeutic standpoint, comprehensive treatment strategies that restore lymphocyte quantity and function appear more promising. We anticipate the development of more targeted, low-side-effect therapeutic drugs to prevent and rectify lymphopenia and immunosuppression induced by sepsis. We also foresee advancements in auxiliary diagnostic technologies, including establishing monitoring and early warning systems based on lymphocyte count and subgroups. It is essential to note the substantial heterogeneity in the degrees of lymphopenia among different patients, closely correlated with factors such as age, underlying diseases, and infection pathways. For instance, elderly sepsis patients experience more pronounced and persistent lymphopenia, a phenomenon associated with accelerated immunosenescence. Distinct pathogens induce varying patterns of lymphocyte decline, necessitating the differentiation of lymphocyte kinetic alterations in different types of sepsis patients to adopt more personalized treatment strategies. This area remains relatively unexplored and warrants further study

### T-cell lymphocytopenia: an omnipresent predictor of morbidity and mortality in consequence of SARS-CoV disease and influenza A infections [^111jNEte]. Cytokine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of The Research

We proposed T-cell lymphocytopenia as a strategic predictor of serious coronavirus and influenza infections. Our preeminent goal was to determine whether a degree of T-cell lymphopenia would identify a distinct threshold cell count to differentiate between severe and non-severe infections. We codified an Index Severity Score to exploit an association between T-cell cytopenia and the grade of disease activity.

Principal Result

A T-cell count of 560 cells/uL or below signified a trend towards advanced disease.

### Lymphocyte count and mortality risk in older persons. the Leiden 85-plus study [^1124KHfp]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate whether a low peripheral blood lymphocyte count is associated with increased mortality risk in older persons and to determine whether this association could be ascribed to ill health.

Design

A cohort study with a total follow-up period of 1,602 person years.

Setting

Leiden, the Netherlands.

Participants

Four hundred thirty-six community-dwelling residents aged 85 and older.

Measurements

Health status and leukocyte total and differential counts were assessed at baseline. Lymphocyte subsets were measured with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Age- and sex-adjusted mortality risks were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.

Results

There was no association between lymphocyte count and mortality in persons with ill health (mortality risk lowest vs highest quartile = 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.85–1.58, P = .35), but mortality was dependent on lymphocyte count if disease was excluded (mortality risk lowest vs highest quartile = 2.14; 95% CI = 1.08–4.23, P = .03). A similar increase in mortality risk was found when the cluster designation (CD)4+, CD8+, and CD16+ lymphocyte subsets were analyzed. Within individuals, low values of the lymphocyte subsets were related and there was no compensatory increase in CD16+ lymphocyte counts. A low lymphocyte count was not associated with specific causes of death.

Conclusion

A low lymphocyte count was associated with an increased mortality risk in older persons without apparent disease. This association was not only found for the total lymphocyte count but also for the CD4+, CD8+, and CD16+ lymphocyte subset counts.

### Prognostic value of lymphocyte count for in-hospital mortality in patients with severe AECOPD [^115d2mzY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

People have learned that low lymphocyte counts are associated with poor prognosis in numerous acute and chronic diseases such as sepsis, cancer and cardiovascular disease. This phenomenon is often seen in serious MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) infections as well. In the global epidemic of COVID-19 in recent years, researchers have also found that lower lymphocyte count is prevalent in patients. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, peripheral blood lymphocyte count was reduced, as were the counts of various lymphocyte subgroups. The predictive value of lymphocytes in humans needs to be explored in more studies.

This study population consisted of patients with severe AECOPD, and to our knowledge, this is the first to focus on the predictive role of lymphocytes on poor prognosis in patients with severe AECOPD. We also found that patients with low lymphocyte had significantly longer hospital stay and time on ventilator compared to patients with normal lymphocyte count. Few studies have focused on the relationship between lymphocyte count and these two outcomes. As previously mentioned, among patients with severe AECOPD, a very high percentage of patients with low lymphocytes have respiratory failure (84.6%), which means that these patients are sicker and leads to longer hospital stays and use of ventilators.

Our study also had some limitations. First, our study was a single-center study with a small number of cases, lacking follow-up data on patients. Secondly, many patients failed to complete pulmonary function tests during this hospitalization due to the severity of the disease, and there were no CAT scores, mMRC scores or other indicators to assess the severity of patients, which prevented a more comprehensive prognosis of patients. Finally, interactions between lymphocyte subpopulations may have an impact on lymphocyte counts.

### Association of lymphopenia with risk of mortality among adults in the US general population [^114bcCGH]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

Approximately 20% of the general US population appears to have a high-risk IH profile, and these participants' 10-year mortality was 28%, compared with 4% in participants in the present study with a low-risk profile. Moreover, in this cohort study, those individuals with important clinical risk factors who had an adverse IH status were at extreme risk of mortality. Because the IH profiles defined herein emerge from routine testing, ensuring that these high- and extreme-risk individuals receive appropriate evidence-based disease preventive services (cancer screening, vaccination, lifestyle changes, and cardiovascular risk factor modification) may be a pragmatic, simple way to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of population health efforts.

### Failure to normalize lymphopenia following trauma is associated with increased mortality, independent of the leukocytosis pattern [^1154TwwM]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Key messages

- SIRS response following traumatic injury is associated with lymphocyte loss

- A persistently low lymphocyte level over the first 4 days following moderate and severe injury is associated with increased mortality and increased hospital length of stay

- The association between failure to normalize lymphocyte number with worsening outcomes is suggestive of a key role for lymphocytes in the response to traumatic injuries

- The lymphocyte profile, and the association with outcomes is independent of the rest of the leukocyte response to trauma

### Reversal of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio in early versus late death from septic shock [^113ktfMN]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we found that at the onset of septic shock, a low NLCR was associated with nonsurvival. This low NLCR was due to a higher lymphocyte count. When distinguishing time until death in the early-death (before day 5) and late-death (on or after day 5) groups, the NLCR of the early-death patients at admission was significantly lower than that of late-death patients and survivors. The risk of late death was associated with a neutrophil increase, lymphocyte count decrease, and subsequent increase in the NLCR from day 1 to day 5.

Early death (before day 5) versus late death (on or after day 5) is increasingly being studied. An overly strong immune response with a cytokine storm, mitochondriopathy, and massive tissue damage may lead to early death. This dysregulation may cause a complex state combining an unabated innate immune response that leads to persistent inflammation, resulting organ dysfunction, and an impaired adaptive immune response that leaves the host unable to react to any assault. In our study, clinical characteristics did not differ between early- and late-death patients, particularly age, severity scores, and comorbidities. The most remarkable clinical difference was that of hospital-acquired infections, which was 2.7 times higher in nonsurvivors. Although nonsignificant, the ICU length of stay was longer in nonsurvivors. Whether the hospital-acquired infection was a consequence of alteration of adaptive function related to lymphopenia, whether it was responsible for neutrophilia, or both remains unclear.

Most of the prognostic scores mention leukocytosis (> 12,000/mm 3) or leukopenia (< 4000/mm 3) as a severity index, but none considers the leukocyte subpopulations. Significant differences between neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and, consequently, their ratio have been shown to predict the severity or outcome in different pathological circumstances, such as surgical stress, systemic inflammation and sepsis, bacteremia, community-acquired pneumonia, ischemic events, and cancer. We must be cautious because the prognostic value of the NLCR in our study is below the value of 0.8 that is felt to be indicative of a reliable prognostic marker.

The evolution of these leukocyte populations may differ based on their respective role in the inflammatory response. Neutrophils are the first cellular line of defense in the innate immune system and have a short half-life, while lymphocytes are the major cells of the adaptive immune system.

### Reference ranges for lymphocyte counts of neonates: associations between abnormal counts and outcomes [^1121dw49]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Both high and low lymphocyte counts at birth have been associated with adverse outcomes. However, the validity of defining a lymphocyte count as "abnormal" depends on having an accurate reference range. We established a reference range for neonatal lymphocyte counts by using multihospital data and used this to assess previously reported relationships between abnormal counts and early onset sepsis (EOS), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), periventricular leukomalacia, and birth asphyxia.

Methods

We first created a data set that excluded counts from neonates with diagnoses previously associated with abnormal lymphocyte counts. Then the complete data (counts excluded plus included in the reference range) were used to test associations between abnormal counts and EOS, IVH, ROP, periventricular leukomalacia, and outcomes after birth asphyxia.

Results

Lymphocyte counts were retrieved from 40487 neonates, 10860 of which were excluded from the reference range. A count > 95th percentile was associated with EOS (2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.80–2.38) and IVH ≥ grade 3 (2.93; 95% CI: 1.83–4.71). A count < 5th percentile was associated with EOS (odds ratio:1.24; 95% CI: 1.04–1.48), IVH ≥ grade 3 (3.23; 95% CI: 1.95–5.36), and ROP ≥ stage 3 (4.80: 95% CI: 2.38–9.66). Among 120 meeting criteria for birth asphyxia, those with a low count and a high nucleated red cell count had higher mortality (37% vs 11%, P = .001), more transfusions (P = .000), and more neurology referrals (P < .01).

Conclusions

A reference range for lymphocytes can identify neonates with abnormal counts, which can be useful because these neonates are at higher risk for certain adverse outcomes.

### B-cell count and survival: differentiating chronic lymphocytic leukemia from monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis based on clinical outcome [^111nWLyo]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in asymptomatic patients has historically been based on documenting a characteristic lymphocyte clone and the presence of lymphocytosis. There are minimal data regarding which lymphocyte parameter (absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] or B-cell count) and what threshold should be used for diagnosis. We analyzed the relationship of ALC and B-cell count with clinical outcome in 459 patients with a clonal population of CLL phenotype to determine (1) whether the CLL diagnosis should be based on ALC or B-cell count, (2) what lymphocyte threshold should be used for diagnosis, and (3) whether any lymphocyte count has independent prognostic value after accounting for biologic/molecular prognostic markers. B-cell count and ALC had similar value for predicting treatment-free survival (TFS) and overall survival as continuous variables, but as binary factors, a B-cell threshold of 11 x 10(9)/L best predicted survival. B-cell count remained an independent predictor of TFS after controlling for ZAP-70, IGHV, CD38, or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results (all P < .001). These analyses support basing the diagnosis of CLL on B-cell count and retaining the size of the B-cell count in the diagnostic criteria. Using clinically relevant criteria to distinguish between monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) and CLL could minimize patient distress caused by labeling asymptomatic people at low risk for adverse clinical consequences as having CLL.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^114sVVS4]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

This narrative review provides an overview of the evolving significance of lymphopenia in sepsis, emphasizing its critical function in this complex and heterogeneous disease. We describe the causal relationship of lymphopenia with clinical outcomes, sustained immunosuppression, and its correlation with sepsis prediction markers and therapeutic targets. The primary mechanisms of septic lymphopenia are highlighted. In addition, the paper summarizes various attempts to treat lymphopenia and highlights the practical significance of promoting lymphocyte proliferation as the next research direction.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART)–mediated viral suppression — expected CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count patterns and timing indicate that most people experience recovery of CD4 counts to the normal range (> 500 cells/mm3), but some who started ART at low CD4 counts do not experience recovery to > 500 cells/mm3 despite sustained virologic suppression, and promptly initiating ART in people diagnosed early with HIV provides the best opportunity for maximal CD4 cell recovery.

### Low eosinophil and low lymphocyte counts and the incidence of 12 cardiovascular diseases: a CALIBER cohort study [^1152Mwtf]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Results

We included 621 052 patients with differential leucocyte counts while clinically 'stable' and 154 179 patients with differential leucocyte counts performed during acute illness or treatment (see online supplementary figure S2 and table S3). We observed 55 004 initial presentations of cardiovascular disease over median 3.8 (IQR 1.7–6.0) years follow-up; 9711 occurred within the first 6 months. Of the remaining patients, 32 591 died of non-cardiovascular causes, 99 622 left the practice during the study period and were censored, and 588 014 were still registered with the practice at the end of the study period.

Baseline characteristics

Lower eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were not associated with major cardiovascular risk factors. Low eosinophil count was associated with female gender, black ethnicity and cancer, whereas higher eosinophil count was associated with male sex, deprivation, South Asian ethnicity, higher body mass index and atopy (table 1, see online supplementary table S4). Low lymphocyte count was associated with cancer, in common with eosinophil counts, but the association with ethnicity was different: people of black ethnicity tended to have higher lymphocyte counts (table 1, see online supplementary table S5). Eosinophil and lymphocyte counts in the lowest categories were more likely to be taken under acute conditions (see online supplementary tables S6 and S7).

Table 1
Characteristics of patients with low eosinophil or low lymphocyte counts

Cumulative incidence of cardiovascular disease by eosinophil and lymphocyte count

Crude cumulative incidence curves showed that individuals with low eosinophil or lymphocyte counts had a greater incidence of heart failure as the initial presentation of cardiovascular disease, at least over the first few months (figure 1), but there was no apparent association with non-cardiac presentations of cardiovascular disease (figure 2).

### Lower lymphocyte count is associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease [^116PiD2G]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Patients with established Parkinson's disease (PD) display differences in peripheral blood markers of immune function, including leukocyte differential counts, compared with controls. These differences may be useful biomarkers to predict PD and may shed light on pathogenesis. We sought to identify whether peripheral immune dysregulation was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis.

Methods:

We examined the relationship between incident PD, baseline differential leukocyte count and other blood markers of acute inflammation in UK Biobank (UKB), a longitudinal cohort with ~500,000 participants. We used a range of sensitivity analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) to further explore the nature of associations.

Results:

After excluding individuals with comorbidities which could influence biomarkers of inflammation, 465 incident PD cases and 312,125 controls remained. Lower lymphocyte count was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis (per 1-SD decrease in lymphocyte count odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–1.32, p adjusted = 0.01). There was some evidence that reductions in eosinophil counts, monocyte counts and C-reactive protein (CRP) were associated with increased PD risk, and that higher neutrophil count was also associated. Only the association between lower lymphocyte count and increased PD risk remained robust to sensitivity analyses. MR suggested that the effect of lower lymphocyte count on PD risk may be causal (per 1-SD decrease in lymphocyte count; OR MR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01–1.18, p = 0.02).

Interpretation:

We provide converging evidence from observational analyses in UKB and MR that lower lymphocyte count is associated with an increased risk of subsequent PD.

### Mycophenolate mofetil [^115zYstN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What are the possible side effects of Mycophenolate mofetil?

Mycophenolate mofetil may cause serious side effects, including:

See "What is the most important information I should know about Mycophenolate mofetil?"
Low blood cell counts. People taking high doses of Mycophenolate mofetil each day may have a decrease in blood counts, including:
white blood cells, especially neutrophils. Neutrophils fight against bacterial infections. You have a higher chance of getting an infection when your white blood cell count is low. This is most common from 1 month to 6 months after your transplant.
red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to your body tissues. You have a higher chance of getting severe anemia when your red blood cell count is low.
platelets. Platelets help with blood clotting.

Your doctor will do blood tests before you start taking Mycophenolate mofetil and during treatment with Mycophenolate mofetil to check your blood cell counts. Tell your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection (See "What is the most important information I should know about Mycophenolate mofetil?"), including any unexpected bruising or bleeding. Also, tell your doctor if you have unusual tiredness, lack of energy, dizziness or fainting.

### Down to a T: the functional importance of lymphopenia in severe COVID-19 [^113z3i4m]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The emergence of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019 has led to a pandemic that has had widespread detrimental effects on populations globally. Ample evidence now supports that immunopathology associated with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) relates to a key role for inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor α) and IL-6 that are augmented systemically as part of a "cytokine storm" and can be targeted by immunomodulatory therapies, including dexamethasone and JAK (Janus kinase)-inhibitors.

From the very earliest case series emerging from Wuhan, it became clear that reduced circulating lymphocyte numbers (lymphopenia) was a hallmark feature of severe hospitalized COVID-19 cases. More recently, this abnormality has been shown to correlate with hyperinflammation and adverse disease outcomes, including requirement for invasive ventilation and mortality. Lymphopenia has been recognized for many years to be a feature in a range of severe viral infections, but the mechanisms driving this abnormality, particularly in the context of SARS-COV-2, are poorly understood. Recent studies have elucidated that SARS-CoV-2–associated lymphopenia may be related to a dysregulation of T-cell homeostasis, but the precise mechanism governing this alteration and relationships to disease severity are unknown. A better understanding of these mechanisms is key to facilitating new therapies to target these abnormalities and improve outcomes.

### Predictive value of low relative lymphocyte count in patients hospitalized for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: insights from the EVEREST trial [^114UMVyP]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Low lymphocyte count has been shown to be an independent prognostic marker in heart failure (HF) in the outpatient setting. Limited data exist regarding whether relative lymphocyte count correlates with postdischarge outcomes in patients hospitalized for HF.

Methods and Results

We performed a post hoc analysis of the Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study with Tolvaptan (EVEREST) trial, which randomized 4133 patients hospitalized for worsening HF with an ejection fraction ≤ 40% within 48 hours of admission to tolvaptan or placebo for a median follow-up of 9.9 months. The primary end points of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization were analyzed in patients with available baseline complete blood counts (n = 3717). Lymphocyte percentage was analyzed as a continuous variable. Times to events were compared using log-rank tests and multivariable Cox regression models. Patients with low lymphocyte percentage tended to be older and had higher rates of comorbid disease (diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and renal insufficiency). Low lymphocyte counts were associated with wide QRS duration, high natriuretic peptides, and low ejection fraction, blood pressure, and serum sodium. These patients were less likely to receive evidence-based HF medications. After adjusting for 22 known clinical risk factors, a 10% decrease in lymphocytes was associated with an increased hazard of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.31 [95% CI: 1.14–1.150], P < 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 1.14 [95% CI: 1.04–1.25], P = 0.007) in the first 100 days postdischarge. Lymphopenia during hospitalization normalizes in majority of patients in the early postdischarge period.

Conclusions

Low relative lymphocyte count during hospitalization for HF is an independent predictor of poor outcomes in the early postdischarge period, beyond traditional prognostic indicators.

### Lymphopenia in cancer patients and its effects on response to immunotherapy: an opportunity for combination with cytokines? [^116ZBYMJ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Quantitative lymphocyte alterations are frequent in patients with cancer, and strongly impact prognosis and survival. The development of cancers in immunosuppressed patients has demonstrated the contribution of different T cell populations, including CD4 + cells, in the control of cancer occurrence. Whereas absolute numbers of neutrophils, platelets and red blood cells are routinely monitored in clinic following treatments, because of possible short-term complications, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), their subpopulations or diversity (phenotype, TCR) are rarely analyzed and never used to choose therapy or as prognostic criteria. The recent identification of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi) as powerful therapeutic agents has revitalized immunotherapy of cancer in a broader group of diseases than anticipated. The status of the immune system is now recognized as an important biomarker for response to these novel treatments. Blood ALC values, along with tumor infiltration by CD8 + T cells, and ICPi and ICPi-ligand expression, are likely to be a potential marker of sensitivity to anti-ICPi therapy. In this article, we review the current knowledge on the incidence and significance of lymphopenia in cancer patients, and discuss therapeutic strategies to restore lymphocyte numbers.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111Ge6pq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pooled data across early studies validate a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count among patients with severe cases of COVID-19 compared with those with mild cases. Why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that this association could result from direct lymphocyte infection, destruction of lymphatic tissue, inflammation leading to lymphocyte apoptosis, or inhibition of lymphocytes by metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis. Lymphopenia as a marker of severity does not seem to be specific to COVID-19; it has been used to prognosticate other viral pneumonias such as influenza. Neutrophilia may be more specific to severe disease than leukocytosis, but neutrophil count was not uniformly reported across the studies included in our analysis.

Despite our findings regarding clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19, our study had several limitations. First, our literature search found an expected paucity of data surrounding this topic because published characterizations of patients with COVID-19 remain minimal. More COVID-19 data from other nations and patient populations will aid in the comparison and validation of our clinical findings. Second, we noted significant heterogeneity in both the leukocyte and lymphocyte analyses. This phenomenon probably resulted from the small sample size, limited and early data, and skewed representation of the patient population. Third, the definitions of severe cases were somewhat inconsistent across these studies, varying from acute hypoxic respiratory failure to requiring mechanical ventilation. This variability could further compound the heterogeneity found across these studies. Last, only a minority of the manuscripts reported the proportion of patients with lymphopenia, and variable cutoffs based on the articles' reference ranges made it difficult to ascertain a cutoff for severe disease.

With the rising cases of COVID-19 and limited resources, being able to prioritize patients with severe disease is crucial. Some therapeutic agents are being investigated; however, supplies are often low and procurement may be delayed. The sooner patients with severe disease can be identified, the sooner the process of obtaining therapy can be initiated.

### Diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making for the neutropenic patient [^111Q1zfB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Determining the cause of a low neutrophil count in a pediatric or adult patient is essential for the hematologist's clinical decision-making. Fundamental to this diagnostic process is establishing the presence or lack of a mature neutrophil storage pool, as absence places the patient at higher risk for infection and the need for supportive care measures. Many diagnostic tests, eg, a peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy, remain important tools, but greater understanding of the diversity of neutropenic disorders has added new emphasis on evaluating for immune disorders and genetic testing. In this article, a structure is provided to assess patients based on the mechanism of neutropenia and to prioritize testing based on patient age and hypothesized pathophysiology. Common medical quandaries including fever management, need for growth factor support, risk of malignant transformation, and curative options in congenital neutropenia are reviewed to guide medical decision-making in neutropenic patients.

### Haematological manifestations of lupus [^113rv6Jb]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic systemic autoimmune disease with variable multisystem involvement and heterogeneous clinical features, ranging from mild to life threatening. There is no gold standard test to diagnose SLE, hence the determination of the presence of this disease, in addition to being a diagnosis of exclusion, ultimately rests with the judgement of a clinician.

The first classification criteria for SLE were developed by the American Rheumatism Association (predecessor of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)) in 1971. Immunological tests were incorporated into the criteria and revised SLE classification criteria were published in 1982. The criteria, in 1997, underwent another revision and included advancing knowledge about the association of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies with SLE. Although the criteria are widely accepted and used, only a few potential manifestations of SLE are represented. The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) SLE classification criteria comprise 11 clinical and 6 immunological criteria. In contrast to the ACR criteria, the SLICC criteria require at least one clinical and one immunological criteria for the classification of SLE. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA), leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are part of both ACR and SLICC criteria.

Haematological abnormalities are common findings in patients with SLE. Sometimes, haematological abnormalities can be caused by the pathophysiology of SLE itself, but at other times they can be found in patients with SLE but not be a manifestation of SLE. Neither set of criteria, however, specify how leucopenia and lymphopenia in these patients can be differentiated from decreased white cell count caused by immunosuppressive therapy or other causes. Thus, it is important to distinguish haematological abnormalities as either manifestations of SLE, consequence of SLE treatment or as part of another blood cell dyscrasia.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114dGBCj]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) epidemiology in HIV indicates that oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis are common in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the vast majority are caused by Candida albicans, and occurrence is an indicator of immune suppression most often observed with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3, with esophageal disease typically occurring at lower CD4 counts than oropharyngeal disease. The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a dramatic decline in the prevalence of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis and a marked diminution in cases of refractory disease. Fluconazole (or azole) resistance is predominantly the consequence of previous exposure to fluconazole (or other azoles), particularly repeated and long-term exposure, and prior exposure to azole therapy has been associated with a gradual emergence of non-C. albicans species, particularly Candida glabrata, as a cause of refractory mucosal candidiasis in patients with advanced immunosuppression and low CD4 counts. In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis — whether a single episode or recurrent — is common in healthy, adult women and does not suggest HIV infection.

### Lower lymphocyte count is associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease [^116t9z56]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Patients with established Parkinson's disease (PD) display differences in peripheral blood markers of immune function, including leukocyte differential counts, compared with controls. These differences may be useful biomarkers to predict PD and may shed light on pathogenesis. We sought to identify whether peripheral immune dysregulation was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis.

Methods

We examined the relationship between incident PD, baseline differential leukocyte count and other blood markers of acute inflammation in UK Biobank (UKB), a longitudinal cohort with ~500,000 participants. We used a range of sensitivity analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) to further explore the nature of associations.

Results

After excluding individuals with comorbidities which could influence biomarkers of inflammation, 465 incident PD cases and 312,125 controls remained. Lower lymphocyte count was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis (per 1-SD decrease in lymphocyte count odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–1.32, p adjusted = 0.01). There was some evidence that reductions in eosinophil counts, monocyte counts and C-reactive protein (CRP) were associated with increased PD risk, and that higher neutrophil count was also associated. Only the association between lower lymphocyte count and increased PD risk remained robust to sensitivity analyses. MR suggested that the effect of lower lymphocyte count on PD risk may be causal (per 1-SD decrease in lymphocyte count; OR MR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01–1.18, p = 0.02).

Interpretation

We provide converging evidence from observational analyses in UKB and MR that lower lymphocyte count is associated with an increased risk of subsequent PD. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:803–812.

### Haematological manifestations of lupus [^116jWczt]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Lymphopenia

Introduction

Lymphopenia is defined as < 1.5×10 9 lymphocytes/L on two or more occasions according to the ACR and SLICC criteria. Low lymphocyte counts commonly occur in SLE with a prevalence ranging from 20% to 93%and are observed frequently in patients with active or severe disease. Moreover, lymphocyte levels may fluctuate during the clinical course, irrespective of treatment. However, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs may contribute to the lymphopenia in severe disease. The degree of lymphopenia can be quite striking with values < 0.5×10 9 /L observed in 10% of patients. Lymphopenia occurs independently of neutropenia but may also contribute to the leucopenia seen in these patients.

Both T and B lymphocyte subpopulations may be affected, whereas the null lymphocyte subpopulation is frequently spared.T cell numbers are affected more than B cells. In particular, the CD4+ subset of T cells is more profoundly affected, although the CD4/CD8 ratio is usually unchanged. This surprising observation may be explained by the deficiency of the CD4 epitope that reacts with monoclonal antibody used for the detection of this subset, leading to a technical artefact. The naive B lymphocyte subset (CD19+/CD27−) is more affected than the memory B lymphocyte subset (CD19+/CD27+) in patients with active SLE.

Pathogenesis

The pathogenesis of lymphopenia is still unclear. Antilymphocyte antibodies have long been held responsible for the decline in lymphocyte numbers and in lymphocyte function. The number of autoantibody types responsible for these activities has expanded in the last several decades. Recent studies suggest that defects in apoptosis may also play a role.

Antilymphocyte antibodies are a heterogenous group of autoantibodies. Titres vary with disease activity, and presence of antilymphocyte activity is associated with lymphopenia. Historically, these antibodies have been identified in vitro by their ability to lyse lymphocytes. More recently, these antibodies have been identified by their binding to the surface of lymphocytes or plasma membrane components. Other autoantibodies, for example, anti-Ro, are associated with lymphopenia.

### Analysis of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 [^116QEMG2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Symptoms of COVID-19 vary in severity and presentation. When admitting patients to the hospital, it is desirable to isolate patients with COVID-19 from those without the disease. However, reliably identifying patients with COVID-19 in the emergency department before hospital admission is often limited by the speed and availability of testing. Previous studies determined a low lymphocyte count is commonly found in patients with COVID-19. We sought to explore the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients presenting to the emergency department requiring subsequent hospitalization who were found to have COVID-19.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on 312 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency department. The absolute lymphocyte count for these patients was used to calculate sensitivities at various cut-off values. The relationships between absolute lymphocyte count and variables, including age, sex, need for intubation, and mortality, were also explored.

Results

Cut-off values for absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 1.1 K/uL to 2.0 K/uL, with sensitivities of 72% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, lower mean absolute lymphocyte counts were identified in males, patients who required intubation, and patients who died.

Conclusion

Knowing the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 may help identify patients who are unlikely to have the disease. Additionally, absolute lymphocyte count can be used as a marker of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Association of lymphopenia with risk of mortality among adults in the US general population [^114Saihn]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

This study sought to (1) determine the associations among lymphocyte levels, other IH parameters (RDW and CRP level), and survival and (2) establish the extent to which the associated risk of these variables is additive. In this large cohort of adults, we found that lymphopenia was associated with mortality risk independently of traditional clinical risk factors and other IH variables (RDW and CRP level). Individuals with multiple IH abnormalities had a strikingly high risk of mortality among this generally low-risk population. The risk associated with this IH pattern is independent of (and thus additive to) traditional clinical risk factors. Together, these data suggest that IH risk may be viewed as a multidimensional entity and can be estimated using markers commonly available as part of routine clinical care.

### Haematological abnormalities in new-onset rheumatoid arthritis and risk of common infections: a population-based study [^114XkHCx]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The long-term prognosis of RA has improved with the availability of conventional synthetic and later biologic DMARDs, coupled with greater monitoring and treatment adjustment to target disease remission. EULAR recommendations suggest the primary target for treatment of RA should be a state of clinical remission, with low disease activity an acceptable therapeutic goal, particularly in patients with a long duration of disease.

Haematological abnormalities (including anaemia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia) in RA are common. More than 50% of patients with RA have anaemia and the relationship between anaemia and disease activity is complex; it is logical to assume that the prevalence of anaemia should decline with improved disease control as the underlying cause is often anaemia of chronic disease. Despite this, iron deficiency anaemia and macrocytic anaemia have also been reported and may relate to gastrointestinal blood loss, the presence of other autoimmune diseases and iatrogenic causes. DMARD treatment in RA patients has been observed to influence both lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. Furthermore, studies have suggested an increased risk of serious infections with some RA medications, including with anti-TNF therapies. Other studies have suggested little or no detectable increase in infectious morbidity or mortality in RA patients with lymphopenia. The effect of lymphocyte and neutrophil counts in early RA on subsequent infection is not well studied and could influence treatment choices.

Due to the increased risk of infection, EULAR guidelines recommend an annual influenza vaccination and a one-off pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination for individuals with RA being treated with immunosuppressive medication. UK guidelines recommend the same strategy for other immunosuppressed individuals. Despite this, vaccination uptake has been shown to be suboptimal for individuals with RA, with up to two-thirds of individuals not receiving the influenza vaccine annually post-diagnosis; uptake is especially low in younger age groups. Real-world evidence on the effectiveness of vaccinations on subsequent infection in individuals with RA is lacking.

We aimed to establish the association between haematological abnormalities at disease onset and the risk of common infections in a contemporary RA population. We also set out to determine associations between vaccinations for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia and the subsequent incidence of influenza and pneumococcal-like infections, respectively.

### The absence of CD4 + T cell count recovery despite receipt of virologically suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy: clinical risk, immunological gaps, and therapeutic options [^115PWaFn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who are receiving long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy do not exhibit a marked increase in the CD4(+) T cell count, despite achieving complete suppression of the HIV load. These patients are referred to as "immunological nonresponders". When treating immunological nonresponders, the practicing clinician has several questions, including questions about the clinical risk associated with persistent immunodeficiency and about possible approaches to treatment that would provide clinical and immunological benefits. However, tentative answers to these questions require investigations of the mechanisms that underlie the lack of immune recovery, because only the deepest comprehension of the immunological gaps underlying functional defects will allow administration of highly targeted and efficacious treatment strategies. The aim of our review is to provide a thorough assessment of the clinical implications of a lack of increase in the CD4(+) T cell count in immunological nonresponders, to examine the immunological gaps limiting recovery of the CD4(+) T cell count, and to note possible therapeutic avenues, which may offer clinicians guidance regarding how to most efficaciously treat these critical patients.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1176iZ19]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Introduction and rationale for immediate ART — The primary goals of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are to prevent HIV-associated morbidity and mortality and to prevent transmission of HIV to others. These goals are accomplished by using effective ART to achieve and maintain plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (viral load) below the quantification limits of commercially available assays. Durable viral suppression lowers the risk of both AIDS-defining and other HIV-related complications, improves immune function and overall health, and allows people with HIV to live a lifespan approaching that of people without HIV. High plasma viral load is a major risk factor for HIV transmission; effective ART suppresses viremia and, consequently, substantially reduces the risk of sexual and perinatal HIV transmission. Early clinical trials of combination ART focused on people with advanced HIV and low CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts, and guidelines at that time recommended initiation based on CD4 thresholds or AIDS-defining conditions. Two large randomized controlled trials, START and TEMPRANO, both published in 2015, addressed the optimal time to initiate ART, and both studies demonstrated reductions in morbidity and mortality among people with HIV who had CD4 counts > 500 cells/mm3 and who initiated ART immediately when compared with people who delayed initiation of ART. Deferring ART until CD4 counts decline puts people with HIV at risk of both AIDS-defining conditions and certain serious non-AIDS–defining conditions, and the magnitude of CD4 recovery is directly correlated with CD4 count at ART initiation; consequently, some individuals who start treatment with CD4 counts < 350 cells/mm3 do not achieve CD4 counts > 500 cells/mm3.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111cLhuZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Study

We searched 3 major databases — MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) — for clinical studies published December 1, 2019, through March 28, 2020. To broadly identify studies detailing lymphocyte and leukocyte testing among patients with COVID-19, we used the following search criteria: "(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-NCoV OR HCov-19 OR novel coronavirus) AND (laboratory OR WBC OR lymphocyte)". We prioritized studies that measured lymphocyte and leukocyte counts among patients who had severe or critical cases versus those with mild cases. Severe cases were defined as significant respiratory distress (acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission) caused by COVID-19.

Our meta-analysis included articles about studies and clinical trials that met the following 4 inclusion criteria: 1) involved adult, human patients; 2) written in English; 3) reported lymphocyte and leukocyte counts for patients; and 4) compared patients with severe versus mild illness. Our meta-analysis excluded articles about studies with the following 9 characteristics: 1) involved nonhuman subjects; 2) written in a language other than English; 3) were not a clinical trial, such as a review paper or letter; 4) were out of the scope of the study question detailed above; 5) did not provide raw data to perform quantitative meta-analysis; 6) involved pediatric patients; 7) did not have the full article available; 8) were duplicates; and 9) were ongoing or not completed.

CD4 cell recovery — contributing conditions and management: In people on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) with declining CD4 counts or those with CD4 consistently < 100 cells/mm3, untreated coinfections and serious medical conditions may contribute to CD4 lymphopenia, and treating coinfections and optimizing management of contributing conditions should be pursued when feasible.

### Association between underweight and low lymphocyte count as an indicator of malnutrition in Japanese women [^113npcqk]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The number of young women who are underweight has recently increased in Japan. The aim of the present study was to investigate the nutritional problems of young Japanese women by measuring serum albumin, prealbumin, and lymphocyte count as indicators of nutritional status.

Methods

The subjects were 912 women aged 19–39 years who participated in an annual health checkup for residents in a city of Aichi prefecture, Japan. Questionnaire data, physical measurements, and blood tests were analyzed in relation to weight categories of underweight (body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 kg/m(2)), normal (BMI ≤ 18.5- < 25 kg/m(2)), and obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2)).

Results

Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in the underweight group. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed an association of low lymphocyte count (< 1500/microL) with underweight (odds ratio [OR] 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35–2.83). Low prealbumin (< 20 mg/dL) was associated with weight loss (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00–2.02) but not with underweight. Albumin was not lower in the underweight group. The prevalence of low lymphocyte count was higher by 35% among underweight women who lost weight of ≥ 1 kg in the past 3 months and higher by 50% among those who lost weight of ≥ 2 kg.

Conclusions

The present study suggests that underweight women in their 20s and 30s can be at risk for low lymphocyte count or potential malnutrition. The risk is particularly high in underweight women who have lost weight in recent months.

### Low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis persists after seven years of follow up and is associated with a poorer outcome [^111sepci]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis is defined by the presence of very low numbers of circulating clonal B cells, usually phenotypically similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, whose biological and clinical significance remains elusive. Herein, we re-evaluated 65/91 low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis cases (54 chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like and 11 non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like) followed-up for a median of seven years, using high-sensitivity flow cytometry and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. Overall, the clone size significantly increased in 69% of low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis cases, but only one subject progressed to high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. In parallel, the frequency of cytogenetic alterations increased over time (32% vs. 61% of cases, respectively). The absolute number of the major T-cell and natural killer cell populations also increased, but only among chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like cases with increased clone size vs. age- and sex-matched controls. Although progression to chronic lymphocytic leukemia was not observed, the overall survival of low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis individuals was significantly reduced vs. non-monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis controls (P = 0.03) plus the general population from the same region (P ≤ 0.001), particularly among females (P = 0.01); infection and cancer were the main causes of death in low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. In summary, despite the fact that mid-term progression from low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis to high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia appears to be unlikely, these clones persist at increased numbers, usually carrying more genetic alterations, and might thus be a marker of an impaired immune system indirectly associated with a poorer outcome, particularly among females.

### Relative lymphocyte count as an indicator of 3-year mortality in elderly people with severe COPD [^116x7m3t]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

There are contradictory results regarding lymphocyte number and function in senescence.

Rea et al. demonstrated a 10% decrease in both B and T cell number and percentage of absolute lymphocyte count in elderly subjects. According to B cells, the relative reduction in B cells can provoke alterations in the production of specific antibodies. As B cells can switch immunoglobulins among the different types and in agreement with specific actions toward the pathogenic agents, the reduction in B cell count can negatively affect outcome in elderly patients. Furthermore, T cells can promote the production of cytokines able to enhance the response to pathogens from different actors in the immune system, as well as the switch of immunoglobulins and the promotion of B cell growth and reproduction. All of these data demonstrate that a deficit in either the B or T cell population or both could increase the risk of infection and, thus, morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. Lehtonen et al. suggested that, in very old people, both T and B cell function are significantly reduced and that there are major changes in lymphocyte subsets.

The mechanisms leading to the reduction in lymphocyte count and immunological impairment are still far from clear. Aging and COPD are associated with psychological stress.

It has been long known that psychological and physiological stresses result in a significant increase in systemic cortisol production. The physiological diurnal variation and pulsatile pattern of secretion are thought to limit the lymphocyte-depleting effect of cortisol. However, elderly people secrete large amounts of cortisol, whose levels may remain elevated for a longer time than in younger adults. Increased cortisol levels can result in a gradual decrease in relative lymphocyte count. Therefore, it may be supposed that a decrease in relative lymphocyte count in elderly patients with COPD, as a consequence of the combined action of age and cortisol pathway, would impair the distribution of white blood cells. Such a theory should be tested in further studies.

### Dimethyl fumarate kit (Dimethyl fumarate) [^1162kErr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In these controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, among patients who did not experience prolonged, severe lymphopenia during treatment, the median times for lymphocyte counts to return to normal after discontinuing dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules were as follows:

4.3 weeks in patients with mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count ≥ 0.8×109/L) at discontinuation,
10 weeks in patients with moderate lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.5 to < 0.8×109/L) at discontinuation, and
16.7 weeks in patients with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 0.5×109/L) at discontinuation.

Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules has not been studied in patients with pre-existing low lymphocyte counts.

Obtain a CBC, including lymphocyte count, before initiating treatment with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules, 6 months after starting treatment, and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Consider interruption of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.5×109/L persisting for more than six months. Given the potential for delayed recovery of lymphocyte counts, continue to obtain lymphocyte counts until their recovery if dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules are discontinued or interrupted due to lymphopenia. Consider withholding treatment from patients with serious infections until resolution. Decisions about whether or not to restart dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules should be individualized based on clinical circumstances.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115HgEi7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee conclusions

The evidence suggests that hematological abnormalities are commonly detected in patients with sarcoidosis by a peripheral blood complete blood cell count and differential cell count. However, the abnormalities are often transient and, according to our systematic review, might be just as common among healthy control subjects. The committee noted that leukopenia and lymphopenia are common complications of sarcoidosis, and are related in almost all cases to inflammatory mechanisms, such as granulomatous bone marrow infiltration and the systemic effects of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α. Thus, there is no compelling reason to sample the bone marrow for alternative diagnoses in cases of sarcoidosis accompanied by leukopenia. Anemia, however, was common and an important finding, because it can contribute to sarcoidosis symptoms and signs, such as fatigue and shortness of breath, which may impact a patient's care. It can also be an indicator of other medical problems, and a complete blood cell count is usually needed when initiating cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy. Taken together, the committee concluded that anemia, whether attributable to sarcoidosis or not, is clinically relevant, important to patients, and requires further evaluation.

Recommendation

1 We suggest that patients with sarcoidosis undergo baseline complete blood cell count testing to screen for hematological abnormalities (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Research needs

The literature addressing hematologic abnormalities in sarcoidosis is decades old, and it is unclear whether it is applicable today, given the different laboratory tests and thresholds that are currently used. Splenectomy was previously used to treat cytopenia due to hypersplenism; even though splenectomy is less common today, there are no definitive alternative approaches that have been evaluated as treatments for hematologic abnormalities due to sarcoidosis. Lymphopenia and CD4, CD8, and CD19 lymphocyte subsets have been proposed as markers of more severe sarcoidosis, and patients with lymphopenia with sarcoidosis may be particularly responsive to anti–TNF-α treatment, although additional study is needed.

### CD4 cell count: declining value for antiretroviral therapy eligibility [^114ThERv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) policy for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has historically been based on clinical indications, such as opportunistic infections and CD4 cell counts. Studies suggest that CD4 counts early in HIV infection do not predict relevant public health outcomes such as disease progression, mortality, and HIV transmission in people living with HIV. CD4 counts also vary widely within individuals and among populations, leading to imprecise measurements and arbitrary ART initiation. To capture the clinical and preventive benefits of treatment, the global HIV response now focuses on increasing HIV diagnosis and ART coverage. CD4 counts for ART initiation were necessary when medications were expensive and had severe side effects, and when the impact of early ART initiation was unclear. However, current evidence suggests that although CD4 counts may still play a role in guiding clinical care to start prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, CD4 counts should cease to be required for ART initiation.

### Relative lymphocyte count as an indicator of 3-year mortality in elderly people with severe COPD [^114R2vCk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The hypothalamus-hypophysis-adrenal axis is a sensitive feedback system for various pathophysiological conditions leading to neurohumoral activation. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that severe COPD is associated with a generalized increase in circulating catecholamines and cytokines. By increasing the production of selected cytokines, mainly of interleukin-6, cathecolamines indirectly stimulate the corticotropin-releasing hormone, which leads to increased secretion of cortisol and a consequent reduction in circulating lymphocytes. Therefore, neurohumoral activation and the immune system demodulation produce a vicious circle that may worsen the prognosis in elderly patients with severe COPD and low relative lymphocyte count. The demonstration that plasma interleukin-6 levels increase with age and in patients with COPD supports this interpretation.

Furthermore, activation of the inflammatory systems could be responsible for the cachexia and hypermetabolic state found in some patients with severe COPD. A low relative lymphocyte count can be considered as a surrogate marker for malnutrition in patients with severe COPD, and thus as a negative prognostic factor. Fuenzalida et al. demonstrated a partial recovery in immune system components, and lymphocyte count in particular, in patients with COPD who underwent a dedicated nutritional program. Therefore, the negative prognostic value of low lymphocyte count in elderly patients with COPD could be related to different conditions (cortisol and adrenergic hyperactivation, malnutrition, comorbidities, etc.), which impair the survival of such individuals. Thus, the relative lymphocyte count represents more than a simple marker of immunological deficit.

This study has some limitations, as follows: 1) lymphocyte subpopulations were not measured, and thus the respective prognostic role of deficits of the cellular and humoral immunity could not be assessed; 2) some degree of uncertainty exists in determining the cause of death in this kind of study, and, theoretically, this could affect the interpretation of the relationship between lymphopenia and mortality; 3) orthopnea and fluid retention are not uncommon in severe COPD complicated by hypoxemia and hypercapnia, and could simulate congestive heart failure. However, the stringent criteria used to diagnose congestive heart failure and the results of survival analysis for patients without congestive heart failure support the reliability of the current conclusions. Nevertheless, the proposed prognostic model should be tested in a population with only moderate COPD in order to limit further the potential confounding effect of congestive heart failure.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^112dh6FY]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity

Aging is correlated with alterations in lymphocytes. In older individuals severely affected by sepsis, a pronounced decrease in lymphocytes, especially in T cells, is evident, with these reductions persisting over extended periods. In a study involving 2300 sepsis patients, 42.6% demonstrated enduring lymphopenia, primarily observed in elderly individuals who also presented a higher prevalence of chronic complications and elevated APACHE IV and SOFA scores. Further, elderly sepsis patients manifested exacerbated apoptosis and proliferative disturbances in CD4 + T cell subsets. Aging and nutritional changes could augment the effects of cellular apoptosis. Additionally, diminished TCR diversity, spurred by lymphopenia, aggravates immune aging, potentially escalating the readmission rates in elderly patients. Remarkably, similar trends of persistent lymphopenia and raised regulatory T cell frequencies have been noticed not only in the elderly but also in neonates with hospital-acquired sepsis and early clinical infections.

Different pathogens may induce diverse lymphopenic patterns. Numerous studies distinctively addressing bacterial and viral-induced sepsis have yielded results beneficial for precision therapy. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections can reduce B/T cells, albeit more pronounced in the former case. Prolonged lymphopenia was significantly associated with worse clinical prognoses in influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections but not other respiratory viruses. Moreover, extensive replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is conjectured to be a plausible cause of lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients, as high viral loads might diminish peripheral blood lymphocyte counts either by inducing more significant cell apoptosis or by prompting lymphocyte migration to infected tissues. The research also indicated a positive correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin levels with viral load and a negative correlation with lymphocyte count, suggesting that control of viral replication could ameliorate lymphopenia. This hints at the necessity of considering tissue infiltration effects in lymphocyte count evaluations and proposes the potential utility of CRP and ferritin as readily accessible clinical indicators to reflect the correlation between lymphocyte levels and specific viral loads. Research also highlights that host genetic variations might affect lymphocyte quantities. A broader discussion encompassing more heterogeneous evidence is underway.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116kZkpy]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

CD4 count monitoring — The CD4 count is the most important laboratory indicator of immune function in people with HIV, and low pretreatment CD4 count is the strongest predictor of disease progression and mortality according to findings from clinical trials and cohort studies. CD4 counts are highly variable; a significant change (2 standard deviations) between two tests is approximately a 30% change in the absolute count, or an increase or decrease in CD4 percentage by three percentage points. Monitoring of lymphocyte subsets other than CD4 (e.g. CD8, CD19) is not recommended (BIII) because it has not been proven to be clinically useful and is more expensive than monitoring CD4 count alone.

### Hematological abnormalities in COVID-19: a narrative review [^114omM7H]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Common hematological abnormalities in COVID-19 are lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated D -dimer and CRP levels. These alterations are significantly more common/prominent in patients with severe COVID-19 disease, and thus may serve as a possible biomarker for those needing hospitalization and ICU care. As performing complex tests for identification of coagulation abnormalities is not practical in a pandemic setting, the use of serial D -dimer levels may be considered in view of practical clinical decisions. Close attention needs to be paid to coagulation abnormalities and steps taken to prevent these occurring or to mitigate their harmful effects.

Factors that affect absolute CD4 count — basis, variability, and preferred parameter: The absolute CD4 count is a calculated value based on the total white blood cell (WBC) count and the percentages of total and CD4 T lymphocytes, and this absolute number may fluctuate or be influenced by factors affecting WBC count and lymphocyte percentages, such as use of bone marrow–suppressive medications, chronic corticosteroids, or acute infections; splenectomy or coinfection with human T-lymphotropic virus type I may cause misleadingly elevated CD4 counts, and in these settings CD4 percentage remains stable and may be a more appropriate parameter to assess a person's immune function.

Use of CD4 count for monitoring response to ART — The CD4 count is used to assess a person's immunologic response to ART and to determine whether prophylaxis for OIs can be discontinued. For most people, an adequate response is defined as an increase in CD4 count in the range of 50 cells/mm3 to 150 cells/mm3 in the first year of ART, generally with an accelerated response in the first 3 months of treatment, and subsequent increases average approximately 50 cells/mm3 to 100 cells/mm3 per year until a steady state level is reached; people who initiate therapy with a low CD4 count or at an older age may have a blunted increase in their counts despite virologic suppression.

We assessed 59 articles as eligible (included patient-level clinical data) and identified 8 studies (included lymphocyte counts and stratification of illness severity) for the quantitative synthesis (Appendix Table). These studies described 1,289 cases of COVID-19, of which 592 (45.9%) were classified as severe.

We compared lymphocyte and leukocyte counts in patients with severe/critical versus mild cases of COIVD-19 (Appendix Figure). All laboratory data were captured at the time of patient admission. Overall, patients categorized as having severe illness tended to have lower lymphocyte counts (pooled MD −0.36, 95% CI −0.50 to −0.22; p < 0.00001) and higher leukocyte counts (pooled MD 1.32, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.02; p < 0.00001). Fan et al. reported an absolute lymphocyte count of > 1.0 × 10 9 cells/L for 39/58 (69.6%) patients in the nonsevere group and 2/9 (22.2%) patients in the severe group. Huang et al. reported an absolute lymphocyte count of < 1 × 10 9 cells/L in 15/28 (54%) patients in the nonsevere group and 11/13 (83%) in the severe group. Wan et al. reported an absolute lymphocyte count of < 1.0 × 10 9 cells/L for 36/95 (38%) patients in the nonsevere group and 32/40 (80%) in the severe group. Zhang et al. reported a decreased lymphocyte count for 28/82 (70.7%) patients in the nonsevere group and 46/56 (82.1%) in the severe group.

### Clinical and molecular features of immunodeficiency in patients with telomere biology disorders [^114DWDCo]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunodeficiency in telomere biology disorders (TBDs) has been described in pediatric patients with severe phenotypes, but less characterized within the broader TBD spectrum. We collected complete blood counts, lymphocyte subsets, and infection history from 88 consecutive TBD patients with a median age of 37 years (range 6–76). Most patients were > 18 years old (80/88; 90%) and harbored either a TERT (45%) or TERC (32%) germline mutation. Thirty-two patients (36%) experienced significant infections (opportunistic, recurrent, and/or requiring hospitalization); 47% had lymphopenia, and 3% severe neutropenia. Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) < 0.96 and < 1.1 x103/µL, but not severe neutropenia, associated with increased infection risk and lower overall survival, respectively. Decreased CD3+ T-cells, both CD4+ and CD8+, associated with BMF, increased infection risk, and reduced survival. Low CD3+ and CD4+ associated with solid cancers. Telomere length was shortened across the cohort without correlation with ALC or lymphocyte subsets. In a predominantly adult cohort of TBDs, immunodeficiency was marked by T lymphopenia, possibly a consequence of accelerated aging in the hematopoietic compartment. An ALC cut-off of < 1.1 x103/µL may be a useful biomarker to identify patients with an increased risk of infection, a major cause of death of TBD patients.

### Host response to infection: not all lymphopenia is created equal in SARS-CoV-2 [^111XbFPG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The last decade has demonstrated how outwardly similar patients may have substantial underlying biological heterogeneity, even in acute illness syndromes such as SARS-CoV-2. Identifying biological subphenotypes of acute illness and understanding how those differences may inform selection of different therapies are key precision medicine research priorities in critical care. Although Michels and colleagues raise more questions than answers, this excellent study demonstrates how a precision medicine framework integrating clinical observations, molecular assays, and advanced data analyses can bring new insights into the immunology of severe infection.

### Early decrease in blood lymphocyte count is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^116TG2K5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the early stage, lymphocyte count can dynamically reflect the pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 patients. An early decrease in lymphocyte count is associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. This finding may indicate that COVID-19 patients with decreased lymphocytes after admission need more attention.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^117XkQHV]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Introduction — risk factors in children with HIV: Numerous studies have documented an increased risk of TB in children and adults with HIV. A decreasing or low CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count is not necessary for an increased risk of TB in children with HIV, but decreasing CD4 cell counts reflect diminishing immunity, which further increases the risk for TB disease. Multiple studies conducted in resource-limited settings have demonstrated that among children with HIV, those with TB disease tend to have lower CD4 cell counts and percentages than those without TB disease. In addition, while rare, congenital TB might be more common among children born to mothers with TB/HIV coinfection, especially when those children have also perinatally acquired HIV.

### Diroximel fumarate (Vumerity) [^112taEiX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In these controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, among patients who did not experience prolonged, severe lymphopenia during treatment, the median times for lymphocyte counts to return to normal after discontinuing dimethyl fumarate were as follows:

4.3 weeks in patients with mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count ≥ 0.8 x 109/L) at discontinuation,
10.0 weeks in patients with moderate lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.5 to < 0.8 x 109/L) at discontinuation, and
16.7 weeks in patients with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 0.5 x 109/L) at discontinuation.

Neither VUMERITY nor dimethyl fumarate have been studied in patients with preexisting low lymphocyte counts.

Obtain a complete blood count (CBC), including lymphocyte count, before initiating treatment with VUMERITY, 6 months after starting treatment, and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Consider interruption of VUMERITY in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.5 × 109/L persisting for more than six months. Given the potential for delayed recovery of lymphocyte counts, continue to obtain lymphocyte counts until their recovery if VUMERITY is discontinued or interrupted because of lymphopenia. Consider withholding treatment from patients with serious infections until resolution. Decisions about whether or not to restart VUMERITY should be individualized based on clinical circumstances.

### Effectiveness of the relative lymphocyte count to predict one-year mortality in patients with acute heart failure [^111JJYos]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Several works have endorsed a significant role of the immune system and inflammation in the pathogenesis of heart failure. As indirect evidence, an association between a low relative lymphocyte count (RLC%) and worse outcomes found in this population has been suggested. Nevertheless, the role of RLC% for risk stratification in a large and nonselected population of patients with acute heart failure (AHF) has not yet been determined. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the association between low RLC% and 1-year mortality in patients with AHF and consequently to define whether it has any role for early risk stratification. A total of 1,192 consecutive patients admitted for AHF were analyzed. Total white blood cell and differential counts were measured on admission. RLC% (calculated as absolute lymphocyte count/total white blood cell count) was categorized in quintiles and its association with all-cause mortality at 1 year assessed using Cox regression. At 1 year, 286 deaths (24%) were identified. A negative trend was observed between 1-year mortality rates and quintiles of RLC%: 31.5%, 27.2%, 23.1%, 23%, and 15.5% in quintiles 1 to 5, respectively (p for trend < 0.001). After thorough covariate adjustment, only patients in the lowest quintile (< 9.7%) showed an increased risk for mortality (hazard ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 2.65, p = 0.006). When RLC% was modeled with restricted cubic splines, a stepped increase in risk was observed patients in quintile 1: those with RLC% values < 7.5% and < 5% showed 1.95- and 2.66-fold increased risk for death compared to those in the top quintile. In conclusion, in patients with AHF, RLC% is a simple, widely available, and inexpensive biomarker, with potential for identifying patients at increased risk for 1-year mortality.

### Usefulness of total lymphocyte count as predictor of outcome in patients with chronic heart failure [^112mA54Y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Low lymphocyte count has been considered a predictive marker of unfavorable outcomes for patients with heart failure (HF). Baseline blood samples for complete blood counts, differential counts, renal function tests. and lipid profile were prospectively obtained to assess the association between lymphocyte count and clinical outcomes in 305 patients with HF (average New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 2.8). The mean follow-up duration was 4.7 years (range 8 months to 8.4 years), and 111 patients (36%) died during the follow-up period. The mean lymphocyte count for the group was 1,803.64 ± 740.3, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 37%. Patients with low lymphocyte counts (< 1,600 median count) after 8 years had significantly lower survival rates than those with lymphocyte counts ≥ 1,600 (58% vs 72%, p = 0.012). The prediction of poorest survival was for patients in NYHA class III or IV and with lymphocyte counts < 1,600. Regression analysis showed that lymphocyte level, the LVEF, and NYHA class were predictors of mortality. Of these, NYHA class was the most prominent predictor, followed by lymphocyte count, which was even more significant than the LVEF (hazard ratio 0.76, p = 0.037). In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrate that total lymphocyte count is an important prognostic factor, inversely associated with predicted mortality. Although the total low lymphocyte count was correlated with a lower NYHA class and a lower LVEF, it emerged as an independent death risk factor in patients with chronic HF.

### Relative lymphocyte count: a prognostic indicator of mortality in elderly patients with congestive heart failure [^116dsQfr]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A reduction in the relative lymphocyte count is a marker of the stress response; however, its prognostic value remains undetermined. The objective of this study was to investigate the predictive value of the relative lymphocyte count for survival in elderly patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).

Methods and Results

One thousand two hundred seventy-four consecutive patients above the age of 65 years hospitalized with heart disease were enrolled in the CHF Italian Study and followed up for 3 years. Of these, 413 patients were excluded because of factors that could affect the lymphocyte count. Of the remaining 861 patients, 423 (49%) met the criteria for the diagnosis of CHF (mean age 76 ± 7 years, 51% men), of whom 162 patients (38%) had a relative lymphocyte count ≤ 20%. The 3-year all-cause mortality in patients with CHF and a relative lymphocyte count ≤ 20% was 64% compared with 40% in patients with a relative lymphocyte count > 20% (P < .0001). The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for death in patients with CHF and low relative lymphocyte count was 1.76 (95% confidence interval 1.34–2.32, P = .0001). After adjustment for baseline differences and variables associated with or known to affect lymphocyte count, the hazard ratio remained significantly different from 1.0 (hazard ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.21–2.48, P = .0026).

Conclusion

A low relative lymphocyte count is an independent marker of poor prognosis in elderly patients with CHF. The relative lymphocyte count is a simple, accurate, widely available, and inexpensive marker that can help to identify elderly patients with CHF who are at increased risk for mortality. The pathophysiologic mechanism of this observation remains to be determined.

### What to Do with an abnormal newborn screen for severe combined immune deficiency [^1111CzUh]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency has been implemented in all 50 states. This screening identifies newborns with T-cell lymphopenia. After an abnormal screening, additional testing is needed to determine if the child has severe combined immunodeficiency. Because screening programs vary, it is imperative for the clinical immunologist to understand how screening is done in their state and to prepare an effective assessment protocol for the management of these patients. Part of this assessment should include training and helping to ensure the effective delivery of this news to the family, a skill neither intuitive nor classically taught to immunologists.

### Why is my patient neutropenic? [^112gi4vA]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is a common reason for hematology consultations in the inpatient and outpatient settings and is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL. Neutropenia varies in severity, with more profound neutropenia being associated with higher rates of infections and infection-related deaths. The causes for neutropenia are diverse and include congenital and acquired conditions (ie, autoimmune, drugs, infection, and malignancy). This article outlines the most common causes of neutropenia and discusses differential diagnoses, treatment modalities, and the mechanisms by which neutropenia occurs.

### Monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam) [^112MfAko]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In these controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, among patients who did not experience prolonged, severe lymphopenia during treatment, the median times for lymphocyte counts to return to normal after discontinuing dimethyl fumarate were as follows:

4.3 weeks in patients with mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count ≥ 0.8x109/L) at discontinuation,

16.7 weeks in patients with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 0.5x109/L) at discontinuation.

Neither BAFIERTAM nor dimethyl fumarate have been studied in patients with preexisting low lymphocyte counts.

Obtain a CBC, including lymphocyte count, before initiating treatment with BAFIERTAM, 6 months after starting treatment, and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Consider interruption of BAFIERTAM in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.5 x 109/L persisting for more than six months. Given the potential for delayed recovery of lymphocyte counts, continue to obtain lymphocyte counts until their recovery if BAFIERTAM is discontinued or interrupted because of lymphopenia. Consider withholding treatment from patients with serious infections until resolution. Decisions about whether or not to restart BAFIERTAM should be individualized based on clinical circumstances.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1172pikM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) disease — HIV-associated cervical and anal neoplasia risk: In the United States and Western Europe, women with HIV/AIDS have significantly higher rates of cervical cancer than the general population, and recent cohort data show a relationship between low CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and cervical cancer risk. HIV infection and low CD4 cell count have been consistently and strongly associated with HPV infection and with precancerous cervical lesions, including low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and the precursor to cervical cancer, CIN 3. Higher rates of HPV infection and CIN are seen in adolescents with HIV, regardless of whether HIV was acquired vertically or horizontally. Among female adolescents with perinatal HIV infection, 30% had an abnormality on their first Pap test and genital warts had a cumulative rate of 12% by age 19 years. CD4 cell count has been related to risk of anal cancer, and high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) is more common in adults and adolescents who are HIV seropositive than in those who are HIV seronegative.

### Importance of hematological parameters for micro-and macrovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: the rio de janeiro type 2 diabetes cohort study [^113NXMpm]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Relatively few studies evaluated low absolute lymphocytes count as a prognostic marker; three were in patients with cardiovascular diseases, two in population-based samples and none of them in individuals with diabetes. An observational cohort study showed that low lymphocytes were predictive of all-cause and several cause-specific mortality, including cardiovascular one. The other population-based retrospective study showed that lymphopenia was associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, which was particularly evident in individuals with elevated C-reactive protein and/or RDW, a parameter of bone marrow dysregulation that may reflect chronic inflammation. Another investigation performed in a retrospective database of patients who were referred to coronary angiography also demonstrated low lymphocytes count as a predictor of mortality, and the association with higher RDW improved its predictive capacity. In accordance with these studies, we demonstrated in a type 2 diabetes population that low lymphocyte count was a predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortalities, and additionally we also showed that low lymphocyte count was a predictor of total CVEs. We may speculate on the reasons why lymphopenia was an independent risk factor for mortality in individuals of different clinical settings. This might be due to a decreased immune vigilance that makes them less capable of surviving to severe disease. As well, reduced lymphocytes could be an indicator of general frailty that confers and an increased risk of any cause of death. Indeed, older age is associated with reduced lymphocytes count that may compromise global immune capacity. Reduced lymphocytes might also indicate chronic inflammatory, metabolic or neuro-endocrine stress factors and thus be associated with reduced survival as an epiphenomenon.

### Nomogram for predicting early mortality after umbilical cord blood transplantation in children with inborn errors of immunity [^112aRzKJ]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, a low absolute count of CD4-positive lymphocytes was associated with a high risk of early mortality. CD4-positive lymphocytes play an important role in adaptive immunity. The deficiency of immune defense and surveillance caused by CD4-positive lymphocytopenia can provoke fatal opportunistic infections and lead to malignancy. In patients with IEI, a decrease in CD4-positive lymphocytes is often closely associated with combined immunodeficiency diseases, especially SCID. Even when we excluded SCID patients (N = 48) characterized by low CD4 levels from our cohort, the absolute count of CD4-positive lymphocytes in the early mortality group remained significantly lower than that in the other patients group (p = 0.03). Thus, our study highlights the association between lower CD4 levels and early mortality, and clinicians should be alert to patients whose CD4-positive lymphocyte count decrease before UCBT.

Our result also showed that a history of sepsis was positively associated with early mortality after UCBT in patients with IEI. Few studies have shown the association between a history of sepsis and HSCT prognosis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, and it remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients worldwide. Virtually all tissues and organs can undergo dysfunction following sepsis. Although sepsis was under control in our cohort before transplantation, patients with a history of sepsis were more likely to experience early mortality. We speculate that the long-term consequences of sepsis had a negative impact on UCBT prognosis. Our results highlight the need to identify the history of sepsis as a risk factor for an unfavorable prognosis after UCBT in patients with IEI since patients who undergo UCBT before the onset of sepsis may have better outcomes.

### Immunological consequences of CAR T-cell therapy: an analysis of infectious complications and immune reconstitution [^114UgjoL]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe ICANS is associated with lower lymphocyte and CD4 + T-cell counts

To investigate whether patient characteristics or preconditions have an influence on immune reconstitution in patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells, we analyzed the course of ANC, lymphocytes, CD4 +, and CD8 + T cells, and CD56 + lymphocyte counts. Interestingly, neither sex, > 2 previous therapy lines, or CRS had a significant influence on the cellular reconstitution within the first year after treatment (mixed effects model, as shown in Figure 5 Ai-Ci). ICANS grading > 1 is associated with lower lymphocyte and CD4 + T-cell counts (mixed effects model, column factor: P = .02 and P = .01), but not with lower ANC (Figure 5 Aii-Cii). HEMATOTX grading was not associated with the long-term ANC (Figure 5 Aiii; p = 0.19). Unexpectedly, low HEMATOTOX grading was associated with lower lymphocyte and CD4 + counts in the long-term follow-up but not in the short-term follow-up (Figure 5 Biii, Ciii; time × column factor; p = 0.03 and P = .01).

Squares indicate mean values and whiskers indicate standard deviation. Data were analyzed with a mixed effects model. ICANS grading > 1 is associated with lower lymphocyte and CD4 + T-cell counts (column factor, P = .02 and P = .01, respectively).

### Cladribine (Mavenclad) [^1131MS8g]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Risk of Teratogenicity

MAVENCLAD may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Malformations and embryolethality occurred in animals [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus during MAVENCLAD dosing and for 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course.

In females of reproductive potential, pregnancy should be excluded before initiation of each treatment course of MAVENCLAD and prevented by the use of effective contraception during MAVENCLAD dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose of each treatment course. Women who become pregnant during treatment with MAVENCLAD should discontinue treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. MAVENCLAD is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception.

5.3 Lymphopenia

MAVENCLAD causes a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. In clinical studies, 87% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients experienced lymphopenia. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment course and were lower with each additional treatment course. In patients treated with a cumulative dose of MAVENCLAD 3.5 mg per kg over 2 courses as monotherapy, 26% and 1% had nadir absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 and less than 200 cells per microliter, respectively. At the end of the second treatment course, 2% of clinical study patients had lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter; median time to recovery to at least 800 cells per microliter was approximately 28 weeks.

Additive hematological adverse reactions may be expected if MAVENCLAD is administered prior to or concomitantly with other drugs that affect the hematological profile [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. The incidence of lymphopenia less than 500 cells per microliter was higher in patients who had used drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS prior to study entry (32.1%), compared to those with no prior use of these drugs (23.8%).

Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential including lymphocyte count prior to, during, and after treatment with MAVENCLAD. See Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) for timing of CBC measurements and additional instructions based on the patient's lymphocyte counts and clinical status (e.g., infections).

### Prognostic value of lymphocyte count for in-hospital mortality in patients with severe AECOPD [^111VDh5G]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often have a poor prognosis. Biomarkers can help clinicians personalize the assessment of different patients and mitigate mortality. The present study sought to determine if the lymphocyte count could act as a risk factor for mortality in individuals with severe AECOPD.

Methods

A retrospective study was carried out with 458 cases who had severe AECOPD. For analysis, patients were divided into two groups on the basis of lymphocyte count: < 0.8×10 9 /L and ≥ 0.8×10 9 /L.

Results

Patients who fulfilled the criteria for inclusion were enrolled, namely 458 with a mean age of 78.2 ± 8.2 years. Of these patients, 175 had a low lymphocyte count. Compared to patients with normal lymphocyte counts, those with low counts were older (79.2 ± 7.4 vs. 77.5 ± 8.6 years, p = 0.036), had lower activities of daily living scores on admission (35.9 ± 27.6 vs. 47.5 ± 17.1, p < 0.001), and had a greater need for home oxygen therapy (84.6 vs. 72.1%, p = 0.002). Patients with low lymphocytes had higher mortality rates during hospitalization (17.1 vs. 7.1%, p = 0.001), longer hospital stay (median [IQR] 16 days [12–26] vs. 14 days [10–20], p = 0.002) and longer time on mechanical ventilation (median [IQR] 11.6 days [5.8–18.7] vs. 10.9 days [3.8–11.6], p < 0.001). The logistic regression analysis showed lymphocyte count < 0.8×10 9 /L was an independent risk factor associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 2.74, 95%CI 1.33–5.66, p = 0.006).

Conclusion

Lymphocyte count could act as a predictor of mortality in patients with severe AECOPD.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114SvMrj]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis — bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): For patients with suspected HP who have a compelling exposure history within the appropriate clinical context and a chest HRCT pattern typical for HP, we suggest not routinely using BAL fluid analysis to confirm a diagnosis of HP (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). BAL fluid analysis can narrow the differential diagnosis by excluding competing causes, particularly in nonfibrotic HP (eg, infection), but in patients with a high pretest probability of HP, the BAL cellular differential generally does not significantly alter the post-test probability and as a result adds little additional diagnostic information. In the appropriate clinical context, a history of clinically relevant exposure to a compelling IA with a typical high-resolution CT pattern allows for a confident diagnosis of HP. Lymphocytic alveolitis is not consistently present in patients with fibrotic HP, and BAL fluid lymphocytosis is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of fibrotic HP; however, BAL fluid lymphocytosis may increase diagnostic confidence when the IA is identified and HRCT findings are compatible with HP and should be considered when the exposure history and imaging data are discordant, and may exclude common alternative diagnoses, such as IPF, when the lymphocyte differential count is high (eg, ≥ 40%).

The incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly globally; as of March 29, 2020, ≈670,000 cases had been confirmed worldwide. COVID-19 is typically a pulmonary infection that can range from mild illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure; however, other symptoms such as myalgias and anorexia have been noted. Although many ongoing studies are investigating measurement of proinflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers as a way to prognosticate infection severity, we investigated use of 2 easily obtained predictors: lymphopenia and leukocytosis.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114GsRFV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

HIV primary care — CD4 count interpretation emphasizes staging and percentage correlates: The initial CD4 cell count is used to stage HIV infection, establish the risk of specific HIV-associated complications, and determine the need for prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (OIs). Total CD4 counts of 200 and 500 cells/µL generally correspond to CD4 cell percentages of 14% and 29%, respectively. In children aged < 5 years, there is more variability in the absolute CD4 cell count; therefore, CD4 percentage is generally preferred for monitoring immune status.

### Risk factors associated with low CD4 + lymphocyte count among HIV-positive pregnant women in Nigeria [^115mQCVt]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the risk factors for CD4+ lymphocyte counts of 200 cells/mm(3) or lower in HIV-positive pregnant women in Nigeria.

Method

A cross-sectional data analysis from a prospective cohort of 515 HIV-positive women attending a prenatal clinic. Risk of a low CD4+ count was estimated using logistic regression analysis.

Results

CD4+ lymphocyte counts of 200 cells/mm(3) or lower (280 ± 182 cells/mm(3)) were recorded in 187 (36.3%) out of 515 HIV-positive pregnant women included in the study. Low CD4+ count was associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–95.53), lack of condom use (aOR, 5.16; 95% CI, 1.12–23.8), history of genital ulcers (aOR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.12–2.82), and history of vaginal discharge (aOR; 1.62; 1.06–2.48).

Conclusions

Over 35% of the HIV-positive pregnant women had low CD4+ counts, indicating the need for treatment. The findings underscore the need to integrate prevention of mother-to-child transmission with HIV treatment and care, particularly services for sexually transmitted infections.

Lymphopenia — workup and management for patients on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy include structured evaluation and targeted prophylaxis. Workup should include history with special attention to nutritional status and exposures to lymphocyte depleting therapy, physical examination with special attention to spleen size, complete blood count with differential, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, chest X‑ray to evaluate for thymoma, and assessment for infections including bacterial, fungal, and viral causes (specifically CMV or HIV). Management states that no specific action is required for lymphopenia G1–G3 and ICPI therapy should be continued; for G4, continue ICPI therapy and initiate Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis and Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with CMV screening, perform HIV or hepatitis screening if not already done, and consider EBV testing if there is evidence of lymphadenopathy or hepatitis, fevers, and hemolysis concerning for lymphoproliferative disease.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115LM7qp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale for question

Hematologic abnormalities (i.e. leukopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or pancytopenia) are manifestations of sarcoidosis that raise the possibility of bone marrow involvement, although this is not the most common cause of such abnormalities. Splenomegaly with sequestration may be a more common cause of hematologic abnormalities. In the absence of splenomegaly, compartmentalization of white blood cells to the site of organ involvement is a common cause of leukopenia and lymphopenia (,–). Additional causes of hematologic abnormalities are hepatic sarcoidosis, nonsarcoidosis medical problems, and treatment with immunosuppressive therapies, like methotrexate. Less-frequent hematologic abnormalities attributed to sarcoidosis include eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia. Pancytopenia may be a presenting manifestation of sarcoidosis, but the cytopenia more often presents as a secondary finding in those with active disease. As a result, the committee asked whether patients with sarcoidosis should undergo a baseline complete blood cell count testing to screen for hematological abnormalities.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^111t6zFG]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective study that included 77 sepsis and 23 non-sepsis adult patients, the daily lymphocyte count of the patients was calculated until discharge or death. Lymphocytes exhibited a high diagnosis of sepsis with an area under the curve value of 0.971 (95% CI = 0.916–0.994). The diagnostic efficacy of lymphocytes was more significant than other biomarkers, such as white blood cells, neutrophil count, and procalcitonin. The results also showed that the 28-day mortality rate was 39.66% in patients with persistent lymphocyte counts below 0.76 × 10^9/L, significantly higher than in patients without persistent lymphopenia. ALC is a promising, low-cost, rapid, and readily available biomarker for diagnosing sepsis. High vigilance is required for sepsis when a non-viral infection is suspected and lymphopenia levels are below the optimal threshold (0.76 × 10^9/L) value. In another single-center retrospective cohort study of 335 adult patients with bacteremia and sepsis, complete blood cell counts were recorded for the first four days following the diagnosis of sepsis. On Day 4, the median ALC was significantly higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors (1.1 × 10^3 cells/µl [IQR 0.7, 1.5] vs. 0.7 × 10^3 cells/µl [IQR 0.5, 1.0]). ALC was also found to be independently associated with 28-day survival (adjusted OR 0.68 [95% CI 0.51, 0.91]) and 1-year survival (adjusted OR 0.74 [95% CI 0.59, 0.93]). Thus, persistent lymphopenia on the fourth day after sepsis diagnosis predicts early and late mortality and may serve as a biomarker for sepsis-induced immunosuppression.

### Prediction of SARS-CoV-2-positivity from million-scale complete blood counts using machine learning [^113UwkUq]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The CBC is a simple and inexpensive exam. It is part of most laboratory routines, so "astute practitioners may use nuances and clues from the CBC in many clinical situations". Liu et al.devised a high accuracy risk assessment tool that can predict the mortality for COVID-19 through CBCs. Li et al.verified that the low count of white blood cells is related to COVID-19 severity by analyzing 12 death cases of COVID-19 and 18 individuals with moderate to severe symptoms, verifying low lymphocyte percentage in most of the cases. Although our dataset had no indicator of severity, we did find a drop in lymphocyte count the closer individuals were to their first positive RT-PCR results, corroborating this finding. Furthermore, we also verified many other analytes that shared a similar pattern. Although more research is needed, we believe that the key analytes indicated by our model might provide possibilities for future research. Literature suggests that there might be existing intrinsic relationships between analytes that might be characteristic of COVID-19. For instance, Nalbant et al.found that the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) might be particularly typical of COVID-19 infection. However, there is a profusion of other possible promising ratios and patterns currently being under-analyzed for the sake of COVID-19 diagnosis. One of the secondary goals of this work is to investigate this hypothesis, and we confirmed that our search algorithm tends to favor ratios over analyte count values.

### Immunity and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19: a systematic review [^116ewbsF]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a clinical syndrome caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Patients can be asymptomatic or present respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and even multiple-organ failure which can lead to death. The balance between an effective antiviral response and dysregulated immune response is the key factor determining the severity of COVID-19 progression. A systematic review was performed using the NCBI-PubMed database to find the articles related to COVID-19 immunity and inflammatory response published from 1 December 2019 to 15 April 2020. Haematological, immunological and biochemical parameters were extracted and correlated with disease severity, age and presence of comorbidities. Twelve articles were analysed comprising a total of 1042 hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 95 different parameters. Total lymphocyte count and levels of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells were decreased in severe and critical cases. Neutrophilia was found in patients who progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interleukin-six (IL-6) was high in mild and severe patients regardless of comorbidities. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and count and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were increased regardless of disease severity or presence of comorbidities. High levels of D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase were present in diabetic patients and patients who developed ARDS. Procalcitonin levels were elevated to varying degrees in severe and critical patients. We conclude that the total lymphocyte count, CD3+ and CD4+ T cells are low, especially in severe and critical COVID-19 patients; ESR, CRP and IL-6 were elevated, independent of the severity of disease. Understanding the inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients is essential for the development of better therapeutic and management strategies.

### The use of total lymphocyte count (TLC) as an independent criterion for initiating HAART in resource-poor countries [^1161F13o]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Total lymphocyte count (TLC) is a simple marker for monitoring HIV disease in resource-poor setting. A value of 1.2 x 10(9)l(-1) could be used as an independent criterion for starting antiretroviral treatment, since it is highly predictive of a low CD4 count warranting intervention.

When to Initiate Treatment

In addition to diagnostic criteria, the iwCLL guidelines dictate when to initiate treatment, based on patients' symptoms, full blood counts and physical examination. The presence of constitutional symptoms, progressive lymphocytosis, a doubling time of less than 6 months, an Hb of less than 100 g/L or a platelet count of less than 100 x 10 9 /L as well as progressive or symptomatic bulky lymphadenopathy/organomegaly or treatment-resistant autoimmune thrombocytopaenia or anaemia are indications to start treatment. In some circumstances, treatment may be initiated at diagnosis, but it is much more common for patient to be monitored for signs of increasing disease activity often over many years.

HIV-infected men with low testosterone — short-term testosterone effects: In randomized trials among HIV-infected men, adverse event rates did not differ from placebo, and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, HIV viral load, PSA, and plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not significantly different between groups. Overall, short-term (3 to 6 months) testosterone use in HIV-infected men with low testosterone concentrations and weight loss can lead to small gains in body weight, lean body mass, and mood, with minimal change in quality of life.

### Low lymphocyte counts and association with clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy… [^1176dCAU]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract e14600 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors improve survivals in a variety of cancer patients by harnessing the immune system. Pre-treatment lymphopenia as measured by absolute lymphocyte counts was associated with decreased progression-free survival and overall survival in patients receiving ICIs. During hospitalization ICI treatment is often deferred and efficacy in this population is unclear. Our study explores outcomes and predictive factors for hospitalized patients who received ICI therapy. Methods: Cancer patients who received inpatient ICI were identified in the institutional pharmacy database from 08/2016 to 07/2021. Data were abstracted from electronic medical records. Data were summarized according to frequency and percentage for qualitative variables, and by mean ± standard deviation, median, and range for quantitative variables. The 95% confidence interval for survival was calculated using the exact binomial distribution.

PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test between groups. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the discrimination ability of ALC for prognosis. Statistical significance was defined as 2-sided P < 0.
05. Results: Of 37 identified patients, 2 were excluded from the ALC analysis due to lack of blood counts. The most common cancer type treated was lung cancer. The majority of subjects were men and the median age was 57 years. Pre-treatment ALC < 600 cells/µL were associated with poor PFS and poor OS, respectively. Furthermore, patients with ALC < 600 were less likely to receive a subsequent ICI dose than their counterparts.

Conclusions: Administration of inpatient ICI therapy is associated with poor clinical outcomes and high rates of both inpatient mortality and death within 3 months of discharge. The presence of ALC < 600/µL in hospitalized patients was associated with poor clinical outcomes.

### Hodgkin's disease with leukopenia… [^115u2SQ8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The blood picture in Hodgkin's disease has been of great interest and a subject for controversy since Bunting1 published his classic work on this subject over two decades ago. Bunting postulated two constant features in the blood count: "an increase in blood platelets and an absolute increase in transitional cells. " Furthermore, he stated that "in early cases there is a transitory increase in lymphocytes and basophils with a deficiency in eosinophils and a normal or low neutrophil percentage which is followed by a gradual decrease in lymphocytes and an increase in eosinophils. In late cases there existed a marked neutrophilic leukocytosis with a diminution in white cell elements other than in those cells and the transitionals. " In the early cases of one year or less in duration he found that there was a normal or slightly diminished total while blood cell count and in those of longer duration a moderate or. Boyer S.
