## Question

how do you decide plan of care with elevated alkaline phosphatase

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to decide on a plan of care for an elevated alkaline phosphatase. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding transient causes. Then, I should verify the hepatic versus non-hepatic origin of ALP using GGT or isoenzymes. Next, I will review the liver test pattern and decide on first-line imaging. After that, I need to consider extrahepatic biliary obstruction versus intrahepatic cholestasis and pursue targeted serologies. Then, I should evaluate non-hepatic sources if GGT is normal. I will also assess severity and urgency, including when to refer or biopsy. Finally, I will outline disease-specific management, monitoring, and special populations, and close with documentation and follow-up requirements [^1156xFwp] [^114k6r3r] [^113XoUqa].

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and not jump to conclusions; I should repeat the liver panel to ensure persistence, review prior results, and contextualize with symptoms, medications, and comorbidities, because transient elevations are common and the magnitude of abnormality does not reliably predict clinical significance, and importantly, many patients with significant liver disease have only mild or even normal liver tests, so I need to avoid anchoring on the number alone [^1156xFwp] [^117VSnab] [^116bPbMD].

> Wait, let me verify the source of ALP before chasing liver disease; I should obtain GGT to confirm hepatobiliary origin, recognizing that GGT lacks specificity and can be elevated with alcohol, obesity, and medications, so if GGT is normal I should consider bone or other non-hepatic sources, and if the origin remains uncertain, ALP isoenzyme fractionation can help distinguish liver, bone, intestinal, or placental sources, especially in children, pregnancy, or when liver imaging is unrevealing [^111Zqb9T] [^115xNaAK] [^113Fviv2].

> Hold on, I should verify the pattern of liver injury; if ALP is disproportionately elevated relative to AST/ALT, that supports a cholestatic process, whereas predominant AST/ALT elevations indicate hepatocellular injury, and a mixed pattern suggests overlap, and I should calculate the R ratio to classify the pattern objectively as hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed, which will guide the differential and next steps [^116MrpTo] [^1155asMt].

> Next, I should review first-line imaging; a right upper quadrant ultrasound is appropriate to assess for biliary dilatation, stones, masses, and parenchymal disease, and if ductal dilatation is present, I need to escalate to MRCP or ERCP to evaluate for extrahepatic obstruction, whereas if ducts are not dilated, I should pivot to intrahepatic cholestasis and proceed with autoimmune serologies and consider MRCP if PSC is suspected [^114k6r3r] [^112SbFyr] [^115xNaAK].

> I will now examine targeted serologies for cholestatic liver disease; I should order AMA for PBC, and if positive, initiate UDCA and monitor for biochemical response, noting that deep biochemical response with normalization or near-normalization of ALP and bilirubin is associated with improved outcomes, and if AMA is negative but suspicion remains high, I should consider PBC-specific nuclear antibodies and, selectively, liver biopsy, while for PSC I should obtain MRCP and consider IgG4 to exclude secondary sclerosing cholangitis, and I should remember that normal ALP does not exclude early PSC, so clinical context matters [^111F46zi] [^112pZnZn] [^115udJMp] [^113FGaYR].

> But wait, what if GGT is normal; I need to check for non-hepatic sources of ALP such as bone disease, pregnancy, or malignancy, and in older adults with bone pain or incidental ALP elevation I should consider Paget disease and obtain plain radiographs of symptomatic bones and a radionuclide bone scan to define extent, using total ALP to monitor treatment response, and in children or adolescents I should remember physiologic growth-related ALP elevations and use age- and sex-specific reference ranges to avoid misclassification [^113Fviv2] [^114xjgbt] [^1164DS7j].

> I should double-check severity and urgency; marked ALP elevations, especially greater than five times the upper limit of normal, or any ALP elevation accompanied by jaundice, pruritus, or right upper quadrant pain warrant expedited evaluation for obstruction or acute cholangitis, and in patients with unexpected weight loss, elevated ALP increases the pretest probability of cancer and should lower the threshold for cancer investigation, while in known liver disease, rising ALP may herald decompensation and merits urgent hepatology input [^114k6r3r] [^112mdiUy] [^113XoUqa].

> Let me consider when to observe versus biopsy; if ALP is only mildly elevated, GGT is normal, imaging is unrevealing, and the patient is asymptomatic, observation with repeat testing in 3 to 6 months is reasonable, but if ALP remains persistently elevated beyond 6 months or exceeds two times the upper limit of normal, I should reconsider liver biopsy or advanced imaging to clarify diagnosis and stage disease, balancing risks and potential to change management [^114k6r3r] [^113XoUqa].

> Next, I should review disease-specific management; for PBC, I will start UDCA and reassess biochemistry at 6 to 12 months, adding second-line therapy such as obeticholic acid or bezafibrate if ALP remains above 1.67 times the upper limit of normal or if bilirubin is elevated, aiming for the lowest achievable ALP and bilirubin because deep biochemical response correlates with improved transplant-free survival, while for PSC I should avoid high-dose UDCA, monitor for cholangiocarcinoma, and consider MRCP surveillance and liver transplant referral for advanced disease, and for drug-induced cholestasis I must stop the offending agent and monitor until resolution [^112pZnZn] [^114dCFEU] [^111wLwHR].

> I need to ensure I address complications and comorbidities; cholestasis can cause fat-soluble vitamin deficiency and coagulopathy, so I should check INR and consider a trial of vitamin K if prolonged, and I should screen for osteoporosis given chronic cholestasis and consider bone-directed therapy when indicated, while also reviewing medications and supplements comprehensively for potential hepatotoxicity and using resources like LiverTox to guide attribution and management [^114sDDx7] [^112eit57].

> Let me verify special populations; in pregnancy, ALP is physiologically elevated from placental production, so I should avoid over-calling cholestasis unless other liver tests are abnormal or symptoms arise, in children I must use age-specific ALP ranges and consider genetic or metabolic cholestatic disorders if GGT is unexpectedly low, and in persons with HIV, an elevated ALP may reflect opportunistic hepatobiliary infection or drug toxicity and warrants a lower threshold for imaging and targeted infectious workup [^113Fviv2] [^1164DS7j] [^111qAJ71].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic implications; in PBC, achieving normal or near-normal ALP and bilirubin is associated with the lowest risk of transplantation or death, and in metastatic disease, higher ALP correlates with tumor burden and worse survival, so I should communicate these risks transparently and align monitoring intensity with prognosis and patient goals [^112XxVng] [^115FNR5c].

> I will now examine monitoring and follow-up; for confirmed cholestatic liver disease, I should track ALP, GGT, bilirubin, and albumin periodically to gauge treatment response, for PBC I should reassess at 6 to 12 months after UDCA and consider second-line therapy if biochemical response is inadequate, and for Paget disease I should follow total ALP every 3 to 6 months to assess bisphosphonate response, adjusting therapy accordingly [^112pZnZn] [^114xjgbt].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are complete; I should record the confirmed abnormality, the interpreted pattern, the imaging and serologic workup, the working diagnosis, the management plan with rationale, and the follow-up interval, and I should communicate clearly with the patient about the significance of ALP elevation, the expected course, red flags, and when to seek urgent care, because missed or incompletely evaluated abnormal liver tests are common and represent a lost opportunity to intervene early [^114FH32S] [^113XoUqa].

An elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) requires a **stepwise approach**: confirm persistence and exclude transient causes, then **confirm hepatic origin with GGT** [^111Zqb9T]. If GGT is elevated, obtain a **right upper quadrant ultrasound** [^116VCtcF] to assess for biliary obstruction or mass lesions [^113XoUqa]; if normal, pursue autoimmune serologies (AMA, ANA, ASMA) [^114k6r3r] for PBC/PSC [^115udJMp] and consider MRCP/ERCP if PSC is suspected [^115udJMp]. If GGT is normal, evaluate for **bone disease** (Paget's, metastases, vitamin D deficiency) [^113Fviv2] [^115iC68h] and **medication-induced ALP elevation** [^112eit57]. Management is cause-specific: treat obstruction, autoimmune cholangiopathies, bone disease, or drug-induced injury [^111F46zi] [^111wLwHR] [^11154Hag]; monitor ALP trends to guide therapy and prognosis [^112XxVng] [^112iRJLG].

---

## Step 1: confirm and characterize the elevation

- **Repeat testing**: Confirm persistence and exclude lab error or transient causes (recent meals, minor trauma, intercurrent illness) [^1156xFwp].

- **Pattern recognition**: Compare ALP with ALT, AST, GGT, and bilirubin to classify as cholestatic, hepatocellular, or mixed [^116MrpTo] [^1155asMt].

- **Clinical context**: Review symptoms (pruritus, jaundice, bone pain), medications/supplements, alcohol, metabolic risk factors, and comorbidities [^115PkWRv].

---

## Step 2: confirm hepatic origin

GGT is the **first-line test** [^114Kk3U6] to confirm a hepatobiliary source; if normal, consider bone or other non-hepatic causes [^113Fviv2]. If the origin remains unclear, **ALP isoenzyme analysis** can differentiate hepatic, bone, intestinal, or placental sources [^notfound].

---

## Step 3: imaging and initial evaluation

Order a **right upper quadrant ultrasound** [^116VCtcF] to assess for biliary obstruction, gallstones, masses, or liver parenchymal disease [^113BpbEZ]. If ultrasound is inconclusive but suspicion for PSC remains, **MRCP or ERCP** [^115udJMp] should be considered [^114k6r3r].

---

## Step 4: laboratory evaluation based on imaging results

| **Imaging result** | **Next laboratory tests** |
|-|-|
| Biliary obstruction | - LFTs <br/> - Viral hepatitis serologies (HBV, HCV) <br/> - Tumor markers (CEA, CA 19–9) <br/> - Coagulation profile [^113LJvTk] |
| No obstruction | - Autoimmune serologies (AMA, ANA, ASMA) [^114k6r3r] <br/> - IgM/IgG <br/> - Viral hepatitis serologies <br/> - Consider Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency if indicated [^1155asMt] |

---

## Step 5: evaluate non-hepatic causes if GGT is normal

- **Bone disease**: Paget's disease, metastatic bone disease, vitamin D deficiency, hyperparathyroidism [^113Fviv2] [^115iC68h].

- **Medications**: Anticonvulsants, antibiotics, NSAIDs, and others [^notfound].

- **Physiological**: Pregnancy, childhood growth spurts [^113Fviv2].

---

## Step 6: management based on identified cause

- **Biliary obstruction**: ERCP with stone extraction or stenting; surgical consultation for malignancy [^notfound].

- **PBC**: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA); obeticholic acid or fibrates if inadequate response [^114dCFEU] [^117MPwoL].

- **PSC**: UDCA (moderate dose); consider ERCP for strictures; liver transplant evaluation if advanced [^111wLwHR].

- **Bone disease**: Bisphosphonates for Paget's; treat underlying malignancy or metabolic disorder [^115iC68h].

- **Drug-induced**: Discontinue offending agent; monitor recovery [^11154Hag].

---

## Step 7: monitoring and follow-up

Track **ALP trends** to assess treatment response and disease progression [^112pZnZn]. Provide **patient education** on the cause, prognosis, and adherence to therapy and lifestyle changes. Schedule regular follow-up with periodic labs and imaging as indicated.

---

## Special considerations

- **Children**: Use age-specific reference ranges; consider genetic cholestatic disorders if GGT is low with cholestasis [^112XLmib].

- **Pregnancy**: Physiological ALP elevation is common; evaluate if other liver tests are abnormal or symptoms occur [^115LahNR].

- **Elderly**: Higher prevalence of malignancy and bone disease; maintain a low threshold for imaging [^115iC68h].

---

A structured approach — confirm persistence, confirm hepatic origin, image, and tailor labs — ensures accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy, with **ALP trends informing response and prognosis** [^1155Yms9].

Conclusion

The findings of this study have significant implications for the clinical management of patients with CRLM. By demonstrating a strong association between ALP level and mortality risk, we provide clinicians with a simple, cost-effective and readily available tool for prognostic assessment. Based on our findings, we propose several practical clinical applications. Elevated ALP levels should prompt more intensive monitoring and potentially more aggressive treatment approaches, particularly for patients with multiple liver metastases. This biomarker can help identify high-risk patients who may benefit from early palliative care consultations and advanced care planning discussions. Regular monitoring of ALP levels can serve as a valuable tool for evaluating treatment responses and guiding the timing of surgical interventions. Furthermore, ALP levels could facilitate more informed discussions about prognosis with patients and their families, helping guide decisions regarding the frequency of follow-up visits and surveillance imaging. From a resource allocation perspective, patients with elevated ALP levels may require more frequent monitoring and earlier referral to supportive care services. Incorporating ALP monitoring into existing prognostic scoring systems can enhance risk stratification and treatment planning. Based on these findings, we recommend that ALP levels be included in the routine assessment of patients with CRLM and considered for integration into existing prognostic scoring systems. However, prospective studies are needed to validate the efficacy of ALP as a prognostic marker and to explore its potential role in guiding treatment decisions. Future research should focus on developing standardised ALP-based risk assessment tools, investigating the optimal timing and frequency of ALP monitoring, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of ALP-guided treatment strategies and examining the impact of ALP-based clinical decision-making on patient outcomes.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral. ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; ARLD, alcohol-related liver disease; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; BMI, body mass index; FBC, full blood count; GGT, γ-glutamyltransferase; INR, international normalised ratio; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus; USS, ultrasound scan.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1156xFwp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115PkWRv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114k6r3r]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Figure 4 — Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under "Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases", proceed with "History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT"; if "GGT normal → evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies", but if "GGT abnormal → obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA". If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^112SbFyr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be seen in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. Cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase can be seen with various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. We discuss the initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### The role of the clinician in the multi-omics era: are you ready? [^117AncXX]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical caution in the -omics era

Ultimately, the optimal approach to an undiagnosed patient with a suspected IMD remains embedded in clinical expertise and the laboratory tests available in a given jurisdiction, however, we expect these broad assessment technologies will merge in the future as a single test for a patient with a suspected IMD. At the same time, proper interpretation of these big data will require functional assays, and the clinician must be cautious in assigning etiologic diagnoses based on -omics findings alone. Mitochondrial diseases deserve special mention. Although genome-wide sequencing has greatly advanced the diagnosis of this heterogeneous group of conditions, pitfalls remain, including the need to sequence both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (the latter extracted from affected tissue for highest levels of heteroplasmy), as well as mitochondrial 'phenocopies' and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction. One example is the identification of mt-ATP6 mutations as the cause of classic clinical and biochemical multiple carboxylase deficiency phenotypes, including characteristic C3 and C5OH elevations on NBS, some of whom respond to biotin (Balasubramaniam et al; Larson et al. 2018). Vice versa, examples of conditions with secondary OXPHOS dysfunction include recessive SCN3A mutations presenting with congenital hypotonia and respiratory complex defects (Koch et al), epileptic encephalopathy, elevated alkaline phosphatase, respiratory complex deficiency in PIGA deficiency (Tarailo-Graovac et al), and intellectual disability with hypotonia in TBCK deficiency (Bhoj et al).

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

How is PBC diagnosed?

Modes and routes of presentation

Increased awareness of the serological associations of PBC and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the community has led to an evolution of the mode of presentation of PBC in recent years, away from presentation with clinically overt disease (eg, advanced liver disease)towards presentation following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on screening(figure 1). Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to an increase in diagnosis following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy of UDCA treatment in slowing disease progression, it makes sense that early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is seen more commonly in those presenting with cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, occasional patients still present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver transplantation.

Figure 1
The BSG/UK-PBC consensus care pathway for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). While care needs always to be personalised to the patient, there are consensus pathways that are important for patients with PBC, which encompass the important 'pillars' of care that are believed to provide optimal management of disease and its complications.

Blood tests

The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and PBC-specific serological markers (> 95% for both sensitivity and specificity) means that blood tests lie at the heart of PBC diagnosis.

Liver biochemistry

PBC is characterised, in its early stages, by elevation in serum ALP and GGT. Multiple studies on the biochemical response to UDCA therapy demonstrate the value of ALP following therapy as a useful prognostic marker. It is unclear at present whether ALP values are markers of response to other emerging forms of therapy in PBC, but recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory review has suggested there is at least reasonable evidence to consider ALP as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy in PBC. Elevation in bilirubin and fall in serum albumin are features of advanced disease and are also important prognostic markers. Given the more diverse causes of elevations in GGT, to date the utility of GGT determination in patients with PBC has been to confirm a biliary origin of ALP, and not usually to reach a diagnosis or guide therapy. Further studies need to be performed before GGT can replace ALP with regard to diagnosis and treatment, although in the context of classical cholestasis a strong correlation between the two laboratory markers exists.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115fZ5hX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Confirmed alkaline phosphatase elevations — primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is described as "an uncommon chronic liver disease" that "is seen more commonly in women than men", with symptoms such as "fatigue and pruritus". Testing highlights cholestasis and characteristic serology: "Lab testing reveals biochemical evidence of cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevation of bilirubin), as well as the serologic hallmark for screening and diagnosis: immunoglobulin M and PBC-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in up to 95% of patients (64)". Histology is selective: "Liver biopsy is not routinely required although may be beneficial in patients with suspected anti-mitochondrial antibody-negative disease and to stage liver fibrosis".

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### Paget disease of bone for primary care [^115iC68h]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Paget disease of bone is a benign disorder characterized by focal areas of increased bone turnover in one or more skeletal sites. It usually affects older adults, and men are at a higher risk than women. Any bone may be affected, but the disease has a high preference for the pelvis, spine, skull, and long bones. Pain is the most common symptom, and presentation of the disease may depend on which bones are affected, the extent of involvement, and the presence of complications. Paget disease of bone may be asymptomatic, and suspicion arises from incidental findings of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels on routine blood work or abnormalities on imaging tests performed for an unrelated cause. Evidence-based guidelines recommend the use of plain radiography and serum alkaline phosphatase testing for initial diagnosis and radionuclide scans for delineation of the extent of disease. Treatment with nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates is recommended in active disease or when risk of complications is possible. Complications of the disease include arthritis, gait changes, hearing loss, nerve compression syndromes, and osteosarcoma. Total serum alkaline phosphatase is the suggested marker for assessing treatment response when high bone turnover occurs, and it should be measured at three to six months to evaluate initial response. Early diagnosis of Paget disease of bone remains key to its management because patients generally have a good prognosis if treatment is initiated before major complications arise. The primary care physician may need to consult with a specialist for confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of treatment.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^116sUSJP]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis considerations for hypophosphatasia — Diagnosis in patients of any age can be established based on characteristic signs, symptoms, and complications together with consistently low age- and sex-adjusted serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after excluding other causes of low ALP and skeletal diseases with similar presentations. Because the lower limit of normal for ALP varies by age and sex, measured activity must be compared with the lower limit and range appropriate for the patient. Physicians should be aware that many institutions do not routinely flag low ALP and may incorrectly apply adult ALP reference ranges to all ages, and the report emphasizes that age- and sex-adjusted ALP reference intervals are critical to an accurate diagnosis of HPP.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115xNaAK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115S355f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease — biochemical evaluation after imaging: We recommend that after radiological diagnosis of Paget's disease, the initial biochemical evaluation of a patient should be done using serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or with the use of a more specific marker of bone formation when appropriate. In patients with radiological evidence of Paget's disease, measurement of serum total ALP is the least expensive biochemical test to determine the metabolic activity of the disorder, and although this bone formation marker increases secondary to bone resorption, it correlates well with the extent of skeletal involvement when assessed from radiographs or scintigraphy and with the probability of achieving normal values with a potent bisphosphonate.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114i1ouT]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

### Global guidance for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of tumor-induced osteomalacia [^116ET9sF]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemical workup and features

The challenges associated with diagnostic testing have been recently reviewed by Brandi et al; for the purposes of this global guidance document, we will focus on the most salient points for clinicians to bear in mind. The first necessary step to diagnosis requires measuring serum phosphate in anyone being evaluated for musculoskeletal symptoms (Fig. 2). Serum phosphate should be measured on a morning, fasting blood specimen. Serum phosphate concentration is normally higher in young children and decreases with age; therefore, it is important to make sure that an age‐specific normal range is used. In adults, hypophosphatemia is defined as levels below 0.8 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). To establish chronic hypophosphatemia, there must be two values below the normal range on at least two occasions ≥ 2 weeks apart.

One study showed that, among 144 patients with TIO, 43.1% of cases with hypophosphatemia were not treated or misdiagnosed, and only 11.8% of patients seeking medical care for the first time were tested for serum phosphate.

Comprehensive laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count, fasting serum phosphate, serum creatinine, calcium, albumin, and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Additional variables, including PTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, and FGF23, should also be measured (Table 3, Fig. 2). It should be emphasized that not all assays are standardized, and not all labs use the same reference values, so care must be taken when interpreting results.

Measurement of 25(OH)D levels is necessary for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency, a common cause of hypophosphatemia and rickets/osteomalacia that must be differentiated from TIO. However, vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is frequent in the general population, and a low 25(OH)D level does not rule out the possibility of concurrent TIO. In fact, persistent hypophosphatemia after correction of vitamin D deficiency should prompt consideration that the patient may have TIO. Iron deficiency may indicate a need for potentially different patient management.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

After radiological diagnosis of Paget's disease, the initial biochemical evaluation should be done using serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or with the use of a more specific marker of bone formation when appropriate, and we recommend measuring a specific marker of bone formation or resorption in patients with Paget's disease and abnormal liver or biliary tract function to assess response to treatment or follow evolution of the disease in untreated patients.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^115PLRtA]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical characteristics

The biochemical hallmarks of XLH are hypophosphataemia due to renal phosphate wasting, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and elevated intact FGF23 levels. A positive family history of XLH, elevated ALP levels, decreased serum phosphate concentrations associated with renal phosphate wasting and/or the identification of a PHEX mutation can help to identify affected children within the first weeks of life. Of note, serum levels of phosphate might be in the normal range within the first 3–4 months of life. Renal phosphate wasting should be evaluated by calculating the tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR)(Table 1). In patients with insufficient phosphate intake, or impaired intestinal absorption (which might be suspected by low urinary levels of phosphate), TmP/GFR can be falsely low until serum levels of phosphate are restored to normal. Although, plasma levels of intact FGF23 are usually elevated, normal levels of FGF23 do not exclude XLH but should be interpreted as inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia. FGF23 levels are also influenced by other factors, in particular phosphate intake and vitamin D therapy. Therefore, FGF23 levels are most informative in untreated patients. FGF23 levels are elevated in several other forms of hypophosphataemic rickets (Table 2), and the normal range varies considerably according to the assay used. Serum concentrations of calcium are usually in the lower normal range, and urinary calcium is low owing to impaired 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D synthesis and consequently decreased intestinal calcium absorption. In contrast to calcipenic rickets, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are usually at the upper limit of the normal range or even slightly elevated. Circulating levels of 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D are low or inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia.

Liver blood tests

Liver blood tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), are frequently tested as part of routine clinical investigation in primary care. Whilst unexplained persistently abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated, normal liver blood tests do not exclude NAFLD or significant fibrosis. In a study of 223 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, ALT more than two times the upper limit of normal (> 70 IU/L) had a sensitivity of just 50% and specificity of 61% for NASH, and sensitivity 40% and specificity 58% for advanced fibrosis. Moreover, the serum ALT level typically falls as liver fibrosis progresses and patients with cirrhosis frequently have a normal range ALT level. Therefore, do not rely on abnormal liver blood tests to prompt consideration of liver disease. However, persistently unexplained abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated. (Recommendation 3, Table 1)

Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be evaluated in line with national recommendations, with a focussed history eliciting risk factors for chronic liver disease including unhealthy alcohol consumption, the presence of metabolic risk factors and a detailed drug history. Automated systems, such as intelligent liver function tests (iLFT), can streamline the investigation of abnormal liver blood tests giving a full panel of results, suggested diagnosis and advice for further management. This approach increases the diagnosis of liver disease and is highly cost effective.

### The impact of deep response to ursodeoxycholic acid in primary biliary cholangitis-should it be the new clinical standard? [^115S6beK]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review explores the emerging concept of "deep response" in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), defined by the normalization of biochemical markers, particularly alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. It examines its potential as a new standard for disease management and its implications for long-term patient outcomes, health policies, and clinical decision-making.

Recent Findings

Recent studies suggest that achieving a deep response significantly improves long-term outcomes in some patients with PBC. In particular, a significant complication-free survival gain was observed among patients who at baseline were at high risk for disease progression. However, limitations in data and the variability in patient populations pose challenges for universal adoption of this standard.

Summary

Deep biochemical response represents a promising new standard for optimizing PBC management, offering measurable goals for clinicians and potentially improved long-term outcomes for patients. However, further research is necessary to better define the appropriate biochemical thresholds, understand the risks of overprescribing, and identify patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit from this strategy. A balanced, patient-centered approach incorporating deep response into comprehensive management could improve care for high-risk PBC patients.

### How are abnormal results for liver function tests dealt with in primary care? Audit of yield and impact [^114FH32S]. BMJ (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether abnormal results for liver function tests are investigated in primary care and findings on full investigation.

Design

Retrospective audit and prospective clinical investigation.

Setting

University hospital and surrounding general practices serving around 330 000 people.

Subjects

Adults with abnormal results for liver function based on tests requested by their doctor between 1 January and 30 June 1995.

Interventions

All patients with gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or alkaline phosphatase concentrations at least twice the upper limit of the reference range were studied. A median of 15 months later (range 12–21) records of hospital attendances and further investigations were examined. Where investigations were incomplete the records from the general practice were examined, and suitable patients were invited to attend the liver clinic.

Main Outcome Measures

Investigations requested by the doctor and final diagnoses reached.

Results

933 patients with abnormal liver function tests were identified; follow up data were obtained in 873 (94%). 531 patients were already under hospital review. Of the remaining 342 patients, 157 were suitable for investigation; the others had died, moved away, were elderly, or had repeat liver function tests with normal results. No further tests were requested for 91 (58%) of these patients. 66 had been partially investigated by their doctor, and in seven patients results suggesting a treatable chronic liver disease had not been followed up. On investigation, 97 (62%) had an identifiable diagnosis requiring hospital intervention or follow up, or both.

Conclusions

Abnormal results for liver function are often not adequately investigated, missing an important chance of identifying treatable chronic liver disease.

Chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) evaluation in CKD stages 3–5D — KDIGO lists stage-based biochemical and skeletal assessments. For stage 3 (30–59), calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) 'Once (1C)a; then every 6–12 mo (NG)', parathyroid hormone (PTH) 'Once (1C)a; then based on level and CKD progression (NG)', and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] 'Once (2C); then based on level and treatments (2C)'. For stage 4 (15–29), Ca and P 'Every 3–6 mo (NG)', PTH 'Every 6–12 mo (NG)', and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 'Every 12 mod (NG)'; for stage 5 (< 15 or dialysis), Ca and P 'Every 1–3 mo (NG)', PTH 'Every 3–6 mo (NG)', and ALP 'Every 12 mod (NG)'. Bone-specific ALP 'Can be used to evaluate bone disease (2B)'; bone biopsy is listed 'In various settingsc and before treatment with bisphosphonates (NG)'; bone mineral density (BMD) has 'No routine testing in the presence of CKD-MBD (2B)'; and vascular calcification testing carries 'No recommendation for routine screening'. The table notes to 'Base the frequency of laboratory measurements on the presence and magnitude of abnormalities and rate of CKD progression. Increase frequency intervals as needed to monitor for trends, treatment efficacy, and side effects (NG)', and adds pediatric monitoring: 'In children, monitoring of Ca, P, and ALP levels is suggested beginning in CKD stage 2 (2D)'.

### Patient-derived reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase to support appropriate utility for isoenzymes determinations and hypophosphatasia [^1164DS7j]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Appropriate age- and sex-specific reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are essential to identify patients with hypophosphatasia (low ALP) and to avoid unnecessary ALP isoenzymes analysis (elevated ALP). This study used patient ALP historical data to statistically derive sex- and age-specific reference intervals.

Methods

The ALP values reported as part of clinical management during an 18 month period (from July 2021 to March 2023) were obtained. Following logarithmic transformation of ALP data and repeated removal of outliers, cumulative frequency plots were generated using a modified Hoffmann approach to derive age- and sex-specific reference intervals.

Results

Age-specific ALP reference intervals ranged from 110 to 250 and 120 to 295 U/L for males and females < 15 days old, 80 to 400 and 90 to 380 U/L for males and females 15 days to 1 year old, 105 to 280 and 90 to 290 U/L for males and females 1 to 10 years old, 75 to 300 and 90 to 300 U/L for males and females 10 to 13 years old, 80 to 300 and 60 to 175 U/L for males and females 13 to 15 years old, 55 to 150 and 60 to 180 U/L for males and females 15 to 18 years old, and 55 to 140 and 60 to 147 U/L for male and female adults, respectively (> 18 years old).

Conclusion

By applying derived ranges, a retrospective review of ALP isoenzymes would eliminate 24.5% of requests. Additionally, 9 neonates would have required investigation for possible hypophosphatasia.

### Application of the latest advances in evidence-based medicine in primary biliary cholangitis [^117MPwoL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

It is becoming increasingly clear that our goal in treating PBC is evolving to target greater reductions in ALP and bilirubin than what was recommended in the past. It is our opinion that the goal after adding a second-line therapy for PBC is to achieve the lowest ALP level possible. We recommend that ALP response to UDCA be assessed 6–12 months after UDCA initiation and that the second-line therapy be considered (see the following section, Up-to-date PBC algorithm). It is also important to apply proper medical judgment and consider other factors when adding a second-line therapy. For instance, exposing an older patient with stage I disease and an ALP of 150 U/L to a second or third drug knowing that it will not alter their clinical course but will lower their ALP would not be the best approach. Given the recent restriction established on the use of OCA in patients with advanced cirrhosis, it is also important to restage the liver disease and carefully evaluate for signs of portal hypertension before starting OCA. Finally, it seems likely that our treatment goals in PBC will evolve over time to achieve complete biochemical remission (normal or near-normal ALP and bilirubin levels).

### Transformative therapy in hypophosphatasia [^114sULVf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical findings of the most common manifestations are shown in figure 1; note that presentation can be multisystemic. Low ALP activity level is the hallmark of HPP and should be assessed when HPP is suspected. Measurement of ALP is easy to perform, readily available and can lead to rapid diagnosis. However, its interpretation requires some care. The normal range for ALP is age- and gender-specific, emphasising the need for appropriate laboratory reference ranges. Some laboratories only have one broad reference range for all ages; physicians should be wary because ALP levels that are normal for adults could represent pathological levels for children. Furthermore, there is often a focus upon elevated ALP for the diagnosis of rickets/osteomalacia, rather than low ALP levels.

Together with low ALP levels, typical radiological features of perinatal, infantile and childhood HPP can confirm the diagnosis. However, the radiological features in mild childhood, adult and odonto-HPP are not always diagnostic. Where the diagnosis is in doubt, confirmatory laboratory testing can include PLP, PPi or urinary phosphoethanolamine levels, which are usually above the reference range in patients with HPP, as well as ALPL mutational analyses.

The presence of any clinical findings shown in figure 1 with a combination of low ALP activity level should result in a working diagnosis of HPP until proven otherwise. Timely access to care and treatment options is dependent on the critical period between symptom onset and diagnosis. This is especially important for patients with perinatal and infantile HPP, where delays may have fatal consequences, or in older patients where treatment with bisphosphonates may worsen the bone phenotype. Improving awareness will increase the likelihood of a correct diagnosis and minimise the period between symptom onset and initiating the newly available, potentially life-saving therapy.

We hope that despite the inconvenience of frequent injections and the high cost of the treatment, this transformative therapy will be implemented for those in whom HPP is currently life-limiting.

### Ketamine hydrochloride (Ketalar) [^113rgeQH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Pediatric
Neurotoxicity

Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.

Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

5.6 Drug-Induced Liver Injury

Ketamine administration is associated with hepatobiliary dysfunction (most often a cholestatic pattern), with recurrent use (e.g., misuse/abuse or medically supervised unapproved indications). Biliary duct dilatation and/or biliary duct stricture and/or stenosis with or without evidence of biliary obstruction has also been reported with recurrent use. Obtain baseline LFTs, including alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase, in patients receiving ketamine as part of a treatment plan that utilizes recurrent dosing. Monitor those receiving recurrent ketamine at periodic intervals during treatment.

Reports of ketamine and the occurrence of sclerosing cholangitis have been received. Therefore, consider sclerosing cholangitis in patients with long term ketamine use and a cholestatic pattern of increased LFTs particularly grossly elevated gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase levels.

5.7 Increase in Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure

An increase in intracranial pressure has been reported following administration of ketamine hydrochloride. Patients with elevated intracranial pressure should be in a monitored setting with frequent neurologic assessments.

Transplant bone disease — vitamin D testing and bone mineral density (BMD) management: In patients with CKD stages 1–5T, we suggest that 25(OH)D (calcifediol) levels might be measured, and repeated testing determined by baseline values and interventions (2C), and we suggest that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency be corrected using treatment strategies recommended for the general population (2C). In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than approximately 30mL/min/1.73 m2, we suggest measuring BMD in the first 3 months after kidney transplant if they receive corticosteroids or have risk factors for osteoporosis as in the general population (2D). In patients in the first 12 months after kidney transplant with eGFR greater than approximately 30mL/min/1.73 m2 and low BMD, we suggest that treatment with vitamin D, calcitriol/alfacalcidol or bisphosphonates be considered (2D), and we suggest that treatment choices be influenced by the presence of CKD–MBD, as indicated by abnormal levels of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, alkaline phosphatases and 25(OH)D (2C).

CKD-MBD bone assessment and imaging in CKD stages 3–5D: KDIGO 2009 suggests that in patients with CKD stages 3–5D, measurements of serum PTH or bone-specific ALP can be used to evaluate bone disease because markedly high or low values predict underlying bone turnover, and states it is reasonable to perform bone biopsy in various settings and before therapy with bisphosphonates in patients with CKD-MBD. KDOQI 2003 noted bone-specific ALP not specifically recommended and that unexplained increases in bone ALP activity together with increases in PTH is indication for considering bone biopsy in CKD stage 5D; it also stated that bone biopsy should be considered in CKD stage 5D in various settings. For densitometry, KDIGO 2009 states that in CKD stages 3–5D with biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD, suggest that BMD testing not be routinely performed, whereas KDOQI 2003 stated DXA should be used in patients with fractures and those with known risks for osteoporosis. KDIGO also made no recommendation given for routine screening for vascular calcification.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^115AgRSj]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^1157JGuq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical follow-up

Serum level of ALP is a reliable biomarker of rickets activity and osteomalacia in children and adults. Given that bone-specific ALP represents ~80–90% of total ALP in the serum of children, total ALP might be used in this population. In adults, bone-specific ALP is preferred given that ~50% of circulating ALP originates from hepatocytes. When rachitic or osteomalacic bones are undertreated, ALP levels are elevated and urinary levels of calcium are usually low. By contrast, when rickets is healed, ALP levels tend to normalize and urinary calcium levels start to increase. PTH should be measured regularly as secondary hyperparathyroidism is promoted by oral phosphate supplementation. Suppressed PTH levels suggest that the dose of active vitamin D is disproportionately high compared with phosphate supplementation. Measurement of serum and urinary levels of calcium is required to evaluate the safety of active vitamin D. Spot urine samples are preferred as they are simple to perform, especially in young children. Alternatively, 24-hour urine collections can be performed in toilet-trained patients. We do not recommend regular measurement of serum levels of FGF23 in treated patients as it does not guide therapy.

In patients treated with burosumab, fasting serum phosphate level is a biomarker of efficacy and should be monitored to titrate the treatment in children and to exclude hyperphosphataemia. In some patients, burosumab might initially normalize TmP/GFR while serum level of phosphate is still below the normal range owing to the high demand for phosphate of the bone. In this setting, an increase in burosumab dose will not necessarily result in improved bone healing. Therefore, we suggest that TmP/GFR should be analysed together with fasting serum phosphate levels as a measure of drug efficacy. Serum levels of 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D might increase under burosumab therapy; we suggest measuring these levels every 6 months and analysing them together with the urinary calcium excretion as safety parameters.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease presenting with an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase [^111g4yEa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Goals

To define a subset of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with isolated elevations in alkaline phophatase.

Background

NAFLD is a common referral to Gastroenterologists and Hepatologists. We have noted a subset of patients with biopsy proven NAFLD who present with an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase instead of the more typical aminotransferase elevations.

Study

A review of the liver biopsy database at Brooke Army Medical Center was performed with the key identifiers of "steatosis" and "steatohepatitis". Patients were separated into 2 groups depending on whether they presented with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase (group 1), or more typical aminotransferase elevations (group 2). Multiple variables were analyzed to determine any significant differences between these groups.

Results

A total of 297 liver biopsies were evaluated. Of these, 135 biopsies were included in the study. Group 1 consisted of 14 patients and group 2 had 121 patients. Patients in group 1 were more likely to be older females (P < 0.05). Within group 1, those with steatohepatitis were older than those with steatosis (P < 0.05). When analyzed with regard to histopathology, patients with steatosis in group 1 were more likely female than group 2 patients (P = 0.03). Those with steatohepatitis in group 1 were older than group 2 patients (P = 0.001). Five of the 7 patients with steatohepatitis in group 1 had advanced liver disease at the time of biopsy.

Conclusions

Older female patients with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase and risk factors for NAFLD should be evaluated for evidence of significant steatohepatitis.

### Change in alkaline phosphatase activity associated with intensive care unit and hospital length of stay in patients with septic acute kidney injury on continuous renal replacement therapy [^114SEB7P]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

This is a retrospective observational study. We extracted data from all patients who underwent CRRT for septic AKI in ICU from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015, at the Asan medical center, a tertiary referral hospital. Septic AKI was defined as the simultaneous presence of the criteria for AKI and the consensus criteria for sepsis. We excluded patients with chronic dialysis, prior solid organ transplantation, stage IV malignancy, and patients younger than 18 years. Altogether, a total of 177 hospitalized patients were analyzed. Among those, AP activity was not available in 14 patients, because a blood sample was not drawn. Eight patients with sepsis of hepatobiliary origin were not included in the analysis to exclude direct liver injury as a mechanism of AP elevation. We measured AP activity when initiating CRRT and designated it as baseline value in our study. Follow-up AP activity on day 3 was not available in 32 patients who died within 3 days. Finally, the baseline AP activity of 155 patients and day 3 AP activity of 123 patients were analyzed.

Patients were followed up until hospital discharge for measurement of length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, and mortality. ICU discharge was planned when a patient's physiologic status was stabilized and the need for ICU monitoring and care was no longer necessary.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America ICU fever guidelines — abdominal ultrasound can potentially diagnose acalculous cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, liver or kidney abscesses, perforated bowel, ascites, and/or appendicitis as potential sources of fever, and in surgical patients can identify surgical wound abscesses and determine if they are amenable to drainage. Acalculous cholecystitis, an important but often unrecognized cause of fever in critically ill patients, may be suspected with right upper quadrant pain, although this is commonly absent; in patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, abdominal ultrasound may be helpful in diagnosing the cause of a febrile episode. However, a lack of data on false-positive and false-negative results in patients without abdominal signs or symptoms precludes a firm recommendation supporting routine diagnostic abdominal ultrasound.

### Normal alkaline phosphatase levels are dependent on race / ethnicity: nationalGEP health and nutrition examination survey data [^112DnEqh]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

We note with interest that all 97.5th percentile values in our sample exceeded the reference range reported in the manual for the analyzer used (91 IU/L). Because the demographic characteristics of the sample used to develop these ranges were not available, we are unable to speculate as to possible reasons for this discrepancy. Variation in laboratory analyzer output ranges has impeded the development of a widely accepted standard reference range for ALP; as a result, manufacturers recommend calibration of analyzer equipment at each site. Our findings underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate patient pool for this calibration, in order to generate normal ranges that reflect the sex and racial profile of the patients at each health system. Failure to reference appropriate normal values can impact care.

In particular, normal ALP (and multiples of the ULN) are frequently used in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment efficacy for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). White women are most commonly affected by PBC, and as a result, much of the literature reflects laboratory parameters derived from this cohort. Our data suggest that these values may not appropriately represent normal ranges in male patients and those from other racial groups, potentially impacting their care. Future prospective studies in large, racially diverse samples are needed to confirm our results.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112YHG7F]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee conclusions

The evidence suggests that liver laboratory abnormalities will be found in 12% of patients with sarcoidosis who undergo routine liver function testing, most of whom have hepatic granulomas. We did not identify a specific pattern of liver function abnormalities indicative of hepatic sarcoidosis, but some studies suggest that liver granulomas are more often associated with increases of alkaline phosphatase and less frequently with rises in transaminases.

The committee discussed reports that immune suppression and ursodeoxycholic acid reduce transaminitis and cholestasis in patients with related symptoms (pruritus), suggesting that treatment is effective in reducing disease activity in patients with symptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis. However, according to both the committee's clinical experience and the systematic review, it is uncertain whether these effects can be extrapolated to asymptomatic patients with hepatic sarcoidosis. The systematic review found no difference in resolution or improvement of abnormal liver function tests with treatment; however, it was not designed to estimate the effects of treatment of hepatic sarcoidosis, and, therefore, better evidence about treatment may exist. Treatment decisions should not be undertaken carelessly, because death due to cirrhosis or liver failure is uncommon, yet the risks of chronic treatment, especially immune suppression, are significant. The committee also noted that prednisone treatment may confound the assessment, as it can cause transaminitis. The committee agreed that the evidence is too scarce to conclude whether treatment affects progression to cirrhosis or reduces the need for liver transplantation.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that more than 1 out of every 10 patients with sarcoidosis who undergo liver function testing will be identified as having liver involvement, but the implication on treatment is unclear. The committee concluded that there is value in identifying patients with liver involvement at the time of initial diagnosis, and to screen for liver involvement annually even if the initial screen is negative (Table 5), if for no other reason than to avoid hepatotoxic treatments, and to follow such patients more carefully for the development of symptoms that warrant treatment.

Recommendations

1 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we suggest baseline serum alkaline phosphatase testing to screen for hepatic sarcoidosis (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
2 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we make no recommendation for or against baseline serum transaminase testing.

### High alkaline phosphatase levels in hemodialysis patients are associated with higher risk of hospitalization and death [^113rr9sD]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

We evaluated risks associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase in hemodialysis patients using longitudinal data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, a prospective observational study of hemodialysis patients in 12 countries. Alkaline phosphatase levels were normalized by the upper limit of the laboratory-reported reference range. Cause-specific hospitalization and mortality risks were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by region and adjusted for phosphorus, calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone, case mix, and numerous comorbidities. The odds of high normalized alkaline phosphatase were increased twofold in the United States in comparison to Japan. Elevations of normalized alkaline phosphatase were significantly associated with several comorbid conditions, increased fractures, parathyroidectomy, risk of hospitalization due to major adverse cardiac events, higher all-cause cardiovascular, and infection-related mortality risk. Our results also show that elevated serum normalized alkaline phosphatase was associated with higher risks of hospitalization and death in hemodialysis patients, independent of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels.

Osteosarcoma — prognostic serum markers and survival: Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are identified as prognostic indicators, with higher LDH at presentation in metastatic versus localized disease in a cohort of 1421 extremity cases (36.6% vs. 18.8%; P < .0001), and 5-year disease-free survival correlated with LDH (39.5% for high LDH vs 60% for normal). In a retrospective analysis of 789 extremity cases, ALP was a significant prognostic factor for event-free survival, with 5-year EFS 24% when serum ALP was more than four times the normal value and 46% when elevated below this limit (P < .001). However, in multivariate analyses, these markers did not retain prognostic significance when compared with tumor volume, age, and histologic response to chemotherapy.

Drug-Induced Liver Injury and Liver Failure

Inform patients that TRIKAFTA is associated with a serious risk for drug-induced liver injury and that liver injury resulting in liver failure leading to liver transplantation or death have occurred, including in patients without a history of liver disease.

Advise all patients that liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) should be assessed prior to initiating TRIKAFTA and then assessed every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, then at least annually thereafter. Inform patients with a history of liver disease or liver function test elevations at baseline that more frequent monitoring may be necessary. Instruct patients to interrupt treatment with TRIKAFTA if symptoms of liver injury occur (e.g., jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, ascites) and to notify their healthcare provider immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Prognostic value of serum alkaline phosphatase in spinal metastatic disease [^115KRU8T]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Spinal metastases are the most common type of bone metastasis and have a prevalence of 30–50% in cancer patients. – Spinal metastases lead to spinal instability, pathologic fractures, neurologic deficits, and decreased quality of life. Management of spinal metastases is primarily palliative and includes consideration of surgery, radiotherapy, medical management, and palliative therapy. Determination of the appropriateness of invasive management such as multi-level decompression and stabilisation requires accurate pre-operative estimation of survival. A number of prognostic factors have been identified in this population but routinely collected laboratory markers have yet to be fully understood or utilised. – Serum alkaline phosphatase is one such marker that is routinely collected in spinal metastatic disease patients but remains underutilised for prognostication.

Alkaline phosphatase has been well-established as a marker of hepatobiliary pathology and bone turnover and mineralisation. – This metalloenzyme is expressed on the cell surface of osteoblasts and serum levels of the enzyme correlate with increased osteoblastic activity. In osteolytic bone metastases this enzyme is elevated secondary to a local bone formation response in an attempt to compensate for the predominant destructive lesion. In osteoblastic bone metastases, alkaline phosphatase is elevated secondary to local stimulation of osteoblasts. In visceral metastasis, serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated secondary to intrahepatic biliary tract obstruction by hepatic metastatic tumour burden. On the basis of this known pathophysiology, we hypothesised that elevated serum alkaline phosphatase would be a marker for survival in spinal metastatic disease as an aggregate measure for metastatic tumour burden.

As such, the primary purpose of this study was to determine if serum alkaline phosphatase was an independent prognostic factor for survival in spinal metastatic disease. The secondary aim of this study was to characterise the relationship between serum alkaline phosphatase and metastatic tumour burden.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^115JK2Gk]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) treated with asfotase alfa — conclusions emphasize that a coordinated, multidisciplinary, team-based and patient-focused approach is needed for managing patients receiving asfotase alfa therapy, and that the consensus recommendations are based on expert opinion and are intended to serve as a basic framework for monitoring patients with HPP for whom the decision to treat has been made. Monitoring assessments must be tailored to the individual patient, depending on medical history, specific clinical manifestations, and the clinician's professional judgment, and the disclaimer adds that ultimately the treatment and monitoring of patients with hypophosphatasia should be tailored to the patient. Adherence to these recommendations is completely voluntary, and clinicians are reminded that the recommendations provided may evolve as more scientific information becomes available.

Regarding medical management for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, more specifically with respect to management of pancreatitis, ESGE 2020 guidelines recommend to consider testing serum amylase and/or lipase 2–6 hours after ERCP in patients with postprocedural abdominal pain planned to be discharged on the day of ERCP. Consider discharging patients with serum amylase and lipase values < 1.5 and 4 times the ULN, respectively, without concerns about the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis.

### Prognostic value of serum alkaline phosphatase in spinal metastatic disease [^115FNR5c]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Determination of the appropriateness of invasive management in patients with spinal metastatic disease requires accurate pre-operative estimation of survival. The purpose of this study was to examine serum alkaline phosphatase as a prognostic marker in spinal metastatic disease.

Methods

Chart reviews from two tertiary care centres were used to identify spinal metastatic disease patients. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine if serum alkaline phosphatase was an independent prognostic marker for survival.

Results

Overall, 732 patients were included with 90-day and 1-year survival of n = 539 (74.9%) and n = 324 (45.7%), respectively. The 1-year survival of patients in the first quartile of alkaline phosphatase (≤ 73IU/L) was 78 (57.8%) compared to 31 (24.0%) for patients in the fourth quartile (> 140IU/L). Preoperative serum alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly elevated in patients with multiple spine metastases, non-spine bone metastasis, and visceral metastasis but not in patients with brain metastasis. On multivariate analysis, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival in spinal metastatic disease.

Conclusion

Serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with preoperative metastatic tumour burden and is a biomarker for overall survival in spinal metastatic disease.

Alcoholic liver disease — Significant alcohol consumption has been suggested as ≥ 210 g of alcohol per week in men and ≥ 140 g per week in women, and patterns suggestive of alcoholic liver injury include an AST:ALT ratio of at least 2:1, with a higher ratio of AST:ALT exceeding 3:1 further increasing the likelihood of alcoholic liver disease; measurement of GGT may represent a complementary test but by itself is not helpful diagnostically, and alcohol consumption should be queried in all patients with abnormal liver chemistries with complete cessation recommended.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^112eit57]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Drug and supplement-induced liver injury — medications and supplements are emphasized as common sources: "Prescribed and over-the-counter medications, as well as non-prescribed complementary alternative medicines or dietary supplements, represent a common source for acute and chronic liver injury". Workup demands thorough review, since "Identification of an offending agent is challenging and requires a comprehensive query of the patient, his or her family, and careful review of available medical and pharmacy records and laboratory data (22)". Many drugs can raise enzymes: "Many medications are associated with at least a small risk of elevation of ALT/AST/alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin with or without hepatotoxicity", and for statins "there is an extensive literature on the safety in those with chronic liver disease with only rare cases of hepatotoxicity reported (60,61)". In suspected acetaminophen exposure, clarify use when enzymes are markedly elevated: "In those with high ALT levels (> 1,000IU/l) an accurate history of acetaminophen use either as a single medicine or in combination with analgesic-narcotic combinations is essential". Management often involves withdrawal and monitoring: "Attributing liver injury to a specific agent frequently requires empiric trials of drug discontinuation to observe full recovery of liver chemistries", with substitution or surveillance as needed. Clinicians should ask about supplements — "Specific query for non-prescribed supplements is essential to discovery of associated liver injury" — and be aware that "Common herbal supplements associated with hepatotoxicity include chaparral, ephedra, ji bu huan, germander, green tea extract, and shark cartilage (8,62)". A practical reference is provided: "A helpful resource that is available to clinicians trying to ascertain whether a drug or supplement may be hepatotoxic is the website livertox.nih.gov".

### Elevated liver enzymes: emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This has become more common with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

Objective

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

Discussion

The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

Conclusions

By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management and evaluation of the patient with elevated LFTs.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1139d42c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^115NBR2R]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare, inherited, systemic, metabolic disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations or a single dominant-negative mutation in the gene encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). The disease is associated with a broad range of signs, symptoms, and complications, including impaired skeletal mineralization, altered calcium and phosphate metabolism, recurrent fractures, pain, respiratory problems, impaired growth and mobility, premature tooth loss, developmental delay, and seizures. Asfotase alfa is a human, recombinant enzyme replacement therapy that is approved in many countries for the treatment of patients with HPP. To address the unmet need for guidance in the monitoring of patients receiving asfotase alfa, an international panel of physicians with experience in diagnosing and managing HPP convened in May 2016 to discuss treatment monitoring parameters. The panel discussions focused on recommendations for assessing and monitoring patients after the decision to treat with asfotase alfa had been made and did not include recommendations for whom to treat. Based on the consensus of panel members, this review provides guidance on the monitoring of patients with HPP during treatment with asfotase alfa, including recommendations for laboratory, efficacy, and safety assessments and the frequency with which these should be performed during the course of treatment. Recommended assessments are based on patient age and include regular monitoring of biochemistry, skeletal radiographs, respiratory function, growth, pain, mobility and motor function, and quality of life. Because of the systemic presentation of HPP, a coordinated, multidisciplinary, team-based, patient-focused approach is recommended in the management of patients receiving asfotase alfa. Monitoring of efficacy and safety outcomes must be tailored to the individual patient, depending on medical history, clinical manifestations, availability of resources in the clinical setting, and the clinician's professional judgment.

### Medical treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: what have we learned and where are we going? [^113FGaYR]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

THE PROS AND CONS OF ALP IN PSC

An elevated serum ALP level above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is part of the diagnostic criteria of PSC in adults in the EASL, but not in the AASLD clinical practice guidelines. According to the AASLD guidelines, the cholangiographic features of PSC, along with the exclusion of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, is sufficient for making a diagnosis, accounting for the fact that a significant proportion of individuals with PSC may have normal ALP levels. As PSC is increasingly diagnosed at earlier disease stages along with increased attention and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) availability and quality, omission of the elevated ALP criterion of the diagnosis, as now implemented in the AASLD guidelines, may be particularly relevant. High levels of ALP are associated with a more severe disease stratum, while normal levels are associated with a better prognosis. ALP is thus included in several prognostic models for PSC, including the Amsterdam-Oxford score, the UK-PSC score, and the PREsTO score. However, the intraindividual variability of ALP is considerable, and spontaneous normalization of ALP frequently occurs.,

Biology of ALP

ALPs are glycoproteins bound to the plasma membrane and are widely distributed in nature. In humans, zinc and magnesium serve as significant cofactors for their biological activity. ALPs exist in 4 different isoforms: intestinal ALP, placental ALP, germ cell ALP, and liver/bone/kidney (ie, tissue-nonspecific) ALP. Over 80% of the ALPs in serum originate from the liver and bone. Although ALPs are found in numerous tissues, their exact physiological function remains largely unknown. Elevated activity in the circulation is a marker for skeletal remodeling or hepatobiliary disease, but clinical variations in serum ALP levels also commonly occur in endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease, hematological diseases, malnutrition, and vitamin deficiencies. Genetic variation, for instance related to bile acid transport and glycobiology, associates with ALP levels in apparently healthy individuals. It is currently unknown to what extent ALP serves an integral part of cholestatic liver disease pathophysiology or merely represents a marker of biliary injury, altered bile composition, and cholestasis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

AASLD practice guidance — diagnostic entry criteria and initial steps for suspected drug-induced liver injury (DILI) include biochemical evidence of liver injury meeting one of these criteria: 1) AST or ALT > 5x ULN, or ALP > 2x ULN (or pretreatment baseline if abnormal) on 2 separate occasions, 2) Total serum bilirubin > 2.5mg/dL with elevated AST, ALT or ALP level, or 3) INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT or ALP. DILI suspected based on clinical history, symptoms, and/or physical exam: 1) Assess exposure to all prescription and over the counter medications, HDS products, and toxins, including start and stop dates, especially within the preceding 6 months; 2) Discontinue any non-essential medications and supplements. Determine R ratio R = ALT/ULN ALP/ULN and classify as R ≥ 5: Hepatocellular, R value 2–5: Mixed, or R ≤ 2: Cholestatic.

### How to use… alkaline phosphatase in neonatology [^116BVg9u]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is regularly measured in clinical practice. Changes in serum levels are observed in a number of clinical conditions. In neonatology, it has been proposed as a useful marker for both a diagnosis and an indication of the severity of metabolic bone disease (MBD) in infants born preterm. Nutritional practices, aimed at reducing the occurrence or severity of MBD, have led to ALP being proposed as a stand-alone means of monitoring treatment. The current evidence does not support this use: ALP only achieves usefulness in a diagnostic and monitoring capacity when combined with other serum and imaging techniques.

### Clinical significance of transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferase (TAEAT) in oncology [^111bQ9xb]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF TAEAT AND GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE

Although the clinical significance of symptomatic DILI cases or cases with multiple laboratory abnormalities is well established, there is no consensus on how to interpret and manage TAEAT. Several of the gaps in our current knowledge regarding various aspects of TAEAT, which may benefit from further research, are summarized below.

Should Risk:Benefit Assessment be Used to Determine TAEAT Management?

The determination of when to continue treatment and risk:benefit considerations for various types or stages of cancer are areas requiring further research. The interpretation and clinical significance of a single Hy law case or TAEAT in oncology trials can be especially challenging. Modification of Hy law criteria using fold elevations in liver chemistries in patients with baseline abnormalitieshave been proposed to improve the assessment of possible TAEAT in oncology trials. Although oncotherapeutic agents causing liver enzyme elevations may still gain FDA approval, specific guidelines are needed to differentiate between management approaches based on risk:benefit assessment for each patient, to identify when to monitor liver chemistries and continue treatment, or when to modify, withhold, or discontinue treatment.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^113Fmaxq]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Screening recommendations

S1. The CFF recommends that annual labs [total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), platelet count] should be performed at a time of clinical stability for identification of hepatobiliary involvement in all PwCF starting at CF diagnosis.

CFHBI can manifest in childhood, adolescence, and/or adulthood. Liver test abnormalities may precede imaging abnormalitiesand correlate with fibrosis. Early identification of CFHBI affects care through staging, regular monitoring, and treatment. Common liver test abnormalities in CF may include elevations in serum AST, ALT, GGT, and/or alkaline phosphatase. Elevated conjugated bilirubin may occur in aCFLD or with biliary obstruction. Portal hypertension may also cause an absolute or relative thrombocytopenia if baseline thrombocytosis is present. Prior guidelines recommended further action at 1.5–2x upper limit of normal values for increased specificity. However, this, coupled with the use of high thresholds, can contribute to delayed diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to use age and sex-normative values, and we recommend further evaluation if any abnormalities are persistent (> 3–6 mo). Few studies have evaluated the optimal timing and frequency of lab testing; however, the CFF recommends that these tests be performed on an annual basis beginning at CF diagnosis. Many PwCF have transient elevation of liver enzymes during systemic inflammation or antibiotic treatment; however, CFHBI is characterized by persistent liver test abnormalities, and annual screening should be performed during a time of relative clinical stability (eg, no active treatment for acute pulmonary exacerbation or infection). Calculation of liver fibrosis indices based on routine laboratory tests, including AST-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), fibrosis-4, and GGT-to-Platelet Ratio (GPR) can detect advanced fibrosis and portal hypertension and may be more specific than liver tests alone since they include platelet count. APRI is the most studied in CF and may be useful to identify aCFLD.– GPR may be particularly useful in detecting early biliary disease prior to significant hepatocyte injury. Optimal thresholds have not been broadly accepted in CF for any of the fibrosis indices, and therefore, the utility of these indices in screening PwCF for possible CFHBI or aCFLD is uncertain.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^111zVcPi]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) treated with asfotase alfa — consensus monitoring guidance explains that after the decision to treat with asfotase alfa, recommendations focus on assessing and monitoring patients and do not include whom to treat; guidance includes recommendations for laboratory, efficacy, and safety assessments and the frequency with which these should be performed during the course of treatment. Recommended assessments are based on patient age and include regular monitoring of biochemistry, skeletal radiographs, respiratory function, growth, pain, mobility and motor function, and quality of life. Because of the systemic presentation of HPP, a coordinated, multidisciplinary, team-based, patient-focused approach is recommended in the management of patients receiving asfotase alfa, and monitoring of efficacy and safety outcomes must be tailored to the individual patient depending on medical history, clinical manifestations, availability of resources in the clinical setting, and the clinician's professional judgment. As context, asfotase alfa is described as a human, recombinant enzyme replacement therapy that is approved in many countries for the treatment of patients with HPP.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112ynGmP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Research needs

The clinical presentation of renal sarcoidosis is often insidious, and renal damage is progressive without treatment. Elevated creatinine or available imaging technologies are not specific for renal sarcoidosis. Renal biopsy is often necessary to reliably establish the diagnosis of renal sarcoidosis, but carries risks of bleeding, pain, and, rarely, arteriovenous fistula formation. Future studies should consider convenient, noninvasive biomarkers of renal sarcoidosis; examples include evaluation of 24-hour urine parameters and research focused on prognosis, response to therapy, and mechanisms of fibrosis.

Question 5: Should Patients with Sarcoidosis Who Do Not Have Hepatic Symptoms Undergo Screening for Hepatic Sarcoidosis by Routine Transaminase and Alkaline Phosphatase Testing?

Rationale for question

The liver is commonly involved in sarcoidosis and is more common in African Americans than white individuals. Although liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension can result and require transplantation, the prevalence of these outcomes and the long-term consequences of hepatic sarcoidosis are not established, and the indications for treating hepatic sarcoidosis are unclear. Thus, the benefits of routine screening for hepatic sarcoidosis, based on liver function tests, is unknown. The committee asked if patients with sarcoidosis presenting with no liver manifestations should undergo routine baseline screening with liver function tests.

Summary of evidence

Our systematic review identified 575 potentially relevant articles; the full text of 15 was reviewed and 8 were selected to inform the guideline committee. None of the studies compared liver function testing to no testing; all were nonrandomized studies that reported the frequency of abnormal liver function and other outcomes (,–). Only one study explicitly stated that the patients had no hepatic symptoms; the others only implied that most patients had minimal to no hepatic symptoms. Meta-analysis of the selected studies found that liver function testing was abnormal in 12% (95% CI, 6–19%) of patients. Among those who underwent subsequent liver biopsy, granulomas were identified in 96% (95% CI, 88–99%). The committee's confidence in the generalizability of this result was limited by concern about selection bias due to nonconsecutive selection of patients for liver biopsy. The proportion of patients with abnormal liver function tests in whom systemic corticosteroids were initiated varied widely across studies, ranging from 25% to 95%.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eFu7U]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate and pancreas but not in bone; therefore it can be useful in confirming that an elevated ALP is of liver and not bony origin.GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^112NFjqp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Dosage is titrated based on laboratory testing, improvement in rickets and skeletal deformity on radiographs, and minimization of gastrointestinal and other side effects. Conventional therapy does not correct renal phosphate wasting, so, during treatment with calcitriol and phosphate, we do not target normal serum phosphorus due to safety concerns (nephrocalcinosis and hyperparathyroidism). Oral phosphate and calcitriol are administered multiple times a day due to short half-life and ongoing renal losses, limiting compliance.

Since the goal is for alkaline phosphatase and rickets to improve with treatment, it may be reasonable to increase doses of calcitriol or phosphate carefully to help reach this goal, unless the other safety laboratory assessments (normal to high serum phosphorus, high calcium, high PTH, or high urine calcium excretion) or other safety issues would prohibit that change. Recognize also that improvements in alkaline phosphatase takes time, and often alkaline phosphatase increases transiently on initiation of therapy for hypophosphatemic rickets or osteomalacia. Once stable dosing (of calcitriol and phosphate, or of burosumab) is established, monitoring is recommended about every 3 to 4 months for serum phosphorus, calcium, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as urine calcium and creatinine. Importantly if the fasting serum phosphorus is low on treatment, that is not itself an indication to adjust phosphate salts or calcitriol.

Treating non-FGF23–mediated hypophosphatemia is more complex; hypercalciuria is often present. HHRH is treated with phosphate salts as monotherapy because of inherently elevated 1,25(OH) 2 D and hypercalciuria. When treating HHRH with phosphate salts, high 1,25(OH) 2 D may persist, though hypercalciuria can improve, while phosphaturia persists and hyperparathyroidism remains a risk. Similarly, patients with renal tubulopathies are at risk for hypercalciuria, limiting treatment with active vitamin D and requiring careful monitoring for hypercalciuria and progressive kidney disease. Targeted therapy for cystinosis is available as cysteamine.

### The occurrence and burden of hypophosphatasia in an ambulatory care endocrinology practice [^115TCzat]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inherited disease resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the ALPL gene encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. The presentation and severity of the disease are highly variable, ranging from perinatal onset with high mortality rates to adult identification with low mortality rates and symptoms ranging from minimal to severe. Moderate forms of HPP typically manifest during middle age and are often undiagnosed. The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence and burden of HPP in an ambulatory care endocrinology practice.

Methods

Potential subjects were identified with a computerized text search of patient electronic medical records. Search terms included serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels of ≤ 40 U/L. Records of patients with at least 2 low ALP levels were reviewed manually to identify potential patients with a history consistent with hypophosphatasia.

Results

In total, 315 patients with ALP levels ≤ 40 U/L were identified from an estimated 20 000 patient records. Fifty-six patients with a single low level were excluded from further review. The remaining 259 patients were reviewed, 10 of whom had histories consistent with HPP. None of the identified 10 patients was currently being treated or had previously been treated for HPP. Information about these patients was shared with their respective providers, along with the recommendation to proceed with further evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of HPP.

Conclusion

Hypophosphatasia is an uncommon condition with variable presentation, often resulting in a missed diagnosis. Surveillance of practices by identifying patients with low ALP levels is a rational screening approach to identifying potential patients with HPP.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^111x58zo]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Variant presentations of PBC

The classical presentation of PBC is in a woman with the combination of cholestatic LFTs and positive AMA, with or without the systemic symptoms of PBC. Important variants are seen in the clinic:
AMA-negative (AMA −ve) PBC: Approximately 5% of patients with PBC are negative for AMA (or anti PDC-E2/M2 by ELISA), although this figure in practice reflects the assays employed. The majority of these patients will be positive for the PBC-specific nuclear antibodies. Such antibodies are equivalent to AMA in terms of diagnostic accuracy for PBC and AMA −ve, ANA +ve patients do not need biopsy for diagnostic confirmation. True autoantibody-negative PBC cannot be diagnosed without biopsy. In terms of management, AMA −ve disease should be treated in the same way as AMA +ve. There are data to suggest that ANA +ve patients progress more rapidly. At present this information does not influence therapy decisions, although this may change in the future with the development of stratified treatment models.
AMA +ve with normal LFTs: Up to 0.5% of the population in screening studies are found to be AMA +ve with, typically, 50% of those having normal liver biochemistry. Earlier studies suggested that over prolonged follow-up the majority of patients with AMA and normal LFTs seen in the formal clinical setting went on to develop typical PBC biochemical abnormality and symptoms, although the relevance of this to the broader AMA +ve population is unclear. Over 18 years of follow-up, however, none developed cirrhosis, needed transplant or died of PBC. Individuals found to be AMA +ve with normal LFTs should be screened every year for biochemical abnormality development and then treated as for classical PBC if such abnormality is seen. This follow-up can take place in primary care unless there are specific individual factors such as associated autoimmune disease warranting secondary care follow-up. With the background rate of AMA reactivity in blood donors reaching 1 in 200 in some studies, and the rising prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, it is also inevitable that AMA reactivity will be identified in patients clinically most likely to have metabolic liver disease. As noted already, such patients may need liver biopsy to identify the dominant liver injury, particularly as an elevation in ALP alone can also be found in patients with NAFLD.
PBC/AIH overlap syndromes: A small minority of patients with PBC can also have simultaneous AIH features. The management of this group is discussed in detail below.
AMA +ve AIH: A small minority of patients with AIH are AMA +ve, typically in the context of other AIH-characteristic autoantibodies. Such cases do not usually present a diagnostic challenge because of the presence of a biochemical pattern characteristic of AIH rather than PBC (ALT/AST and IgG elevation rather than ALP and IgM). AMA +ve AIH should be treated as for AMA −ve AIH.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of mineral and bone disorders, KDIGO 2017 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum PTH or bone-specific ALP for the evaluation of bone disease in patients with CKD stages 3–5D as markedly high or low values predict underlying bone turnover.

### Reevaluating goals of therapy in primary biliary cholangitis: is good enough is not good enough anymore? [^112XxVng]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune-mediated inflammatory cholestatic liver disease, which can progress to cirrhosis. This issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology features the results of the GLOBAL PBC Study Group evaluating patients with PBC over a 10-year period. Although biochemical response was evaluated in previous studies, this study showed that bilirubin levels ≤ 0.6 upper limit of normal or normal levels of alkaline phosphatase are associated with the lowest risk for liver transplantation or death in patients with PBC.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115caZG3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — biochemical markers for monitoring: We recommend measuring a specific marker of bone formation or resorption in patients with Paget's disease and abnormal liver or biliary tract function to assess response to treatment or follow evolution of the disease in untreated patients. (1|⊕⊕⊕○) Serum P1NP as a measure of bone formation is the best option, and if cost or availability prevent use of this option, then resorption markers such as serum βCTx or urine NTx provide accurate estimates of baseline bone metabolic activity and the response to treatment; total ALP overlaps with liver ALP with up to 20% cross-reactivity of antibodies to liver ALP with bone ALP, osteocalcin has been shown to be an insensitive marker for bone formation, and availability and cost vary considerably by region and by insurance coverage, so practitioners may need to verify whether a given test is covered by the patient's insurance.

### Evaluating elevated liver chemistry test results… [^112LzhZW]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The widespread frequency of serum blood chemistry analyses in medicine requires an appropriate guideline for evaluating abnormal test results. Guidelines have been developed by the Clinical Practice Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association to interpret results and follow patients with abnormal liver chemistry test results. Important factors in this evaluation include risk factors for liver disease, medications associated with liver chemistry abnormalities, comorbid conditions, alcohol consumption, and other evidence of liver disease. This information base may appropriately direct the examination toward establishing specific diagnoses. When no clues exist or a diagnosis cannot be confirmed, an algorithm for evaluation of liver test abnormalities can be useful. Elevated serum aminotransferase levels indicate the need to test for common hepatic diseases with noninvasive testing. If these results are negative, further testing should be based on the clinical situation.

Clinical follow-up and serial serum liver chemistry testing is important. If aminotransferase elevations are persistent or marked, or if there is evidence of liver disease, a more complete diagnostic effort is required, which may include radiologic testing and liver biopsy. Hyperbilirubinemia can be caused by hepatocellular, cholestatic, or metabolic diseases and requires further evaluation. Initial evaluation should identify whether hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia in an asymptomatic patient may indicate Gilbert's syndrome, hemolysis, or a medication adverse effect. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the presence of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level warrants evaluation for biliary obstruction with ultrasonography. An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level in the presence of normal aminotransferase levels warrants testing of γ-glutamyl-transferase or 5-nucleotidase testing.

If these results are negative, some other etiology should be sought for the elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level outside of the hepatobiliary tract. If these results are positive, further testing is necessary to look for biliary obstruction, medication adverse effects, or primary biliary cirrhosis. The authors conclude that mild liver abnormalities found in patients who appear to be healthy can be followed up closely if initial testing for common liver disease is negative. Further evaluation is essential in patients who have significant symptoms, chronic or serious liver disease, and marked laboratory abnormalities.

### Special considerations in interpreting liver function tests… [^114sDDx7]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

It is especially important to remember that in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, the serum AST level is almost never greater than 500 U per L and the serum ALT value is almost never greater than 300 U per L. The reasons for these limits on AST and ALT elevations are not well understood. In typical viral or toxic liver injury, the serum ALT level rises more than the AST value, reflecting the relative amounts of these enzymes in hepatocytes. However, in alcoholic hepatitis, the ratio of AST to ALT is greater than 1 in 90 percent of patients and is usually greater than 2. Diagnostic confusion can occur when a patient presents within a few hours after acute bile duct obstruction from a gallstone. In this situation, AST and ALT levels often reach 500 U per L or more in the first hours and then decline, whereas AP and GGT levels can take several days to rise. Both AP and GGT levels are elevated in about 90 percent of patients with cholestasis.

22, 23 If the origin of an elevated serum AP level is in doubt, the isoenzymes of AP can be separated by electrophoresis. However, this process is expensive and usually unnecessary because an elevated liver AP value is usually accompanied by an elevated GGT level, an elevated 5′-nucleotidase level and other LFT abnormalities. In one study, 24 isolated AP elevations were evaluated in an unselected group of patients at a Veterans Affairs hospital. Most mild AP elevations resolved within six months, and almost all greater elevations had an evident cause that was found on routine clinical evaluation. Persistently elevated liver AP values in asymptomatic patients, especially women, can be caused by primary biliary cirrhosis, which is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small bile ducts. Serum antimitochondrial antibody is positive in almost all of these patients. An elevated PT can result from a vitamin K deficiency.

This deficiency usually occurs in patients with chronic cholestasis or fat malabsorption from disease of the pancreas or small bowel. A trial of vitamin K injections is the most practical way to exclude vitamin K deficiency in such patients. The PT should improve within a few days.

### Clinical significance of serum alkaline phosphatase level in advanced pancreatic cancer… [^112MVKsR]. ASCO (2011). Low credibility.

Abstract 183 Background: Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that is elevated by various hepatobiliary diseases. Generally its elevation is thought to indicate bile stasis. There are some reports that show ALP is an important prognostic factor for several cancers such as colon, lung, and gastric cancer. Often it is speculated that ALP elevation indicates bile stasis caused by liver metastasis. However, the significance of ALP elevation in advanced pancreatic cancer patients is not well evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine the significance of elevated serum ALP as a prognostic factor in patients with APC even without jaundice and liver metastasis. Methods: Serum ALP levels were measured in 393 patients with APC receiving gemcitabine monotherapy before treatment, and according to those levels, patients were subgrouped, UNL-500 U/L, 501–700 U/L, 701–1000 U/L, 1000U/L < ALP).

The clinical data of each group were analyzed to see characteristics of elevated ALP patients. The relationship between ALP level and survival, response were also examined. Results: The elevated ALP group included poor performance status patients, and associated with low serum albumin. The elevated ALP group 112 days) showed significantly worse prognosis and lower disease control rate compared to the normal ALP group. Multivariate analysis revealed ALP, CRP, ascites, distant metastasis, white blood cell count, PS, AST, and ALT were independent prognostic factors. Similar results were seen in liver metastasis free patients without jaundice. Conclusions: Elevated serum ALP level correlated with poor performance status and low serum albumin.

ALP was also the independent prognostic factor in liver metastasis free APC patients without jaundice. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### Background… [^114qMUwo]. stacks.cdc.gov (2013). Low credibility.

Elevated total serum alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with mortality in the general population and in dialysis patients. Retrospective cohort study. 28, 678 patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4, similar results were noted. In a subgroup analysis that included patients who had serum phosphorus data, we found that while adjusting for serum phosphorus, each 1-standard deviation higher ALP was associated with a 10% increased hazard for mortality, and a non-significant 9% increased risk for ESRD.

In a diverse population with CKD stages 3 and 4, we noted a graded increase in the risk for the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and ESRD even after adjusting for relevant confounding variables. Similar results were obtained when the analysis was restricted to those who had ALP levels within the normal ranges highlighting that even high-normal values of ALP might be associated with risk for adverse outcomes. The ALP levels which portrayed an increased risk of death in both these studies were within the normal references ranges, similar to our study findings pointing out the importance of monitoring those with high-normal ALP values. Analysis from the Dialysis Outcomes & Practice Patterns Study showed a 25% increased risk of all-cause mortality and 38% increased risk of hospitalization in patients with mild to markedly elevated ALP compared to normal controls.
7.

In summary, elevated ALP levels are associated with an increased risk of ESRD and all cause mortality in patients with CKD stages 3–4. These findings, along with previous studies in this area, suggest that clinicians may use ALP as a risk assessment tool to identify patients with higher risk for mortality and/or ESRD progression. More studies are warranted to confirm the association of ALP with ESRD and illuminate the pathogenetic process.
