## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and work up a patient who presents with fever and diffuse body pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of fever plus generalized pain and how to frame the differential. Then, I should verify immediate red flags and stabilization priorities. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential by pathophysiology and outline a focused diagnostic strategy. After that, I need to check for pitfalls and special populations, and finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic management and follow-up plan with clear thresholds for escalation and de-escalation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of fever with diffuse body pain. This constellation is a high-acuity signal that mandates a broad but prioritized differential spanning infection, autoimmune and autoinflammatory disease, malignancy, and drug or toxin-related etiologies, because these categories account for the vast majority of serious causes of prolonged fever and systemic pain in adults [^117Nng2s] [^115ChBjx]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while fever and myalgia/arthralgia are common in COVID-19 and can raise pretest probability, individual symptoms have limited diagnostic accuracy, so I should avoid anchoring on a single diagnosis and instead use a syndromic approach guided by timing, pattern, and organ involvement [^1127gt6v] [^1158sVdE].

> I need to ensure I address immediate safety. Fever with diffuse pain can herald sepsis, so I should screen for SIRS/Sepsis-3 features and organ dysfunction, obtain vitals, and initiate sepsis protocols if indicated, because delays in antibiotics and hemodynamic support increase mortality [^115JM9Ce]. Wait, let me verify the thresholds: fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered mentation are red flags that warrant urgent evaluation and empiric therapy while cultures are pending, especially if there are risk factors or focal signs suggesting a source [^115JM9Ce].

> Next, I should review the history with a focus on chronology, exposures, and associated symptoms. I will ask about duration and pattern of fever, whether pain is myalgic versus arthralgic, morning stiffness, rash, mucosal or serosal involvement, weight loss, night sweats, travel, animal or dairy exposures, sexual history, medications, and immunocompromise, because these elements rapidly narrow the differential and guide testing [^117Nng2s] [^115ChBjx]. Hold on, I should verify that I also ask about COVID-19 contacts and vaccination status, given the frequency of myalgia and fever in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need to isolate if suspected [^1127gt6v].

> On examination, I will look for focal sources of infection, synovitis, dermatomyositis rashes, vasculitic lesions, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and neurologic deficits, because these findings pivot the workup toward infection, autoimmune disease, or malignancy. I should double-check for subtle signs like temporal artery tenderness, jaw claudication, or distal extremity swelling that suggest giant cell arteritis or autoinflammatory disease, respectively [^1163WPEd] [^116W1n6d]. But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised? In that case, I must maintain a lower threshold for invasive infections and atypical presentations, including opportunistic pathogens and spinal infections, which can present with nonspecific back pain and fever [^111DLBVh].

> I will now examine the differential by pathophysiology, starting with infectious etiologies. COVID-19 remains common and can present with fever and myalgia/arthralgia, often with respiratory or neurologic symptoms, so I should test early and isolate if suspected while assessing severity and oxygen needs [^1127gt6v] [^1167hMMi]. I should also consider sepsis from bacteremia, endocarditis, intra-abdominal or urinary sources, and spinal infections, especially if pain is focal or severe, because these are time-sensitive and may require empiric antibiotics and source control [^115JM9Ce] [^111DLBVh]. Let me reconsider tropical and travel-related diseases such as brucellosis, chikungunya, and rickettsial infections if epidemiology fits, as they frequently present with fever and arthralgia and have distinct clues on history and exam [^113QE2RB] [^116EiHu6].

> For autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, I should keep adult-onset Still's disease in mind when there are high-spiking fevers, evanescent rash, leukocytosis, and markedly elevated ferritin, especially with negative infectious and autoimmune serologies, because early recognition changes management toward IL-1 blockade and steroids [^116L3RVJ]. I need to check for ANCA-associated vasculitis if there is multiorgan involvement with upper airway, pulmonary, renal, or neurologic features, and for SLE when fever accompanies arthralgia, serositis, or cytopenias, remembering that fever is a weighted criterion in the EULAR/ACR classification and must be attributed carefully [^11573Apg] [^112Tx14X]. Polymyalgia rheumatica in patients over 50 with proximal girdle pain and elevated ESR/CRP, and VEXAS syndrome in older men with recurrent fevers, cytopenias, and skin disease, should be considered when infections are excluded and inflammation persists [^113SU3FH] [^115EYeK6].

> Malignancy remains a critical consideration, particularly lymphoma or other hematologic cancers, when fever and pain coexist with B symptoms, cytopenias, or organomegaly. I should confirm that I escalate to PET-CT and tissue diagnosis if labs and exam suggest this pathway, because delays worsen outcomes [^117Nng2s]. Hold on, I should verify that I also consider solid organ malignancies with paraneoplastic features or metastatic disease when the clinical picture fits, especially in older adults or those with risk factors [^115bNwDj].

> I should double-check for miscellaneous and drug-related causes. Medication-induced lupus or serum sickness-like reactions can present with fever and arthralgia, and I need to review all prescription, OTC, and herbal agents carefully. Autoinflammatory syndromes such as NLRP12-associated disease or Yao syndrome can mimic recurrent fever with myalgia and rash, and should be considered when infections are repeatedly negative and episodes recur [^114UY1Vi] [^116W1n6d]. Let me verify that I also keep metabolic or endocrine emergencies in mind if the vitals or labs suggest thyroid storm or adrenal crisis, though these are less common in this presentation.

> Next, I should review a focused diagnostic strategy. Core labs should include CBC, CMP, ESR/CRP, urinalysis, and cultures as indicated, because these provide nonspecific but essential clues and help track response. I need to ensure I add targeted testing based on pretest probability: COVID-19 PCR, blood cultures, rheumatologic serologies, HIV testing, and imaging of suspected involved organs, reserving CT or MRI for focal pain, suspected abscess, or deep infection, and PET-CT for occult malignancy or vasculitis when initial workup is unrevealing [^117Nng2s] [^115ChBjx]. Hold on, I should verify that I do not over-order low-yield tests; a clue-directed approach reduces cost and false positives while maintaining diagnostic yield [^115ChBjx].

> I will now examine pitfalls and special populations. In older adults, temporal arteritis and malignancy are more common, so I should maintain a low threshold for temporal artery biopsy and cancer screening when systemic inflammation and pain coexist with anemia or weight loss [^1163WPEd]. In immunocompromised hosts, I must broaden infectious differentials to include fungi, atypical bacteria, and viruses, and consider early invasive diagnostics if the patient deteriorates. In children, I should remember that musculoskeletal pain with fever mandates evaluation for malignancy and rheumatic disease, as benign etiologies are less likely when constitutional symptoms are present [^111DLBVh] [^112LhaiD]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked that COVID-19 can also present with isolated myalgia and fever, so I should still test and isolate when clinically indicated even without respiratory symptoms [^1127gt6v].

> For initial management, I need to ensure supportive care with antipyretics and analgesia while the workup proceeds, and initiate empiric therapy only when there is a credible threat such as sepsis, severe COVID-19, or GCA. I should confirm that I avoid starting immunosuppression before excluding infection, except in life-threatening autoimmune crises where the benefit outweighs the risk, and I should involve specialists early when the diagnosis remains unclear or the disease is organ-threatening [^115JM9Ce] [^1163WPEd]. Let me reconsider steroid use in suspected PMR or AOSD; a rapid, dramatic response to low-dose prednisone supports PMR, whereas AOSD often requires higher doses and IL-1 blockade, so I should align steroid dosing with the suspected entity and monitor closely [^113SU3FH] [^116L3RVJ].

> Follow-up should be iterative, with reassessment every 48–72 hours to incorporate new data and avoid premature closure. I should double-check that I document evolving problem representations and explicitly revisit the differential if new clues emerge, because up to half of FUO cases remain undiagnosed without a disciplined, clue-driven approach, and persistence or deterioration should trigger escalation to advanced imaging, tissue diagnosis, or subspecialty input [^117Nng2s] [^115ChBjx]. Hold on, I should verify that I also plan for longitudinal care in autoinflammatory or rheumatic diagnoses, as many require ongoing immunomodulation and monitoring for complications such as amyloidosis or cardiovascular disease [^115x7Zgc].

> In summary, fever with diffuse body pain is a high-acuity presentation that demands a structured, reference-aware approach: stabilize first, obtain a meticulous history and exam, pursue a prioritized differential across infection, autoimmunity, autoinflammation, and malignancy, and deploy a focused, stepwise diagnostic and therapeutic plan with built-in checkpoints for reassessment and escalation. I need to ensure I communicate uncertainty transparently with the patient while acting decisively on red flags to prevent delays in treating life-threatening conditions [^117Nng2s] [^115ChBjx].

Fever and body pain together signal a **systemic inflammatory process** [^116q9khA] and should prompt a **structured workup** to distinguish infection, autoimmune disease, and malignancy [^117Nng2s]. Infections are most common, but **autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases** (e.g. SLE, AOSD, vasculitis) [^112Tx14X] [^116L3RVJ] and malignancies (e.g. lymphoma) [^116qjTKf] must be considered, especially with persistent or recurrent symptoms. Initial evaluation should include a **focused history, exam, CBC, inflammatory markers, and targeted labs/imaging** based on clues; early recognition of red flags (weight loss, night sweats, organ dysfunction) guides urgency and scope of testing [^115ChBjx]. Management is cause-specific: antibiotics for infection, immunomodulation for autoimmune disease, and oncology referral for malignancy.

---

## Infectious etiologies

Infections are the **most common cause** of fever with body pain; consider:

- **Viral infections**: COVID-19 [^1127gt6v], influenza, EBV, CMV, and HIV commonly present with fever and myalgia/arthralgia [^notfound].
- **Bacterial infections**: Sepsis, endocarditis, TB, brucellosis [^113QE2RB], and rickettsial diseases can cause systemic symptoms with fever and pain [^notfound].
- **Fungal infections**: Histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and cryptococcosis can present with fever and diffuse pain, especially in immunocompromised hosts [^notfound].

---

## Autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases

Autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases often present with **fever and diffuse pain**:

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Noninfectious fever is a classification criterion [^112Tx14X]; arthralgia and myalgia are common [^112Tx14X].
- **Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD)**: High spiking fevers, arthralgia, and elevated ferritin are characteristic [^116L3RVJ].
- **Vasculitis**: ANCA-associated vasculitis [^11573Apg] and giant cell arteritis [^1163WPEd] present with constitutional symptoms, fever, and myalgia/arthralgia.
- **Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)**: Proximal muscle pain and stiffness with elevated ESR/CRP; fever may occur [^113SU3FH].

---

## Malignancies

Malignancies can present with **fever and diffuse pain**, particularly lymphoma, leukemia, and solid tumors with paraneoplastic syndromes [^notfound]. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) mandates evaluation for occult malignancy, especially with B symptoms (night sweats, weight loss) [^117Nng2s].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Evaluation** |
|-|-|
| History | - Onset <br/> - Duration <br/> - Pattern <br/> - Travel <br/> - Exposures <br/> - Comorbidities <br/> - Medications <br/> - Associated symptoms (rash, arthritis, organ-specific symptoms) [^115ChBjx] |
| Physical exam | - Vitals <br/> - Skin <br/> - Joints <br/> - Organomegaly <br/> - Lymphadenopathy <br/> - Neurologic deficits [^1131XZYQ] |
| Initial labs | - CBC <br/> - ESR/CRP <br/> - CMP <br/> - UA <br/> - Blood cultures <br/> - HIV <br/> - Autoimmune serology (ANA, RF, ANCA) <br/> - Viral testing (COVID-19, EBV, CMV) [^116WzKVD] |
| Imaging | - Chest X-ray <br/> - CT/MRI based on clinical suspicion (e.g. CT abdomen/pelvis for lymphoma, MRI for osteomyelitis) [^notfound] |
| Specialized tests | - Bone marrow biopsy <br/> - PET-CT <br/> - Genetic testing (e.g. autoinflammatory panels) as indicated [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Infections**: Empiric antibiotics for sepsis; targeted therapy for identified pathogens [^115JM9Ce].
- **Autoimmune/autoinflammatory**: Glucocorticoids, DMARDs, biologics (e.g. IL-1 blockade for AOSD) [^116L3RVJ].
- **Malignancy**: Oncology referral, chemotherapy, radiation, or surgical management [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic implications

Persistent fever with body pain carries significant morbidity and mortality, particularly when due to **sepsis**, **malignancy**, or **autoimmune disease**. Early recognition and targeted therapy improve outcomes [^115JM9Ce] [^117Nng2s].

---

Fever with body pain reflects a **systemic inflammatory process**; a **structured, clue-driven workup** is essential to distinguish infection, autoimmune disease, and malignancy, enabling timely, cause-specific therapy and improving outcomes [^117Nng2s].

### Systemic autoinflammatory disease in adults [^112BWr6h]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Systemic autoinflammatory disorders comprise an expanding group of rare conditions. They are mediated by dysfunction of the innate immune system and share a core of phenotypic manifestations including recurrent attacks of fever, cutaneous signs, chest or abdominal pain, lymphadenopathy, vasculopathy, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Diagnosis is often established in childhood, but a growing number of adult patients are being recognized with systemic autoinflammatory disorders, including adult-onset disease. In this review, we provide a concise update on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic approach of systemic autoinflammatory disorders with an emphasis on the adult patient population. Despite the recent advances in genetic testing, the diagnosis of autoinflammatory disease in adult patients is often based on a thorough knowledge of the clinical phenotype. Becoming acquainted with the clinical features of these rare disorders may assist in developing a high index of suspicion for autoinflammatory disease in patients presenting with unexplained episodes of fever or inflammation.

Discussion

Summary of main results

Individual signs and symptoms appear to have very poor diagnostic properties for COVID‐19, although this has to be interpreted in the presence of a limited number of studies, heterogeneity between the studies precluding any firm conclusions and in a context of selection bias. Most features had very low sensitivity, while specificity was moderate to high.

We have identified four possible red flags, that is, symptoms that increased the probability of COVID‐19 when present because of a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5 in at least one study: fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache. When we apply the results of sensitivity and specificity of these systemic features to disease probabilities, we assess their value to rule in and rule out disease as shown in the dumbbell plots (Figure 16). These clearly show the limited effect on disease probability from these signs and symptoms. Importantly, we did not find any studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of combinations of signs and symptoms. There were also no studies from community primary care settings.

### Recurrent febrile syndromes: what a rheumatologist needs to know [^115x7Zgc]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Rheumatologists are likely to be asked to evaluate patients with recurrent febrile syndromes, so it is important that they are familiar with the clinical and diagnostic features, pathophysiology and therapeutic options for these rare autoinflammatory disorders. These syndromes are all characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and systemic inflammation; however, some syndromes have unique historical and physical features that can help with making a diagnosis. The primary associated morbidity is systemic amyloidosis, usually with renal involvement. Diagnostic testing is mostly limited to genetic testing. NSAIDs, colchicine and corticosteroids have roles in the treatment of some of these disorders, but biologic drugs that target interleukin-1beta are emerging as consistently effective therapies.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^115ChBjx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

### A 47-year-old woman with left shoulder pain [^116EaSSY]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 47-year-old woman who presented with pain in the left shoulder, fevers, and fatigue. Through a structured clinical approach, including targeted history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges, and the differential diagnosis is refined. As the clinical course progresses, additional investigations provide key insights, leading to the final diagnosis.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) has fascinated and perplexed clinicians for over a century. No published guidelines exist on the approach to FUO, and studies have demonstrated that a diagnosis is never established in up to 30% of cases. A comprehensive history and physical examination are the keys to establishing a diagnosis in patient with FUO. This article provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis of FUO by delineating the most important elements of a comprehensive history and physical examination.

A young man presented with recurrent high-spiking fevers, diffuse arthralgia, hepatomegaly and a transient salmon-coloured rash. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis, markedly elevated inflammatory markers and extreme hyperferritinaemia. Extensive infectious and autoimmune workups were negative. The patient met Yamaguchi criteria for adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and responded well to corticosteroids and biologic therapy with canakinumab. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of AOSD and the importance of early consideration in patients with systemic inflammation and prolonged fever who have negative infectious and autoimmune testing.

### Fever of unknown origin: clinical overview of classic and current concepts [^111237hy]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to disorders that present with prolonged and perplexing fevers that are difficult to diagnose. This article presents a clinical overview of classic and current causes of FUOs, which may be due to infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. Comprehensive but nonfocused diagnostic testing is ineffective and should be avoided. The FUO workup should be directed by the key history, physical, and laboratory findings in clinical presentation. The clinical syndromic approach in the differential diagnosis of FUOs is emphasized, and the diagnostic importance and significance of fever patterns are discussed.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^114TeDKQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting LUQ pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration or congestion. Massive enlargement is usually caused by an infiltrative process and is not seen in gallstone-related illnesses.

There is discordance between the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly and the persistent LUQ pain. Plausible explanations include primary hepatic diseases with acute portal hypertension and splenic congestion; a left-sided intra-abdominal infection or malignancy (e.g. diverticulitis or colon cancer) spreading to the liver via the portal circulation; or a single malignant (e.g. lymphoma), infectious (e.g. endocarditis) or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis) process simultaneously affecting the liver and spleen (or another left-sided abdominal organ).

Joint Pain

Joint pain can have many causes. Differential diagnosis includes trauma (eg, sprain, tendinitis), infection, crystal-induced arthropathy (eg, gout), degenerative joint disease (eg, osteoarthritis), malignancy, rheumatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), and other conditions, such as Sjögren syndrome, scleroderma, and fibromyalgia. When assessing chronic joint pain, the physician should ask about the location(s), onset, and progression of the pain as well as the presence of systemic symptoms. In addition to the patient's medical history, a family history of joint disease and rheumatic conditions should be reviewed. Physical examination involves inspection, palpation, range of motion, and other specialized tests. The occurrence of nocturnal or unremitting pain, systemic symptoms such as fever/chills or weight loss, or significant disability should prompt an immediate workup and referral. During physical examination, warm skin, erythema, and joint swelling indicate a need for a more urgent workup and are suggestive of conditions such as infection and/or autoimmune disease. Radiography is suggested if the patient displays swelling or tenderness, inability to bear weight, gross deformity, and older age. Laboratory tests do not often play a key role in the diagnosis of joint pain. Blood tests such as ESR and CRP can be helpful to rule out an autoimmune disorder, but other laboratory tests such as rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, ANA, and other auto-antibodies are often best ordered only when there is a strong clinical suspicion of an autoimmune disorder. Elevated ESR and CRP are also often elevated in other conditions such as systemic infections or malignancy.

Hair Loss

Hair loss (alopecia) can be divided into cases in which the hair follicle is damaged and those in which the hair follicle is normal but hair growth cycle is abnormal. A thorough medical history includes details on hair loss (duration and pattern), presence of breakage or shedding at the roots, and increased or decreased shedding or thinning. Family history of alopecia, past and present medical conditions, diet, and current medications should also be reviewed. A thyroid function test should be performed, and patients should be referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation.

### ANCA associated vasculitis [^11573Apg]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

What symptoms do patients develop?

AAV may present with constitutional symptoms suggestive of chronic inflammatory disease (fatigue, weight loss, fever, night sweats, myalgia, or polyarthralgia) or with specific features of end-organ involvement. Almost any part of the body can be affected, but the most commonly affected systems are the upper airways, lungs, kidneys, eyes, and peripheral nerves. Therefore, presenting symptoms include sinus pain, nasal discharge, or crusting, ear pain, or deafness (from upper airways involvement), cough, shortness of breath, wheeze or haemoptysis (from lung involvement), and painful, red eyes (from scleritis). Some patients may have weakness, numbness, or difficulty walking, but many patients do not mention these symptoms, and signs of peripheral neuropathy — such as foot drop or wrist drop — should be specifically sought on examination. A classic "vasculitic" purpuric skin rash is present in a minority of patients. Common presenting symptoms are listed in box 1.

Box 1
When to consider ANCA associated vasculitis

Consider a diagnosis of AAV in the following clinical circumstances. Any of these features should prompt consideration of AAV; multiple features are strongly suggestive of AAV. Figures in parentheses are the approximate proportion of incident cases exhibiting each feature.

### Unexplained recurrent fever: when is autoinflammation the explanation? [^115cW19G]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrent fever can be the sole or leading manifestation of a variety of diseases including malignancies, autoimmune diseases and infections. Because the differential diagnoses are manifold, no formal guidelines for the approach of patients with recurrent fever exists. The newly recognized group of autoinflammatory diseases are often accompanied by repetitive fever attacks. As these episodes are frequently associated by a variety of divergent presentations, the differentiation of other causes for febrile illnesses can be difficult. In this article, we first review disease entities, which frequently present with the symptom of recurrent fever. In a next step, we summarize their characteristic pattern of disease presentation. Finally, we analyse key features of autoinflammatory diseases, which are helpful to distinguish this group of diseases from the other causes of recurrent fever. Recognizing these symptom patterns can provide the crucial clues and, thus, lead to the initiation of targeted specific diagnostic tests and therapies.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for rheumatic fever, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, AHA 2015 guidelines recommend to include polyarthralgia as a major manifestation only in moderate- or high-incidence populations and only after careful consideration and exclusion of other causes of arthralgia, such as autoimmune, viral, or reactive arthropathies.

### The pathophysiological basis and consequences of fever [^116q9khA]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Fever associated with inflammation

In critically ill patients, inflammation is commonly observed to aid repair after traumatic or infective insults. The four cardinal features of pain, heat, redness, and swelling were originally described by Celsus around 2000 years ago and, at about the same time, Hippocrates noted that the fever was of benefit. Fever is a ubiquitous component of inflammation across the animal kingdom, and enhances the host response. A large number of both the cell-derived and plasma-derived inflammatory mediators are pyrogenic; fever associated with inflammation is probably mediated in a similar way to sepsis as described above. Chronic inflammation is deleterious; the recently described compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) restores homeostasis, and it is likely that the magnitude and relative timings of the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses are both important in determining the host outcome.

Fever in patients with malignancy is reported to be sepsis related in around two thirds of cases. The tumour is the direct cause of fever in less than 10% of febrile episodes; tumour necrosis and production of pyrogenic cytokines is the likely pathogenesis.

Regulated autoimmunity is considered to be a natural physiological reaction; however, pathological autoimmunity occurs because of higher titres of more antigen-specific antibodies, often of the IgG isoform, and a reduction in self-tolerance. There are five pathogenic processes associated with autoimmune disease development, and in excess of 80 diseases have been described; fever is considered to be cytokine mediated in the majority of cases.

Autoinflammatory conditions differ from autoimmune diseases. In the former, the innate immune system directly causes inflammation without a significant T-cell response, whereas in the latter the innate immune system activates the adaptive immune system, which is in itself responsible for the inflammatory process. The former are also known as periodic fever syndromes, highlighting the intermittent febrile nature of these conditions. Examples include familial Mediterranean fever and some arthopathies, including adult-onset Still's disease. Most autoinflammatory conditions are genetic, and a large number are related to abnormalities in pro-inflammatory cytokine handling, for example IL-1 or interferon (IFN) signalling, or constitutive NF-kB activation, offering therapeutic targets.

### Anticipating the future: prognostic tools as a complementary strategy to improve care for patients with febrile illnesses in resource-limited settings [^117DizvS]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Globally, febrile illnesses are among the most common reasons to seek healthcare. While most can be managed at the community level, a small proportion (~1%–2%) progress to life-threatening disease. This burden is carried disproportionately by individuals in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where febrile illnesses remain a leading cause of morbidity.

Understanding the underlying causes of the main febrile syndromes is critical to successful treatment of febrile illnesses. Several recent initiatives have addressed this topic. Nevertheless, approaches that focus solely on diagnosis struggle to reconcile the fact that patients with the same infection or syndrome can have markedly different illness trajectories, perhaps reflecting differing host nutritional and other susceptibility states.

Most febrile patients in LMICs are managed by community health workers and healthcare providers working at primary or district level. These practitioners often have limited training and inadequate access to the necessary supervision and diagnostic testing to support their clinical decision-making. In such contexts, in addition to assessing the cause of a patient's illness, an equally pertinent question is: is my patient's condition likely to progress and require a higher level of care? A prognostic tool that could reliably risk stratify patients would have immense potential for benefit, through timely identification of patients at risk of deterioration and guiding appropriate use of scarce resources.

### Chronic musculoskeletal pain in children: part I. initial evaluation [^115XRVW3]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal pain can be difficult for children to characterize. Primary care physicians must determine whether the pain may be caused by a systemic disease. Change in activity, constitutional symptoms such as fevers and fatigue, or abnormal examination findings without obvious etiology should raise suspicion for rheumatic disease. A complete physical examination should be performed to look for extra-articular signs of rheumatic disease, focusing on but not limited to the affected areas. A logical and consistent approach to diagnosis is recommended, with judicious use of laboratory and radiologic testing. Complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement are useful if rheumatic disease is suspected. Other rheumatologic tests (e.g., antinuclear antibody) have a low pretest probability in the primary care setting and must be interpreted cautiously. Plain radiography can exclude fractures or malignancy; computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are more sensitive in detecting joint inflammation. Family physicians should refer children to a subspecialist when the diagnosis is in question or subspecialty treatment is required. Part II of this series discusses rheumatic diseases that present primarily with musculoskeletal pain in children, including juvenile arthritis, the spondyloarthropathies, acute rheumatic fever, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^116qjTKf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Reasoning

The problem representation is an abstract one-sentence summary that elaborates the key features of the case. It triggers plausible diagnostic hypotheses and directs exploration of further historical elements, physical examination features and diagnostic testing. In complex cases it is often necessary to consider more than one problem representation. Here the competing versions might be: (1) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with a subacute febrile illness and headaches associated with LUQ abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting; or (2) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with acute onset of sharp, unremitting LUQ pain, nausea and vomiting. Using the first problem representation, the clinician would likely consider serious intracranial infections and mass lesions. In the second problem representation, the LUQ pain is the focal point that directs further data gathering. It is often useful to explore competing problem representations to avoid "premature closure". Premature closure is the failure to consider other plausible diagnoses after an initial working diagnosis is reached. It is one of the most common clinical reasoning errors made by clinicians.

She had no significant past medical history. Her only medication was acetaminophen. Her family history was unremarkable. She was unemployed and denied current or prior alcohol, tobacco or drug use. She was born in Mexico and immigrated to the United States at age 23. She travels to Mexico regularly and had returned 3 weeks ago after a 2-month visit. Review of systems was notable for night sweats and a 20-pound intentional weight loss over the past several months.

Although the 20-pound weight loss is described as being intentional, the rarity of that achievement and associated night sweats suggest a systemic illness such as infection, autoimmune disease or malignancy. Her travel to Mexico places her at risk for tuberculosis (gastrointestinal and CNS manifestations) and amebiasis (colitis or liver abscess). Autoimmune syndromes with gastrointestinal manifestations include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polyarteritis nodosa and inflammatory bowel disease. Lymphoma would be the most likely malignancy given her age and constitutional symptoms.

### Pain symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a literature review [^111p4y9J]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

On 11 March, 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. It brought substantial physical and psychological burden on individuals and financial loss across countries. Patients with COVID-19 may exhibit various symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, chest pain, and abdominal pain, at 2–14 days after exposure to the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV-2). Pain symptoms present important challenge to clinicians' diagnosis when treating COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Considering the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the pain symptoms should be systematically summarized.

Results

The virus can invade different tissues of the body and cause different pain manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades the respiratory system, and patients develop sore throat, fever, cough, and other pneumonia-associated symptoms. Moreover, it infects the nervous system (eg, headache, dizziness, and confusion), digestive system (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea), and cardiovascular system (eg, chest pain, palmus, and cardiac injury). The incidence rate is 1.7–33.9% for headache, 0.7–47.1% for sore throat, 1.5–61.0% for myalgia/arthralgia, 1.6–17.7% for chest pain, and 1.9–14.5% for abdominal pain. In comparison with chest and abdominal pain, COVID-19 patients are more likely to develop headache, sore throat, and myalgia/arthralgia.

Conclusion

Different pain reflects the damage of different body systems. Therefore, the summary of pain symptoms for COVID-19 patients can help doctors improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis when treating COVID-19 patients with atypical or mild symptoms and adopt more targeted treatment methods.

### Knee pain in adults and adolescents: the initial evaluation [^1173sAtq]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Knee pain affects approximately 25% of adults, and its prevalence has increased almost 65% over the past 20 years, accounting for nearly 4 million primary care visits annually. Initial evaluation should emphasize excluding urgent causes while considering the need for referral. Key aspects of the patient history include age; location, onset, duration, and quality of pain; associated mechanical or systemic symptoms; history of swelling; description of precipitating trauma; and pertinent medical or surgical history. Patients requiring urgent referral generally have severe pain, swelling, and instability or inability to bear weight in association with acute trauma or have signs of joint infection such as fever, swelling, erythema, and limited range of motion. A systematic approach to examination of the knee includes inspection, palpation, evaluation of range of motion and strength, neurovascular testing, and special (provocative) tests. Radiographic imaging should be reserved for chronic knee pain (more than six weeks) or acute traumatic pain in patients who meet specific evidence-based criteria. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography allows for detailed evaluation of effusions, cysts (e.g. Baker cyst), and superficial structures. Magnetic resonance imaging is rarely used for patients with emergent cases and should generally be an option only when surgery is considered or when a patient experiences persistent pain despite adequate conservative treatment. When the initial history and physical examination suggest but do not confirm a specific diagnosis, laboratory tests can be used as a confirmatory or diagnostic tool.

### Increase in body temperature during migraine attacks [^111j1Py6]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intermittent fever has been occasionally related to migraine, either as a migraine equivalent or as a migraine accompaniment. We present a case of recurrent increase in body temperature consistently associated with migraine headaches.

Methods

A 15-year-old girl reported a 3-year lasting history of migraine without aura, with a feeling of warmth occurring in each episode. Ancillary tests did not show any evidence of secondary headaches or any systemic disease. A 2-month headache diary was obtained, with daily records of headache intensity (0, no headache; 1, mild pain; 2, moderate pain; 3, severe pain) and simultaneous measurements of axillary temperature. Both parameters were registered in the evening, at 6:00 pm every day. The distribution of headache intensity and body temperature as well as the relationship between both variables over time were analyzed with nonparametric tests.

Results

The number of days without pain was 28 (45.2%); a mild headache was present on 13 days (21%), a moderate headache on 15 days (24.2%), and a severe headache on 6 days (9.7%). Headache days were associated with higher body temperature than headache-free days (median values: 37.3°C vs 36.6°C; Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.001). Moreover, a positive correlation was found between headache intensity and body temperature (Spearman's rho coefficient: 0.83, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Recurrent increase in body temperature may be another manifestation of the complex clinical spectrum of migraine. This symptom is probably related to hypothalamic involvement.

### Fever of unknown origin: focused diagnostic approach based on clinical clues from the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests [^112W7EYY]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The causes of fevers of unknown origin (FUOs) are diverse and may be the result of infectious rheumatic or inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. This article reviews the focused diagnostic approach to FUOs, emphasizing relevant history, physical examination, and selected laboratory tests using a clinical syndrome approach. Laboratory tests should be guided by the most likely diagnoses based on the presenting clinical syndrome. Considered in concert, nonspecific laboratory tests may provide important diagnostic clues. Using a sequential diagnostic approach, a focused evaluation diagnoses all but the rarest or most obscure causes of FUO.

### Fabry disease pain: patient and preclinical parallels [^1111R85T]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

3.1.2. Pain experienced in Fabry disease

Patients with Fabry disease experience both evoked and spontaneous pain which can be chronic or episodic in nature(Fig. 2). These multiple pain phenotypes or syndromes manifest as sensitivity to thermal/mechanical stimuli, pain crises, pain after eating, and as ongoing chronic pain. Interindividual pain heterogeneity is high, with some patients experiencing no pain and others reporting debilitating pain requiring leave from work, school absence, and reduction in exercise. On average, patients score a 2 to 3/10 for pain on a visual analogue scale, and some patients describe intense pain episodes. Pain initiation is primarily associated with exercise, ambient temperature changes, and fever, although pain can also be reported to be triggered by stress and shifts in weather. By contrast, some patients have no discernible triggers for their pain. Pain is primarily reported in the glove and stocking regions of the body, and localized in the fingers, palms, and soles. However, high-intensity pain can encompass the legs, arms, abdomen, back, shoulders, joints, teeth, and head. In addition, many patients with Fabry disease experience severe gastrointestinal pain, both nonevoked chronic pain between meals and episodic pain after eating that is associated with diarrhea, bloating, and early satiety. Other pain experienced can include frequent headaches, priapism, and chest pain. The initial onset of pain is between the ages of 3 and 16 years, although pain can develop < 1 year of age or in adulthood. Therefore, there are both acute and chronic aspects of peripheral pain experienced by patients with Fabry disease that can be triggered by stimuli or occur spontaneously.

3.1.2.1. Neuropathic and inflammatory pain

Patients most often describe pain with neuropathic characteristics including burning, searing, squeezing, pressing, dragging, prickling, electrifying, tingling, sharp, and sore. These characteristics together with reduced nerve fiber densityand the effectiveness of neuropathic pain medicationstrongly suggest that pain is driven by neuropathy. Acute pain can be managed with a variety of anti-inflammatory medications, and anti-inflammatory treatment encompasses most medication used to treat the acute Fabry pain. Increases in proinflammatory cytokine mediators in the immune system including TNF-α, IL-1β, TLR4, and IL-6 suggest that inflammation potentially contributes to Fabry pain. Therefore, Fabry pain may encompass both neuropathic and inflammatory components.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^116ZT2Vj]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Clinical Aspects

CVID‐associated enteropathy is defined by chronic diarrhoea and malabsorptive symptoms in the absence of infectious, autoimmune, or gluten‐sensitive causes. Histological hallmarks include villous atrophy, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and duodenitis, with the definition increasingly incorporating clinical parameters such as unexplained weight loss and hypoalbuminemia. Overall, it remains a diagnosis of exclusion supported by characteristic but heterogeneous histopathological findings.

4.1 Disease Manifestation

4.1.1 Clinical Symptoms

After a short incubation period of 12–48 h, norovirus symptoms generally manifest as moderate gastrointestinal disturbances, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain, frequently accompanied by fever, chills, headache, general malaise, and myalgia. In healthy, immunocompetent individuals, norovirus symptoms typically resolve within 2–3 days; however, in immunocompromised patients or those with other underlying conditions, a severe and persistent sickness may ensue.

In CVID‐associated enteropathy, chronic watery diarrhoea represents the most frequent GI manifestation. Furthermore, reports indicate that up to 38% of patients experience dyspeptic symptoms and abdominal pain. Fever may occur in approximately 40% of cases as a systemic feature. Patients often exhibit a reduced body mass index (BMI), in some instances falling below 18 kg/m². Malabsorption is a common finding, frequently accompanied by nutritional deficiencies such as anaemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, and/or hypocalcemia.

Given the underlying immune dysregulation in CVID, a broad spectrum of concomitant autoimmune disorders may also occur, including autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopaenia, lymphocytic thyroiditis, primary biliary cholangitis, vitiligo, or psoriasis.

### Autoinflammatory syndromes [^114VqwvE]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Autoinflammatory syndromes comprise a diagnostically challenging group of systemic inflammatory disorders uniquely related by (1) dysregulation of innate immunity, (2) inflammasome activation, (3) dramatic clinical features (high fevers, neutrophilic rashes, and bone or synovial involvement), (4) impressive acute phase responses, and (5) effective treatment with cytokine inhibitors. This review details some of the more common autoinflammatory disorders, their distinguishing features and dermatologic manifestations, and how an accurate diagnosis can be established in patients presenting with periodic or intermittent febrile disorders.

### Rosai-dorfaman-destombes disease as a first manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus… [^115cUngk]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Rosai–Dorfman–Destombes is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis caused by activated histiocytes accumulated in body tissues. The most common presentation of RDD is massive cervical lymphadenopathy, and less common the presence of extranodal disease in the skin, sinuses or central nervous system. The lymph nodes were reportedly decreased in size from the initial presentation. Her complete blood cell count, liver and renal functions, electrolytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and uric acid were within normal limits as was a chest XR. Seven days later the swelling of her neck increased up to 14 cm in diameter and she developed fever and pain. C3 and C4 were low. Bacterial, Fungal and viral testing was negative. HLH screening, ALPS testing and immunoglobulins were normal.

In between biopsies her massive cervical lymphadenopathy spontaneously regressed but subsequently on day she developed generalized edema, hypertension, and elevated creatinine. An abdominal CT showed extensive lymphadenopathy below the diaphragm and splenomegaly. Since hypertension and acute renal failure persisted a kidney biopsy was performed showing diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis consistent with active lupus nephritis INS/RPS class IV. The patient received treatment with immunosuppressors. Discussion: The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy is broad and many of the hyper inflammatory syndromes such as ALPS, HLH, RDD are usually not considered in the etiology of lymphadenopathy in children and adolescents. RDD is a rare disorder that can occur in association with autoimmune diseases and as in this case could be the first manifestation of an autoimmune disorder.

In the presence of other associated symptoms, in this case RDD should be seen more as a manifestation of an underlying diagnosis either autoimmune or malignant unless a specific genetic predisposition is found to explain RDD. Conclusion: This case is unique in that it showcases the rare etiology of lymphadenopathy as well as a rare presentation of SLE. Recognizing this rare entity as a first manifestation of an autoimmune disease such as SLE should be considered.

- Clammy or sweaty skin
- Confusion or disorientation
- Extreme pain or discomfort
- Fever, shivering or feeling very cold
- High heart rate or weak pulse
- Shortness of breath.

At-risk populations Anyone can develop sepsis, but some people are at higher risk for sepsis. Keep ReadingPeople at Increased Risk for Sepsis Causes Infections put you and your family at risk for sepsis. When germs get into a person's body, they can cause an infection. If that infection doesn't stop, it can cause sepsis. Bacterial infections cause most cases of sepsis. Sepsis can also be a result of other infections, including viral infections, such as influenza. Fungal infections can also cause sepsis. Diagnosis Sepsis is diagnosed through a medical assessment performed by a healthcare provider. They diagnose sepsis using physical findings, such as:

- Fever
- Increased heart rate
- Low blood pressure
- Trouble breathing Healthcare providers also perform tests that check for signs of infection or organ damage. Some of these tests are used to identify the germ that caused the infection that led to sepsis.

This testing might include blood cultures looking for bacterial infections, fungal infections, or tests for viral infections, like influenza. Healthcare providers should immediately evaluate and treat people who might have sepsis. Treatment Research shows that rapid, effective sepsis treatment includes:

- Giving appropriate treatment, including antibiotics, as soon as possible
- Maintaining blood flow to organs Sometimes surgery is required to remove tissue damaged by the infection. Healthcare providers should treat sepsis as soon as possible.

### A fever of unknown origin workup in the emergency department reveals an unusual pathogen [^113Mu4ND]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

The cause of a fever of unknown origin (FUO, fever of > 21 days without an identified etiology) may be a common illness, an atypical presentation of a common illness, or an unusual illness. A patient with an FUO occasionally presents to the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis of an FUO is extensive. A primary goal for the ED physician is to determine if the patient with an FUO has a disorder that needs immediate recognition and treatment. We describe a case of a teenage boy who presented to our ED with 2 weeks of high fever and back pain. We describe this teenage boy with FUO and a surprising diagnosis.

### Consensus for prevention and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for neurologists [^1167hMMi]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics and manifestations

COVID-19 is highly contagious and has a long latency period. The incubation period is generally 3–14 days, but the most extended period was reported to be 24 days. Local news in Wuhan has reported a case of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection that had a 38-day incubation period. People who have visited the epidemic area or have a contact history with patients or suspected cases should consider self-quarantine and closely monitor body temperature and related symptoms.

Systemic and respiratory symptoms

Patients with COVID-19 often have a fever, dry cough and fatigue as the primary manifestations, and in some patients, pharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and conjunctivitis are common. Therefore, if a patient has any of these symptoms, even if the symptoms are mild, testing for COVID-19 is recommended.

Neurological symptoms and signs

Neurological symptoms have been observed in patients with COVID-19. It has been reported that more than one-third of patients experienced various neurological symptoms including the involvement of central nervous system (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment and neuralgia) and skeletal muscular damage. Skeletal muscle injury was defined when a patient had skeletal muscle pain and elevated serum creatine kinase level above 200 U/L. In patients with central nervous system manifestations, the most common complaints were dizziness and headache. In patients with peripheral nervous system manifestations, the most common complaints were taste and smell impairment.

The nervous system manifestations were significantly more common in patients with severe infection, manifested as ischaemic stroke and cerebral haemorrhage diagnosed by clinical symptoms and head CT, impaired consciousness and skeletal muscle injury. Rapid clinical deterioration or worsening could be from a neurological event such as stroke, which may have contributed to its high mortality rate. The main reason of clinical worsening is the hyperactivation of inflammatory factors that eventually causes a fatal inflammatory storm as the disease progresses. In addition, coagulation system is damaged causing the D-dimer and platelet abnormalities, which increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease. During the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with above neurological manifestations especially more develop nervous system manifestations, doctors should consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a differential diagnosis so to avoid misdiagnosis and seize the opportunity of stopping it from infecting the others.

### Insights into imaging of aortitis [^112C2Th8]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Aortitis is a subtype of the more general term "vasculitis", an inflammatory condition of infectious or noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall. The term "vasculitis" refers to a broad spectrum of diseases with different aetiologies, pathophysiologies, clinical presentations and prognoses. The clinical manifestations are nonspecific, as are the laboratory findings such as pain, fever, weight loss, vascular insufficiency and elevated levels of acute phase reactants, as well as other systemic manifestations, and sometimes may mimic other entities. Thus, if not suspected as part of the initial differential diagnosis, aortitis can be overlooked during the workup of patients with constitutional symptoms and systemic disorders. Methods: Imaging is rarely used for the primary diagnosis, but imaging findings, although nonspecific, can help in the assessment of these patients and is often required for making the final diagnosis. Imaging can be critical in the initiation of appropriate management and therapy. Results: Noninvasive cross-sectional imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced CT, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, nuclear medicine and in particular positron emission tomography (PET) are the leading modalities in modern diagnostic imaging of aortitis for both the initial diagnosis and follow-up. Conclusion: This review focusses on the most common manifestations of aortitis with which radiologists should be familiar.

Teaching Points

- Aortitis is an inflammatory condition of infectious/noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall.

- Imaging findings can help in the assessment of aortitis and are often crucial for the final diagnosis.

- Contrast-enhanced CT, MRI and PET-CT are used for both the initial diagnosis and follow-up of aortitis.

### Chronic pain and infection: mechanisms, causes, conditions, treatments, and controversies [^114i62iA]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Group A streptococcus

In acute rheumatic fever, oropharyngeal group A streptococcus infection triggers an autoimmune response resulting in inflammation and organ damage. Most patients who develop rheumatic fever are aged between 5 and 15 years, with Streptococcus pyogenes being the most implicated bacterial strain. In one large database study of 1470 children, 50% of rheumatic fever hospital admissions presented with primary arthritis without carditis, 26% presented with arthritis and carditis, 24% presented with chorea, and 6.5% showed both chorea and carditis. Recurrences are common in rheumatic fever, especially in younger individuals. Considered by many to be a prototypical autoimmune condition, rheumatic fever can manifest as a prolonged pain syndrome that includes reactive polyarthritis, skin involvement, carditis, vasculitis, and chorea, which might result in associated neurologic symptoms including pain. About 5% of patients with untreated, group A streptococcus pharyngitis develop rheumatic fever, with early antibiotic treatment reducing the risk substantially. Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended to prevent recurrences.

### COVID-pain: acute and late-onset painful clinical manifestations in COVID-19-molecular mechanisms and research perspectives [^112PgijA]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, clinicians and researchers realized that, although the respiratory manifestations were predominant, signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary involvement could enrich the clinical picture of the disease. Clinical experience and literature data have shown that all organs and systems can be involved, directly or indirectly (eg, through cytokine damage), during the course of the disease. The matter, however, is very complex and in addition to the extrapulmonary manifestations occurring during the acute phase, a broad spectrum of clinical conditions can represent sequelae of the disease. These consequences can last from weeks until months after recovery from acute illness.

In this scenario, painful manifestations are included among the extrapulmonary expression of COVID-19, and they can occur during the acute phase but also as short- or long-term complications. In the acute phase of COVID-19, pain can be present in different forms. One of the first reports found that muscle pain can affect 44% of patients. Later on, it was showed that myalgia/arthralgia, sore throat, abdominal pain, chest pain, and headache usually accompany respiratory symptoms, but they can also occur as isolated clinical findings. Moreover, severe myalgia was regardless of the severity of COVID-19.

Since the pandemic is ongoing, the chapter on post-COVID-19 complications has yet to be written. The term long COVID or post-COVID-19 syndrome refers to a range of new or ongoing symptoms experienced 4 weeks or later after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. In a recent meta-analysis, the authors demonstrated more than 50 long-term effects of COVID-19. Interestingly, in addition to respiratory, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric sequelae, chronic pain must be necessarily considered among disease sequelae. Carfì et al, for instance, showed that after hospital discharge 27.3% of post-COVID-19 individuals reported joint pain, and 21.7% chest pain. Again, it was highlighted that 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital, 10–20% of patients treated in the ward suffered from myalgia, although the percentage increased to up 30% in those who needed intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization. Chest pain and headache are other pain conditions observed in outpatients and inpatients until 35 days after the disease. These short- or long-term effects can combine with mood problems and fatigue, as well as other problems, affecting the quality of life of COVID-19-survivors.

Multifactorial autoinflammatory diseases

Beyond monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, there is a spectrum of disorders that unambiguously feature a deregulated activation of the myeloid compartment and autoinflammation, though lacking a specific driver mutation to their pathogenesis. They are considered complex autoinflammatory diseases, in which environmental stimuli in genetically predisposed individuals result in unchecked activation of the innate immune compartment. These diseases are typically diagnosed in adulthood and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adult patients with unexplained recurrent fever.

### Guidance for responding to a plague bioterrorism event… [^114HnpWG]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Pneumonic plague is the most likely clinical manifestation following an intentional release of Yersinia pestis.
- Public health responders should work with medical providers to isolate patients with suspected or confirmed plague, monitor patient outcomes, and report data to state public health authorities.
- Plague is a very serious illness but is treatable with commonly available antimicrobials. Healthcare personnel response activities During a plague emergency, your facility may be called upon to care for patients with the disease or suspected of having the disease.

Pneumonic plague is the most likely clinical manifestation following an intentional release of Y. pestis as a bioweapon.

In addition to the usual systemic plague manifestations of fever, chills, aches, and fatigue, patients with pneumonic plague may experience rapidly advancing shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough, and sometimes will have bloody or frothy sputum. Patients with pneumonic plague pose a risk for person-to-person transmission. Clinicians should be trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of plague. Ensure staff know your facility's plans for how to respond if plague is suspected; this includes notifying local and state health departments immediately and coordinating laboratory activities through the Laboratory Response Network. Confer with state health departments to determine the appropriate specimens for diagnostic testing. More information on infection control Read the full treatment recommendations for plague in MMWR. Plague is a very serious illness but is treatable with commonly available antimicrobials. Early treatment of plague is essential.

To reduce the chance of death, antimicrobials should be given within 24 hours of symptom onset. Recommended duration of treatment is 10 to 14 days. Treatment may extend beyond 14 days if a patient remains febrile or has other concerning symptoms. Y. pestis as a bioweapon. In addition to the usual systemic plague manifestations of fever and lethargy, animals with pneumonic plague may experience cough and sometimes bloody or frothy sputum. Characteristic symptoms of bubonic plague in animals include swollen, painful lymph nodes in addition to systemic manifestations such as fever and lethargy.

### Periodic fever syndromes: beyond the single gene paradigm [^117Wfqki]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of FMF

Recent work based on the Eurofever registry - a large international registry of autoinflammatory diseases - has proposed new provisional clinical classification criteria with high sensitivity and specificity based on a gold standard defined by the presence of two MEFV mutations. The criteria include fever episodes lasting less than two days, with accompanying symptoms of chest pain and/or abdominal pain together with Eastern or North Mediterranean ethnicity. Patients should not have aphthous stomatitis, urticarial rash, or enlarged cervical lymph nodes, and episodes may not last more than 6 days. While these criteria remain provisional, other published classification criteria (Table 1) have been developed based on expert opinion and description of clinical manifestations in populations of limited ethnic diversity; the overlap among clinical features has led to low performance when applied to patients with different autoinflammatory diseases.

Given that there are overlapping symptoms among FMF and a number of polygenic autoinflammatory diseases – including periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), and Behçet disease – it is often challenging to make a purely clinical diagnosis of FMF. This is particularly the case in regions such as North America where FMF is rare and may be milder or present atypically. Some patients may also be mistakenly diagnosed with autoinflammatory or autoimmune syndromes that have some overlapping clinical features, including Behcet disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatic fever.

Moreover, interpretation of genetic testing is challenging in patients with an FMF syndrome or a clear inflammatory phenotype but only one MEFV mutation of uncertain significance. Consensus guidelines suggest that while the diagnosis relies on clinical judgment, another periodic fever syndrome (PFS) should be considered in this case. Further studies are needed to validate data from combined molecular and clinical analysis in order to understand the effects of specific genetic variants. As emphasized by a recent systematic review, there is wide clinical variability among individuals with an FMF phenotype that is only partially explained by allelic heterogeneity.

The aim of this review is to describe the difficulties faced in clinical settings in making a diagnosis of FMF, or other genetically defined autoinflammatory diseases, in the face of patients with clinical disease and genetic mutations that are defined as 'uncertain'. The use of patient databases to advance understanding, particularly in genetically mixed populations, and the implications to treatment accessibility when diagnoses are undefined, are discussed.

While experiential learning is a desirable goal of residency education, little is known regarding the actual clinical experience of internal medicine residents during their training.

Methods

We modified an electronic patient handoff tool to include a system for resident entry of a primary diagnosis for each of their patients. Using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) system, we created two methods to select the code: 1) an organ system-based dropdown list containing frequently used codes; and 2) a search option for the complete ICD-9 database. The codes were then grouped using ICD-9 categorization.

Results

A total of 7562 resident-patient diagnostic encounters were studied. A wide spectrum of clinical conditions was observed, with symptoms and ill-defined conditions, circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders, neoplasms, genitourinary disorders, digestive disorders, diseases of the blood/blood forming organs, endocrinologic/nutritional/metabolic/immune disorders, and disorders of the skin and subcutaneous tissue accounting for about 86% of resident clinical experience. Symptoms and ill-defined conditions were noted to represent a sizable portion of resident clinical experience. Within this category, the most common conditions were fever; abdominal pain; and chest pain, unspecified.

Conclusions

Analysis of resident-selected ICD-9 codes might serve as a method to attempt to define resident clinical experience, and may be useful in the development of innovative experiential learning-based residency curricula. This might also be used to assess gaps in experiential learning at the program or resident level, and may serve to identify topics that require additional teaching supplementation.

### Pain symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a literature review [^111G8sbA]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

On 11 March 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The WHO reported that the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased sharply to 79,231,893 (1,754,574 deaths, 2.21% fatality ratio) in 219 countries/territories/areas as of December 29, 2020. The fatality ratio in France, Italy, and United Kingdom reached 2.48% (62,197 deaths, 2,507,532 confirmed cases), 3.52% (71,620 deaths, 2,038,759 confirmed cases), and 3.12% (70,405 deaths, 2,256,009 confirmed cases), respectively. The spread of COVID-19 is becoming unstoppable across the world, and the global pandemic brought substantial physical and psychological burden on individuals and financial loss across countries.

Patients with COVID-19 exhibit various symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, chest pain, and abdominal pain, at 2–14 days after exposure to the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV-2). Huang et alfirst reported the clinical symptoms at the onset of illness in patients with COVID-19, in which fever was the most common symptom (98%), followed by cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), muscle pain or fatigue (44%), sputum production (28%), headache (8%), haemoptysis (5%), and diarrhoea (3%). Guan et alfound that the common pain symptoms include myalgia or arthralgia (14.9%), sore throat (13.9%), and headache (13.6%). Apart from respiratory symptoms, pain symptoms, such as headache, sore throat, myalgia or arthralgia, chest pain, and abdominal pain are common in patients with COVID-19. Similarly, patients with SARS also reported pain symptoms.such as myalgia (49.3–60.9%), headache (35.4–55.8%), sore throat (12.5–23.2%), chest pain (10.4%), and abdominal pain (3.5%).

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) – A call for new research standards and updated clinical management [^115QePFm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Prolonged fever of 38.3°C or higher for at least 3 weeks' duration has been termed fever of unknown origin if unexplained after preliminary investigations. Initially codified in 1961, classification with subgroups was revised in 1991. Additional changes to the definition were proposed in 1997, recommending a set of standardized initial investigations. Advances in diagnosis and management and diagnostic testing over the last 3 decades have prompted a needed update to the definition and approaches. While a 3-week fever duration remains part of the criteria, a lower temperature threshold of 38°C and revised minimum testing criteria will assist clinicians and their patients, setting a solid foundation for future research.

### Classifying and diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century [^112Tx14X]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Constitutional symptoms in SLE

Non-infectious fever is the one criterion that is entirely new in the EULAR/ACR 2019 classification criteria, carrying a weight of 2, but helping with early classification. Fever came not from the expert Delphi exercise, but was a common and specific marker of SLE in the international early SLE cohort, where 35% of the SLE patients vs 14% of those with mimicking conditions had fever and 28% vs 8% had fever without increased CRP. Similarly, in the SLE patient questionnaire, 54% of the patients reported fever before or at their SLE diagnosis. For fever, adhering to the attribution rule of not counting a criterion better explained by another cause is of obvious importance. Fever with elevated CRP is particularly likely to be due to bacterial infection.

As an immune complex disease, other features of SLE likewise are similar to viral infections. Classic features of early viral disease, namely arthralgias, myalgias and fatigue, are often pronounced and of persistence in SLE. However, arthralgias (in the absence of arthritis) and fatigue were actually more common in mimicking conditions than in SLE patients, and the same probably would be true for myalgias as well. This is important information when considering these symptoms for SLE diagnosis. One other relatively common constitutional symptom is lymphadenopathy, which often necessitates lymph node biopsy to rule out lymphoma.

Adaptive immune system

In addition to releasing large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cells, the adaptive immune system generates virus‐specific CD4 + T‐cells, CD8 + T‐cells, and Bcells, which are crucial for mounting an effective immune response. However, the adaptive immune response can become dysregulated, leading to organ and tissue damage. This immune imbalance may be a significant factor contributing to life‐threatening conditions in COVID‐19 patients and persistent adaptive immune dysregulation is suspected to play a crucial role in PCC. Patients experiencing PCC often exhibit alterations in both cellular and humoral immune mediators, particularly in T‐cell populations. These changes may contribute to ongoing immunopathology, potentially explaining long‐term symptoms such as chronic fever and muscle and joint pain. For instance, specific T‐cell subsets, including CD8 + ‐T‐cells, may remain activated long after the initial infection. This persistent activation might result from virus‐specific responses to residual viral antigens or from polyclonal/bystander activation driven by the chronic inflammatory environment. While virus‐specific activation suggests the presence of lingering viral proteins or RNA fragments, polyclonal or bystander activation could reflect dysregulated immune signalling or the influence of elevated proinflammatory cytokines. Both mechanisms are hypothesised to contribute to the chronic inflammation and tissue damage observed in PCC. Additionally, CD4 + effector memory T‐cells may be involved in sustaining this inflammatory environment by continuously providing help to B cells and other immune cells.

The adaptive immune system's dysregulation in PCC is also reflected in altered cytokine and chemokine production. For instance, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines like IL‐6, TNFα, and IFNα were observed in the plasma of PCC patients, which may contribute to the chronic inflammatory state and contribute to the ongoing symptoms of PCC, including fatigue and respiratory difficulties. The dysregulation of memory T and B cells in PCC may also contribute to persistent symptoms. Effector memory T‐cells are crucial for providing long‐term protection against pathogens, but in PCC these cells may become dysfunctional due to prolonged antigen stimulation or chronic exposure to proinflammatory cytokines, leading to a state of exhaustion. This dysfunction may impair their ability to respond effectively to new infections or reactivations of latent viruses. Similarly, memory B cells may contribute to the production of autoantibodies through mechanisms such as molecular mimicry or cross‐reactivity, where antibodies generated against SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens inadvertently recognise self‐antigens. This aberrant antibody response can further contribute to the pathology of PCC by promoting autoimmune reactions and tissue damage.

### Pain symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a literature review [^112yudcr]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the virus not only invades the respiratory system and cause fever, cough, sore throat, and other pneumonia-associated symptoms, but also infects other systems in humans and results in corresponding symptoms, including nervous system (eg, headache, dizziness, and confusion), digestive system (eg, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite), and cardiovascular system (eg, palmus, chest pain, and cardiac injury). Chest pain, myalgia, and abdominal pain are likely to occur in patients with severe infections, foreshadowing a wider range of virus invasion. These conditions may be risk factors for developing severe or critical COVID-19. Sore throat is more common in mild patients than in severe patients. It may be attributed to the invasion of the virus is limited to respiratory system in mild patients, and other systems are not damaged. Moreover, the spread of the virus through feces also suggests that need for more effective protective measures to prevent further spread of COVID-19 and control infection. The incidence rate is 1.7–33.9% for headache, 0.7–47.1% for sore throat, 1.5–61.0% for myalgia/arthralgia, 1.6–17.7% for chest pain, and 1.9–14.5% for abdominal pain. Different pain reflects the damage of different body systems. However, pain in patients with COVID-19 may also be caused by treatment-related persistent pain and discomfort, intermittent procedural pain, and chronic pain before admission to the intensive care unit. So, it is particularly important to determine the source of pain in the long and complicated treatment process. Although these pain symptoms are not as typical as fever and cough, doctors should not ignore them to avoid misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. They are also the signal that could alert doctors to pay attention to strengthen self-protection to reduce infection risks. The symptoms can also provide basis for doctors to take more targeted measures, treat and cure patients reasonably. In addition, once the general population has these symptoms, they should also consider that they are potential patients with COVID-19, should isolate themselves and seek medical attention as soon as possible.

### Overview of fever of unknown origin in adult and paediatric patients [^112ZBvwo]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) can be caused by a wide group of diseases, and can include both benign and serious conditions. Since the first definition of FUO in the early 1960's, several updates to the definition, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have been proposed. This review outlines a case report of an elderly Italian male patient with high fever and migrating arthralgia who underwent many procedures and treatments before a final diagnosis of Adult-onset Still's disease was achieved. This case report highlights the difficulties in diagnosing certain causes of FUO that requires a very high index of suspicion. The main causes of FUO in paediatric and adult patients will be reviewed here, underlying the fact that a physician should also consider the possibility that a patient with FUO may have a monogenic autoinflammatory disease (AID). The identification of AIDs requires a careful evaluation of both history and clinical details that may reveal important clues to identify the correct aetiology. We also provide a comprehensive account of specific signs and symptoms that could suggest possible diagnoses and guide the work-up of FUO and non-genetic periodic fevers in children.

### Case report: COVID-19 masquerading as an acute surgical abdomen [^114RrKVi]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19 typically not only affects the respiratory system but can also affect other body organs. The manifestations differ according to the system predominantly affected. A meta-analysis including data of around 2,000 patients revealed that fever (89%), cough (69%), and muscle aches with fatigue (36%) are the most prevalent symptoms, whereas nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were less common (4–5%). This analysis did not specify the prevalence of abdominal pain, but that can be ascertained from another review exploring the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations, depicting a 2–6% prevalence of abdominal pain among patients with COVID-19. Nonetheless, acute abdominal pain is uncommon. We share our experience with three cases presenting with acute abdominal pain necessitating, abdominal imaging, and surgical evaluation.

### NLRP12-associated systemic autoinflammatory diseases in children [^114UY1Vi]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of NLRP12-AID

The most important clinical symptom of NLRP12-AID is noninfectious recurrent fever. Fever may exhibit a certain pattern, lasting 2–10 days each time, and has self-limiting characteristics with no special manifestations during onset. Torreggiani et al. defined periodic or recurrent fever as 3 or more unexplainable fever episodes within 6 months, with an interval of at least 7 days between 2 fever episodes. Statler et al. reported that unexplainable fevers accounted for as many as 69% of fever cases in children, complicating determination of the cause of fever, especially recurrent fever. After excluding infectious and neoplastic factors, autoinflammatory diseases caused by immune system disorders should be considered. The onset of most NLRP12-AID symptoms is related to cold stimulation. Due to its dominant genetic background, a positive family history is critical information for diagnosing NLRP12-AID, but some family members who carry mutated genes have no obvious clinical symptoms due to environmental factors or new mutations. For most SAIDs, the initial onset occurs during childhood, even before the age of 10 years; therefore, the age at initial onset should be traced for patients with a delayed diagnosis. Due to multisystem inflammatory responses, accompanying symptoms of NLRP12-AID can include polyarthralgia/arthritis, abdominal pain/diarrhea, lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly, headache, neurosensory deafness, aphthous stomatitis and so on. Rashes (urticaria, erythema and papules) related to fever and systemic inflammatory responses are also characteristic manifestations, that are significantly associated with cold stimulation, with pigmentation loss after the rashes subside. Generally, the interval between onset is not completely fixed, but the intermittent normalized clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators can distinguish SAIDs from other chronic diseases. The response of SAIDs to antibiotics and immunosuppressive therapy is usually poor, and corticosteroids can relieve certain symptoms in some cases.

### Giant cell arteritis: reviewing the advancing diagnostics and management [^1163WPEd]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

GCA has heterogeneous clinical features due to the overlapping spectrum of the known clinical phenotypes: cranial GCA (C-GCA), large vessel GCA (LV-GCA), and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) (Fig. 2). The majority of people with cranial GCA will have symptoms of new onset headache, jaw claudication and cutaneous allodynia. Nearly half of people with GCA have symptoms of PMR (Fig. 2) while up to one-fifth of people with PMR will be diagnosed with GCA. There may be large vessel involvement in cranial GCA, which may be asymptomatic and revealed by diagnostic imaging alone. Up to 50% of people with GCA will experience constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, loss of appetite, malaise, depression. These may help narrow the differential diagnosis from an ocular cause or pain syndrome (such as migraine or cluster headache) to a systemic cause, however many systemic conditions have the potential to exhibit these symptoms (Table 1).

Fig. 2
Risk factors for GCA.

Table 1
Potential differential diagnoses for those suspected with GCA.

The visual symptoms of GCA are well documented and include amaurosis fugax, double vision to devastating visual loss. The most common ocular manifestations include anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, large peripapillary cotton wool spots, arterial occlusions (cilio-retinal artery or central artery), oculomotor cranial nerve palsy, and posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, with other rarer ocular syndromes having been reported (Table 2). Initiation of treatment may result in reversal of visual loss in the minority.

Table 2
Ocular manifestations of Giant Cell Arteritis.

Ophthalmologists need to beware of the less common presentations of GCA, as they may be asked to examine patients who are suspected of having GCA. For example, symptoms of LV-GCA include intermittent limb claudication or absent pulses according to the vessels affected and chest or back pain if there is aortic involvement. GCA can present without any symptoms of cranial or large vessel involvement, with inflammation or fever of unknown origin (IFUO), anorexia, weight loss and anaemia being the only evidence of an active disease process. Patients with constitutional GCA are at risk of significant diagnostic delay due to the large differential diagnosis of IFUO.

### Clinical characteristics and mechanisms of musculoskeletal pain in long COVID [^114qHCpR]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The lasting symptoms of COVID-19, now referred to as "Long COVID", are a public health concern. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, "Long COVID" is defined as signs and symptoms that develop during or after an acute infection consistent with COVID-19 and persist longer than 4 weeks. This comprises both ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 (from 4 to 12 weeks) and post-COVID-19 syndrome (beyond 12 weeks). The guidelines emphasize that the symptoms cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis which is in keeping with the clinical case definition proposed by the WHO that also highlight the potential fluctuations and protracted nature of post-COVID-19 symptoms.

Long COVID presents as a clinically diverse condition, with published work reporting a plethora of symptoms, most commonly: fatigue, shortness of breath, pain, post-exertional malaise, persisting elevated temperature and cognitive dysfunction. At the beginning of December 2021, estimated 1.3 million people in UK private households had Long COVID, 64% of whom reported an adverse impact of their symptoms/diagnosis on their ability to carry out activities of daily living (ADL). Several theories have been posited to explain the etiology of Long COVID which include continued presence of the virus, re-infection with the same or possibly different strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), endothelial damage and hypercoagulation, dysautonomia, and dysfunctional immune response leading to chronic inflammation.

### Diagnostic approach to polyarticular joint pain [^111oEEBP]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Identifying the cause of polyarticular joint pain can be difficult because of the extensive differential diagnosis. A thorough history and a complete physical examination are essential. Six clinical factors are helpful in narrowing the possible causes: disease chronology, inflammation, distribution, extra-articular manifestations, disease course, and patient demographics. Patients with an inflammatory arthritis are more likely to have palpable synovitis and morning stiffness; if the condition is severe, they may have fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Viral infections, crystal-induced arthritis, and serum sickness reactions are common causes of acute, self-limited polyarthritis. Because chronic arthritides may present abruptly, they need to be considered in patients who present with acute polyarticular joint pain. Joint palpation can help to distinguish inflammatory synovitis from the bony hypertrophy and crepitus that typically occur with osteoarthritis. Extra-articular manifestations of rheumatologic disease may be helpful in arriving at a more specific diagnosis. Many classic rheumatologic laboratory tests are nonspecific. A complete blood count, urinalysis, and a metabolic panel may provide more useful diagnostic clues. Plain-film radiographs may demonstrate classic findings of specific rheumatologic diseases; however, radiographs can be normal or only show nonspecific changes early in the disease process.

### Recurrent painful ecchymosis in an adolescent female [^111ZfrKx]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is correct?
A. PP can present after a triggering event such as trauma, emotional distress, surgery, or infection with ecchymosis developing in an unrelated site.
B. PP is a skin manifestation of an underlying coagulation disorder.
C. Psychiatric disease is not a common comorbidity present in patients with PP.
D. Systemic symptoms are not associated with skin lesions in PP.
E. Lesions of PP resolve with low rates of recurrence.

Answers:
A. PP can present after a triggering event such as trauma, emotional distress, surgery, or infection with ecchymosis developing in an unrelated site – Correct. A triggering event can often be identified in patients with PP. Postsurgical procedure is the most common, possibly because of the traumatic and emotional stress of recovering from surgery.
B. PP is a skin manifestation of an underlying coagulation disorder – Incorrect. The diagnosis of PP is made in a patient with no underlying coagulation disorder that could explain the development of ecchymosis. Hematologic laboratory findings are usually normal.
C. Psychiatric disease is not a common comorbidity present in patients with PP – Incorrect. Approximately 50% of patients with PP may have an underlying psychiatric disorder, most commonly depression and personality disorder.
D. Systemic symptoms are not associated with skin lesions in PP – Incorrect. Appearance of new skin lesions in PP may be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, and myalgia. Additionally, gastrointestinal hemorrhages and epistaxis have been reported.
E. Lesions of PP resolve with low rates of recurrence – Incorrect. Lesions of PP resolve within 7 to 10 days. They become less painful and change colors from blue to green and then to yellow before resolving. Unfortunately, lesions do typically recur either in the same location or other parts of the body.

### Primary spinal infections in patients with hematologic immunocompromising conditions: a systematic literature review [^111DLBVh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary spinal infections (PSIs) include conditions such as discitis which involves the intervertebral disk, spondylodiscitis which involves the intervertebral disk and end plate of the vertebral body, and vertebral osteomyelitis which involves infection and inflammation of the vertebra. PSIs have been characterized in the setting of comorbidities that leave patients especially susceptible to fungal, viral, and bacterial vertebral infections. These comorbidities include solid organ transplant patients, patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis, and patients with autoimmune conditions. It is understood that PSIs are more prevalent and aggressive among patients in chronic immunocompromised (IC) states. Thus, the authors sought to investigate PSIs in the context of hematologic diseases, particularly those that affect the immune system.

Owing to the nonspecific symptoms such as fever and generalized back pain, an undiagnosed, rapidly developing PSI can pose a serious threat. Patients often display better outcomes when PSIs are diagnosed earlier in the course of the infection. Therefore, diagnosis and rapid intervention to treat PSIs is of paramount importance. Interventions include intravenous or oral antibiotics and more invasive surgical methods, such as abscess drainage or decompressive laminectomy for extensive infections.

### Clinical course and characteristics of generalized pustular psoriasis [^117RTKSi]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Generalized pustular psoriasis is characterized by recurrent flares of widespread, painful, fiery erythema studded with sterile pustules that may coalesce to form lakes of pus. Mucosal involvement may also occur, and manifests as cheilitis, geographic tongues or fissured tongues, and genital lesions. Severity can range from mild to severe, and an individual patient can experience different disease extent, severity, and cutaneous and extracutaneous symptoms with each flare. Generalized pustular psoriasis flares may or may not be accompanied by systemic symptoms, including fever, general malaise, fatigue, and disabling edema. Common laboratory abnormalities observed in GPP flares include leukocytosis and neutrophilia, elevated CRP levels, hypocalcemia, hypoalbuminemia, and abnormal liver function tests.

High fever has been reported in approximately 24–96% of patients during a GPP flare (Table 1) and approximately 30–70% of patients have leukocytosis with neutrophilia recorded. There is no international consensus on the definition of a severe GPP flare. In a single-center study of 95 patients with acute GPP affecting > 30% of the body surface area (BSA), pain, fever, and leukocytosis were prevalent and documented in 96.8%, 95.8%, and 82.1% of patients, respectively. Hence, a GPP flare affecting > 30% BSA may be classified as a severe or significant flare because of its association with systemic inflammation. Systemic inflammation, defined as a fever > 38 °C with leukocytosis > 12 × 10⁹/L, is more prevalent in patients with IL36RN variants. Patients with homozygous IL36RN variants have a more severe phenotype that is characterized by early onset, low prevalence of plaque psoriasis, and a high risk of systemic inflammation. Extracutaneous manifestations of a GPP flare include arthritis and arthralgia, uveitis and conjunctivitis, and neutrophilic cholangitis. Generalized pustular psoriasis is also associated with multiple comorbidities, such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, anxiety, and depression.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^1174xBBo]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

COMMENTARY

In this case, the clinician employed both pattern recognition (fever, jaundice and abdominal pain triggered the diagnosis of cholangitis) and analytical reasoning to explain the jaundice and LUQ pain. Pattern recognition is a method of reasoning associated with "expertise" whereby the experienced clinician makes the correct diagnosis after asking only a few questions and performing a few physical examination maneuvers. A more advanced model of expert diagnostic reasoning embraces this ability to recognize many patterns, but also emphasizes fluidity between pattern recognition and analytical reasoning. This requires recognizing elements that do not fit the readily available pattern and further exploring those features in a focused, efficient manner. Emerging research on reasoning suggests that an approach using pattern recognition combined with careful consideration of discordant case features may improve diagnostic accuracy.

In this complex case, multiple candidate illnesses remained plausible even after the accumulation of substantial data. Clinicians approach this problem by prioritizing the differential diagnosis in relationship to the refined problem representation. Sorting the possible diagnoses into categories of close, intermediate and limited match, and including diagnoses that pose great risk if missed, can tailor the diagnostic workup for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness (Table 1).

### Fever of unknown origin: a challenging case [^116WzKVD]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as a body temperature of ≥ 38.3°C on at least two occasions and a duration of illness of ≥ 3 weeks or having multiple febrile episodes over this time period. There must be no obvious diagnosis despite complete history taking and examination, as well as appropriate investigation that should include routine blood tests, inflammatory markers, autoimmune screen, cultures, chest radiography and abdominal imaging. Investigation includes identifying any potential diagnostic clues (PDCs) that can help reveal the underlying cause of the fever; however, up to 50% of cases of FUO remain undiagnosed.

The case described here is of a rare condition presenting with FUO that proved to be a diagnostic challenge. Despite its rarity, accurate documentation of cases of Cogan's syndrome remains crucial to improving our awareness and understanding of this condition. This could in turn bring about the development of more effective treatment as well as reduce patient morbidity by leading to earlier diagnosis. Our case also stresses how laboratory and radiological investigations should not serve as an alternative to thorough clinical assessments since early recognition of PDCs and symptom complexes is more likely to help clinch a diagnosis than investigations which can at times return non-specific results.

### An update on polymyalgia rheumatica [^113SU3FH]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

There is no gold standard for diagnosing PMR, and unlike many other rheumatic syndromes, there are no specific clinical manifestations, serology or other laboratory findings in PMR. As a result, diagnosis of PMR can be challenging with a considerable number of conditions in the list of differential diagnoses. However, in daily practice, the diagnosis of PMR relies mainly on the following combination of principles: new‐onset symptoms of both morning stiffness and pain in the shoulder and pelvis girdle in a person aged 50 years or older, evidence of systemic inflammation with a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and or CRP, no other disease that would explain the clinical presentation better and finally abrupt response to GCs. In some diagnostic criteria, there are other specific requirements, such as a 2‐week duration of symptoms or negative tests for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.

The diagnosis of PMR should be considered clinically. The typical case is an elderly woman with early morning bilateral shoulder pain and stiffness. Similar symptoms often occur in the pelvic girdle. Typically, the symptoms ease during the day. Systemic manifestations such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss may occur in about a third of the patients. In addition, there is almost always an elevation of inflammatory parameters, especially ESR and/or CRP. Other inflammatory parameters can be elevated as white blood cell or platelet count and sometimes liver enzymes or alkaline phosphatase may be elevated as a sign of systemic inflammation. On clinical examination, tenderness with deep palpation of the muscles around the shoulders and thighs is often noted. In addition, there is usually restricted mobility in the shoulders, without muscle atrophy or weakness. Occasional signs of synovitis in the shoulders, wrist joints and the knees can be seen. PMR can be diagnosed in combination with GCA, especially in those with a cranial phenotype, that is, TA. Although temporal biopsy may be positive in a minority of patients with PMR, it is not included in the currently recommended investigation of the disease, unless there are concomitant cranial GCA symptoms. Finally, in PMR, most patients will respond rapidly and dramatically to GCs and according to some criteria, this response is required for diagnosis.

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19, and to identify people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Symptoms are what is experienced by patients, for example, cough or nausea. Signs are what can be evaluated by clinical assessment, for example, lung auscultation findings, blood pressure or heart rate.

Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 include: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. Red flags indicating possible severe disease or pneumonia include breathlessness at rest, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, and temperature above 38 °C.

Neurologic conditions are categorized as either those that cause a change in mental status or those that create a focal finding on physical examination. Neurologic abnormality associated with fever can be caused by a primary neurologic condition or one that does not originate in the central nervous system. Optimal management of such conditions requires high clinical suspicion and a broad differential diagnosis, which facilitates rapid recognition and effective treatment. A thorough history and physical examination are key determinants in accurately diagnosing neurologic conditions associated with fever, often requiring acquisition of collateral information from persons other than the patient.

### Whipple's disease: multiple hospital admissions of a man with diarrhoea, fever and arthralgia [^114mSyKK]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Whipple's disease is a rare chronic multi-systemic infectious disorder caused by the Gram-positive bacillus, Tropheryma whippelii. Infection may involve any organ in the body, and most commonly affects white men in the fourth to sixth decades of life. The most common presenting symptoms are gastrointestinal and include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, anorexia and associated weight loss. However, the variability in presentation is considerable and some patients may present with intermittent low-grade fever, neurological abnormalities (nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, cranial nerve defects), migratory arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, or involvement of the cardiovascular system. In typical Whipple's disease, the most severe changes are seen in the proximal small intestine and biopsy reveals mucosal and lymph node infiltration with large, foamy histocytes, containing granules that stain positive with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent and represent intact or partially degraded bacteria. Extended antibiotic treatment (up to 1-year) is indicated. Life-long surveillance for recurrence is essential, once primary treatment has been completed. We report the case of a 58-year-old man who developed a rare infection with the actinobacterium, T. whippelii. The patient had suffered intermittent episodes of varying clinical symptoms associated with multiple hospital admissions and clinical diagnoses, spanning a period of 22 years. Historically, arthralgia was the primary manifestation in this patient and also was the chief complaint for which he was first hospitalized 22 years ago. At his most recent admission to our hospital department, his presenting symptoms were persistent fatigue, weight loss, arthralgia and diarrhoea. Thus, it is essential that clinicians retain a high index of suspicion for T. whippelii infection in patients who have a long-term history of arthritis, fever and diarrhoea.

### Investigating and managing pyrexia of unknown origin in adults [^117Nng2s]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Few clinical problems generate such a wide differential diagnosis as pyrexia (fever) of unknown origin. The initial definition proposed by Petersdorf and Beeson in 1961,¹ later revised, is "a fever of 38.3°C (101°F) or more lasting for at least three weeks for which no cause can be identified after three days of investigation in hospital or after three or more outpatient visits". ²⁻⁴Essentially the term refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an obvious cause despite reasonable evaluation and diagnostic testing. A fever that is not self limiting for which no cause can be found can become a source of frustration for both patient and doctor. There is little consensus on how such patients should be investigated, although recent prospective studies have evaluated diagnostic protocols to suggest approaches to investigation. ³⁵⁶ We discuss evidence from epidemiological and diagnostic studies and suggest an approach to investigating and managing pyrexia of unknown origin. Immunocompromised individuals, those with HIV infection, and patients admitted to hospital for other reasons with persistent or unexplained fever represent distinct subgroups in which the likely causes, diagnosis, and treatment of pyrexia usually differ from those in patients who are not immunocompromised. We do not discuss these subgroups in this review other than to provide definitions of pyrexia of unknown origin in different groups of patients (see box 1).

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^1127gt6v]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of previous review

In our initial review, we found 16 relevant studies with 7706 participants. The median number of participants was 134. Prevalence of the target disease varied from 5% to 38% with a median of 17%.

The studies assessed 27 separate signs and symptoms, but none assessed combinations of signs and symptoms. Seven were set in hospital outpatient clinics (2172 participants), four in emergency departments (1401 participants), but none in primary care settings. No studies included children, and only one focused on older adults. All the studies confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis by the most accurate test available, which was reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR).

The studies did not clearly distinguish mild to moderate COVID‐19 from severe to critical COVID‐19, so we presented the results for all severities together. The results indicated that at least half of participants with COVID‐19 had a cough, sore throat, high temperature, muscle or joint pain, fatigue, or headache. However, cough and sore throat were also common in people without COVID‐19, so these symptoms alone are less helpful for diagnosing COVID‐19. High temperature, muscle or joint pain, fatigue, and headache substantially increase the likelihood of COVID‐19 when they are present.

Signs and symptoms for which sensitivity was reported above 50% in at least one study were the following:

Cough: sensitivity between 43% to 71%, specificity between 14% to 54%
Fever: sensitivity between 7% to 91%, specificity between 16% to 94%
Sore throat: sensitivity between 5% to 71%, specificity between 55% to 80%
Myalgia or arthralgia: sensitivity between 19% to 86%, specificity between 45% to 91%
Fatigue: sensitivity between 10% to 57%, specificity between 60% to 94%
Headache: sensitivity between 3% to 71%, specificity between 78% to 98%

All other signs and symptoms appeared to have very low sensitivities but high specificities, making them unsuitable for diagnosis individually.

We concluded that the diagnostic accuracy, especially the sensitivity, of individual signs and symptoms is low. In addition, results were highly variable across studies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^113QE2RB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL TEACHING POINTS

Human brucellosis is a very common illness worldwide. Four brucella species — melitensis, suis, abortus and canis — cause the majority of human illness, with B. melitensis being the most common.
Brucellosis is generally transmitted by direct contact with infected animals (cattle, sheep, goats or pigs) or by consuming unpasteurized dairy products. The incubation period is days to months.
Though brucellosis can involve any organ system, it usually presents with nonspecific symptoms, including undulating fevers, night sweats, malaise, weight loss and arthralgias. It can also present with focal brucellosis syndromes, including meningitis, arthritis, endocarditis or epididymoorchitis.
Granulomatous hepatitis is caused by infections (e.g. tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, Q fever, brucellosis, syphilis, cryptococcosis, leprosy), drugs, malignancy (e.g. lymphomas, renal cell carcinoma) or autoimmune diseases (e.g. sarcoidosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, primary biliary cirrhosis). Up to 20 percent of cases are idiopathic.
The social history is often a key discriminating feature in febrile illnesses, particularly for patients who travel outside of industrialized areas. They are often exposed to infections that are not routinely considered.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^115srJRm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Index test(s)

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease, and to identify people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Symptoms are what is experienced by patients, for example cough or nausea. Signs are what can be evaluated by clinical assessment, for example lung auscultation findings, blood pressure or heart rate.

Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 disease include: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. Red flags indicating possible pneumonia include breathlessness at rest, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, and temperature above 38 °C.

Clinical pathway

Important in the context of COVID‐19 is that the pathway is multifaceted because it is designed to care for the diseased individual and to protect the community from further spread. Decisions about patient and isolation pathways for COVID‐19 vary according to health services and settings, available resources, and stages of the epidemic. They will change over time, if and when effective treatments and vaccines are identified. The decision points between these pathways vary, but all include points at which knowledge of the accuracy of diagnostic information is needed to be able to inform rational decision making.

Prior test(s)

In this review on signs and symptoms, no prior tests are required because signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease. Patients can, however, self‐assess before presenting to healthcare services based on their symptoms. This is in contrast to contact tracing, in which patients or participants are tested based on a documented contact with a SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive person and may themselves be asymptomatic.

Role of index test(s)

Signs and symptoms are used as triage tests, that is, to rule out COVID‐19 disease, but also to identify patients with possible COVID‐19 who may require further testing, care escalation or isolation.

Alternative test(s)

Chest X‐ray, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) are widely used diagnostic imaging tests to diagnose COVID‐19 pneumonia. Availability and usage varies between settings. We address these radiological tests in a separate review.

### Musculoskeletal manifestations in hereditary periodic fever syndromes [^112R1qm2]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs) are a group of inflammatory disorders induced by deregulation of the innate immune system and characterised by inflammatory bouts with fever as well as a large spectrum of other possible manifestations involving most organs and tissues. In this context, musculoskeletal manifestations represent a frequent finding in the clinical picture of patients with AIDs and may range from less severe affections including myalgia and arthralgia to severe arthritis, muscle fasciitis, bone erosions, and joint deformities. Therefore, as diagnostic suspicions originates from a careful and detailed clinical evaluation, physicians dealing with mono- genic AIDs should bear in mind their possible muscle and joint manifestations, some of which are typical and very useful for diagnostic purposes. Indeed, their prompt recognition may reduce the diagnostic delay thus allowing an early and appropriate therapeutic management. For these reasons, the present review is aimed at providing a wide overview on the different patterns of joint and muscle affections in the four main monogenic AIDs.

### Severe rift valley fever may present with a characteristic clinical syndrome [^112GDPyT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is an emerging pathogen that is transmitted in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Egypt, and the Arabian peninsula. Outbreaks of RVF, like other diseases caused by hemorrhagic fever viruses, typically present in locations with very limited health resources, where initial diagnosis must be based only on history and physical examination. Although general signs and symptoms of human RVF have been documented, a specific clinical syndrome has not been described. In 2007, a Kenyan outbreak of RVF provided opportunity to assess acutely ill RVF patients and better delineate its presentation and clinical course. Our data reveal an identifiable clinical syndrome suggestive of severe RVF, characterized by fever, large-joint arthralgia, and gastrointestinal complaints and later followed by jaundice, right upper-quadrant pain, and delirium, often coinciding with hemorrhagic manifestations. Further characterization of a distinct RVF clinical syndrome will aid earlier detection of RVF outbreaks and should allow more rapid implementation of control.

### Recurrent fever and rash [^115m3F1V]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Periodic fever is uncommon in children. The differential diagnosis is large, even though associated symptoms such as rash may help narrow the differential diagnosis. Atypical presentations require thoughtful evaluation. This article describes a case of a 4-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with recurrent fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, myalgias, and rash. His hospital course is described along with a review on the background, evaluation, management, and complications of tumor necrosis receptor-1 alpha periodic syndrome.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^113gmuYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with severe or critical disease require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19;
severe or critical COVID‐19.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping (which is a subset of the above):

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### Herpes zoster in pregnancy: clinical outcomes and treatment patterns from a multicenter retrospective cohort [^113rMckJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes zoster is a worldwide health concern, with an incidence rate of 3 to 5 cases per 1000 person-years in the United States. Over the past several decades, the incidence has been rising, although the underlying causes of this increase remain unidentified. The etiological agent responsible for herpes zoster is the varicella-zoster virus (VZV).VZV, a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, is classified under the Herpesviridae family and is formally designated as Human Herpesvirus Type 3 (HHV-3).VZV has only one serotype in nature, and humans are its sole reservoir. The virus can manifest as two distinct clinical conditions: varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Primary infection with VZV results in varicella, after which the virus becomes latent in the cerebral and dorsal root ganglia. Upon a decline in cell-mediated immunity, VZV can reactivate within T lymphocytes residing in the ganglia, resulting in extensive viral replication and the manifestation of herpes zoster. Two to three days prior to the onset of the rash, patients typically exhibit prodromal symptoms, including fatigue, headache, low-grade fever, and abnormal skin sensations such as itching, burning, and prickling. During the active phase, herpes zoster manifests at the affected dermatome with the appearance of a rash accompanied by pain. This condition frequently results in a deterioration of the patient's quality of life. Approximately 20% of patients continue to experience pain during the chronic phase after the rash has resolved, a condition known as postherpetic neuralgia. In contrast to primary infection, herpes zoster can cause prolonged discomfort and chronic pain.

### Autoinflammatory manifestations in adult patients [^116aaQm3]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Autoinflammatory diseases represent a family of immune-mediated conditions characterized by the unchecked activation of innate immunity. These conditions share common clinical features such as recurrent fever, inflammatory arthritis, and elevation of acute phase reactants, in the absence of an identified infectious etiology, generally without detectable serum autoantibodies, with variable response to glucocorticoids and in some cases colchicine, which represented the mainstay of treatment until cytokine blockade therapies became available. The first autoinflammatory diseases to be described were monogenic disorders caused by missense mutations in inflammasome components and were recognized predominantly during childhood or early adulthood. However, the progress of genetic analyses and a more detailed immunological phenotyping capacity led to the discovery a wide spectrum of diseases, often becoming manifest or being diagnosed in the adult population. The beneficial role of targeting hyperinflammation via interleukin 1 in complex non-immune-mediated diseases is a field of growing clinical interest. We provide an overview of the autoinflammatory diseases of interest to physicians treating adult patients and to analyze the contribution of hyperinflammation in non-immune-mediated diseases; the result is intended to provide a roadmap to orient scientists and clinicians in this broad area.

Chikungunya (CHIK) — overlap and confusion with dengue fever are highlighted, noting that CHIK has to be distinguished from dengue fever and the two diseases can occur together in the same patient. In CHIK, shock or severe hemorrhage is very rarely observed; the onset is more acute and the duration of fever is much shorter, and maculopapular rash is more frequent than in dengue fever. Although people may complain of diffuse body pain, in CHIK the pain is much more pronounced and localized to the joints and tendons.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^1146789i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

13
Forest plot of tests: 37 fatigue (non‐cross‐sectional study), 36 fever (non‐cross‐sectional study), 39 headache (non‐cross‐sectional study), 38 myalgia or arthralgia (non‐cross‐sectional study)

14
Forest plot of tests: 40 diarrhoea (non‐cross‐sectional study), 41 nausea/vomiting (non‐cross‐sectional study), 42 gastrointestinal symptoms, not specified (non‐cross‐sectional study)

15
Forest plot of 35 chest tightness (non‐cross‐sectional study)

Overall, diagnostic accuracy of individual signs and symptoms is low, especially sensitivity. In addition, results were highly variable across studies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

Signs and symptoms for which sensitivity was reported above 50% in at least one cross‐sectional study are the following.

Cough: sensitivity between 43% and 71%, specificity between 14% and 54%
Sore throat: sensitivity between 5% and 71%, specificity between 55% and 80%
Fever: sensitivity between 7% and 91%, specificity between 16% and 94%
Myalgia or arthralgia: sensitivity between 19% and 86%, specificity between 45% and 91%
Fatigue: sensitivity between 10% and 57%, specificity between 60% and 94%
Headache: sensitivity between 3% and 71%, specificity between 78% and 98%

For fever, six of nine studies report a sensitivity of at least 80%, which is unsurprising considering fever was a key feature of COVID‐19 that was used in selecting patients for further testing. As a result, most participants in these studies would have fever, both cases and non‐cases. The same applies to cough, which was also listed as one of the main criteria for SARS‐CoV‐2 testing and may have contributed to inflated sensitivity estimates.

### A taste of periodic fever syndromes [^114K8wRJ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Periodic fevers are acquired or inherited disorders of innate immunity, which were first described in the 1940s. The patients are typically young at onset and have regularly recurring fevers for a few days to a few weeks with systemic inflammatory symptoms that are interrupted by symptom-free periods. There is a variety of clinical manifestations including gastrointestinal complaints, myalgias, arthralgias, and rash. A differential diagnosis in these patients may include recurrent infections, other inflammatory disorders, and neoplastic disease. This clinical review focuses on a sample of autoinflammatory disorders including familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-associated periodic syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome, the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome. We review the basics, pertinent clinical and laboratory features, and management of each entity.

### Urticarial vasculitis [^115S8TmB]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent edematous papules and plaques on the skin that last longer than 24 hours, often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as joint pain and fever. Unlike common urticaria, this condition involves inflammation of small blood vessels, leading to more severe and long-lasting skin lesions with a tendency to leave a bruiselike appearance. Diagnosis is challenging and may require a skin biopsy. Associated with underlying autoimmune diseases, treatment involves managing symptoms with medications such as antihistamines and corticosteroids, addressing the immune system's dysfunction, and treating any concurrent autoimmune conditions.

### Clinical features in VEXAS syndrome: a systematic review [^115EYeK6]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is an adult-onset systemic autoinflammatory disorder with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent population-based studies suggest a prevalence of ∼1 in ∼4000 men over 50 years old. The condition manifests as combined systemic inflammation and bone marrow dysfunction, with up to half of patients dying withing 5 years of diagnosis. The disease is characterized by a highly heterogeneous clinical presentation across multiple systems. Patients experience recurrent fevers, profound fatigue, skin lesions and progressive cytopenias, leading to substantial disability and frequent hospitalizations. The economic burden is considerable, with many patients requiring long-term corticosteroid therapy, repeated transfusions and intensive specialist care across multiple disciplines.

This systematic review aims to comprehensively catalogue and analyse all reported clinical manifestations of VEXAS syndrome since its discovery. By synthesizing data from all published case series and reports, we seek to establish the relative frequency of different disease features and identify rare but significant manifestations. This information will be crucial for improving disease recognition, developing standardized diagnostic criteria and guiding therapeutic decision-making.

Yellow fever (YF) clinical manifestations and illness course — In the majority of persons infected with YF, infections are believed to be asymptomatic; clinical disease varies from a mild, undifferentiated febrile illness to severe disease and the clinical disease period is usually 3–6 days; some patients experience an abrupt onset of a high fever (up to 104°F [40°C]) with systemic symptoms, and examination might demonstrate bradycardia in relation to the elevated body temperature (Faget's sign); during this period the patient is usually viremic, which lasts for approximately 3 days; many recover, but in approximately 15% of infected persons the illness recurs in more severe form within 48 hours following the viremic period, with viremia generally absent during this phase.

### Symptom burden in patients with idiopathic multicentric castleman disease and its impact on daily life: an international patient and caregiver survey [^112EeWgQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multicentric Castleman Disease (MCD) is a heterogenous collection of lymphoproliferative disorders often associated with a hyperinflammatory state mediated by hypercytokinemia. Idiopathic MCD (iMCD) is diagnosed once other aetiologies of MCD are eliminated, in particular human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), other infections, POEMS-associated MCD (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy/oedema, monoclonal protein and skin changes), autoimmune conditions, and certain malignancies as per the international diagnostic criteria.iMCD cases can be further classified into three distinct clinical entities–iMCD with thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, bone marrow reticulin fibrosis or renal dysfunction, and organomegaly (iMCD-TAFRO); iMCD with idiopathic plasmacytic lymphadenopathy (iMCD-IPL); and iMCD not otherwise specified (iMCD-NOS), a category that includes cases that do not meet the criteria for either iMCD-TAFRO or iMCD-IPL. iMCD is a rare condition with an estimated annual incidence of 3.1–3.4 cases and prevalence of 6.9–9.7 cases per million in the United States (US). The clinical phenotype of iMCD can vary ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to generalised pain, chronic fatigue, and anasarca among others and in some cases, severe sepsis-like picture leading to multi-organ failure and death.iMCD patients, particularly those not treated in a timely manner or with appropriate therapy, develop significant morbidities and have high rates of emergency room visits and hospitalisations.iMCD-related symptoms have been shown to negatively impact patient quality of life. As no curative therapies exist for iMCD, the primary focus of clinical management remains symptom control and prevention of serious complications.

### Ocular manifestations as first signs of systemic T cell lymphoma in two cases [^116eamKL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Intraocular involvement of systemic T-cell lymphomas are uncommon and have been broadly regarded as markers of poor prognosis. A diagnosis of lymphoma has to be suspected when patients have systemic manifestations including fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, EBV-associated liver disease, et al. and uveitis fails to respond to steroid therapy.

### Approach to the adult patient with fever of unknown origin [^1135PtTj]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) in adults is defined as a temperature higher than 38.3 degrees C (100.9 degrees F) that lasts for more than three weeks with no obvious source despite appropriate investigation. The four categories of potential etiology of FUO are classic, nosocomial, immune deficient, and human immunodeficiency virus-related. The four subgroups of the differential diagnosis of FUO are infections, malignancies, autoimmune conditions, and miscellaneous. A thorough history, physical examination, and standard laboratory testing remain the basis of the initial evaluation of the patient with FUO. Newer diagnostic modalities, including updated serology, viral cultures, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, have important roles in the assessment of these patients.

### New concepts in rheumatic pain [^113ZGgwZ]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The inclusion of pain as the fifth vital sign in clinical medicine underlines the importance of this symptom. Pain that is consistently present in any rheumatic condition should be considered a specific disease entity, which should be actively managed in parallel with the rheumatic complaint. Rheumatic pain is the most prevalent pain syndrome worldwide and will be experienced by almost all persons during their lifetime. Pain results in a significant burden of suffering that affects overall well-being as well as sleep, mood, and energy. Understanding of pain mechanisms from the anatomic and molecular perspectives has advanced, prompting the use of more varied pain interventions beyond simple analgesic medications.

### Post-acute and long-COVID-19 symptoms in patients with mild diseases: a systematic review [^113ATq8V]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The disease was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Currently, the virus has spread all around the world and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.

COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease and the severity can range from asymptomatic to very serious. Most people who are infected will develop symptoms. About one in five patients remain asymptomatic although the evidence is still inadequate. COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system. Other organs that may be affected by COVID-19 include the heart, kidney, liver, muscles, skin and nervous system. Since COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease, various clinical manifestations are involved. Clinical manifestations in the acute phase of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, fatigue, a sore throat, loss of taste or smell, dyspnoea, nasal congestion, muscle or joint pain, chest pain, headache and nausea.

Some patients, even those with mild symptoms of COVID-19, continue to experience symptoms after initial recovery. For many other infectious diseases, post-infectious syndromes have already been recognized for instance, after a mild SARS-infection where a substantial proportion of patients have residual damage in the lungs. In addition, some studies describe psychological complaints, fatigue, limitations in fitness and reduced quality of life after a SARS-infection. Other infectious diseases known for post-infectious symptoms are, for example, Q-fever, Legionnaires' disease, glandular fever and epidemic polyarthritis. A prospective study showed that patients experienced fatigue, neurocognitive problems, musculoskeletal pain and mood disturbance six months after these infections. Although these findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with COVID-19, it is expected that also a proportion of COVID-19 patients will experience physical, cognitive or psychological complaints and more specifically persistent fatigue after initial recovery within 3 weeks.

### The eye involvement in monogenic autoinflammatory diseases: literature review and update [^1122me4J]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs) are rare entities characterised by improper activation of the innate immune system. This in turn determines recurrent episodes of systemic inflammation characterised by fever, which is variously combined with a wide range of inflammatory manifestations involving the skin, joints, serous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system. As shown by research efforts conducted during the last decade, the eye is not exempt from the systemic inflammatory process and may be involved in almost all of the most frequent AIDs, with several distinct peculiarities. Ocular affections may severely impact patients' quality of life due to orbital pain, impairment of visual acuity, and/ or long-term, sight-threatening complications. Consequently, in the context of a multidisciplinary team, ophthalmologists should be aware of ocular manifestations related to these disorders as they may have a dominant diagnostic weight in patients with a challenging presentation as well as a salient role in therapeutic choice in sight-threatening situations. This review describes a variety of aspects of ophthalmologic involvement in AIDs, looking at both well-recognised eye manifestations as well as rarely reported ocular presentations, with a particular focus on the recent literature.

### Musculoskeletal manifestations of childhood malignancies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LhaiD]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The most of pediatric rheumatic diseases are associated with musculoskeletal manifestations, including bone pain, arthritis, arthralgia, and myalgia. Systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile dermatomyositis and some types of vasculitis are the most common of this group of diseases. For the differential diagnosis of these diseases, the presence of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs and paraclinical findings are helpful, but in some cases, it is necessary to rule out malignancy with appropriate tests such as bone marrow aspiration.

Benign musculoskeletal pains such as growing pains are common in children. Red flags for differentiating pathological pain from benign pain including unilateral limb pain, upper limbs pain, pain that wakes up the child and does not respond to analgesics. Also, the presence of arthritis, fever, weight loss and systemic symptoms are red flags. In these cases, examination for pathological causes including malignancy is necessary.

In the case of other childhood cancers, it seems that more than a third of affected children face musculoskeletal complications. Of course, it should be kept in mind that in cancers related to the skeletal system, it is obvious that a significant part of affected children have musculoskeletal manifestations. As the prevalence of musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with bone malignancies, spine cancers and central nervous system malignancies, the prevalence of musculoskeletal involvement will be much higher. Of course, there are very few studies on the mentioned manifestations among non-hematological malignancies and it is not possible to evaluate them systematically at the moment. The limitation of this study is that we investigated common malignancies and meta-analysis was not possible.

### Disorders with ophthalmic and thoracic involvement [^115hmXmV]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

A variety of systemic conditions involve the thorax and the eyes. While subtle or nonspecific eye symptoms can be the initial clinical manifestation of some disorders, there can be additional manifestations in the thorax that lead to a specific diagnosis and affect patient outcomes. For instance, the initial clinical manifestation of Sjögren syndrome is dry eye or xerophthalmia; however, the presence of Sjögren lung disease represents a fourfold increase in mortality. Likewise, patients with acute sarcoidosis can initially present with pain and redness of the eye from uveitis in addition to fever and parotitis. Nearly 90% of patients with sarcoidosis have thoracic involvement, and the ophthalmologic symptoms can precede the thoracic symptoms by several years in some cases. Furthermore, a diagnosis made in one system can result in the screening of other organs as well as prompt genetic evaluation and examination of family members, such as in the setting of Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Multimodality imaging, particularly CT and MRI, plays a vital role in identification and characterization of these conditions. While it is helpful for ophthalmologists to be knowledgeable about these conditions and their associations so that they can order the pertinent radiologic studies, it is also important for radiologists to use the clues from ophthalmologic examination in addition to imaging findings to suggest a specific diagnosis. Systemic conditions with thoracic and ophthalmologic manifestations can be categorized as infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, neoplastic, or hereditary in origin. The authors describe a spectrum of these conditions based on their underlying cause. © RSNA, 2024.

Discussion

YAOS often presents with recurrent and remitting flu-like symptoms followed by fever and erythematous plaques or patches. Our patient experienced symptoms that are commonly reported with YAOS: gastrointestinal manifestations (bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), arthritis and arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, headache, weight loss, and chronic pain causing physical impairment.,

Other reported features of YAOS include sicca-like symptoms, most commonly periorbital swelling, lower extremity swelling, oral ulcers, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, pericarditis, and pleuritis. Cerebral infarction has also been reported in the context of a YAOS-associated fever attack. Eyelid swelling is especially common, seen in > 50% of patients with YAOS. Its absence in our case highlights disease variability and emphasizes recognizing its full spectrum of manifestations. Although 90% of Caucasians experience dermatitis, no Chinese patients with dermatitis have been reported, suggesting possible human leuokocyte antigen-mediated differences in disease expression.

A broad differential should include other systemic autoinflammatory diseases, a group of disorders caused by chronic activation of the innate immune system. In contrast with classic autoimmune disorders, autoinflammatory conditions lack identifiable autoantibodies but rather comprise periodic fever syndromes with evanescent urticarial papules, plaques, figurate erythema, erysipelas-like eruptions, and sterile pustules, typically in association with. fever Elevated acute phase reactants, rash, serositis, arthritis, and lymphadenopathy are present in both autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Yao et aldeveloped a 6-gene panel to screen for periodic fever syndromes that may mimic YAOS (Table I). Typically, recurrent patchy erythema, distal extremity swelling, and eyelid swelling are more suggestive of YS than other hereditary periodic fever syndromes.

### Acute rheumatic fever… [^113TZDvt]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Acute rheumatic fever is a delayed sequela of some group A streptococcal infections.
- It affects many organ systems and has a varied clinical presentation. One manifestation, carditis, may result in long-term disability or death.
- Treatment involves antibiotics, which help prevent recurrent episodes.
- As of July 10, 2025, there is a voluntary recall of Bicillin L-A, a preferred antibiotic to prevent recurrences. Find details in the Prevention section below.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with acute rheumatic fever. Manifestations by organ system Organ systems involved commonly include the
- Cardiovascular system
- Central nervous system
- Musculoskeletal system
- Skin Cardiovascular system Carditis is the major cardiac manifestation of acute rheumatic fever. It occurs in 50% to 70% of first episodes and is associated with valvulitis of the mitral valve, or less commonly, the aortic valve.

Central nervous system Chorea, also called Sydenham's chorea or St. Vitus dance, is the major central nervous system manifestation. Chorea often appears after the other manifestations of acute rheumatic fever. It also can appear as the only manifestation of acute rheumatic fever. Musculoskeletal system Arthritis is present in up to 75% of episodes. Polyarthritis of the large joints is the most common musculoskeletal manifestation. Skin Subcutaneous nodules and erythema marginatum are the two major skin manifestations but occur in < 10% of episodes. Nodules are most commonly present in patients with carditis. Clinical features Clinical features Acute rheumatic fever is usually characterized by fever. Other symptoms depend on the affected organ systems.

Carditis Clinical signs of carditis include
- Cardiomegaly
- Congestive heart failure
- New heart murmur
- Pericardial effusion
- Pericardial friction rub Additionally, a prolonged PR interval can be seen on electrocardiography. Subclinical carditis may also be present. In these cases, classic murmurs may not be appreciated on physical exam. Valve disease is found solely by echocardiography/Doppler studies.

### Clinical and serological insights from the Asian lineage chikungunya outbreak in Grenada, 2014: an observational study [^111cEsR7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean region in 2014, and the first serologically confirmed case was seen in Grenada in July. This study investigated the outbreak of CHIKV in Grenada to identify the distinguishing clinical manifestations and the symptoms that corresponded the closest with serological test results. Sera were tested by IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction to distinguish between cases positive or negative for CHIKV. Of 493 cases, 426 (86%) tested positive for CHIKV. The diagnostic decision rule, "Define as CHIKV positive a patient presenting with joint pain and any combination of fever, body pain, or rash", produced the closest agreement (85%) with the serological test results (Cohen's kappa, k = 0.289, P value < 0.001). When laboratory facilities are not available for diagnostic confirmation, syndromic surveillance using these four symptoms could be useful to define cases during a CHIKV outbreak when CHIKV is the predominant circulating arbovirus.

### Clinicopathologic conference: a four-year-old child with digital clubbing [^1129RCUB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Another disease with increasing recognition is COPA syndrome, an autosomal dominant autoinflammatory condition named for mutations in the COPα gene. COPA syndrome is characterized by restrictive lung disease, arthritis, and renal disease. Patients with COPA syndrome frequently have clubbing due to their underlying restrictive lung disease. COPA syndrome is a relatively new and rare disorder, and the incidence and prevalence of this condition are still uncertain. Recurrent or periodic fever does not appear to be a defining feature of COPA syndrome. This lowered our suspicion that COPA syndrome was the cause of our patient's presentation. She also did not have arthritis or renal involvement to support this diagnosis.

Interestingly, there is a case report of a child with recurrent fevers and hepatosplenomegaly who ultimately developed clubbing secondary to portal hypertension due to Takayasu arteritis. Given the report of fevers and the initially elevated level of alkaline phosphatase, systemic sarcoidosis was considered. Sarcoidosis is a condition characterized by necrotizing granuloma formation in multiple tissues with manifestations dependent on the organ. Our patient did not have lymphadenopathy, parenchymal lung disease, organomegaly, or hypercalcemia that would suggest this diagnosis, and the elevated alkaline phosphatase level normalized spontaneously, further lowering suspicion for this disease.

Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions

GI‐related causes of clubbing include inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile polyposis, hepatic disorders, and celiac disease. Though our patient had abdominal pain following fevers, she did not have diarrhea, constipation, mucosal sores, or other findings to suggest primary GI disease. Her initially elevated alkaline phosphatase finding normalized without intervention, also lowering our suspicion for primary GI disease.

Neoplastic disease

Clubbing has been associated with neoplasms for decades, particularly with pulmonary neoplasms. However, for our patient, a primary pulmonary neoplasm was felt to be unlikely given her age and lack of risk factors, such as smoking or exposure to smoke. She also lacked systemic symptoms, such as night sweats, coughing, or weight loss, to suggest neoplasm. Her chest radiograph did not demonstrate a mass that would be consistent with primary pulmonary neoplasm.

Infectious disease

Infectious causes of clubbing include more indolent infections, such as tuberculosis, infective endocarditis, HIV, or chronic parasitic infection. She lacked risk factors for these infections, lowering suspicion that they were the cause of her symptoms.

### Autoinflammatory diseases: how to put the fire inside the body out? [^114SYzLD]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs) are a group of distinct hereditable disorders characterized by unexplained, recurrent episodes of fever and severe inflammation, most commonly involving skin, joints, gut, and eyes. Mutations in inflammasome-related proteins, particularly in NOD-like receptor (NLR) genes, have been strongly associated with the occurrence of AIDs. However, new genes and dysfunctional proteins have recently been identified and the spectrum of AIDs is ever-expanding. In fact, it has been suggested to encompass other disorders which share some clinical features with AIDs, but are not clearly familial, or are not characterized by fever as a prominent symptom, or are polygenic. In this issue of Autoimmunity Reviews some novel and burning aspects of AIDs were covered and the relationship between AIDs and autoimmune diseases was discussed.

### Fever of unknown origin in the returning traveler [^111Cmo4x]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The returning traveler with fever presents a diagnostic challenge for the health care provider. When evaluating such a patient, the highest priority should be given to diseases that are potentially fatal or may represent public health threats. A good history is paramount and needs to include destination, time and duration of travel, type of activity, onset of fever in relation to travel, associated comorbidities, and any associated symptoms. Pretravel immunizations and chemoprophylaxis may alter the natural course of disease and should be inquired about specifically. The fever pattern, presence of a rash or eschar, organomegaly, or neurologic findings are helpful physical findings. Laboratory abnormalities are nonspecific but when corroborated with clinical and epidemiologic data may offer a clue to diagnosis.

Clinical presentation and disease course

A characteristic feature of PMR is a new and relatively acute onset of proximal muscle pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, upper arms, hips and thighs. Patients often suffer from a pronounced morning stiffness with difficulty turning in or getting out of bed in the morning with some spontaneous relief of symptoms later in the day. The stiffness affects even other physical activities in the morning, including getting dressed or taking care of other daily activities. The symptoms are usually fully developed within a few days to a couple of weeks. Occasionally, the onset is more insidious and may lead to nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, arthralgia, loss of appetite, weight loss or fever. It is not unusual that some patients undergo investigations for suspicion of malignant disease before the diagnosis can be made with PMR.

The nonspecific clinical presentation and the absence of specific laboratory findings or serologic features often leads to some diagnostic delay. PMR imposes a major burden on the daily life of elderly people. The psychological impact is significant, including anxiety related to active disease and side effects of glucocorticoid (GC) treatment.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^114SyG51]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Assessment of diabetic foot infections — When evaluating a diabetic foot infection, a problem-directed history and physical examination "should be obtained" and "A systematic approach to the complete assessment of these patients is required". Pain "should be considered an unreliable symptom in individuals with peripheral neuropathy". Constitutional symptoms are important clinical clues and "Severe infection or sepsis must be considered when these symptoms are present", yet "in about 50% of diabetic patients presenting with significant infection, systemic signs (fever and leukocytosis) are absent", and "Frequently, the only indication of infection is unexplained or recalcitrant hyperglycemia". Laboratory testing "might include a CBC with or without differential, blood cultures, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, sedimentation rate, and urinalysis". The history and exam should include onset, duration, and pre-infection appearance, evaluate "Depth or size of the ulcer, amount of drainage, swelling, color, odor, and extent of infection", and the ulcer "should be probed to determine the presence of bone or joint involvement, sinus tracts, or extension into tendon sheaths".
