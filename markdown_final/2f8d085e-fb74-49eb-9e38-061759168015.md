## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach AKI in the setting of CKD, including definitions, risk stratification, acute management, recovery and follow-up, and special considerations, with explicit self-verification of reasoning steps throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definitions and the AKI–CKD continuum. Then, I should verify the bidirectional relationship and its clinical implications. Next, I will risk-stratify patients and identify high-risk phenotypes. After that, I need to outline acute management principles, including hemodynamics, nephrotoxin stewardship, and drug dosing. Then, I should review renal replacement therapy decision-making and timing. Next, I will address recovery assessment, AKD surveillance, and long-term follow-up. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and uncertainty as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't build on a shaky premise. AKI is an abrupt decrease in kidney function over 7 days or less using creatinine and/or urine output criteria, whereas CKD is defined by abnormalities of kidney function or structure persisting beyond 90 days. AKD bridges these, capturing 7–90 day dysfunction and may occur with or without meeting formal AKI criteria, which is crucial in CKD where small creatinine changes can be misread as progression rather than superimposed injury [^114e5SHX] [^111proz3] [^112vfKRP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about separateness. I need to check the bidirectional relationship. CKD is a major susceptibility factor for AKI, and AKI accelerates CKD progression through maladaptive repair, fibrosis, and persistent microvascular injury, forming an interconnected continuum rather than discrete entities. This means superimposed AKI on CKD (acute-on-chronic) carries compounded risk for nonrecovery, ESRD, and mortality, and even apparent "full recovery" after AKI still confers elevated long-term CKD risk [^111vPPrr] [^113LsPJo] [^111LBP1H] [^115Z92XB].

> Next, I should review risk stratification to identify who needs intensified monitoring and intervention. High-risk features include advanced CKD, diabetes, hypertension, older age, sepsis, and exposure to nephrotoxins. Importantly, AKI severity and duration independently predict CKD incidence and progression, and even low-stage or short-duration AKI elevates risk, so I need to ensure I don't under-triage patients with seemingly "mild" episodes [^113PWCCq] [^111PP2qm] [^114uJfKa].

> I will now examine the acute management principles, starting with hemodynamic optimization and fluid stewardship. Wait, let me verify the fluid strategy: crystalloids are preferred, colloids like HES should be avoided, and diuretics should be used judiciously for volume management rather than to treat AKI per se, as forced diuresis does not improve renal outcomes and positive fluid balance worsens prognosis; I should double-check that I'm not overstating diuretic harm — yes, diuretics are not recommended to prevent or treat AKI, but they remain appropriate for managing volume overload when present [^1174XRkG] [^113tQ7DQ] [^113LsPJo].

> Let me consider nephrotoxin management next, because this is often actionable. I need to ensure a meticulous medication reconciliation with dose adjustments to altered kinetics, avoidance of high-risk agents when alternatives exist, and proactive planning during intercurrent illness. PPIs, NSAIDs, and certain antimicrobials are frequent culprits, and patient education plus medication review during acute illnesses reduces exposure and AKI risk in CKD [^116ZuCbu] [^1142Q2NB] [^112ykkgR].

> I should confirm drug dosing principles in AKI/AKD, especially in CKD where baseline function already alters clearance. Dosing should follow the trajectory of kidney function rather than a single static eGFR, with frequent reassessment as function changes; I need to remember that eGFR equations are unreliable in unstable AKI, so serial creatinine and clinical context guide adjustments, and I should avoid both underdosing and accumulation-related toxicity during recovery or RRT transitions [^112BFJec] [^115vSFuo] [^112UehdE].

> Now, I need to check when to initiate RRT and how modality choice affects recovery. The optimal timing remains controversial; a practical approach is to start when metabolic and fluid demands exceed kidney capacity or when life-threatening indications arise, integrating patient-specific factors and likelihood of renal recovery; modality selection should be individualized, and although some observational data suggest CRRT may associate with better kidney outcomes, randomized data have not shown survival differences, so shared decision-making and local expertise should guide choice [^1164os86] [^115beXTX] [^112Zxn7z].

> But wait, what if I overcall early RRT in a patient likely to recover spontaneously? I should double-check recovery likelihood using clinical phenotypes and, when available, functional tests like the furosemide stress test to enrich prognostication. Importantly, in dialysis-requiring AKI, baseline kidney function is the strongest predictor of recovery, and even stage 4 CKD patients can recover in a meaningful proportion, so I should avoid prematurely labeling ESRD and instead maintain a recovery-focused plan for at least 90 days when recovery probability is not low [^116EsTzW] [^117TR3e7].

> Next, I should review how to assess recovery and surveil for AKD. Let me verify the definitions: full recovery is typically defined by return to baseline creatinine and absence of AKI criteria, partial recovery by a fall in AKI stage, and nonrecovery by persistent AKI. Importantly, persistence beyond 7 days constitutes AKD and warrants intensified follow-up because AKD — whether or not it met formal AKI criteria — is associated with higher risks of death and CKD progression [^112VAtge] [^112vfKRP] [^113RrLYN].

> I need to ensure long-term follow-up is not overlooked, as this is where we can mitigate the AKI–CKD transition. KDIGO-aligned guidance recommends reassessing kidney function at about 3 months after an AKI episode to detect new or worsening CKD, with earlier checks around 30 days in perioperative or high-risk patients. Serial creatinine and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio help detect ongoing injury and guide risk modification, and I should confirm that this follow-up is embedded in discharge planning and primary care workflows [^113Rgd2X] [^115z8HhV].

> Let me think about special populations and settings where nuances matter. In advanced CKD, contrast-associated AKI risk is real but modest, and delaying necessary imaging can be harmful; with hydration and risk mitigation, proceeding is often reasonable. In pediatrics, AKI is common in critical care and carries substantial CKD risk, so age-appropriate monitoring and follow-up are essential. In resource-limited settings, infections and hypovolemia dominate etiologies, so prevention and early recognition strategies must be adapted to local epidemiology and capacity [^113wy8KQ] [^111iTdAv] [^112XELTZ].

> I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with evolving precision frameworks. Subphenotyping and enrichment strategies are increasingly used to match interventions to biology and prognosis, and while not yet routine in broad practice, they inform trial design and may soon refine bedside risk stratification; meanwhile, pragmatic, prevention-focused care with vigilant nephrotoxin stewardship, hemodynamic optimization, and structured follow-up remains the cornerstone for AKI in CKD [^112tyqrv] [^115HcEFq] [^113LsPJo].

> In summary, I need to ensure my approach treats AKI and CKD as an integrated continuum: define and stage AKI/AKD using standardized criteria, stratify risk with attention to severity and duration, deliver supportive care centered on hemodynamics and nephrotoxin avoidance, individualize RRT decisions with recovery in mind, and mandate structured follow-up to detect and slow CKD progression. If I keep verifying each step against guideline-concordant principles and emerging evidence, I can reduce missteps and better protect kidney function over time [^114e5SHX] [^111proz3] [^116EsTzW].

AKI in CKD is defined by a **≥ 50% rise in serum creatinine** or a **≥ 0.3 mg/dL increase within 48 hours** [^114e5SHX] on top of reduced baseline eGFR, reflecting an acute decline superimposed on chronic impairment [^114R2JkN]. CKD increases AKI risk via reduced renal reserve, nephrotoxin exposure, and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension [^113PWCCq]; AKI accelerates CKD progression through maladaptive repair and fibrosis [^111PvcrG] [^114ZR7Ra]. Management centers on **early detection** with frequent creatinine and urine output monitoring [^116QRuer], prompt correction of volume, blood pressure, and electrolytes, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and careful medication dosing [^1142Q2NB]. RRT is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia, acidosis, or volume overload, with modality tailored to hemodynamics and recovery likelihood [^1164os86]. Recovery is less likely with higher AKI severity, longer duration, older age, diabetes, and pre-existing CKD; even after apparent recovery, CKD progression and mortality risks remain elevated, so structured follow-up is essential [^116EsTzW] [^112E4pER].

---

## Definitions and diagnostic criteria

AKI is defined by **KDIGO** as an abrupt reduction in kidney function — a rise in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or ≥ 50% within 7 days, or urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours [^notfound]. In CKD, AKI is diagnosed when there is a **≥ 50% increase in serum creatinine** from baseline or a **≥ 0.3 mg/dL rise within 48 hours**, superimposed on chronic impairment [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several mechanisms underlie **AKI in CKD**:

- **Reduced renal reserve**: Lower baseline GFR limits compensatory capacity during acute insults [^116BeyQa].
- **Nephrotoxin exposure**: CKD patients often receive nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, contrast, certain antibiotics) that precipitate AKI [^112ykkgR].
- **Hemodynamic instability**: CKD patients are vulnerable to hypotension, hypovolemia, and RAAS activation, worsening renal perfusion [^116QRuer].
- **Maladaptive repair**: AKI in CKD can trigger fibrosis and chronic progression via persistent inflammation and endothelial injury [^114ZR7Ra].

---

## Clinical implications and outcomes

AKI in CKD has **major clinical consequences**:

- **Progression of CKD**: AKI accelerates CKD progression to ESRD through fibrosis and nephron loss [^notfound].
- **Increased mortality**: AKI in CKD is linked to higher short- and long-term mortality [^notfound].
- **Dialysis dependence**: Higher risk of chronic dialysis after AKI in CKD [^116EsTzW].
- **Cardiovascular complications**: Elevated risk of heart failure, arrhythmias, and ischemic events [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors

Key risk factors for **AKI in CKD** include:

| **Category** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Patient-related | - Older age <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Liver disease <br/> - Volume depletion <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances [^111pc4Gq] |
| Disease-related | - Advanced CKD stage <br/> - Proteinuria <br/> - Rapid CKD progression <br/> - Acute decompensation of chronic conditions [^1171wmis] |
| Treatment-related | - Nephrotoxic medications <br/> - Contrast exposure <br/> - Surgery <br/> - Invasive procedures <br/> - Inadequate monitoring [^1128f7Be] |

---

## Management strategies

Management of **AKI in CKD** requires a coordinated approach:

- **Early detection**: Frequent monitoring of serum creatinine, eGFR, and urine output; use KDIGO criteria to stage AKI severity [^111JD9cT].
- **Hemodynamic optimization**: Maintain adequate volume status, blood pressure, and cardiac output; avoid hypotension and volume overload [^1174XRkG].
- **Nephrotoxin avoidance**: Review and discontinue nephrotoxic drugs; adjust doses to renal function [^116ZuCbu].
- **Electrolyte and acid-base management**: Correct hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and other disturbances promptly [^113LsPJo].
- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: Initiate when indicated for refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or volume overload; choose modality based on hemodynamics and recovery likelihood [^1164os86].

---

## Prognosis and recovery

Recovery after AKI in CKD varies with **severity, duration, and baseline kidney function**. Non-recovery is more likely with higher AKI severity, longer duration, older age, diabetes, and advanced CKD. Even after apparent recovery, CKD progression and mortality risks remain elevated, so structured follow-up is essential [^116EsTzW] [^112E4pER].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **risk stratification** — identifying high-risk patients and monitoring closely during exposures — and on **nephrotoxin stewardship** by avoiding or adjusting nephrotoxic drugs and ensuring appropriate hydration during contrast or surgery. Education of patients and providers supports early recognition and intervention [^113PWCCq] [^1128f7Be].

---

AKI in CKD is common and consequential, with bidirectional links to CKD progression and mortality. Early detection, hemodynamic optimization, nephrotoxin avoidance, and timely RRT are central to management, and structured follow-up is critical given persistent risks even after apparent recovery [^116gQkzx].

### Long-term risks of adverse kidney outcomes after acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PP2qm]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased risks of adverse kidney outcomes, and incidence or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney failure (KF), or major adverse kidney events (MAKE).
Timely identification of CKD is imperative for initiating preventive measures that may impede further cardiorenal consequences.

This study adds:

The risks of CKD incidence or progression, as well as KF, were higher among individuals with more severe AKI stages or longer AKI durations. Notably, even individuals with the lowest AKI stage or a short AKI duration of < 3 days had increased risks of these outcomes.
Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and acute kidney replacement therapy were associated with increased risk of CKD incidence/progression after AKI.
Risks of kidney dysfunction after AKI were different between clinical settings; the highest risks in comparison to individuals without AKI were seen in the context of cardiovascular surgery.

Potential impact:

This review raises awareness of the association of AKI and CKD incidence, CKD progression, KF, and MAKE. Even individuals with the lowest AKI stage or short-lasting AKI showed increased risk for CKD incidence or progression. It emphasizes the importance of vigilance for post-AKI decline in kidney function.
Risks for adverse kidney outcomes were heterogeneous between patient subgroups, based on AKI stage, AKI duration, and clinical setting. This highlights the need to develop tailored strategies to promptly recognize kidney function decline post-AKI and initiate kidney protective measures.

### Raising awareness of acute kidney injury: a global perspective of a silent killer [^1124N7BV]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Worldwide, acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with poor patient outcomes. Over the last few years, collaborative efforts, enabled by a common definition of AKI, have provided a description of the epidemiology, natural history, and outcomes of this disease and improved our understanding of the pathophysiology. There is increased recognition that AKI is encountered in multiple settings and in all age groups, and that its course and outcomes are influenced by the severity and duration of the event. The effect of AKI on an individual patient and the resulting societal burden that ensues from the long-term effects of the disease, including development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is attracting increasing scrutiny. There is evidence of marked variation in the management of AKI, which is, to a large extent, due to a lack of awareness and an absence of standards for prevention, early recognition, and intervention. These emerging data point to an urgent need for a global effort to highlight that AKI is preventable, its course is modifiable, and its treatment can improve outcomes. In this article, we provide a framework of reference and propose specific strategies to raise awareness of AKI globally, with the goal to ultimately improve outcomes from this devastating disease.

### Recovery dynamics and prognosis after dialysis for acute kidney injury… [^112Lq9Ut]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eTable 14. Specificity Analysis for Risk of 3 Independent Events, Appendicitis, Traffic Accident, and Deafness Among Different Post-AKI CKD Stages Data Sharing Statement AKD indicates acute kidney disease; AKI-D, dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury; KRT, kidney replacement therapy; and SCr, serum creatinine. aAn SCr measurement within 90 days of discharge denotes the mean value of all SCr measurements taken within 90 to 135 days after discharge. Question Are baseline kidney function, acute kidney disease severity, and post-AKD kidney function associated with adverse outcomes in patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. Findings In this cohort study with 6703 participants, baseline kidney function and post-AKD kidney function were significant independent factors associated with all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiac events, end-stage kidney disease, and readmission in patients with AKI-D.

Worse post-AKD kidney function was associated with a progressive increase in the risk of adverse outcomes; however, AKD severity was not associated with adverse outcomes. Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease are conceptually interconnected syndromes. 1 In the literature, CKD is a recognized risk factor for AKI, and the presence or absence of CKD before an episode of AKI affects the prognosis after AKI. 2 In addition. postepisode CKD has been used as a surrogate end point for subsequent end-stage kidney disease and mortality in patients with AKI. 3, 4 Acute kidney disease is an intermediate stage between AKI and CKD and is defined as acute or subacute damage and/or loss of kidney function for a duration of 7 to 90 days after an AKI episode.

5, 6 Unlike AKI and CKD, which have well-established definitions in clinical practice and public health, AKD is a relatively novel entity, 1 and the association between the severity of AKD and outcomes is currently unclear. Nearly half of the patients with AKI-D in this study returned to their initial CKD stage after AKD. A significant observation from our data is that almost 50% of patients with AKI-D died within 90 days after discharge. Among these patients, approximately 37% died during their hospitalization, while the remaining 12% died within 90 days after discharge.

### Preventing acute kidney injury and its longer-term impact in the critically ill [^115qH4S2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous syndrome that not only affects short-term morbidity and mortality but also influences long-term outcomes. AKI is part of acute kidney disease (AKD) that encompasses a range of different conditions and is characterized by a kidney dysfunction lasting 90 days or less after which time the term chronic kidney disease (CKD) applies. AKD may result in irreversible loss of nephrons and may lead to CKD. In this narrative review, an update on different aspects of AKI in critically ill patients will be provided. We discuss biomarkers for early diagnosis of AKI, sub-clinical AKI, as well as AKI-AKD-CKD transition. In addition, various strategies to prevent the development of AKI, including the application of amino acids, remote-ischemic preconditioning, hemoadsorption, and a kidney prevention strategy, will be discussed. Finally, the choice of adequate endpoints for AKI prevention trials will be addressed.

"Take home message".

AKI and even subclinical AKI impact short- and long-term outcome and therefore, prevention of kidney injury is of utmost importance. As several strategies have been proven to be effective in preventing the development of AKI, these therapies should be implemented in daily practice to improve patient outcomes.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury [^113r9Fsq]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of critical illness and carries a significant risk of short- and long-term mortality, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular events. The degree of renal recovery from AKI may substantially affect these long-term endpoints. Therefore maximising recovery of renal function should be the goal of any AKI prevention and treatment strategy. Defining renal recovery is far from straightforward due in part to the limitations of the tests available to assess renal function. Here, we discuss common pitfalls in the evaluation of renal recovery and provide suggestions for improved assessment in the future. We review the epidemiology of renal recovery and of the association between AKI and the development of CKD. Finally, we stress the importance of post-discharge follow-up of AKI patients and make suggestions for its incorporation into clinical practice. Summary key points are that risk factors for non-recovery of AKI are age, CKD, comorbidity, higher severity of AKI and acute disease scores. Second, AKI and CKD are mutually related and seem to have a common denominator. Third, despite its limitations full recovery of AKI may best be defined as the absence of AKI criteria, and partial recovery as a fall in AKI stage. Fourth, after an episode of AKI, serial follow-up measurements of serum creatinine and proteinuria are warranted to diagnose renal impairment and prevent further progression. Measures to promote recovery are similar to those preventing renal harm. Specific interventions promoting repair are still experimental.

### Trends in hospitalizations for acute kidney injury-United States, 2000–2014 [^111pc4Gq]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury increases the risk of developing or exacerbating underlying chronic kidney disease (gradual loss of kidney function over time). National health (Healthy People 2020;) objectives call for renal evaluation of patients hospitalized for acute kidney injury 6 months after discharge to monitor kidney function and prevent or delay onset of chronic kidney disease. CDC's Chronic Kidney Disease Surveillance System monitors the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and its risk factors (including acute kidney injury) in the U.S. population and tracks progress in its prevention, management, and control.

Improving both patient and provider awareness that diabetes, hypertension, and advancing age are frequently associated with acute kidney injury is important for reversing these trends. Elderly persons have physiologically reduced kidney function and functional reserve with the appearance of global sclerosis, but also more comorbidity than do young adults, all of which heighten older persons' susceptibility to nephrotoxic medicines, dyes used for imaging, and even dehydration, all preventable risks for acute kidney injury. Better recognition of risk factors for acute kidney injury by health care providers might improve the effectiveness of treatment of underlying conditions and prevent or mitigate additional kidney insult to patients, particularly among those hospitalized or in long-term care.

Summary

### Recent developments in the detection and management of acute kidney injury [^111iTdAv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) can be defined as the abrupt loss of kidney function, leading to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and impaired control of acid-base, electrolyte and fluid balance. The term 'AKI' has replaced 'acute renal failure' as it emphasises that renal dysfunction encompasses a spectrum of disease severity, rather than a single discrete entity. AKI is a common problem in children admitted to hospital, especially among those requiring intensive care, and it is an independent risk factor for increased mortality and severe morbidity. In addition there are few long-term studies that have assessed the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children who experience an episode of AKI. In one follow-up study of children admitted to intensive care in Canada, 46.8% were identified as being at risk of CKD between 1 year and 3 years after an episode of AKI. Here we review the recent progress in identifying early AKI biomarkers to improve detection; we describe key aspects of managing AKI in children and we highlight areas for future development.

### Overcoming barriers in the design and implementation of clinical trials for acute kidney injury: a report from the 2020 kidney disease clinical trialists meeting [^117TNnge]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a growing epidemic and is independently associated with increased risk of death, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular events. Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) in this domain are notoriously challenging and many clinical studies in AKI have yielded inconclusive findings. Underlying this conundrum is the inherent heterogeneity of AKI in its etiology, presentation and course. AKI is best understood as a syndrome and identification of AKI subphenotypes is needed to elucidate the disease's myriad etiologies and to tailor effective prevention and treatment strategies. Conventional RCTs are logistically cumbersome and often feature highly selected patient populations that limit external generalizability and thus alternative trial designs should be considered when appropriate. In this narrative review of recent developments in AKI trials based on the Kidney Disease Clinical Trialists (KDCT) 2020 meeting, we discuss barriers to and strategies for improved design and implementation of clinical trials for AKI patients, including predictive and prognostic enrichment techniques, the use of pragmatic trials and adaptive trials.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^115z8HhV]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients who progress to stage 2 AKI, adjusting drug dosages to account for glomerular filtration and careful attention to volume input or output become important. Stage 3 AKI is associated with acid–base imbalance, altered electrolyte levels, and accumulation of uremic toxins. Decisions on the need for intensive care and initiation of kidney replacement therapy require expertise in nephrology or critical care medicine and should be considered early in disease progression.

Phase of care, monitoring, and follow-up can vary greatly depending on the severity of disease. The KDIGO clinical practice guidelines recommend that all patients diagnosed with AKI are evaluated at 3 months to screen for new or progressive chronic kidney disease, while the Acute Disease Quality Initiative and PeriOperative Quality Initiative recommend all postoperative patients with AKI or acute kidney disease have a kidney health assessment within 30 days of hospital discharge. As morbidity and mortality increase with severity of AKI (and in patients without renal recovery), these factors should inform the frequency and nature of follow-up. Management of AKI during the period of inpatient hospitalization provides an opportunity to prevent or delay progression of AKI to chronic kidney disease. Patients requiring acute renal replacement therapy (or necessitate continuous renal replacement therapy due to hemodynamic instability) should be managed in the ICU. Furthermore, a variety of critical conditions associated with AKI including shock, sepsis, acid–base imbalance, and respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload require intensive care. The KDIGO management guidelines recommend considering ICU admission beginning at stage 2 AKI.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^112iLPxP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDIGO/KDOQI AKI definition, staging, and performance measures — the definition and staging system provides an important tool for epidemiologic studies and trial design, but there is insufficient validation for its use in diagnosis and clinical management, and we do not believe that there are sufficient data to support use of the stage-based management approach; rather, management of patients with AKI should be based on assessment of overall clinical status; although AKI is an important risk factor for CKD, the majority of patients with mild, readily reversible AKI are at relatively low risk of progressive CKD; from a U.S. public health standpoint, follow-up should be targeted to the highest risk populations; the KDIGO recommendations for definition and staging of adult AKI should not be used for the development of clinical performance measures, and administrative coding for AKI should not be based solely on this definition and staging system.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^116ktjfg]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of CKD chronicity and cause — KDIGO 2012 recommendation 1.4.1.1 advises that in people with GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (GFR categories G3a-G5) or markers of kidney damage, review past history and previous measurements to determine duration of kidney disease (Not Graded); if duration is > 3 months, CKD is confirmed, whereas if duration is not > 3 months or unclear, CKD is not confirmed and patients may have CKD or acute kidney diseases (including AKI) or both and tests should be repeated accordingly; additionally, evaluate the clinical context, including personal and family history, social and environmental factors, medications, physical examination, laboratory measures, imaging, and pathologic diagnosis to determine the causes of kidney disease (Not Graded).

### Acute kidney injury: global health alert [^115BhpEW]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, and increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians and other healthcare professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

### Promoting kidney function recovery in patients with AKI requiring RRT [^117RbBZb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

AKI requiring RRT is associated with high mortality, morbidity, and long-term consequences, including CKD and ESRD. Many patients never recover kidney function; in others, kidney function improves over a period of many weeks or months. Methodologic constraints of the available literature limit our understanding of the recovery process and hamper adequate intervention. Current management strategies have focused on acute care and short-term mortality, but new data indicate that long-term consequences of AKI requiring RRT are substantial. Promotion of kidney function recovery is a neglected focus of research and intervention. This lack of emphasis on recovery is illustrated by the relative paucity of research in this area and by the lack of demonstrated effective management strategies. In this article the epidemiologic implications of kidney recovery after AKI requiring RRT are discussed, the available literature and its methodologic constraints are reviewed, and strategies to improve the understanding of factors that affect kidney function recovery are proposed. Measures to promote kidney function recovery are a serious unmet need, with a great potential to improve short- and long-term patient outcomes.

### Timing of dialysis initiation in acute kidney injury and acute-on-chronic renal failure [^1129jrwE]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

The decision to provide dialytic support and choosing the ideal moment to initiate therapy are common impasses for physicians treating patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been extensively used in clinical practice for more than 30 years, there is a paucity of evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal utilization of RRT in AKI. In the absence of traditional or urgent indications, there is no consensus on whether dialysis should be offered and when it should be started. The lack of agreed-upon parameters to guide the decision, the fear of the risk of the procedure, and the possible contribution to worse prognosis with RRT have resulted in a considerable variation in practice among physicians and centers. In this review, we summarize the evidence evaluating time of initiation of RRT and discuss possible approaches for future trials in addressing this issue.

### Incidence and prognosis of acute kidney diseases and disorders using an integrated approach to laboratory measurements in a universal health care system [^113RrLYN]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do the acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) criteria from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines identify patients who do not meet existing criteria for chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI), and what is the prognosis of these patients?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1.1 million Canadian residents, AKD criteria identified many patients who did not meet existing criteria for CKD or AKI, and patients with AKD without AKI had overall modestly increased risks of incident and progressive CKD, end-stage kidney disease, and death.

Meaning

The incorporation of AKD into clinical and research initiatives for kidney disease would increase recognition of patients at risk of adverse outcomes who are not identified by current AKI and CKD criteria; however, the clinical importance of AKD remains to be determined.

1.3. Further follow-up of AKI

1.3.1 Assess patients 2 months after AKI to evaluate the completeness of resolution, the detection of new onset CKD or worsening of pre-existing CKD. (1C)

Rationale

Observations in recently published epidemiological studies show that in a considerable number of patients who survive the acute clinical condition, CKD develops or worsens. Thus, management of patients should extend even beyond the condition of AKI, and should include monitoring for new-onset CKD. Although the follow-up interval after which an assessment should occur is a matter of clinical judgement, we feel that in high-risk in-patients kidney function should be re-assessed not later than 2 months after hospital discharge. Patients should be managed according to appropriate guidelines if CKD is detected.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1164os86]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline suggested initiating RRT emergently in the presence of life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance. Since 2012, data from several RCTs and observational studies have become available. However, the optimal timing for acute RRT remains unknown. It has been proposed that initiation of RRT should be considered when metabolic and fluid demands exceed the kidney's capacity to meet them. – This concept acknowledges the dynamic nature of acute illness and stresses the importance of regular evaluation of the demand and renal capacity relationship. However, the exact methods for determining demand and capacity are unknown. Existing evidence does not support using biomarkers when deciding whether to initiate RRT. Use of a standardized FST can be considered in AKI, to further quantify the likelihood of AKI progression, and integrated into the spectrum of clinical information available when planning for and deciding to initiate RRT. In determining whether or not to start RRT, risk of complications, global prognosis, potential for recovery, and patient preferences should be considered (Figure 3). Although some regions of the globe have challenges and constraints in providing universal access to RRT, we recommend a similar approach be undertaken for considering for whom and when to start RRT in all regions. – Additionally, a similar approach should be undertaken in both intensive care unit and non–intensive care unit settings.

### Predicting progression to chronic kidney disease after recovery from acute kidney injury [^113Q7XTC]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and subsequent risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) development. The discussion focuses on patients who fully recover from an episode of AKI, the majority of whom do not receive follow-up care with nephrology services.

Recent Findings

Several studies have demonstrated a strong association between AKI and later CKD risk. Animal models provide evidence for a causal link between AKI and CKD while also elucidating some of the potential mechanisms for this progression. Large observational studies have quantified the risk of CKD following AKI recovery, and clinical and emerging biomarker risk factors have been identified.

Summary

The association between AKI with incomplete recovery or nonrecovery and CKD is evident. Recent studies demonstrate that even AKI with apparent full recovery confers an increased risk for subsequent CKD development. Risk prediction models have been developed and require further refinement and validation. The ability to identify patients with AKI recovery who are at high risk for later CKD development is an important clinical and research goal, as there exists a significant opportunity to improve care in this population.

### Subphenotypes in acute kidney injury: a narrative review [^112tyqrv]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Concept of subphenotypes

Among critically ill patients, several syndromic diagnoses (or phenotypes) are recognized, such as AKI, ARDS, sepsis, and delirium. These diagnoses encompass a wide variety of distinct clinical features, varying pathophysiology, etiology, risk factors and clinical course, and finally, very different short- and long-term outcomes. A subphenotype is a distinct group of patients within a phenotype such as AKI who share common features, risk factors, biomarker positivity, response to treatment, or outcomes that separates this subphenotype from other groups of patients within the phenotype. Thus, multiple ways to classify patients into subphenotypes exist (Fig. 1). Severity scoring according to clinical features (such as magnitude of creatinine rise) into subgroups of differing outcomes (such as stage 1 to 3 AKI) has a long tradition in daily clinical practice. However, classifying patients using multiple clinical variables and biomarkers to more specific biologic subphenotypes may better reflect the underlying pathophysiology, facilitate customized approaches to care, and ultimately find targeted therapies.

Fig. 1
Subphenotypes in acute kidney injury. AKI; acute kidney injury, CKD; chronic kidney disease, ICU; intensive care unit, KRT; kidney replacement therapy

Regardless of the strategy used to subphenotype AKI, the overarching goal should remain the same: to cohort patients into groups with unique prognostic and/or therapeutic implications. Subgrouping patients in this manner is termed enrichment, a central tenet of precision medicine. A general schematic of how subphenotyping can facilitate prognostic enrichment (i.e. identifying patients likely to have a disease-related outcome of interest) and predictive enrichment (i.e. selecting patients more likely to respond to a given therapy on the basis of biology) to personalize AKI management is shown in Fig. 2.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^116uvW8Z]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterised by a rapid (hours to days) deterioration of kidney function. It is often diagnosed in the context of other acute illnesses and is particularly common in critically ill patients. The clinical consequences of AKI include the accumulation of waste products, electrolytes, and fluid, but also less obvious effects, including reduced immunity and dysfunction of non-renal organs (organ cross-talk).

The impact and prognosis of AKI vary considerably depending on the severity, clinical setting, comorbid factors, and also geographical location. There is increasing evidence that AKI is associated with serious short- and long-term complications, in particular increased mortality and morbidity, the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and high financial healthcare costs. As such, AKI is now recognized as a major public health problem.

Rapid diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic workup are essential to identify those types of AKI where specific therapies and interventions are available to reverse the injurious process within the kidneys. This review will summarise the key aspects of diagnosis and diagnostic work-up with particular focus on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1171wmis]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

KDOQI/KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and staging are summarized with NKF-KDOQI defining CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function regardless of cause or specific clinical presentation and proposing a staging system based on the level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The conceptual model highlights the clinical value of early identification and management of patients with CKD and has promoted broad-based reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by clinical laboratories to maximize detection of occult CKD. Analyses informing the KDIGO update demonstrated that GFR and albuminuria are independent and complementary predictors of important clinical outcomes, including CKD progression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. The specific goals of the KDIGO CKD guideline update were to clarify the definition and classification of the presence of CKD and to develop a risk classification system of CKD based on evidence. The primary recommendations were to retain KDIGO's use of GFR as the principal basis for staging CKD, but to augment the staging scheme by incorporating the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria in addition to level of GFR. The KDIGO guideline update contains a discussion of CKD progression, recommendations regarding referral to nephrologists, and management of the complications of CKD.

### Designing acute kidney injury clinical trials [^115HcEFq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical condition with various causes and is associated with increased mortality. Despite advances in supportive care, AKI increases not only the risk of premature death compared with the general population but also the risk of developing chronic kidney disease and progressing towards kidney failure. Currently, no specific therapy exists for preventing or treating AKI other than mitigating further injury and supportive care. To address this unmet need, novel therapeutic interventions targeting the underlying pathophysiology must be developed. New and well-designed clinical trials with appropriate end points must be subsequently designed and implemented to test the efficacy of such new interventions. Herein, we discuss predictive and prognostic enrichment strategies for patient selection, as well as primary and secondary end points that can be used in different clinical trial designs (specifically, prevention and treatment trials) to evaluate novel interventions and improve the outcomes of patients at a high risk of AKI or with established AKI.

RRT long-term outcomes and follow-up

Choice of RRT modality and impact on recovery.

The selection of RRT modality does not appear to have a major impact on recovery of kidney function. – Selection of modality of RRT should therefore be based on shared decision-making, local expertise, logistic factors, and patient characteristics. Estimated GFR in conjunction with major adverse kidney events has been used for medium- and long-term assessment but has several limitations. There is uncertainty about the best way to measure renal recovery after RRT in both the short- and medium-term. However, proteinuria is associated with worse long-term outcomes and is easy to measure.

Assessment of kidney function for renal recovery.

In addition to the development of CKD, patient-centered outcomes (quality of life, functional recovery), along with patient experience after AKI, should be a priority and need to be assessed. Post-AKI proteinuria is associated with future loss of kidney function and is regarded as a valuable risk-stratification tool in the post-AKI period. –

Optimal follow-up for AKI patients following RRT

Shared decision-making and communication among caregivers, the patient, and family members is crucial to patient recovery. Patients recovering from critical illness and AKI are often discharged to rehabilitation/skilled nursing facilities and need close monitoring to ensure adequate overall recovery to a baseline state of health and well-being. Such patients should receive multidisciplinary, recovery-focused care. Patients with AKI who continue to require RRT at hospital discharge often receive hemodialysis in outpatient dialysis facilities. Patients with congestive heart failure are less likely to recover kidney function. Higher ultrafiltration rates and more intradialytic hypotensive episodes are associated with higher risk of non-recovery of kidney function. To assess for renal recovery, hemodynamic status, intravascular volume, and urine output during dialysis should be carefully monitored.

Quality indicators for acute RRT

The importance of measuring and monitoring the quality of acute RRT provided to critically ill patients with AKI, including the optimal "benchmarking" for acute RRT programs, is receiving great attention. Quality of acute RRT should be monitored to ensure the effective and safe delivery of care. At a minimum, institutions and programs providing RRT should integrate, monitor, and report quality and outcome indicators across all forms of acute RRT therapies. These outcome measures should comprise a variety of metrics that incorporate patient survival, patient-centered acute RRT outcomes, safety, AKI survivor–related outcomes, and patient experience. Quality indicators should include shared goals that are patient- and clinically centered.

### Contrast-induced acute kidney injury and renal support for acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 2) [^111FECn1]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever international multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. Two topics, contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy, deserve special attention because of the frequency in which they are encountered and the availability of evidence. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided. This review is an abridged version of the guideline and provides additional rationale and commentary for those recommendation statements that most directly impact the practice of critical care.

The study STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) was published by Sean M Bagshaw and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Intensive Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease and Acute kidney injury. In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of RRT initiation strategy in patients with and without CKD? In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the population was: 1121 patients (353 female, 768 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with documented pre-existing eGFR data prior to hospitalization. The key exclusion criteria were eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m². In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the interventions were: n = 689 RRT for patients with CKD (eGFR ≤ 59 mL/min/1.73 m²) n = 432 RRT for patients without CKD (eGFR > 59 mL/min/1.73 m²). In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from all causes at day 90 (47.2% vs. 39.5%; aOR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.41). In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in RRT dependence at day 90 (13.7% vs. 7.7%; aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.43) No significant difference in RRT-free days at day 90 (39.7 days vs. 47.9 days; MD -3.24, 95% CI -8.3 to 1.82) No significant difference in death in the hospital (40.6% vs. 35.6%; OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.37). In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the conclusion was: in patients with documented pre-existing eGFR data prior to hospitalization, RRT for patients with CKD was not superior to RRT for patients without CKD with respect to death from all causes at day 90.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^116g6S8T]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Although much of the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline remains state of the art, advances over the past decade have improved our understanding of best practices. Many of these advances are widely accepted (e.g. nephrotoxic medication stewardship, shared decision making for RRT), but others are more controversial (Table 5). Although some centers and specific programs have embraced new technologies and ways of thinking, others have taken a more conservative, or "wait-and-see" approach. Even among conference participants, there was lack of unanimity for various perspectives, and obvious practice variation continues to exist, even among experts. Perhaps more than any new trial or discovery, this fact provides ample rationale for revisiting the AKI guideline in the near future.

### Role of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and management of kidney disease: applications to chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury [^111gqH8P]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are global public health problems associated with a significant burden of morbidity, healthcare resource use, and all-cause mortality. This review explores recently published studies that take a machine learning approach to the diagnosis, management, and prognostication in patients with AKI or CKD.

Recent Findings

The release of novel therapeutics for CKD has highlighted the importance of accurately identifying patients at the highest risk of progression. Many models have been constructed with reasonable predictive accuracy but have not been extensively externally validated and peer reviewed. Similarly, machine learning models have been developed for prediction of AKI and have found sufficient accuracy. There are issues to implementing these models, however, with conflicting results with respect to the relationship between prediction of an AKI outcome and improvements in the occurrence of other adverse events, and in some circumstances potential harm.

Summary

Artificial intelligence models can help guide management of CKD and AKI, but it is important to ensure that they are broadly applicable and generalizable to various settings and associated with improved clinical decision-making and outcomes.

### Management of acute kidney injury: core curriculum 2018 [^1174XRkG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous disorder that is common in hospitalized patients and associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. When AKI is present, prompt workup of the underlying cause should be pursued, with specific attention to reversible causes. Measures to prevent AKI include optimization of volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Crystalloids are preferred over colloids for most patients, and hydroxyethyl starches should be avoided. Volume overload in the setting of AKI is associated with adverse outcomes, so attention should be paid to overall fluid balance. Currently there are no targeted pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of AKI. The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with AKI is unclear, but is an area of active investigation. Recent studies suggest that AKI is not a "self-limited" process, but is strongly linked to increased risk for chronic kidney disease, subsequent AKI, and future mortality.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^116EsTzW]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

ASN Kidney Health Guidance — AKI-D recovery prognosis and individualized management notes that outpatient recovery of kidney function ranges from 20% to 60% of patients and that at 6 months after discharge, 31% of patients with AKI-D achieved dialysis independence. Baseline kidney function is identified as the strongest predictive factor, and even among stage 4 CKD (chronic kidney disease), up to 20%–30% of patients will experience recovery. Because of poor predictive accuracy, it is appropriate to err on the side of assuming that most patients will recover, and therefore, all patients should initially receive AKI-D–specific individualized care; for patients with a high likelihood of recovery of kidney function, it is appropriate to maintain this approach for at least 90 days after discharge. Conversely, for patients with low likelihood for recovery, earlier designation of ESRD (end-stage renal disease) diagnosis may be appropriate, and for those with significant comorbidities, nephrologists should facilitate shared goals-of-care discussions, including advanced care planning and palliative care options.

### Outcomes associated with acute kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116SyDvJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Different from acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), which have well-established definitions in clinical practice and public health, acute kidney disease (AKD) is a relatively novel entity. According to the latest KDIGO consensus, AKD defines abnormalities of kidney function and/or kidney structure with implications for kidney health last for 7–90 days.

In clinical practice, AKD is common among patients in the universal health system, but most of the patients with AKD are not routinely recognized by the current care system. AKD plays a critical role in linking patients to subsequent kidney damage and other adverse events. AKD may occur in a patient without known prior AKI. According to KDIGO consensus conference", kidney disease and disorder "are used to describe abnormalities of kidney function and/or structure. And AKD and CKD are harmonized under kidney disease and distinguished by duration. On the other hand, "acute" means a condition of recent or sudden onset which is short-lived and reversible. AKD may include AKI, but, more important, also includes abnormalities in kidney function that are not as severe as AKI or that develop over a period of > 7 days. Recent data suggest AKD without prior AKI is common and that, like AKI, is associated with higher risks of mortality and progression to CKD.

Nevertheless, previous studies mainly focus on AKD following AKI and confirm that AKD following AKI is associated with increased risks of both mortality and incident CKD. Only a few studies illustrated AKD without prior AKI and its related outcomes. And there remains a gap in clinical care and treatment for patients with AKD, even those without prior AKI.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical outcomes, including incident CKD, progressive CKD, new-onset end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and all-cause mortality of patients with AKD.

### Early-invasive strategies for the management of coronary heart disease in chronic kidney disease: is acute kidney injury a consideration? [^11258D9X]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are less likely to receive early-invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The purpose of this article is to review the risks and outcomes of early-invasive versus conservative strategies, and to consider how contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) should factor in treatment decisions for people with CKD.

Recent Findings

Numerous observational studies have characterized the prognostic importance of CI-AKI. However, recent studies illustrate that compared to the risk of AKI in individuals treated conservatively, the additional risk of kidney injury associated with invasive coronary procedures is relatively modest. Despite the risk of CI-AKI, early-invasive management of ACS has been associated with important long-term benefits.

Summary

These findings illustrate that the additional short-term risk of AKI associated with invasive management should be considered alongside long-term treatment effects on other clinical outcomes and should not act as a deterrent to their use. Strategies to increase the uptake of an invasive management approach, accompanied by the use of CI-AKI prevention strategies, could benefit high-risk individuals with CKD.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^114e5SHX]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

NOMENCLATURE AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

AKI-related definitions

AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly recognized as related entities representing a continuum of disease. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) 2002 guideline and the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline defined CKD as measured or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m², or the presence of markers of kidney damage (e.g. albuminuria) for > 90 days. The 2012 KDIGO guideline defined AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or fewer (Table 1). To complete the continuum, the 2012 guideline proposed the term acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) to define conditions of impaired kidney function not meeting the criteria for either AKI or CKD but having adverse outcomes and requiring clinical care. However, consensus on the exact criteria and indicators of severity is urgently needed.

Because the diagnosis of AKI should be tied to management decisions, and because changing disease definitions may have major implications for disease epidemiology, the case for revising the 2012 KDIGO definition of AKI should be strong before changes are proposed. Furthermore, in the context of an AKI guideline revision, several classification systems in addition to the stages of AKI should be rigorously defined. These relate to the distinctions among persistent, transient, relapsing, and recovered AKI; various etiologies of AKI; and community-onset versus hospital-onset AKI. In addition, there is emerging evidence that markers of structural kidney damage may be associated with clinically relevant outcomes and therefore identify potentially actionable entities. For an AKI guideline revision, the evidence base should be reviewed to determine whether markers of kidney damage constitute risk factors for AKI, define a new entity (such as subclinical or preclinical AKI), or should be incorporated into the AKI definition. Finally, the future guideline should use nomenclature that is precise and patient-centered.

### Bidirectional relationships between acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease [^111vPPrr]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains one of the most potent predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI); however, recent epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a complex interplay between these two clinical entities. A growing body of evidence supports a bidirectional relationship: AKI leads to CKD, and the presence of CKD increases the risk of AKI. Additionally, several studies suggest that the presence of underlying CKD does modify the relation between AKI and adverse outcomes. In this article, we will review recent studies supporting the hypothesis that AKI leads to CKD and will explore the role of CKD as an effect modifier for AKI.

Recent Findings

A recent meta-analysis confirms the association between AKI and the development of CKD and end-stage renal disease. Patient survival and renal outcomes after AKI are influenced by the presence of underlying CKD. AKI survivors with complete recovery of renal function remain at elevated risk of developing de-novo CKD, which may influence long-term survival; however, recovery of kidney function after AKI is associated with better long-term survival and renal function.

Summary

Recent findings support a strong association between AKI and CKD. There is uncertainty as to whether this relationship is causal. CKD is an effect modifier in AKI.

Recent clinical studies indicate a strong link between AKI and progression of CKD. The increasing prevalence of AKI must compel the nephrology community to consider the long-term ramifications of this syndrome. Considerable gaps in knowledge exist regarding the connection between AKI and CKD. The 13th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative meeting entitled "Therapeutic Targets of Human Acute Kidney Injury: Harmonizing Human and Experimental Animal Acute Kidney Injury" convened in April of 2014 and assigned a working group to focus on issues related to progression after AKI. This article provides a summary of the key conclusions and recommendations of the group, including an emphasis on terminology related to injury and repair processes for both clinical and preclinical studies, elucidation of pathophysiologic alterations of AKI, identification of potential treatment strategies, identification of patients predisposed to progression, and potential management strategies.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury [^1145JMAQ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction: why focus on recovery?

While acute renal impairment is sometimes thought of as a relatively trivial insult defined purely by changes in serum creatinine, the introduction and subsequent acceptance of the concept of acute kidney injury (AKI) has gradually alerted critical care and nephrology clinicians to potential late complications in AKI survivors. It is well recognised that progressive or persistent impairment in renal function may occur following an episode of AKI, with the potential to progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with dialysis dependence. However, the outcome from an episode of AKI cannot simply be regarded as the binary administration for chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) or recovery. Several authors have highlighted the substantial risk of development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), short of ESKD which is in turn strongly associated with increased short- and long-term mortality. This association does not necessarily implicate causation but could also indicate a common underlying disease process (Fig. 1). The question thus arises 'What do we mean by renal recovery after AKI?' Furthermore, in the absence of an effective therapy to alter the acute course of established AKI, our current focus should be turned towards both AKI prevention and promotion of kidney repair in the recovery phase.

### Acute kidney disease and renal recovery: consensus report of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) 16 workgroup [^112VAtge]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to definitions, ADQI 2017 guidelines recommend to define recovery from acute kidney disease as a reduction in peak AKI stage and further refine by the change in serum creatinine level, GFR, biomarkers of injury or repair, and/or return of renal reserve.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

In the past, a myriad of definitions for acute renal failure and AKI existed in parallel, making comparison of results difficult. In the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI, definition and staging of AKI is based on a combination of the Risk, Injury, Failure; Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Both criteria rely on GFR, and its proxy serum creatinine, and urinary output as the most useful overall indices of acute changes of kidney function. Changes in serum creatinine concentration and/or urine output are used as surrogates for acute changes in kidney function. The recommended diagnostic criteria establish a solid ground for standardized AKI assessment and classification in everyday clinical practice as well as in research conditions. As such, ERBP considers them as a good starting point towards a more standardized approach to AKI definition and particularly for the assessment of the predictive power of AKI with respect to overall and renal outcome (staging of severity). However, ERBP wants to update and fine-tune the classification by specifically underscoring and more extensively clarifying (i) the need to use the first available (admission) serum creatinine in that episode as baseline creatinine; and (ii) draw attention to the fact that urinary volume should be expressed using ideal body weight rather than real body weight when calculating the urinary output in mL/min/kg. ERBP also felt that it was necessary to explicitly state that both criteria should be applied to classify patients. Indeed, after publication of the RIFLE criteria, it became rapidly apparent that different interpretations were still given to 'baseline creatinine', and that the urinary output criterion was either omitted, or calculated on 24-h urine output. For baseline creatinine, some authors suggested using an estimation of serum creatinine, by backward calculation from a presumed 'standard GFR' of 75 mL/min/1.73 m²; others suggested using the last known value. This concept of a 'universal baseline' clashes with the current epidemiology of AKI, where an important subpopulation do not start from 'normal renal function', but do already have underlying CKD. Siew et al. demonstrated that the use of the value at admission in the episode under consideration was best associated with risk. Also in the AKIN criteria, the intention is to use the evolution of serum creatinine relative to the first observed value in that episode. It was demonstrated that using admission creatinine rather than estimated creatinine from a presumed GFR of 75 mL/min improved the prediction of need for renal replacement therapy and mortality, and decreased misclassification. ERBP wants to stress that the use of estimated GFR (eGFR), using whatever formula, is obsolete in patients with AKI, as all these formulae presume that kidney function is stable, and markers of GFR are in steady state, which is of course contradictory with the fact that patients have AKI.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 1) [^111JD9cT]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever, international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. In this review we summarize key aspects of the guideline including definition and staging of AKI, as well as evaluation and nondialytic management. Contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy will be addressed in a separate review. Treatment recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided.

1.2: Risk assessment

1.2.1 We recommend that patients be stratified for risk of AKI according to their susceptibilities, especially pre-existing proteinuria and CKD, and exposures to nephrotoxic medication or interventions. (1C)

1.2.2 We recommend monitoring patients at increased risk for AKI with measurements of serum creatinine and urine output to detect AKI at an early stage. (Ungraded statement). Frequency and duration of monitoring should be planned based on patient risk and clinical course. (Ungraded statement).

1.2.3 We recommend developing and implementing pathways of care at the broader hospital level, in close collaboration with the other individual specialities, to achieve the above-mentioned targets. (Ungraded statement).

Rationale

Risk for AKI is increased by exposure to factors that cause AKI (e.g. nephrotoxic medication) or the presence of factors that increase susceptibility to AKI [e.g. dehydration, co-morbidities, and also pre-existing proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD)]. The interaction between susceptibility and the type and extent of exposure to insults determines the risk of AKI occurrence. Particularly in the hospital setting, the patient's susceptibility should be assessed on a regular basis and some factors modified or even avoided (e.g. administration of potentially nephrotoxic agents). ERBP wants to point out that in patients on dialysis, but with preserved diuresis, it can be of importance to follow-up this parameter after procedures with a risk of deterioration of residual renal function, as unnoticed loss of residual renal function is an important risk factor in this patient group.

As prevention is still the best 'treatment' of AKI, and as many cases of avoidable AKI do not occur in patients in the ICU or on the nephrology ward, but in general wards, ERBP stresses the importance of developing and implementing pathways of care to detect and monitor patients at risk of AKI outside nephrology units and ICUs. These pathways should be developed in collaboration with the different involved specialities, to address the specific needs and risks per particular patient group. Even if patients are only seen after having been exposed to a risk factor, they still should be assessed in order to identify those who are more likely to develop AKI, as well as those who will require closer monitoring and general supportive measures in order to avoid further injury.

### Chronic kidney disease-part 2: management and its complications [^114kP1bb]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the multifaceted aspects of kidney function, the management of CKD not only requires knowledge of kidney physiology and pathophysiology but also a keen understanding of how to diagnose, treat, and monitor the metabolic derangements and complications of reduced kidney function. In this article, we provide questions that cover a broad range of clinical scenarios that may test the clinical acumen of a kidney health professional. Each question starts with a brief clinical scenario to guide the reader. Questions are followed by a selection of answers. As in most clinical situations, a variety of tests and/or interventions may be appropriate. As knowledge on the management of kidney diseases and associated complications evolve, the optimal choice for these questions may also evolve.

### Chronic-on-acute kidney injury [^115TfKYV]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Although older teaching suggested that patients who survived an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI) had a benign course, recent studies have demonstrated that AKI is strongly associated with increased risk for development of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) and longer-term mortality. Much as we understand that CKD predisposes to the development of AKI, we must recognize that the relationship is bidirectional and that our patients with AKI are at risk for chronic-on-acute kidney disease.

### Chronic kidney disease following acute kidney injury-risk and outcomes [^1141L2BL]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

In the past two decades, a substantial increase in the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred in North America. This increase has coincided with an increase in the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which has exceeded that expected based upon the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In order to better understand the association between these conditions, there has been a proliferation of studies that have examined the risks of incident and progressive CKD following AKI. Animal studies have shown that failed differentiation of epithelial cells following renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury might lead to tubulointerstitial fibrosis, supporting a biological mechanism linking AKI and CKD. Strong and consistent associations between AKI and incident CKD, progression of CKD and incident ESRD have also been shown in epidemiological studies. In this Review, we summarize the wealth of available data on the relationship between AKI and CKD, and discuss the implications of these findings for the long-term clinical management of patients following AKI. We also identify areas of active investigation and future directions for research.

### Preventing acute kidney injury and its longer-term impact in the critically ill [^111mg36D]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden (within 7 days) loss of kidney function that is determined on the basis of reduced urinary output and/or increased serum creatinine levels. Acute kidney disease (AKD) includes a variety of acute and subacute kidney conditions, including AKI, lasting for up to 90 days. AKD can persist after incomplete resolution of an AKI episode or AKD can develop without ever meeting AKI criteria, for example, when kidney dysfunction evolves slowly. Kidney dysfunction lasting for > 3 months is referred to as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

As the diagnostic markers of AKI, serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output (UO), have poor sensitivity and specificity, it is possible that a healthy individual with transient volume depletion could fulfill the diagnostic criteria of AKI without having kidney injury or long-term health implications. Therefore, clinical judgement is required to diagnose AKI and consider the clinical context. AKI persisting despite volume repletion likely reflects structural damage to the kidney. Similarly, drugs that affect glomerular filtration may cause small changes in SCr levels that are not necessarily indicative of kidney injury.

AKI is a syndrome affecting 10–15% of hospitalized patients and more than 50% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. AKI can be caused by different etiologies and the large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Recent evidence demonstrates that the AKI burden extends beyond the acute phase with progression to CKD, recurrent episodes of AKI, increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and reduced long-term survival. Finding specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by the late diagnosis and the fact that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation. Existing animal models fail to recapitulate the complexity of human AKI, which is often multifactorial. In addition, many clinical trials do not enroll patients with the precise mechanisms and timing modeled in animal experiments thereby limiting translation. Therefore, the main focus lies on preventing AKI development and progression. Recently, several trials have identified measures to prevent the development of AKI in different settings.

In this narrative review, we discuss methods for early diagnosis of AKI, AKI-CKD transition, preventive strategies, as well as the choice of endpoints for AKI prevention trials. A discussion of other AKI etiologies (e.g. glomerulonephritis, vasculitis), AKI management and renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1162zsGX]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline on the classification and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). The guideline was derived from evidence available through February 2011. Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing AKI. In April of 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury with the following goals: determine best practices and areas of uncertainty in treating AKI; review key relevant literature published since the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline; address ongoing controversial issues; identify new topics or issues to be revisited for the next iteration of the KDIGO AKI guideline; and outline research needed to improve AKI management. Here, we present the findings of this conference and describe key areas that future guidelines may address.

The KDIGO guidelines for acute kidney injury (AKI) are designed to assist health-care providers around the world in managing patients with AKI. Clinical guidelines are intended to help the clinician make an informed decision based on review of the currently available evidence. Due to the generic nature of guidelines, it is sometimes difficult to translate a guideline for a particular individual patient who may have specific clinical circumstances. To illustrate this point, we have discussed the interpretation of the KDIGO guideline in patients who have subtleties in their clinical presentation, which may make treatment decisions less than straightforward.

### Chronic kidney disease after acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Z92XB]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury may increase the risk for chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. In an attempt to summarize the literature and provide more compelling evidence, we conducted a systematic review comparing the risk for CKD, ESRD, and death in patients with and without AKI. From electronic databases, web search engines, and bibliographies, 13 cohort studies were selected, evaluating long-term renal outcomes and non-renal outcomes in patients with AKI. The pooled incidence of CKD and ESRD were 25.8 per 100 person-years and 8.6 per 100 person-years, respectively. Patients with AKI had higher risks for developing CKD (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 8.8, 95% CI 3.1–25.5), ESRD (pooled adjusted HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.9–5.0), and mortality (pooled adjusted HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3–3.1) compared with patients without AKI. The relationship between AKI and CKD or ESRD was graded on the basis of the severity of AKI, and the effect size was dampened by decreased baseline glomerular filtration rate. Data were limited, but AKI was also independently associated with the risk for cardiovascular disease and congestive heart failure, but not with hospitalization for stroke or all-cause hospitalizations. Meta-regression did not identify any study-level factors that were associated with the risk for CKD or ESRD. Our review identifies AKI as an independent risk factor for CKD, ESRD, death, and other important non-renal outcomes.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^115bjeSL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

### Long-term outcome in ICU patients with acute kidney injury treated with renal replacement therapy: a prospective cohort study [^112Zxn7z]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent finding in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, with a prevalence of approximately 40–57% when defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. AKI treated with renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT) occurs in approximately 13% of ICU patients. It is associated with adverse outcomes such as increased length of stay, short- and long-term mortality, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In the past, AKI was considered a surrogate marker for severity of illness, and patient mortality was considered a consequence of the underlying disease. However, there is an abundance of epidemiological data demonstrating that AKI in itself leads to adverse outcomes. This is so for the most severe form of AKI, where patients are treated with RRT. In addition, small decreases in kidney function are associated with increased short-term mortality. Further, the prevalence of preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing among patients admitted to the ICU. CKD may lower the threshold for developing AKI, and acute-on-chronic kidney disease is associated with adverse outcomes. Further, even mild AKI may predispose patients to CKD, and thus it increases the risk of subsequent AKI events and finally ESRD. So, AKI can be considered both the cause and the consequence of CKD, and AKI and CKD therefore are considered interconnected and integrated syndromes.

The association of CKD with mortality remains a matter of debate. On one hand, a recent large registry study demonstrated an association of CKD and death. On the other hand, critically ill patients with AKI-RRT who had CKD were reported to have lower short-term mortality than those without preexisting CKD. Another factor that may impact long-term outcomes is modality of RRT. Observational studies suggest that continuous RRT (CRRT) is associated with better kidney outcomes, more specifically with less need for chronic dialysis. However, prospective randomized studies could not demonstrate a survival benefit of CRRT compared with intermittent therapies. Finally, optimal timing of initiation of RRT is unclear. RRT is initiated early in the absence of serious complications of AKI and may therefore have some advantages. The late and more conservative approach takes into account that some patients with severe AKI might recover kidney function spontaneously without starting RRT, thereby avoiding adverse events linked to RRT.

### Does AKI truly lead to CKD? [^117SW8xx]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been implicated as an independent risk factor for the development of CKD in recent observational studies. The presumption in the nephrology community is that this association represents a causal relationship. However, because of potential problems related to residual confounding (shared risk factors), ascertainment bias (sicker patients have more follow-up assessments), misclassification of exposure (problems with defining baseline kidney function and AKI representing a discrete event versus progression of renal disease), and misclassification of outcome (de novo CKD versus CKD progression), it is difficult to conclude with certainty that AKI is truly causal for CKD. In this review we highlight several of the Hill causality criteria to examine the existing evidence and point out the missing elements that preclude defining AKI as a cause of CKD in the general population. Only well-designed studies with rigorous assessment of kidney function in all participants (AKI and non-AKI) before and after the episode or hospitalization or randomized, controlled trials demonstrating that prevention or treatment of AKI reduces the incidence of subsequent CKD can clarify the causal nature of the AKI-CKD relationship.

### Acute kidney injury [^113LsPJo]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden loss of excretory kidney function. AKI is part of a range of conditions summarized as acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD), in which slow deterioration of kidney function or persistent kidney dysfunction is associated with an irreversible loss of kidney cells and nephrons, which can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). New biomarkers to identify injury before function loss await clinical implementation. AKI and AKD are a global concern. In low-income and middle-income countries, infections and hypovolaemic shock are the predominant causes of AKI. In high-income countries, AKI mostly occurs in elderly patients who are in hospital, and is related to sepsis, drugs or invasive procedures. Infection and trauma-related AKI and AKD are frequent in all regions. The large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. AKI management in critical care settings is challenging, including appropriate volume control, nephrotoxic drug management, and the timing and type of kidney support. Fluid and electrolyte management are essential. As AKI can be lethal, kidney replacement therapy is frequently required. AKI has a poor prognosis in critically ill patients. Long-term consequences of AKI and AKD include CKD and cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, prevention and early detection of AKI are essential.

### Are diuretics harmful in the management of acute kidney injury? [^113tQ7DQ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To assess the role of diuretics in acute kidney injury (AKI) and their effectiveness in preventing AKI, achieving fluid balance, and decreasing progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent Findings

Diuretics are associated with increased risk for AKI. The theoretical advantage of diuretic-induced preservation of renal medullary oxygenation to prevent AKI has not been proven. A higher cumulative diuretic dose during the dialysis period can cause hypotension and increase mortality in a dose-dependent manner. Data on the use of forced euvolemic diuresis to prevent AKI remains controversial. Positive fluid balance has emerged as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes. Post-AKI furosemide dose had a favorable effect on mortality due in part to the reduction of positive fluid balance. There are exciting experimental data suggesting that spironolactone may prevent AKI once an ischemic insult has occurred and thus prevent the progression to CKD.

Summary

Diuretics are ineffective and even detrimental in the prevention and treatment of AKI, and neither shorten the duration of AKI, nor reduce the need for renal replacement therapy. Diuretics have an important role in volume management in AKI, but they are not recommended for the prevention of AKI. There is increased emphasis on the prevention of progression of AKI to CKD.

### Acute kidney injury [^116gQkzx]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, heterogeneous, multifactorial condition, which is part of the overarching syndrome of acute kidney diseases and disorders. This condition's incidence highest in low-income and middle-income countries. In the short term, AKI is associated with increased mortality, an increased risk of complications, extended stays in hospital, and high health-care costs. Long-term complications include chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, cardiovascular morbidity, and an increased risk of death. Several strategies are available to prevent and treat AKI in specific clinical contexts. Otherwise, AKI care is primarily supportive, focused on treatment of the underlying cause, prevention of further injury, management of complications, and short-term renal replacement therapy in case of refractory complications. Evidence confirming that AKI subphenotyping is necessary to identify precision-oriented interventions is growing. Long-term follow-up of individuals recovered from AKI is recommended but the most effective models of care remain unclear.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^112ykkgR]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Appendix K — nephrotoxic agents and medication dose adjustments in chronic kidney disease (CKD) highlights the burden and organization of drug-induced kidney injury: In hospitalized acute kidney injury (AKI), approximately 1 in 5 episodes are medication-related, and during critical care approximately a third of patients receive multiple potentially nephrotoxic medications; in outpatients with stage G3-G5 CKD, approximately half use a potentially inappropriate medication. The kidney receives 20% of cardiac output and has a greater exposure to the risk of toxic drug effects than other organ systems. For risk framing, the KDIGO 2019 Controversies in Acute Kidney Injury model organizes drugs into two major categories by which they can cause harm: kidney dysfunction or kidney injury. Pharmacovigilance signals include that, per the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from 2019–2023, there were 77,000 reports of serious AKI suspected to be caused by a drug; seven of the top 10 suspect generic drugs were in the PPI class representing 86% of all reported cases of serious, drug-induced AKI, and global surveillance reports where the PPI class occupies 4 of 5 drugs suspected of causing nephrotoxicity. Clinically, the primary care provider must have a high degree of clinical suspicion of drugs may be causative when an acute decline in kidney function is detected, with cessation of the offending agent as the first step in reversing drug-induced AKI; patient knowledge of having CKD was associated with a protective effect, reducing exposure.

### Recent advances in acute kidney injury and its consequences and impact on chronic kidney disease [^114ZR7Ra]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a major unmet medical need and associates with high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Among survivors, long-term outcomes of AKI can include development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or progression of preexisting CKD. In this review, we focus on ongoing efforts by the AKI community to understand the human AKI to CKD continuum, with an emphasis on the cellular stress responses that underlie AKI and the maladaptive responses that persist in the acute-to-chronic phase. The emphasis is on work that has been published in the past year in this rapidly expanding field.

Recent Findings

Recent studies in preclinical models highlight the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction, cell death, and inflammation on the underlying pathogenesis of AKI. These pathogenic mechanisms can resolve with adaptive kidney repair but persist in maladaptive repair that leads to progressive chronic disease. The complexity and interconnections of these pathways involve cross-talk between the tubular epithelium, endothelium, and interstitial compartments.

Summary

Approaches which lessen or counteract these cellular responses represent novel strategies to prevent AKI and stop or slow down the progression to CKD.

### Acute kidney injury, acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease: challenges and research perspectives [^111PvcrG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are interconnected, with AKI often leading to CKD and vice versa. Despite research advances, their causal relationship in clinical settings remains unclear. Inflammation, oxidative stress, and maladaptive repair are key factors in AKI's progression to CKD. AKI episodes may hasten CKD progression, influenced by demographics, comorbidities, and treatment factors like blood pressure control. This underscores the need for careful management to prevent long-term damage. Prospective cohort studies addressing confounding factors are essential to understanding AKI's impact on CKD. These studies should use precise definitions and measurements to clarify causal pathways and risk factors. Investigating asymptomatic AKI in the general population and CKD patients could offer insights into progression mechanisms and prevention strategies. Understanding AKI-CKD interplay is crucial for developing interventions and improving outcomes, making it a scientific and public health priority.

### Acute kidney injury: an increasing global concern [^112XELTZ]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Despite an increasing incidence of acute kidney injury in both high-income and low-income countries and growing insight into the causes and mechanisms of disease, few preventive and therapeutic options exist. Even small acute changes in kidney function can result in short-term and long-term complications, including chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and death. Presence of more than one comorbidity results in high severity of illness scores in all medical settings. Development or progression of chronic kidney disease after one or more episode of acute kidney injury could have striking socioeconomic and public health outcomes for all countries. Concerted international action encompassing many medical disciplines is needed to aid early recognition and management of acute kidney injury.

### Acute kidney injury: what's the prognosis? [^116Mvdoq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common (especially during critical illness), increasing in incidence, and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease (RIFLE) classification currently provides a standardized estimate of incidence and outcomes from AKI. Despite advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of human AKI, our ability to assess kidney function is limited and functional impairment poorly correlates with structural injury to the kidneys. Emerging novel biomarkers are, however, likely to further enhance risk stratification, facilitate early diagnosis, enable early enrollment in therapeutic trials, and assess prognosis. Sepsis remains the leading cause of AKI among the critically ill and over the past few years insights into the pathogenesis of AKI in sepsis are beginning to shift attention from renal blood flow to inflammation-mediated organ injury. Emerging evidence suggests that survivors of AKI incur long-term risks for developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease compared with those without AKI. Despite decades of research, no specific therapy for AKI other than supportive care currently exists and further work is required to better understand the pathogenesis of AKI during critical illness and to develop novel treatments.

### Long-term risks of adverse kidney outcomes after acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114uJfKa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

AKI was associated with increased risks of kidney dysfunction (CKD incidence, CKD progression, KF, and major adverse kidney outcomes). Risks were heterogeneous between patient subgroups, based on AKI stage, AKI duration, and clinical setting. Yet even the lowest stage or shortest duration of AKI remained at higher risk for CKD incidence or progression. Insight into individual risks for adverse kidney outcomes are necessary to develop tailored follow-up strategies to timely recognize kidney function decline post-AKI and initiate kidney protective measures.

### Acute kidney injury: epidemiology, outcomes, complications, and therapeutic strategies [^115mnBcH]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common serious complications for all hospital admissions, with its incidence increasing among hospitalized patients, particularly those in the intensive care unit. Despite significant improvements in critical care and dialysis technology, AKI is associated with an increased risk of short- and long-term mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and dialysis dependence. These risks are particularly relevant for critically ill patients with AKI severe enough to require renal replacement therapy (RRT). No specific pharmacologic treatment has been established to treat AKI. Hence, the mainstay treatment for patients with AKI is RRT even though there are still several problematic issues regarding its use including RRT modality, dose, and timing. Recently, the impact of AKI on an increased risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or transplantation is attracting increased attention.

### Chronic kidney disease: an inherent risk factor for acute kidney injury? [^116qCukD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the prevalence of CKD in patients who have episodes of AKI. However, the high burden of comorbidities such as age, diabetes, peripheral vascular, cardiovascular, and liver disease accompanying CKD, and the difficulties of defining AKI in the setting of CKD make these observations difficult to interpret. These comorbidities not only could alter the course of AKI but also may be the driving force behind the epidemiologic association between CKD and AKI because of systemic changes and/or increased exposure to potential nephrotoxic risks. Here, we contend that studies suggesting that CKD is a risk factor for AKI may suffer from residual confounding and reflect an overall susceptibility to illness rather than biologic susceptibility of the kidney parenchyma to injury. In support of our argument, we discuss the clinical evidence from epidemiologic studies, and the knowledge obtained from animal models on the pathophysiology of AKI and CKD, demonstrating a preconditioning influence of the previously impaired kidneys against subsequent injury. We conclude that, under careful analysis, factors apart from the inherent pathophysiology of the diseased kidney may be responsible for the increased frequency of AKI in CKD patients, and the impact of CKD on the risk and severity of AKI needs further investigation. Moreover, certain elements in the pathophysiology of a previously injured kidney may, surprisingly, bear out to be protective against AKI.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a global problem affecting more than 10% of all hospitalized patients and approaching two-thirds of those admitted to intensive care units, with survival related not only to the severity, but also to the duration of renal dysfunction. Recent evidence suggests that two-thirds of patients with AKI resolve their renal dysfunction within 3–7 days whereas those who persist have dramatically reduced survival over the following year. Persistence of AKI is of grave importance in that it increases an individual's risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the consequences thereof. This link between AKI and CKD has been established over the last decade and specific recommendations for the management of patients with AKI have been proposed in order to potentially influence this transition. It follows that early identification of individuals at risk of persistent AKI would enable appropriate delivery of these proposed interventions, but also may identify individuals where newer therapies to attenuate AKI could be targeted.

Not only is persistence of AKI relevant to longer term outcomes, clinical decision-making is also critically affected by physician expectations surrounding renal recovery and the decision of when to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT). Currently this is almost totally dependent on clinical expectations as to the likelihood of recovery with no available diagnostics to aid this decision process. As such, significant controversy exists around the timing of RRT with studies showing that some patients can benefit from the earlier initiation of RRT, while other studies demonstrate that some individuals receive RRT who may not require such treatment as they will recover renal function soon. Early and reliable identification of those who will recover renal function may enable a more stratified approach to management, thus avoiding the incumbent risks of extracorporeal therapy.

Of equal or even greater importance is that the mechanisms responsible for recovery from AKI are incompletely understood. Recovery following AKI involves dedifferentiation and proliferation of viable cells which then re-epithelialize the nephron. Failure to regenerate lost cells results in a maladaptive repair and fibrosis. Key mechanisms and triggers for these processes are largely unknown.

In order to find potential markers for persistent AKI, both as candidates for diagnostic testing as well as potential drug targets, we tested novel candidate biomarkers in an international multi-center prospective study to predict persistence of AKI.

AKI, AKD and CKD as interconnected syndromes

AKI, AKD, and CKD often develop along a continuum (Fig. 2). Recent research has shed new light on their interconnections, challenging previous assumptions and highlighting the importance of comprehensive kidney health management both during and well beyond critical illness.

Fig. 2
AKI, AKD and CKD as interconnected and partly overlapping syndromes. Three pathways might lead to CKD: 1) AKI-AKD-CKD (solid lines) 2) AKI-CKD (dashed lines) 3) AKD-CKD (dotted lines). Acute kidney injury, AKI, acute kidney disease, AKD; chronic kidney injury, CKD

AKD describes acute or subacute damage and/or loss of kidney function for a duration up to 90 days. However, importantly, AKD can also occur without meeting AKI criteria if kidney function declines gradually.

As Table 3 shows, AKI, AKD and CKD can be diagnosed and classified as follows:
AKI is classified according to the KDIGO 2012 AKI criteria.
AKD with AKI.
AKD without AKI is classified according to SCr, GFR, and/or markers of structural damage (e.g. albuminuria) (KDIGO definition).
CKD is defined as a kidney impairment persisting for more than 90 days.

Table 3
Overview of AKI, AKD and CKD definitions

AKI acute kidney injury, AKD acute kidney disease, ACR Albumin to creatinine ratio, CKD chronic kidney disease, GFR glomerular filtration rate, SCr serum creatinine

Recent research from Canada and the UK has shed light on important findings regarding AKD: First, age- and sex-standardised incidence rates for AKD with or without AKI were similar; range from 134.3 to 162.4 events/10,000 person years. The 1-year mortality was also similar between patients with AKD with or without AKI. Second, AKD is associated with significant health risks: Patients with AKD face a higher risk of death compared to those without AKD and have an elevated risk of either developing CKD in previously healthy individuals or worsening existing CKD in those already diagnosed. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing and addressing AKD, even when it does not meet the criteria for AKI. The health implications of AKD appear to be similar to those of AKI, emphasizing the need for vigilance in kidney health monitoring during and after critical illness and management across a broader spectrum of kidney function changes besides AKI. An important limitation to this study, however, is that some patients identified with AKD without AKI may have had AKI that was not identified.

### Rationale and design of the kidney precision medicine project [^1127JDKq]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are common, heterogeneous, and morbid diseases. Mechanistic characterization of CKD and AKI in patients may facilitate a precision-medicine approach to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The Kidney Precision Medicine Project aims to ethically and safely obtain kidney biopsies from participants with CKD or AKI, create a reference kidney atlas, and characterize disease subgroups to stratify patients based on molecular features of disease, clinical characteristics, and associated outcomes. An additional aim is to identify critical cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies and preventive strategies. This project is a multicenter prospective cohort study of adults with CKD or AKI who undergo a protocol kidney biopsy for research purposes. This investigation focuses on kidney diseases that are most prevalent and therefore substantially burden the public health, including CKD attributed to diabetes or hypertension and AKI attributed to ischemic and toxic injuries. Reference kidney tissues (for example, living-donor kidney biopsies) will also be evaluated. Traditional and digital pathology will be combined with transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analysis of the kidney tissue as well as deep clinical phenotyping for supervised and unsupervised subgroup analysis and systems biology analysis. Participants will be followed prospectively for 10 years to ascertain clinical outcomes. Cell types, locations, and functions will be characterized in health and disease in an open, searchable, online kidney tissue atlas. All data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project will be made readily available for broad use by scientists, clinicians, and patients.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury and long-term outcomes: is time of the essence? [^112E4pER]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

After any illness, restoration to good health results from organ functional recovery that is dependent on the prior state of health, severity of illness, and the process of care. Although the severity stage can be delineated by the magnitude of structural and functional derangement at any point in time, quantifying recovery is often difficult, as it requires knowledge of the prior condition of the organ and ongoing interventions. The course of disease, with progression or improvement, consequently represents both the nature and extent of injury and repair, the associated comorbidities, and the management. Furthermore, the association of the extent of recovery with short-term and long-term outcomes requires accurate definitions and recognition of the events during and after the illness. In acute kidney injury (AKI), it is well recognized that the stage of AKI; associated comorbidities of diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD); and dialysis requirements are associated with adverse outcomes. More recently, attention has focused on the duration and number of episodes of AKI as factors associated with nonrecovery from AKI and short-term and long-term mortality. Most of these data have emerged from retrospective studies from postcardiac surgery and intensive care unit settings and have not been studied prospectively in other settings. Bhatraju et alstudied long-term major adverse kidney events (MAKE), including incidence or progression of CKD, death, or dialysis, in the prospective, multicenter Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae (ASSESS-AKI) cohort study. Patients with and without AKI who survived hospitalization for 3 months were enrolled and followed up for a median of 4.7 years. Patients with AKI were classified as having resolving AKI if their serum creatinine values decreased by 0.3 mg/dL or more (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4) or 25% or more from maximum within the first 72 hours after AKI diagnosis and as having nonresolving AKI if they failed to meet these criteria. Most patients (74%) had Stage 1 AKI, 9% had sepsis, 4% required mechanical ventilation, and less than 7% needed dialysis. Of the patients with AKI, 62% had a resolving pattern; 54% of these patients had returned to baseline creatinine concentration at hospital discharge and 51% returned to baseline creatinine concentration at 3 months, whereas only 16% of patients with nonresolving AKI had returned to baseline creatinine concentration at hospital discharge and 38% returned to baseline creatinine concentration at 3 months. Compared with patients with no AKI, those with resolving AKI had an almost 2-fold higher risk of MAKE and those with nonresolving AKI had an almost 3-fold higher risk of MAKE; these risks persisted when adjusted for underlying comorbidities and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage of AKI. Patients with nonresolving AKI had a higher rate of incident and progressive CKD. Patients with AKI had a higher mortality rate than those without AKI (22% vs 12%), but there were no differences between patients with resolving AKI and those with nonresolving AKI. Interestingly, the AKI severity stage did not differentiate the development of MAKE during the 4 years of follow-up.

NEPHROTOXIC AGENTS AND DRUGS THAT AFFECT KIDNEY FUNCTION

The use of drugs associated with kidney injury or dysfunction is common both in the hospital setting and in the community for patients with chronic illnesses such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and CKD. These drugs are often referred to as "nephrotoxic", although many of them lead to kidney dysfunction without direct glomerular or tubular cell damage. Furthermore, some drugs that may cause a rise in serum creatinine are actually reno-protective and associated with improved outcomes (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitorsin diabetic nephropathy). Although it would be ideal to propose a simple yet inclusive term to encompass the various mechanisms by which drugs interface with the kidney, meeting participants were unable to identify one. Thus, here the term "nephrotoxic drugs" is retained for consistency with the literature. A new classification should also encompass drugs that are not directly harmful to kidney function but are eliminated by the renal route, and where there is concern about harm from accumulation of parent drug or metabolites in the setting of AKI and AKD. Similarly, failure to increase drug doses and intervals in renal recovery or with enhanced elimination via extracorporeal clearance may lead to therapeutic failure.

In the past 10 years, significant progress has been made regarding susceptibility, management, and preventive strategies to avoid or ameliorate drug- and drug combination–associated kidney injury and dysfunction more broadly.

Overarching nephrotoxic medication management considerations are as follows:
Patients should receive potentially nephrotoxic medications only if needed and only for as long as needed.
Potentially nephrotoxic agents should not be withheld in life-threatening conditions, owing to concern for AKI, including i.v. contrast.
Kidney function must be monitored in patients who are exposed to agents that are associated with kidney injury or dysfunction, to limit the risk and progression of AKI and AKD.
Patients and clinicians need appropriate and effective education as to the potential for kidney injury and dysfunction from nephrotoxic agents.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury [^113KauGJ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

As the long-term ill effects of AKI are partially mediated through the development of CKD the management of these patients should follow general current well-developed clinical CKD guidelines. Treatment of hypertension and modification of cardiovascular risk factors are central to management of patients with or at risk of CKD. In patients with diabetes or proteinuria, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blocking agents should be first-line drugs for hypertension, as these may reduce proteinuria and the rate of progression of CKD. However, recurrent episodes of AKI are a concern, and any follow-up programme should address the prevention and early detection of new episodes of AKI, including the need for early assessment with new acute illness and advice regarding the avoidance of nephrotoxin exposure and adjustment of regular medication in the setting of illness.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a sudden decline in kidney function demonstrated by either a rise in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline levels occurring within a 7-day time period, or a sudden decrease in urine output. Globally, AKI occurs in 7–18% of patients in hospital, accounts for 50% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and is responsible for 2 million deaths per year. It is a complex condition with diffuse aetiologies resulting in both higher in-hospital and long-term mortality. It has been demonstrated that there is an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage kidney disease (ESKD) following AKI survival with the risk increasing in proportion to the severity of AKI. Despite being well recognised, the mechanism behind this increased risk is unknown, however AKI and CKD are now considered to be on a spectrum rather than as two separate entities. This post-AKI state, whereby impaired renal function persists for > 7 days but < 90 days (therefore not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of CKD) is referred to as acute kidney disease (AKD). This definition recognises the renal impairment that persists beyond the definition of AKI and prior to CKD. Furthermore, AKI can worsen underlying CKD; over 30% of patients suffer repeated episodes of AKI which in turn can further increase a patient's CKD and ESKD risk. It is estimated that CKD occurs in approximately 25% of AKI survivors. Not only is AKI a risk factor for CKD and ESKD but people who survive an episode are at an increased risk of developing non-renal conditions including congestive heart failure and cardiovascular disease. The average hospital stay of an AKI admission is 16 days. Therefore, AKI has a significant economic burden as it is estimated to cost the UK National Health Service (NHS) approximately £1.02 billion annually. However, as many as one in five cases of AKI are thought to be preventable. Therefore, with adequate measures to reduce AKI risk, effective monitoring of patients, and with the implementation of appropriate interventions, the NHS could save up to £200 million a year.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114R2JkN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology and outcomes — clinical burden — span multiple settings, and severe disease in critical illness is frequent and lethal; "severe AKI occurs in > 5% of critically ill patients and is associated with mortality rates of 40%-70%". Although "recovery of kidney function occurs in the majority of patients surviving an episode of AKI, many patients remain dialysis dependent or are left with severe renal impairment", and "even patients who have complete or near-complete recovery of kidney function are at increased risk of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD)" with superimposed AKI on CKD "associated with acceleration in the rate of progression to end-stage disease".

### Acute kidney injury: global health alert [^116639p6]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional, and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians, and other health-care professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

### Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease: an integrated clinical syndrome [^116BeyQa]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The previous conventional wisdom that survivors of acute kidney injury (AKI) tend to do well and fully recover renal function appears to be flawed. AKI can cause end-stage renal disease (ESRD) directly, and increase the risk of developing incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) and worsening of underlying CKD. In addition, severity, duration, and frequency of AKI appear to be important predictors of poor patient outcomes. CKD is an important risk factor for the development and ascertainment of AKI. Experimental data support the clinical observations and the bidirectional nature of the relationships between AKI and CKD. Reductions in renal mass and nephron number, vascular insufficiency, cell cycle disruption, and maladaptive repair mechanisms appear to be important modulators of progression in patients with and without coexistent CKD. Distinction between AKI and CKD may be artificial. Consideration should be given to the integrated clinical syndrome of diminished GFR, with acute and chronic stages, where spectrum of disease state and outcome is determined by host factors, including the balance of adaptive and maladaptive repair mechanisms over time. Physicians must provide long-term follow-up to patients with first episodes of AKI, even if they presented with normal renal function.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: an updated review on pathophysiology and management [^111LBP1H]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Long-term outcome following AKI

Several retrospective studies, mostly based on administrative databases, have shown that AKI, even after apparent full recovery, is associated with unfavorable long-term outcomes, including an increased risk of dying, occurrence of cardiovascular events and development of (or progression to) CKD. These findings were recently confirmed in a prospective cohort (ASSESS study) including hospital survivors at 3 months with or without AKI during hospitalization with a median of 4.7-year follow-up. The increased risk of death appears to prevail over the risk of new CKD. Main causes of mortality are cardiovascular events and cancer. Besides the expected risk factors (e.g. age, comorbidities, AKI severity), the recovery pattern of AKI also appears to be associated with long-term mortality.

Whether the association of AKI with long-term cardiovascular events is related to shared risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, pre-existing CKD), the increased incidence of CKD (a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease) or to a causal relationship has not been clearly established but evidence is accumulating that AKI itself may accelerate cardiovascular disease, likely related to AKI-induced remote organ injury and systemic inflammation (organ cross-talk). The pathophysiology is likely multifactorial. Galectin-3, a substance that induces cardiac inflammation, cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction may contribute. Activation of the RAAS after AKI has also been identified as a mediator of cardiovascular damage after AKI as Angiotensin II induces macrophage infiltration, cardiac inflammation and myocardial fibrosis ultimately leading to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. The risk of incident and progressive CKD has been shown in retrospective and prospective studies and can contribute to poor long-term outcomes. AKI is a risk factor for subsequent proteinuria, an independent predictor of adverse outcomes. Other risk factors for the AKI–CKD transition include duration and severity of kidney injury, older age and chronic health conditions, including baseline kidney function. The ASSESS study showed that patients with AKI lasting more than 72 h had a higher risk of CKD than those with resolving AKI and that proteinuria at 3 months was a strong predictor of further deterioration of kidney function. The mechanisms underlying the AKI–CKD transition are incompletely elucidated but thought to include maladaptive tubular repair, persistent microvascular damage and inflammation leading to fibrosis.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression — implementation considerations — emphasize that "It is important to differentiate between progression of chronic disease and acute injury", and that "small changes in GFR could be consistent with AKI, whereas only large changes in GFR would indicate progressive CKD", so "Clinicians will need to attend to other clinical indicators to be able to accurately identify the cause of changes in GFR". They also note that "Change in eGFR may be due to true change in GFR or due to changes in the non-GFR determinants of creatinine concentrations, including assay fluctuations", and that "Differentiating between these requires serial assessments and consideration of potential changes in the non-GFR determinants of creatinine". Finally, "Use of validated prediction models for progression of kidney disease may be able to incorporate numerous clinical factors and provide a single prognostic metric, which can guide decisions", and "Incorporation of such models into laboratory systems may facilitate their use".

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: an updated review on pathophysiology and management [^112cs4jN]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The availability of a consensus definition of acute kidney injury (AKI) has been an important step in establishing AKI epidemiology. AKI affects 30–60% of critically ill patients and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. Evidence is also accumulating that the burden of AKI extends beyond the acute phase with progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), increased risk of cardiovascular complications, recurrent episodes of AKI and long-term mortality. Prevention of development and/or progression is currently limited to hemodynamic and fluid status optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins. Search for a specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by the late diagnosis and the complex and incompletely elucidated pathophysiology. Progress in the management of AKI is to be expected from the recognition that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation.

In this narrative review, we discuss methods for early diagnosis of AKI, clinical phenotypes, pathophysiology, nephrotoxicity, optimal supportive management, as well as the importance of recovery and long-term follow-up. A discussion of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

### Acute kidney disease and renal recovery: consensus report of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) 16 workgroup [^117GUoAv]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

Consensus definitions have been reached for both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and these definitions are now routinely used in research and clinical practice. The KDIGO guideline defines AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or less, whereas CKD is defined by the persistence of kidney disease for a period of > 90 days. AKI and CKD are increasingly recognized as related entities and in some instances probably represent a continuum of the disease process. For patients in whom pathophysiologic processes are ongoing, the term acute kidney disease (AKD) has been proposed to define the course of disease after AKI; however, definitions of AKD and strategies for the management of patients with AKD are not currently available. In this consensus statement, the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) proposes definitions, staging criteria for AKD, and strategies for the management of affected patients. We also make recommendations for areas of future research, which aim to improve understanding of the underlying processes and improve outcomes for patients with AKD.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury [^1116SwRL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The acceptance of a unifying definition of AKI has increased awareness of the syndrome and generated much knowledge on morbidity and outcome. Less attention has been given to recovery from AKI. Despite many limitations, non-recovery of AKI is best defined as the presence of AKI criteria, and partial recovery as a fall in AKI stage. Both are associated with the development of CKD and cardiovascular diseases, need of chronic dialysis and mortality. The incidence of non-recovery differs between studies and populations. Risk factors include high age, CKD, comorbidity, higher severity of AKI and acute disease. After an episode of AKI serial follow-up measurements of serum creatinine and proteinuria are warranted to diagnose progressive renal impairment and implement measures to manage CKD if necessary.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^112TZHBx]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In response to the recently released 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI), the National Kidney Foundation organized a group of US experts in adult and pediatric AKI and critical care nephrology to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy in the context of current US clinical practice and concerns. The first portion of the KDIGO guideline attempts to harmonize earlier consensus definitions and staging criteria for AKI. While the expert panel thought that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials, the panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States. The panel generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI, although noting the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations and the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI.

### Harmonizing acute and chronic kidney disease definition and classification: report of a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^111proz3]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease is an important public health problem. Both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease have been well defined and classified, leading to improved research efforts and subsequent management strategies and recommendations. For those patients with abnormalities in kidney function and/or structure who meet neither the definition of AKI nor chronic kidney disease, there remains a gap in research, care, and guidance. The term acute kidney diseases and disorders, abbreviated to acute kidney disease (AKD), has been introduced as an important construct to address this. To expand and harmonize existing definitions and to ultimately better inform research and clinical care, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organized a consensus workshop. Multiple invitees from around the globe, representing both acute and chronic kidney disease researchers and experts, met virtually to examine existing data, and discuss key concepts related to AKD. Despite some remaining unresolved questions, conference attendees reached general consensus on the definition and classification of AKD, management strategies, and research priorities. AKD is defined by abnormalities of kidney function and/or structure with implications for health and with a duration of ≤ 3 months. AKD may include AKI, but, more importantly, also includes abnormalities in kidney function that are not as severe as AKI or that develop over a period of > 7 days. The cause(s) of AKD should be sought, and classification includes functional and structural parameters. Management of AKD is currently based on empirical considerations. A robust research agenda to enable refinement and validation of definitions and classification systems, and thus testing of interventions and strategies, is proposed.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — progression risk and contrast imaging: There is evidence to suggest that severe and repeated AKI in the setting of CKD could result in the progression of CKD, and studies of AKI in patients without CKD have repeatedly shown an association with increased risk of CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). These studies suggested that the impact of AKI on the risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is negligible. For contrast-enhanced studies in advanced CKD, since the risk of long-term harm associated with contrast-associated AKI is small, it is reasonable to proceed with the appropriate imaging studies to reduce delay in diagnosis or treatment.
