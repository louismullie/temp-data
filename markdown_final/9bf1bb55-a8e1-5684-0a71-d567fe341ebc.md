## Question

ADHD passive treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "passive treatment" means in ADHD and whether any such approaches are evidence-based or recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "passive treatment" in contrast to active, behaviorally demanding interventions. Then, I should verify which non-pharmacologic modalities actually qualify as passive and whether they have supportive evidence. Next, I will review guideline positions and the strength of evidence, including any RCTs or meta-analyses. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful bottom line and note safety, feasibility, and what to tell families when they ask about these options.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misclassify interventions. By "passive", I mean treatments that do not require the patient to actively practice skills, attend sessions, or engage in structured behavioral training, such as supplementation, neurofeedback, mindfulness-based recordings, or environmental modifications, in contrast to active therapies like parent training, CBT, or organizational skills coaching.

> Wait, let me verify which non-pharmacologic categories are typically described as passive or low-burden. Supplements such as omega-3 fatty acids and multinutrient blends, mindfulness-based interventions delivered via audio or app, neurofeedback or EEG-based attention training, and environmental or school-based accommodations are the main candidates that patients and families often consider "passive" relative to weekly therapy or daily behavioral practice requirements [^notfound] [^notfound] [^notfound] [^100c39e7].

> I will now examine the evidence for omega-3 fatty acids, since families frequently ask about "natural" options. The 2023 Lancet Child & Adolescent Health review concludes that polyunsaturated fatty acids show a consistent but modest effect on ADHD symptoms after at least 3 months, suggesting a small, clinically limited benefit that may be acceptable as an adjunct but should not replace first-line treatments [^0428b78b].

> Next, I should review mindfulness-based interventions. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some mindfulness programs are delivered actively in groups, but passive audio-guided mindfulness is common in practice. The 2025 systematic review indicates that mindfulness programs can yield modest reductions in ADHD symptoms, though heterogeneity and small samples limit certainty, and optimal duration and frequency remain unclear; thus, mindfulness may help some patients, but expectations should be modest and use should be coordinated with evidence-based care [^494acd20].

> Let me consider neurofeedback and related brain–computer interface approaches. A BCI-based attention training study reported improvements in parent-rated inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, but the sample was small, the design was not a high-quality RCT, and the field lacks robust, replicated trials; so, while biologically plausible, neurofeedback remains investigational and should not be considered a standard passive treatment at this time [^1638291e].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure I'm not overstating any claims. Contemporary pediatric guidelines emphasize behavioral parent training and classroom interventions as first-line for preschoolers and recommend combining medication with behavioral strategies for school-aged youth; they do not endorse passive modalities as standalone treatments, reflecting the weaker and inconsistent evidence base for supplements, mindfulness, and neurofeedback compared with active behavioral and pharmacologic therapies [^224d2cc6] [^613374ce] [^1f9b3e7a].

> But wait, what if passive approaches are being used as adjuncts within a broader plan? The WHO mhGAP guidance supports psychosocial interventions focused on social, cognitive, and organizational skills, which are active, while allowing that some families may pursue low-burden options; clinicians should counsel that passive treatments have, at best, modest effects and should not delay proven therapies, and that shared decision-making should include discussion of costs, burden, and uncertain benefit [^ff9fbbde] [^0428b78b].

> I should double-check safety and feasibility so recommendations are practical. Omega-3s are generally safe but can cause gastrointestinal upset; mindfulness has minimal adverse effects but requires consistent use; neurofeedback is noninvasive yet time-consuming and costly with limited access and uncertain durability; importantly, relying on passive treatments alone risks delaying effective care and may worsen long-term outcomes, so any passive approach should be framed as adjunctive and monitored for benefit [^0428b78b] [^1638291e] [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, clinically useful bottom line. Passive non-pharmacologic treatments for ADHD, such as omega-3 supplementation, mindfulness-based recordings, and neurofeedback, may confer small, variable benefits and can be considered adjuncts when families prefer low-burden options, but they are not substitutes for first-line behavioral and pharmacologic treatments; clinicians should document rationale, set expectations, and reassess functioning to avoid therapeutic drift away from evidence-based care [^0428b78b] [^224d2cc6] [^613374ce].

---

Passive treatments for ADHD are **non-pharmacological, low-effort interventions** that do not require active patient participation, such as environmental modifications, mindfulness-based approaches, and neurofeedback [^0428b78b] [^1638291e]. These treatments are best used as **adjuncts to standard care** (medication and behavioral therapy) rather than replacements, as evidence for their standalone efficacy is limited and generally weaker than for active treatments [^0428b78b] [^613374ce]. They may help reduce symptoms, improve functioning, or support adherence, but clinicians should set realistic expectations and monitor outcomes [^0428b78b] [^efe673ec].

---

## Definition and examples of passive treatments

Passive treatments are **interventions that require minimal or no active participation** from the patient, contrasting with active treatments like behavioral therapy or medication management. Examples include:

- **Environmental modifications**: Adjusting the physical or social environment to reduce distractions and improve focus (e.g. seating arrangements, noise reduction, structured routines) [^8e2c903d].

- **Mindfulness-based interventions**: Mindfulness meditation or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) delivered via recordings or minimal therapist contact [^notfound].

- **Neurofeedback**: EEG-based biofeedback training aimed at normalizing brainwave patterns associated with attention and impulse control [^1638291e].

- **Dietary supplements**: Omega-3 fatty acids and other nutritional supplements administered without structured behavioral components [^0428b78b].

---

## Evidence base for passive treatments

The evidence base for passive treatments in ADHD is **generally weaker than for active treatments**, with smaller effect sizes and less consistent replication. However, some passive interventions show modest benefits:

| **Treatment** | **Evidence summary** | **Effect size/clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Environmental modifications | Moderate evidence supports environmental adjustments (e.g. classroom seating, organizational tools) in improving focus and reducing distractions [^notfound]. | Small-to-moderate effects; clinically meaningful for some patients. |
| Mindfulness-based interventions | Limited but growing evidence suggests mindfulness can reduce ADHD symptoms and improve emotional regulation, though effects are modest and heterogeneous [^notfound]. | Small effects; may be useful adjuncts. |
| Neurofeedback | Mixed evidence; some studies report improvements in attention and impulse control, but methodological limitations and heterogeneity limit conclusions [^notfound]. | Small-to-moderate effects; promising but not definitive. |
| Omega-3 supplements | Consistent modest effects on ADHD symptoms, particularly inattention, when used for at least 3 months [^0428b78b]. | Small effects; may be considered for mild symptoms or as adjuncts. |

---

## Comparative effectiveness with active treatments

Active treatments — particularly stimulant medication and behavioral therapy — have **stronger and more consistent evidence** for reducing core ADHD symptoms and improving functioning [^7f920bd7] [^a3d80eb9]. Passive treatments are generally less effective than these first-line therapies but may offer additional benefits, especially for patients who cannot tolerate or refuse medication, or as adjuncts to reduce side effects or improve adherence [^0428b78b] [^09c0093e].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **multimodal treatment** — combining medication and behavioral interventions — and do not recommend passive treatments as standalone first-line options. Passive treatments may be considered as adjuncts, particularly when:

- Patients or families prefer non-pharmacological options.
- Medication is contraindicated or poorly tolerated.
- Adjunctive support is needed to improve functioning or adherence [^0428b78b] [^09c0093e].

---

## Patient adherence and engagement

Passive treatments may improve adherence due to their **low burden**, but engagement can still wane without structured support. Clinicians should provide education, set expectations, and monitor outcomes to sustain use and detect benefit [^efe673ec].

---

## Safety and side effects

Passive treatments are **generally safe**, with minimal adverse effects compared to medications. Omega-3s may cause mild gastrointestinal upset; mindfulness is well tolerated; and neurofeedback has no significant safety concerns reported, though access and cost can be barriers [^0428b78b] [^1638291e].

---

## Practical considerations for implementation

Clinicians should consider the following when recommending passive treatments:

- **Patient preferences**: Align choices with patient/family values and readiness [^e6ce8d0c].

- **Resource availability**: Ensure access to evidence-based passive options and monitor fidelity [^0428b78b].

- **Outcome monitoring**: Use standardized measures to track symptoms and functioning [^efe673ec].

- **Integration with active care**: Combine with medication and/or behavioral therapy when feasible [^1f9b3e7a].

---

Passive treatments for ADHD are **low-effort, non-pharmacological interventions** that may offer modest benefits as adjuncts to standard care. They are not replacements for evidence-based active treatments but can be useful for patients seeking additional support or unable to engage in more demanding therapies. Clinicians should individualize recommendations, monitor outcomes, and integrate passive treatments within a comprehensive, multimodal plan.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic disorder requiring developmentally sensitive interventions across the lifespan. Although pharmacotherapy traditionally has been considered the first-line treatment for ADHD, many individuals continue to experience significant functional impairment or choose not to pursue pharmacotherapy. Thus, evidence-based alternatives or adjuncts to pharmacologic treatment for individuals with ADHD are needed. Behavioral parent training and behavioral school interventions are the only empirically supported nonpharmacologic interventions for children and adolescents with ADHD. This article reviews recent additions to the ADHD literature, including evaluations of behavioral interventions in traditional clinical practice and schools, treatment efficacy for preschool-aged children and adults, and the investigation of a novel treatment for individuals with the predominantly inattentive subtype of ADHD.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing disorder affecting children, adolescents, and adults. Several treatment strategies are available that can successfully ameliorate symptoms, ranging from pharmacological to dietary interventions. Due to the increasing range of available options, an informed selection or prioritization of treatments is becoming harder for clinicians. This review aims to provide an evidence-based appraisal of the literature on ADHD treatment, supplemented by expert opinion on plausibility. We outline proposed mechanisms of action of established pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments, and we review targets of novel treatments. The most relevant evidence supporting efficacy and safety of each treatment strategy is discussed. We review the individualized features of the patient that should guide the selection of treatments in a shared decision-making continuum. We provide guidance for optimizing initiation of treatment and follow-up of patients in clinical settings.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition with a high societal burden. The present guidelines summarise current literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed and further compounds are being investigated. The publication of randomised controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^106a132f]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; also known as hyperkinetic disorder) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that affects children and adults worldwide. ADHD has a predominantly genetic aetiology that involves common and rare genetic variants. Some environmental correlates of the disorder have been discovered but causation has been difficult to establish. The heterogeneity of the condition is evident in the diverse presentation of symptoms and levels of impairment, the numerous co-occurring mental and physical conditions, the various domains of neurocognitive impairment, and extensive minor structural and functional brain differences. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard diagnostic criteria. Curative treatments for ADHD do not exist but evidence-based treatments substantially reduce symptoms and/or functional impairment. Medications are effective for core symptoms and are usually well tolerated. Some non-pharmacological treatments are valuable, especially for improving adaptive functioning. Clinical and neurobiological research is ongoing and could lead to the creation of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^e2813112]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurocognitive behavioral developmental disorder most commonly seen in childhood and adolescence, which often extends to the adult years. Relative to a decade ago, there has been extensive research into understanding the factors underlying ADHD, leading to far more treatment options available for both adolescents and adults with this disorder. Novel stimulant formulations have made it possible to tailor treatment to the duration of efficacy required by patients, and to help mitigate the potential for abuse, misuse and diversion. Several new non-stimulant options have also emerged in the past few years. Among these, cognitive behavioral interventions have proven popular in the treatment of adult ADHD, especially within the adult population who cannot or will not use medications, along with the many medication-treated patients who continue to show residual disability.

### Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^dca5d1c7]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), like other psychiatric disorders, represents an evolving construct that has been refined and developed over the past several decades in response to research into its clinical nature and structure. The clinical presentation and course of the disorder have been extensively characterised. Efficacious medication-based treatments are available and widely used, often alongside complementary psychosocial approaches. However, their effectiveness has been questioned because they might not address the broader clinical needs of many individuals with ADHD, especially over the longer term. Non-pharmacological approaches to treatment have proven less effective than previously thought, whereas scientific and clinical studies are starting to fundamentally challenge current conceptions of the causes of ADHD in ways that might have the potential to alter clinical approaches in the future. In view of this, we first provide an account of the diagnosis, epidemiology, and treatment of ADHD from the perspective of both the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Second, we review the progress in our understanding of the causes and pathophysiology of ADHD on the basis of science over the past decade or so. Finally, using these discoveries, we explore some of the key challenges to both the current models and the treatment of ADHD, and the ways in which these findings can promote new perspectives.

### Systematic review of national and international guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^b1cea89c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

During the last few years several clinical guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been published by national and international medical societies. To systematically review and compare recommendations of selected ADHD guidelines, we performed a systematic search in online guideline databases and PubMed in order to retrieve guideline texts. Guidelines meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed and recommendations on assessment and treatment extracted. The AGREE instrument was used to assess methodological quality. Of the 26 guidelines identified, 13 were selected for further analysis: 11 guidelines deal with ADHD in childhood and adolescence and 5 guidelines cover transitional patients and/or ADHD in adults. The methodological quality of ADHD guidelines is moderate to good. They reflect similarities and differences of healthcare systems. Diagnosis throughout the lifespan is based on a detailed clinical history. There is greater agreement on evidence-based pharmacological treatment than on psychosocial interventions, reflecting the strength of evidence.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^2c6f0101]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

ADHD guideline — Action statement 1 (evaluation in children and adolescents) states that the primary care clinician should initiate an evaluation for ADHD for any child 4 through 18 years of age who presents with academic or behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality is B, with benefits noting that systematic identification by primary care clinicians will likely decrease undiagnosed and untreated ADHD in children, and harms/risks/costs including potential inappropriate labeling, missed alternative conditions, and treatments that will not benefit them. The benefits-harms assessment states that the high prevalence and limited mental health resources require primary care pediatricians to play a significant role; treatments have good evidence of efficacy and lack of treatment risks impaired outcomes; exclusions are none; role of patient preferences is that success depends on patient and family preference; intentional vagueness delineates limits between primary care and subspecialty management; and strength is a strong recommendation. The basis notes ADHD occurs in approximately 8% of children and youth and that appropriate diagnosis can be provided for preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age) and adolescents.

- symptoms are still causing persistent, significant impairment in at least one domain of functioning (education, interpersonal relationships, occupation) after implementing environmental modifications in schools, at home, or in other relevant settings

- a careful assessment of the child/adolescent has been obtained

- the child/adolescent and the caregivers, as appropriate, have been informed about treatment options and supported in decision-making

- methylphenidate prescription is made by, or in consultation with, a specialist.

### Current strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of childhood attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^a706c517]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Symptoms of childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder affect cognitive, academic, behavioral, emotional, social, and developmental functioning. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents. An estimated 2 to 16 percent of school-aged children have been diagnosed with the disorder. The prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the primary care setting is similar to that in the general community, depending on the diagnostic criteria and population studied. The causality of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is relatively unknown. Most recent studies focus on the role of dopamine; norepinephrine; and, most recently, serotonin neurotransmitters. The disorder is classified into three general subtypes: predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, predominantly inattentive, and combined. Screening tools and rating scales have been devised to assist with the diagnosis. Appropriate treatment can dramatically improve the function and quality of life of the patient and family. Pharmacologic treatment includes stimulants, such as methylphenidate and mixed amphetamine salts, or nonstimulants, such as atomoxetine. Behavioral approaches, particularly those that reward desirable behavior, are also effective. A combination of pharmacologic and behavioral therapies is recommended.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: a longitudinal study [^e9b7b19c]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, with a worldwide population prevalence in epidemiological studies of around 7.2% in children and 2.5% in adults. The diagnosis of ADHD is based on the presence of pervasive, developmentally inappropriate, and impairing levels of hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsivity. When untreated, individuals with ADHD are prone to a wide range of poor outcomes such as defiant, disruptive, and antisocial behaviours, emotional problems, self-harm, substance misuse, educational underachievement and exclusion from school, difficulties with employment and relationships, and criminality. Therefore, timely recognition and appropriate treatment of ADHD are essential to enhance long-term well-beings of individuals with the condition. Current guidelines often recommend a combination of non-pharmacological (e.g. behavioural or cognitive therapy) and pharmacological treatment, depending on the patient's age, levels of impairment, and comorbidities.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — key action statement 2: To make a diagnosis of ADHD, the primary care clinician should determine that Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria have been met (including documentation of impairment in more than 1 major setting); information should be obtained primarily from reports from parents or guardians, teachers, and other school and mental health clinicians involved in the child's care. The primary care clinician should also rule out any alternative cause (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation).

### Major life activity and health outcomes associated with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^c06b9e41]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

People with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are affected by the disorder throughout their lifetimes. Children with ADHD often have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder in addition to having developmental and social problems. The persistence of ADHD into adolescence and young adulthood varies according to who is being interviewed and the criteria used to define the disorder. For those adolescents and adults in whom ADHD does persist, educational difficulties continue, and problems in the areas of employment, driving, and sexual relationships emerge. ADHD is also associated with increased health care costs even when controlled for psychiatric treatment. Because most ADHD research has been conducted with male children and adolescents with ADHD, combined type, most outcomes for ADHD should be thought of as male outcomes for this subtype. In the future, ADHD researchers should study outcomes for girls and women and for people with ADHD, predominately inattentive type.

### A randomized, controlled trial of integrated home-school behavioral treatment for ADHD, predominantly inattentive type [^4044d697]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral psychosocial treatment integrated across home and school (Child Life and Attention Skills Program) with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) predominantly inattentive type (ADHD-I).

Method

Sixty-nine children ages 7 to 11 years were randomized to the Child Life and Attention Skills Program or a control group who did not receive the intervention. We compared groups posttreatment and at 3- to 5-month follow-up on parent and teacher ratings of inattention, sluggish cognitive tempo, and functional impairment.

Results

Children randomized to the Child Life and Attention Skills Program were reported to have significantly fewer inattention and sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms, and significantly improved social and organizational skills, relative to the control group. Gains were maintained at follow-up.

Conclusions

Behavioral psychosocial treatment, when specifically adapted for ADHD-I and coordinated among parents, teachers, and children, appears efficacious in reducing symptoms and impairment associated with ADHD-I.

### Clinical care of ADHD | Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder… [^100c39e7]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The American Academy of Pediatrics has developed a clinical practice guideline that provides recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
- This guideline is based on the best available evidence, and is intended for use by primary care providers, such as pediatricians, family physicians, and other healthcare providers. Diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD The AAP guidelines for diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD recommend that healthcare providers complete these steps:

- Evaluate children and adolescents ages 4 to 18 years for ADHD if they are having academic or behavioral problems and show inattention, A hyperactivity, B or impulsivity. C
- Get reports on the child's symptoms from parents or guardians, school staff, and mental health workers involved with their care, and get information from the child or adolescent as well.

Treatment recommendations The AAP guidelines for treatment of ADHD recommend that
- Children and adolescents with ADHD should be treated the same as would any other child or adolescent with special healthcare needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home. Did you know. AAP treatment guidelines by age group Children ages 4–6 years The first line of treatment should include:

- Parent training in behavior management; and/or
- Behavioral classroom interventions. ADHD medications for children ages 4–6 years Methylphenidate may be used in children 4–6 years of age if behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvementand the child continues to have serious problems.

School-age children and adolescents Recommended treatment for children and adolescents includes:

- FDA-approved medications along with
- Parent training in behavior management; and/or
- Behavioral classroom interventions. Treatments often work best when used together. For all children attending school, the school is a necessary part of any treatment plan. These plans can include:

- Educational interventions; and
- Individual school supports, such as school environment and behavioral supports. School treatment plans often include an Individualized Education Program or a 504 plan that describes accommodations. Healthcare providers supporting children with special healthcare needs Any child or adolescent who is taking medication The AAP guidelines for treatment of ADHD recommend that
- The healthcare provider adjusts the patient's medication dose as needed to achieve the most benefit with the least amount of tolerable side effects.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^6de09fc5]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

DSM-5 ADHD diagnostic classifications and testing note that the DSM-5 criteria define 4 dimensions of ADHD — attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder primarily of the inattentive presentation (ADHD/I) (314.00 [F90.0]); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder primarily of the hyperactive-impulsive presentation (ADHD/HI) (314.01 [F90.1]); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder combined presentation (ADHD/C) (314.01 [F90.2]); and ADHD other specified and unspecified ADHD (314.01 [F90.8]) — and that the DSM-5 classification criteria are the standard most frequently used by clinicians and researchers; neuropsychological testing has not been found to improve diagnostic accuracy in most cases, although it may help clarify learning strengths and weaknesses.

### Treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: overview of the evidence [^033ce824]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Quality Improvement, Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, reviewed and analyzed the current literature for the purpose of developing an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the treatment of the school-aged child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This review included several key reports, including an evidence review from the McMaster Evidence-Based Practice Center (supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), a report from the Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, the Multimodal Treatment for ADHD comparative clinical trial (supported by the National Institute of Mental Health), and supplemental reviews conducted by the subcommittee. These reviews provided substantial information about different treatments for ADHD and their efficacy in improving certain characteristics or outcomes for children with ADHD as well as adverse effects and benefits of multiple modes of treatment compared with single modes (eg, medication or behavior therapies alone). The reviews also compared the effects of different medications. Other evidence documents the long-term nature of ADHD in children and its classification as a chronic condition, meriting the application of general concepts of chronic-condition management, including an individual treatment plan with a focus on ongoing parent and child education, management, and monitoring. The evidence strongly supports the use of stimulant medications for treating the core symptoms of children with ADHD and, to a lesser degree, for improving functioning. Behavior therapy alone has only limited effect on symptoms or functioning of children with ADHD, although combining behavior therapy with medication seems to improve functioning and may decrease the amount of (stimulant) medication needed. Comparison among stimulants (mainly methylphenidate and amphetamines) did not indicate that 1 class outperformed the other.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^0428b78b]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2023). High credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects approximately 5% of children and adolescents globally and is associated with negative life outcomes and socioeconomic costs. First-generation ADHD treatments were predominantly pharmacological; however, increased understanding of biological, psychological, and environmental factors contributing to ADHD has expanded non-pharmacological treatment possibilities. This Review provides an updated evaluation of the efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological treatments for paediatric ADHD, discussing the quality and level of evidence for nine intervention categories. Unlike medication, no non-pharmacological treatments showed a consistent strong effect on ADHD symptoms. When considering broad outcomes (eg, impairment, caregiver stress, and behavioural improvement), multicomponent (cognitive) behaviour therapy joined medication as a primary ADHD treatment. With respect to secondary treatments, polyunsaturated fatty acids showed a consistent modest effect on ADHD symptoms when taken for at least 3 months. Additionally, mindfulness and multinutrient supplementation with four or more ingredients showed modest efficacy on non-symptom outcomes. All other non-pharmacological treatments were safe; clinicians might tolerate their use but should educate families of childrenand adolescents with ADHD on the disadvantages, including costs, burden to the service user, absence of proven efficacy relative to other treatments, and delay of proven treatment.

### Effectiveness of a digital therapeutic as adjunct to treatment with medication in pediatric ADHD [^3fdb3671]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder of persistent impaired attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that negatively affects daily functioning and quality of life. ADHD is one of the most commonly diagnosed pediatric mental health disorders, with a prevalence estimated to be 5% worldwideand exerts a substantial burden on families and society. Attentional difficulties specifically are associated with impairment in several areas, such as academic functioning, shy and passive social behavior, and impaired adaptive functioning in children/adolescents.

Front-line treatment for ADHD includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, which have demonstrated short-term efficacy –. However, there are limitations to both modalities of treatment –. Based in part on these limitations, there has been considerable interest in additional approaches to augment multimodal ADHD management. Digital therapeutics may offer improved access, minimal side effects, and low potential for abuse while providing targeted treatment options for improving cognitive functions, such as attention. A previous randomized controlled trial (STARS-ADHD), for example, demonstrated AKL-T01, a video-game based digital therapeutic, administered for 4 weeks at home, significantly improved attentional functioning as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA ®) in children diagnosed with ADHD, and a greater proportion of children on AKL-T01 showed evidence of improved ADHD-related impairment (IRS)compared to a digital control intervention after 4 weeks of treatment. Although the IRS change scores did not achieve statistical significance, a trend was observed (p = 0.09) that favored the active treatment.

### Assessing the impact of mindfulness programs on attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^494acd20]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

However, for such MBIs which were less represented in our study, more data is required with larger sample sizes before any clear conclusions can be drawn. Some studies have attempted to compare the efficacy of MBIs versus other treatment modalities such as comparing the effects of Computerized Progressive Attention Training (CPAT) vs. MBSR in adults with ADHD compared to a passive group. Other studies have tried to compare the benefits of psychosocial treatment modalities versus medications, which found that while psychosocial treatments were helpful, they did not provide any additive benefit to stimulant medications. While some studies have evaluated various MBI alongside each other, they have not attempted to make direct comparisons between the different types and to compare their degree of efficacy.

More heterogeneous studies with various MBI types that are equally represented would allow for more room to draw conclusions about the unique benefits of each intervention type, and comparisons in the efficacy of one type of intervention over another.

Intervention duration and frequency are other factors that must be addressed when reviewing the study results. All the studies included had a minimum of 8 weeks of intervention. A mindfulness program of adequate duration is likely crucial in order to ensure the benefits of the intervention, for instance the effects of mindfulness on awareness and attention. The frequency of the interventions varied across studies, with a range of once-per-week to twice-per-week schedules. Notably, all studies employing a twice-per-week duration reported significant reductions in ADHD symptoms. However, due to the limited number of studies with this frequency, further research is needed to clearly determine the impact of intervention frequency on outcomes.

The distribution of ADHD subtypes and comorbidities across studies did not seem to have an association with intervention outcomes. The studies reviewed here include participants who had a combined ADHD subtype, and various comorbidities. Therefore, the impact of ADHD subtypes and comorbidities on the effectiveness of MBIs remains inconclusive based on the available data. Consistent with previous reports it is still unclear which ADHD subtypes would benefit more from MBIs.

### Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic, pharmacogenetic and biochemical studies [^ab09d593]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is commonly known to occur during childhood, is characterized by excessive inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity as well as executive dysfunction, lack of emotional self-control and motivation. However a significant number of affected children (65%) continue manifesting symptoms into adulthood.

The prevalence of ADHD was reported as 5.3% in childhood, whereas it is estimated as 2.5–4.9% in adulthood. Clinical research showed that the predominant features of ADHD in adults differ from ADHD in children, with adults showing less obvious symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity and more inattentive symptoms. A recent study reported follow-back analyses of ADHD cases diagnosed in adulthood, alongside follow-forward analyses of ADHD cases diagnosed in childhood in a representative birth cohort from Dunedin. The findings suggested that adults with ADHD may not have a childhood-onset disorder. There was little overlap between participants who had been diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and those diagnosed in adulthood. This finding is intriguing but difficult to interpret because it is not consistent with a very large literature documenting the persistence of ADHD into adulthood. Pharmacological treatment is considered effective and safe both for children and adults, but there is considerable inter-individual variability among patients regarding response to medication, required doses, and adverse events. Pharmacotherapy with methylphenidate (MPH) seems to be the first-line treatment of choice both in children, and in adults, with ADHD.

Since the release of the 2011 guideline and the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to the fifth edition, the current revision makes only incremental updates, adds a key action statement related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD, and updates the PoCA to assist in implementing the recommendations. The guideline also notes identification of numerous systemic barriers to adoption and a companion article in the Supplemental Information addressing systemic barriers and presenting recommendations to address those barriers, with this article supporting the recommendations of the clinical practice guideline and PoCA.

Diagnostic questions addressed the comparative diagnostic accuracy of approaches usable in primary care or by specialists among children younger than 7 years of age; the comparative diagnostic accuracy of EEG, imaging, or executive function approaches among individuals aged 7 to their 18th birthday; the adverse effects associated with being labeled correctly or incorrectly as having ADHD; and whether more formal neuropsychological, imaging, or genetic tests improve the diagnostic process. Treatment questions addressed the comparative safety and effectiveness of pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic treatments of ADHD; the risk of diversion of pharmacologic treatment; and the comparative safety and effectiveness of different monitoring strategies to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment or changes in ADHD status.

Conclusion

Development of robust evidence of the putative effectiveness of the non-mainstream treatments being used should be a priority given that they are being used by carers; paediatric doctors are increasingly turning to more natural treatments; long-term negative outcomes of those with ADHD are not being affected; and currently recommended treatments are palliative and associated with common side effects. Surveying carers is a useful means of identifying which treatments are being used and should subsequently be tested.

### Multimodal treatment efficacy differs in dependence of core symptom profiles in adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: an analysis of the randomized controlled COMPAS trial [^d70904ba]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

There is broad consensus that to improve the treatment of adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the various therapy options need to be tailored more precisely to the individual patient's needs and specific symptoms. This post-hoc analysis evaluates the multimodal effects of first-line medication (methylphenidate [MPH] vs placebo [PLB]) and psychotherapeutic (group psychotherapy [GPT] vs clinical management [CM]) treatments on the ADHD core symptoms inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. For the two-by-two factorial, observer-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled Comparison of Methylphenidate and Psychotherapy in Adult ADHD Study (COMPAS; ISRCTN54096201), 419 outpatients with ADHD were considered for analysis. ADHD symptoms were assessed by blind observer-rated and patient-rated Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales before treatment (T1), 13 weeks (T2) and 26 weeks (T3) after T1, at treatment completion after 52 weeks (T4), and at follow-up (130 weeks, T5). MPH was superior to PLB in improving symptoms of inattention at almost all endpoints (observer-rated T2, T3, T4, T5; patient-rated T2, T3, T4), while a significant decrease in hyperactivity and impulsivity was at first found after 6 months of treatment. CM compared to GPT decreased inattention and impulsivity in the early treatment phase only (observer-rated T2, patient-rated T2, T3). In conclusion, while MPH seems to have a direct and sustained effect on inattention, premature medication discontinuation should particularly be avoided in patients with hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Also, especially in high inattention and/or impulsivity presentations, initial individual patient management might be beneficial. Consequently, considering individual core symptom profiles may enhance the efficacy of treatments in adult ADHD.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^7f819f47]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence of 1.4–3.0%. It is more common in boys than girls. Comorbidity with childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric disorders is substantial. ADHD is highly heritable and multifactorial; multiple genes and non-inherited factors contribute to the disorder. Prenatal and perinatal factors have been implicated as risks, but definite causes remain unknown. Most guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to treatment, beginning with non-drug interventions and then moving to pharmacological treatment in those most severely affected. Randomised controlled trials show short-term benefits of stimulant medication and atomoxetine. Meta-analyses of blinded trials of non-drug treatments have not yet proven the efficacy of such interventions. Longitudinal studies of ADHD show heightened risk of multiple mental health and social difficulties as well as premature mortality in adult life.

Key points
- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can often be managed with the right treatment.
- Treatment recommendations vary by age group.
- Types of treatment for ADHD include behavior therapy and medications. Treatment types Behavior Therapy
- Behavior therapy, including training for parents; and Medications
- Stimulants
- Non-stimulants. Good treatment plans will include close monitoring of whether and how much the treatment helps the child's behavior, as well as making changes as needed along the way. ADHD treatment recommendations Behavior therapy, including training for parents ADHD affects not only a child's ability to pay attention or sit still at school, but it also affects relationships with family and other children. Children with ADHD often show behaviors that can be very disruptive to others. Behavior therapy is a treatment option that can help reduce these behaviors and can help increase self-regulation skills.

it is often helpful to start behavior therapy as soon as a diagnosis is made. Behavior therapy overview for parents Behavior therapy is an important part of treatment for children with ADHD. Behavior therapy for children The goals of behavior therapy are to learn or strengthen positive behaviors and eliminate unwanted or problem behaviors. Behavior therapy for ADHD can include
- Parent training in behavior management
- Behavior therapy with children
- Behavioral interventions in the classroom These approaches can also be used together. For children who attend early childhood programs, it is usually most effective if parents and educators work together to help the child. The following are suggestions that may help with your child's behavior: Sample suggestions Create a routine. Manage distractions. Limit choices. Be clear and specific when you talk with your child. Help your child plan. Use goals and praise or other rewards.

Discipline effectively. Create positive opportunities. Provide a healthy lifestyle. School-age children and adolescents For children ages 6 years and older, AAP recommends combining medication treatment with behavior therapy. Several types of behavior therapies are considered effective, including:

- Parent training in behavior management;
- Behavioral interventions in the classroom;
- Peer interventions that focus on behavior; and
- Organizational skills training. These approaches are often most effective if they are used together, depending on the needs of the individual child and the family. Parents, healthcare providers, and the school can work together on developing the right treatment plan.

### A systematic review and analysis of long-term outcomes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: effects of treatment and non-treatment [^b9d22801]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In childhood, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by age-inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity-impulsiveness or a combination of these problems. The symptoms of ADHD often lead to functional impairment in multiple domains and lower quality of life. Therefore, in recent years the focus of intervention has expanded from ameliorating immediate symptoms of ADHD to improving functionality in several life domains. Moreover, although traditionally regarded as a childhood disorder, it is now clear that ADHD affects both children and adults. The worldwide prevalence of ADHD has been estimated at 5.29% with approximately 4% prevalence in adults. According to one meta-analysis, ADHD persists in about 65% of adults diagnosed as children if ADHD in partial remission is included, and in about 50% of adults originally diagnosed as children according to a separate estimate. Persistence of ADHD may be related to ADHD symptom severity, number of symptoms, ADHD symptom subtype, ADHD in relatives, psychosocial adversity, psychiatric comorbidities, and/or parental psychopathology. Many adults with ADHD are undiagnosed and untreated. Research on ADHD in adulthood is relatively sparse despite being recognized in adults as early as 1968 as 'minimal brain dysfunction' and in 1972 as 'hyperkinetic disorder'. Thus the negative outcomes reported by most follow-up studies may be a consequence of untreated symptoms.

Pediatricians and other primary care clinicians may continue to provide care after 18 years of age, but care beyond this age was not studied for this guideline. Since 2011 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), was released; the new research and DSM-5 do not support dramatic changes, so this guideline includes only incremental updates and adds a key action statement about the diagnosis and treatment of coexisting or comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD.

### Treatments for ADHD in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^7f920bd7]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Effective treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is essential to improving youth outcomes.

Objectives

This systematic review provides an overview of the available treatment options.

Data Sources

We identified controlled treatment evaluations in 12 databases published from 1980 to June 2023; treatments were not restricted by intervention content.

Study Selection

Studies in children and adolescents with clinically diagnosed ADHD, reporting patient health and psychosocial outcomes, were eligible. Publications were screened by trained reviewers, supported by machine learning.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted and critically appraised by 1 reviewer and checked by a methodologist. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Strength of evidence and applicability assessments followed Evidence-based Practice Center standards.

Results

In total, 312 studies reported in 540 publications were included. We grouped evidence for medication, psychosocial interventions, parent support, nutrition and supplements, neurofeedback, neurostimulation, physical exercise, complementary medicine, school interventions, and provider approaches. Several treatments improved ADHD symptoms. Medications had the strongest evidence base for improving outcomes, including disruptive behaviors and broadband measures, but were associated with adverse events.

Limitations

We found limited evidence of studies comparing alternative treatments directly and indirect analyses identified few systematic differences across stimulants and nonstimulants. Identified combination of medication with youth-directed psychosocial interventions did not systematically produce better results than monotherapy, though few combinations have been evaluated.

Conclusions

A growing number of treatments are available that improve ADHD symptoms and other outcomes, in particular for school-aged youth. Medication therapies remain important treatment options but are associated with adverse events.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^0e32b0a8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD but, despite its widespread use, this is the first comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Search Methods

In February 2015 we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events, general behaviour and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks. We used standard methodological procedures expected within Cochrane. Data from parallel-group trials and first period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses; separate analyses were undertaken using post-cross-over data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity and publication bias.

Main Results

The studies. We included 38 parallel-group trials (5111 participants randomised) and 147 cross-over trials (7134 participants randomised). Participants included individuals of both sexes, at a boys-to-girls ratio of 5:1, and participants' ages ranged from 3 to 18 years across most studies (in two studies ages ranged from 3 to 21 years). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. Most participants were from high-income countries. The duration of methylphenidate treatment ranged from 1 to 425 days, with an average duration of 75 days. Methylphenidate was compared to placebo (175 trials) or no intervention (10 trials). Risk of Bias. All 185 trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Primary outcomes. Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.90 to -0.64; 19 trials, 1698 participants; very low-quality evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -9.6 points (95% CI -13.75 to -6.38) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points; DuPaul 1991a). A change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS is considered clinically to represent the minimal relevant difference. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious (e.g. life threatening) adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.22; 9 trials, 1532 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.02 to 33.2).

Secondary Outcomes

Among those prescribed methylphenidate, 526 per 1000 (range 448 to 615) experienced non-serious adverse events, compared with 408 per 1000 in the control group. This equates to a 29% increase in the overall risk of any non-serious adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; 21 trials, 3132 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.29 (CI 1.06 to 1.56). The most common non-serious adverse events were sleep problems and decreased appetite. Children in the methylphenidate group were at 60% greater risk for trouble sleeping/sleep problems (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.23; 13 trials, 2416 participants), and 266% greater risk for decreased appetite (RR 3.66, 95% CI 2.56 to 5.23; 16 trials, 2962 participants) than children in the control group. Teacher-rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD -0.87, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.71; 5 trials, 668 participants; very low-quality evidence). A change of seven points on the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ; range 0 to 100 points; Landgraf 1998) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a MD of 8.0 points (95% CI 5.49 to 10.46) on the CHQ, which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent-reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.80; 3 trials, 514 participants; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate may improve teacher-reported ADHD symptoms, teacher-reported general behaviour, and parent-reported quality of life among children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. However, the low quality of the underpinning evidence means that we cannot be certain of the magnitude of the effects. Within the short follow-up periods typical of the included trials, there is some evidence that methylphenidate is associated with increased risk of non-serious adverse events, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite, but no evidence that it increases risk of serious adverse events. Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. Given the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point to the advantage of large, 'nocebo tablet' controlled trials. These use a placebo-like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. However, for ethical reasons, such trials should first be conducted with adults, who can give their informed consent. Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects according to age, sex, comorbidity, type of ADHD and dose. Finally, the findings highlight the urgent need for large RCTs of non-pharmacological treatments.

### Components of cognitive-behavioural therapy for mitigating core symptoms in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analys [^4147c384]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity due to impairment of brain functions. People with ADHD experience various challenges in both childhood and adulthood, which can adversely affect various aspects of daily life stability, maintenance of interpersonal relationships and career development.

The current evidence-based guidelines for ADHD treatment recommend physiological approaches such as pharmacological interventions; although these can improve inhibitory function to some extent, complete remission is rare, and the core symptoms of ADHD persist even with physiological treatment in most cases. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline also recommends psychotherapy, especially cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) which has been reported to be effective in improving the core symptoms of ADHD.

CBT is a complex intervention that includes various cognitive and behavioural components, and therapists assess the symptoms and characteristics of each patient individually and prescribe CBT techniques to address their problems accordingly. Thus, determining which CBT components are beneficial or which ones are detrimental for ADHD is crucial for optimising treatment. However, discussions regarding which components of CBT are more effective or potentially harmful in the context of the diverse challenges associated with ADHD have not progressed appreciably.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^f2b6777a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) epidemiology and comorbidity in children and adolescents — In a national survey, 8.4% of children 2 to 17 years of age currently had ADHD, representing 5.4 million children; among those with current ADHD, almost two-thirds were taking medication, approximately half had received behavioral treatment in the past year, and nearly one quarter had received neither type of treatment of ADHD. The median age of diagnosis was 7 years, with approximately one-third diagnosed before 6 years of age, and more than half were first diagnosed by a PCC, often a pediatrician. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to receive a diagnosis; as individuals with ADHD enter adolescence, their overt hyperactive and impulsive symptoms tend to decline, whereas their inattentive symptoms tend to persist. Learning and language problems are common comorbid conditions, the majority of both boys and girls meet diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder, boys are more likely to exhibit externalizing conditions like oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and girls with ADHD are more likely than boys to have a comorbid internalizing condition like anxiety or depression. Although there is a greater risk of receiving a diagnosis of ADHD for children who are the youngest in their class, for most children, retention is not beneficial.

### A dose-response study of OROS methylphenidate in children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^7653095f]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

OROS methylphenidate HCL (MPH) is a recently developed long-acting stimulant medication used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study was conducted to examine dosage effects on ADHD symptoms and stimulant side effects and to explore potential moderating effects of ADHD subtype.

Methods

Children with ADHD combined type (ADHD-CT) or predominantly inattentive type (ADHD-PI; n = 47), ages 5 to 16 years, underwent a placebo-controlled, crossover trial using forced titration with weekly switches at 3 dosage levels. Parent and teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms were used to evaluate efficacy. In addition, vital signs and standardized measures of stimulant side effects were obtained weekly.

Results

Parent ratings were more sensitive to treatment effects than teacher ratings. ADHD symptoms and Clinical Global Impressions Severity Index ratings at each dose condition differed significantly from placebo and baseline ratings, which did not differ from one another. For those with ADHD-CT, there was a clear linear dose-response relationship, with clinically significant reductions in ADHD Rating Scale-IV scores occurring in two thirds to three fourths of the subjects during either 36- or 54-mg dose conditions. Children with ADHD-PI, conversely, were more likely to respond optimally to lower doses and derived less benefit from higher doses, with 60% displaying significant improvement on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV at 36 mg or lower. Mild stimulant side effects were reported during placebo and at all dosage levels. With the exception of insomnia and decreased appetite, which were more common at higher doses, parent report of side effects was not related to dose. In addition, younger and smaller children were more likely to display sleep difficulties and decreased appetite at the higher dose levels Although pulse rate increased slightly with increasing dose, there were no dose effects on blood pressure.

Conclusions

In children with ADHD-CT, the most common subtype of ADHD, increasing doses of stimulant medication were associated with increased improvement of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. In children with ADHD-PI, symptom improvement occurred at lower doses and less benefit was derived from higher doses. In both ADHD subtypes, higher doses were associated with parent ratings of increased insomnia and decreased appetite.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age): For preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age), the primary care clinician should prescribe evidence-based parent- and/or teacher-administered behavior therapy as the first line of treatment (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation) and may prescribe methylphenidate if the behavior interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continuing disturbance in the child's function. In areas in which evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication at an early age against the harm of delaying diagnosis and treatment (quality of evidence B/recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality: A for behavior; B for methylphenidate. Harms/risks/costs: Both therapies increase the cost of care, and behavior therapy requires a higher level of family involvement, whereas methylphenidate has some potential adverse effects. Benefits-harms assessment: Given the risks of untreated ADHD, the benefits outweigh the risks. Role of patient preferences: Family preference is essential in determining the treatment plan. Strength: strong recommendation.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in preschool children [^f1750a44]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a childhood onset of symptoms and impairment. Although it is most frequently identified during elementary school years, epidemiologic data suggest that the onset of ADHD frequently occurs earlier, with presentation as young as 3 years of age. Early identification, however, allows consideration of appropriate interventions. Many data are available on safe and efficacious treatment options for school-aged children who have ADHD; however, little is known about the use of these modalities in preschoolers and, ultimately, the long-term effects of early treatment. Recognition of the preschool presentation of ADHD, appropriate differential diagnosis, and identification of comorbid conditions, and a developmental perspective on the course and potential outcomes of the disorder may guide treatment planning. Newly available data on the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial intervention for preschoolers who have ADHD may help clinicians make treatment decisions for these young children and their families.

We have created an evidence-based guide for clinicians to the relative utility of nonpharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This article uses the term evidence-based in the sense applied by the Oxford Center for Evidenced-Based Medicine to help readers understand the degree to which nonpharmacologic treatments are supported by the scientific literature. This article also reviews the magnitude of the treatment effect expressed as the standardized mean difference effect size (also known as Cohen D). It then describes a meta-algorithm to describe how to integrate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for ADHD.

### Medical management of ADHD in adults: part 1 [^c20b8d7e]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is common, impairing and often unrecognised. Comorbidity is very common and may compound the impact of ADHD. It is important that a diagnosis of ADHD is made following a high-quality assessment. Symptoms and social outcomes can be improved by treatment, particularly medication. Non-pharmacological treatment may be more effective in those who are also on medication, and psychoeducation and environmental modifications are also important. Stimulants such as methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine are recommended first choice medications. The choice of drug can be tailored to patients' circumstances, especially intended duration of action, then titrated week by week, according to response.

hyperactivity disorder/hyperactivity disorder

ADHD is a childhood onset, neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic and environmental origins characterised by pervasive behavioural symptoms of hyperactivity, inattentiveness and impulsivity that have been present for at least 6 months and adversely impact on daily functioning and development. ADHD is highly prevalent. Research combining data from multiple sources and analysed using meta-regression reported a worldwide-pooled estimate of 5.29–7.2% in children, 2.5% in adults and between 2.8% in older adulthood. Symptoms must persist across the lifespan, although the relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics vary across individuals, and may change over the course of development, e.g. in particular hyperactive-impulsive symptoms commonly reduce with age.

The diagnostic criteria for ADHD are presented in DSM-5 and the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 11th edition beta, (ICD-11). Whilst the basic symptom criteria did not change from the revision of DSM-IV, DSM-5 increased the typical age of onset to age 12 (previously age 7). The definition of ADHD was expanded to more accurately characterise the experience of adults, and the number of symptoms was relaxed for adults (> 17 years) who are now required to have five or more symptoms that have persisted for at least 6 months in the inattention and/or hyperactive-impulsive domains. For a diagnosis made in childhood, the number of symptoms remained as 6, respectively. Symptoms must be pervasive and interfere with or reduce the quality of social, academic and occupational functioning. They must not be better explained by other conditions, such as intellectual disability. The change in nomenclature from 'subtypes' in DSM-IV to 'presentations' in DSM-5 reflects increasing evidence that symptoms are often fluid within individuals across their lifespan rather than stable traits. The 'presentation' represents the person's current symptomatology which may change over time: For example, in ADHD, inattentiveness may be relatively stable across development, but hyperactivity and impulsiveness often wane with age. Also, importantly, ASD is no longer an exclusion criterion, which is a fundamental change from DSM-IV and this, together with other comorbid conditions, should be noted. The advance preview of ICD-11 was published in June 2018, and this no longer refers to ADHD as hyperkinetic disorder. Other than that, it appears to be essentially similar to DSM-5.

### Multimodal treatments for childhood attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: interpreting outcomes in the context of study designs [^b8723dce]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2007). Low credibility.

The goal of this article was to outline issues critical to evaluating the literature on incremental benefit of multiple effective treatments used together, vs. a single effective treatment, for childhood ADHD. These issues include: (1) sequencing and dosage of treatments being combined and compared; (2) difficulty drawing valid conclusions about individual components of treatment when treatment packages are employed; (3) differing results emerging from measurement tools that purportedly measure the same domain; and (4) the resultant difficulty in reaching a summary conclusion when multiple outcome measures yielding conflicting results are used. The implications of these issues for the design and conduct of future studies are discussed, and recommendations are made for future research.

Evidence-based treatments for ADHD - an Overview

Multiple groups, committees, and professional organizations have provided the field with recommendations for evidence-based treatment approaches for ADHD. There is clear consensus across these recommendations that pharmacological treatments, notably stimulant medication, psychosocial treatments, and a combination of these two approaches have the strongest evidence base. Table 1 provides a brief overview of the major conclusions of each guideline for the treatment of ADHD in children. It is clearly recommended that families should receive psychoeducation regarding ADHD, and that the evidence-based psychosocial treatments are behavioral parent training (BPT), behavioral interventions in classroom and peer settings, and organizational skills training.

Table 1
Review of practice parameters and treatment guidelines for ADHD.

There are inconsistencies among the guidelines that make broad statements of consensus difficult. For instance, there are differences in precision in recommendations for psychosocial treatments, with some very broad in scope compared to others with more precise recommendations regarding particular treatment types (e.g. BPT) and particular populations (e.g. children under six;). Broad suggestions of seeking "psychological" or "educational" treatment is unhelpful in some guidelines and practice parameters, as there are many approaches that fall under this category and some are clearly efficacious whereas other approaches commonly deployed do not have evidence of efficacy for ADHD. There are also differences in the strength of recommendations, with more contemporary guidelines emphasizing multimodal treatments more so than older guidelines. However, perhaps most notably, there is not clear consensus among the recommendations on the best sequence or combination of treatments for ADHD, even though this is a key question for most families pursuing treatment for ADHD. It is also important to note that most guidelines focus on proximal ADHD treatment – as ADHD is now conceptualized as a life-course persistent disorder, treatment efforts will need to be protracted across time and appropriate for evolving developmental levels.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — adolescents (12–18 years of age): For adolescents (12–18 years of age), the primary care clinician should prescribe FDA-approved medications for ADHD with the assent of the adolescent (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation) and may prescribe behavior therapy as treatment for ADHD (quality of evidence C/recommendation), preferably both. Aggregate evidence quality: A for medications; C for behavior therapy. Benefits: Both behavior therapy and FDA-approved medications have been demonstrated to reduce behaviors associated with ADHD and improve function. Harms/risks/costs: Both therapies increase the cost of care, and behavior therapy requires a higher level of family involvement, whereas FDA-approved medications have some potential adverse effects. Benefits-harms assessment: Given the risks of untreated ADHD, the benefits outweigh the risks. Role of patient preferences: Family preference, including patient preference, is essential in determining the treatment plan.

### Evidence-based… [^4d69deb7]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The primary goal of treatment is to minimize the impact of ADHD symptoms on patient function while maximizing the patient's ability to compensate or cope with any remaining difficulties. Not all symptoms can be resolved with treatment; it is important to manage expectations of treatment and to promote a sense of responsibility and personal agency in patients. Overview of Treatment Recommendations for Adults ADHD outlines a general approach to treating ADHD in adults. Briefly, treatment of ADHD in adults includes: Cognitive Component: Focused on identifying and modifying "thinking errors" or "thought distortions" so that the patient's thoughts are more aligned with success and confidence.

Behavioral Component: Involves engineering the environment to be more conducive to concentration and focus, and learning what reinforces and maintains problem behaviors, and constructive behaviors so that constructive changes can be implemented that support the patient's ability to function well. It includes training in skills to promote relaxation and quiet the mind; communication skills training and exposure therapy, which helps a patient, overcome certain fears and avoidance. It also includes behavioral rehearsal, behavioral practice, and role-playing. In this way, metacognitive therapy is distinct from cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses more on the content of people's thoughts. In people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, problems with metacognition more often encompass difficulty in planning or executing tasks.

The goal of metacognitive therapy in ADHD is to improve organization skills, planning, time management, and resolve thinking distortions that lead to negative moods and the perception of limited options. There is no evidence from controlled trials to indicate how long the patient with ADHD should be treated with medications. Trials of off medications and "medication holidays" can be used to assess the patient's functioning without pharmacotherapy. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued. The evidence on effectiveness and safety of these methods is lacking in adults. Most adult patients with ADHD can benefit from education about ADHD, skill building trainings and adjuvant psychotherapy. A variety of self-help resources such as books, websites and apps exist for adults with ADHD. Several tips and resources for the patients are summarized in the patient handout, Managing Adult ADHD.

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^f73a3f15]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diagnosed mainly in children, often persist into adulthood. Adults in this group have a high rate of other psychiatric problems and functional difficulties in a number of key areas such as academic achievement, interpersonal relationships, and employment. Although the usefulness of immediate-release methylphenidate in children has been extensively studied, studies in adults, which are few, demonstrate varying results.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of immediate-release methylphenidate versus placebo in the treatment of adults with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in November 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), and two trials registers. Biosis was searched in December 2013. We inspected references of all relevant papers to identify more studies and contacted authors of recently published trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized trials comparing immediate-release methylphenidate versus placebo in participants aged 18 years or older with ADHD. We excluded trials conducted on subpopulations of adults with ADHD such as adults with both ADHD and substance dependence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trial risk of bias. We contacted authors of trials to ask for additional and missing data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs.

Main Results

Results from the 11 randomized controlled trials (474 participants, counting participants from cross-over studies as a single arm, and counting both arms from parallel studies) included in the review demonstrated improvement in core clinical ADHD symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness, and overall improvement. We were able to pool results from 10 studies, which included 466 participants. Most included studies were judged to have unclear risk of bias for most categories. However, as all studies were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled and, in general, did not contain factors that significantly decreased the quality of the body of evidence, the quality of evidence was assessed as "high" for most outcomes according to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. For one outcome-inattentiveness-most information came from studies at unclear risk of bias, and so the quality of evidence for this outcome was judged as "moderate". Results are given as SMD for each of the core clinical symptoms of ADHD. In all cases, participant numbers were calculated by counting participants in a single arm from cross-over studies and in both arms from parallel studies. The SMD for the outcome of hyperactivity was -0.60 (95% CI -1.11 to -0.09, 6 studies, number of participants (n) = 245, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate; the SMD for impulsivity was -0.62 (95% CI -1.08 to -0.17, 5 studies, n = 207, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate; and the SMD for inattentiveness was -0.66 (95% CI -1.02 to -0.30, 7 studies, n = 391, moderate-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate. Moderate to extreme statistical heterogeneity was detected for all outcomes. Subgroup analysis comparing high versus low doses did not indicate that higher doses of immediate-release methylphenidate were associated with greater efficacy. For overall change, the SMD was -0.72 (95% CI -1.12 to -0.32, 9 studies, n = 455, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate. The effects of immediate-release methylphenidate on anxiety and depression as parameters of general changes in mental state were equivocal. Some trials reported reduction in depression and anxiety, others detailed no change, and still others described an increase in depressive and anxious symptoms. The most common adverse effect was loss of appetite, in some cases with weight loss. Although no study reported either of these effects as problematic or severe, the included studies were of short duration; thus clinical significance could not be properly assessed. Five studies reported changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and three reported increases in heart rate. None of these results were judged to present cause for concern. No study reported clinically significant adverse effects-cardiovascular or other. Three studies did not mention adverse effects. We were unable to determine whether adverse effects were not discussed by study authors because none occurred, or because no data on adverse effects were collected.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from randomized controlled trials suggest that immediate-release methylphenidate is efficacious for treating adults with ADHD with symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness, and for improving their overall clinical condition. Trial data suggest that adverse effects from immediate-release methylphenidate for adults with ADHD are not of serious clinical significance, although this conclusion may be limited, certainly in the case of weight loss, by the short duration of published studies.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^224d2cc6]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Preschool-aged ADHD treatment (KAS 5a) — For preschool-aged children (age 4 years to the sixth birthday) with ADHD, the PCC should prescribe evidence-based behavioral PTBM and/or behavioral classroom interventions as the first line of treatment, if available (grade A: strong recommendation). Methylphenidate may be considered if these behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continuing disturbance in the 4-through 5-year-old child's functioning. In areas in which evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying treatment (Table 6). (Grade B: strong recommendation.) The overall evidence for PTBM among preschoolers is strong.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for adult ADHD: a systematic review [^09c0093e]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common developmental disorder, often persisting into adulthood. Whilst medication is first-line treatment for ADHD, there is a need for evidence-based non-pharmacological treatment options for adults with ADHD who are either still experiencing significant symptoms or for those who have made the informed choice not to start medication.

Methods

We systematically searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD in adults. After screening of titles and abstracts, full text articles were reviewed, data extracted and bias assessed using a study proforma.

Results

There were 32 eligible studies with the largest number of studies assessing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT consisted of either group, internet or individual therapy.

Conclusions

The majority found an improvement in ADHD symptoms with CBT treatment. Additionally, mindfulness and cognitive remediation have evidence as effective interventions for the core symptoms of ADHD and there is evidence for the use of group dialectical behavioural therapy and hypnotherapy. However, evidence for these is weaker due to small numbers of participants and limitations due to the lack of suitable control conditions, and a high risk of bias.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^836163a3]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbid conditions — primary care clinician (PCC) initiation and referral (KAS 7) states that the PCC, if trained or experienced in diagnosing comorbid conditions, may initiate treatment of such conditions or refer to an appropriate subspecialist, and if not trained or experienced in making the diagnosis or initiating treatment, the patient should be referred to an appropriate subspecialist to make the diagnosis and initiate treatment; this is a Grade C recommendation. Benefits, risks, and preferences are summarized as follows: clinicians are most effective when they know the limits of their practice and local resources; under-identification or inappropriate identification of comorbidities can lead to inadequate or inappropriate treatments; the importance of adequately identifying and addressing comorbidities outweighs the risk of inappropriate referrals or treatments; the families' preferences and comfort need to be taken into consideration; exclusions are none and the strength is recommendation.

The impairment caused by untreated ADHD can complicate, or even lead to, other psychiatric conditions. Accurate diagnosis and efficacious treatment of ADHD in adults, which may include pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, is vital to improve their functioning. When a patient has ADHD and a co-occurring condition, the clinician should usually treat the most impairing condition first.

### Improving the efficacy and effectiveness of evidence-based psychosocial interventions for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents [^267416da]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, chronic, and impairing mental health disorder of childhood. Decades of empirical research has established a strong evidence-based intervention armamentarium for ADHD; however, limitations exist in regards to efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions. We provide an overview of select evidence-based interventions for children and adolescents, highlighting potential approaches to further improving the efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions. We conclude with broader recommendations for interventions, including considerations to moderators and under-explored intervention target areas as well as avenues to improve access and availability of evidence-based interventions through leveraging underutilized workforces and leveraging technology.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^a3d80eb9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trials registers up to March 2022. In addition, we checked reference lists and requested published and unpublished data from manufacturers of methylphenidate.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. The search was not limited by publication year or language, but trial inclusion required that 75% or more of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ > 70). We assessed two primary outcomes, ADHD symptoms and serious adverse events, and three secondary outcomes, adverse events considered non-serious, general behaviour, and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment for each trial. Six review authors including two review authors from the original publication participated in the update in 2022. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Data from parallel-group trials and first-period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses. We undertook separate analyses using end-of-last period data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA) to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 212 trials (16,302 participants randomised); 55 parallel-group trials (8104 participants randomised), and 156 cross-over trials (8033 participants randomised) as well as one trial with a parallel phase (114 participants randomised) and a cross-over phase (165 participants randomised). The mean age of participants was 9.8 years ranging from 3 to 18 years (two trials from 3 to 21 years). The male-female ratio was 3:1. Most trials were carried out in high-income countries, and 86/212 included trials (41%) were funded or partly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Methylphenidate treatment duration ranged from 1 to 425 days, with a mean duration of 28.8 days. Trials compared methylphenidate with placebo (200 trials) and with no intervention (12 trials). Only 165/212 trials included usable data on one or more outcomes from 14,271 participants. Of the 212 trials, we assessed 191 at high risk of bias and 21 at low risk of bias. If, however, deblinding of methylphenidate due to typical adverse events is considered, then all 212 trials were at high risk of bias.

Primary Outcomes

methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.88 to -0.61; I² = 38%; 21 trials; 1728 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -10.58 (95% CI -12.58 to -8.72) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points). The minimal clinically relevant difference is considered to be a change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS. Methylphenidate may not affect serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.67; I² = 0%; 26 trials, 3673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.31 to 2.68).

Secondary Outcomes

methylphenidate may cause more adverse events considered non-serious versus placebo or no intervention (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; I² = 72%; 35 trials 5342 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.22 (CI 1.08 to 1.43). Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated general behaviour versus placebo (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.33; I² = 68%; 7 trials 792 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but may not affect quality of life (SMD 0.40, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.83; I² = 81%; 4 trials, 608 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The majority of our conclusions from the 2015 version of this review still apply. Our updated meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate versus placebo or no-intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour in children and adolescents with ADHD. There may be no effects on serious adverse events and quality of life. Methylphenidate may be associated with an increased risk of adverse events considered non-serious, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite. However, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes is very low and therefore the true magnitude of effects remain unclear. Due to the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the blinding of participants and outcome assessors is particularly challenging. To accommodate this challenge, an active placebo should be sought and utilised. It may be difficult to find such a drug, but identifying a substance that could mimic the easily recognised adverse effects of methylphenidate would avert the unblinding that detrimentally affects current randomised trials. Future systematic reviews should investigate the subgroups of patients with ADHD that may benefit most and least from methylphenidate. This could be done with individual participant data to investigate predictors and modifiers like age, comorbidity, and ADHD subtypes.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^e04200f6]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) chronic care management — KAS 4 states that ADHD is a chronic condition; therefore, the PCC should manage children and adolescents with ADHD in the same manner that they would children and youth with special health care needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home (Table 5), and this is a Grade B: strong recommendation. The rationale provided is that for many individuals, ADHD causes symptoms and dysfunction over long periods of time, even into adulthood, and that available treatments address symptoms and function but are usually not curative.

### Parent training interventions for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children aged 5 to 18 years [^c29d14cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by high levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that are present before the age of seven years, seen in a range of situations, inconsistent with the child's developmental level and causing social or academic impairment. Parent training programmes are psychosocial interventions aimed at training parents in techniques to enable them to manage their children's challenging behaviour.

Objectives

To determine whether parent training interventions are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and associated problems in children aged between five and eigtheen years with a diagnosis of ADHD, compared to controls with no parent training intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases (for all available years until September 2010): CENTRAL (2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to 10 September 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 36), CINAHL (1937 to 13 September 2010), PsycINFO (1806 to September Week 1 2010), Dissertation Abstracts International (14 September 2010) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (14 September 2010). We contacted experts in the field to ask for details of unpublished or ongoing research.

Selection Criteria

Randomised (including quasi-randomised) studies comparing parent training with no treatment, a waiting list or treatment as usual (adjunctive or otherwise). We included studies if ADHD was the main focus of the trial and participants were over five years old and had a clinical diagnosis of ADHD or hyperkinetic disorder that was made by a specialist using the operationalised diagnostic criteria of the DSM-III/DSM-IV or ICD-10. We only included trials that reported at least one child outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors were involved in screening abstracts and at least 2 authors looked independently at each one. We reviewed a total of 12,691 studies and assessed five as eligible for inclusion. We extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the five included trials. Opportunities for meta-analysis were limited and most data that we have reported are based on single studies.

Main Results

We found five studies including 284 participants that met the inclusion criteria, all of which compared parent training with de facto treatment as usual (TAU). One study included a nondirective parent support group as a second control arm. Four studies targeted children's behaviour problems and one assessed changes in parenting skills. Of the four studies targeting children's behaviour, two focused on behaviour at home and two focused on behaviour at school. The two studies focusing on behaviour at home had different findings: one found no difference between parent training and treatment as usual, whilst the other reported statistically significant results for parent training versus control. The two studies of behaviour at school also had different findings: one study found no difference between groups, whilst the other reported positive results for parent training when ADHD was not comorbid with oppositional defiant disorder. In this latter study, outcomes were better for girls and for children on medication. We assessed the risk of bias in most of the studies as unclear at best and often as high. Information on randomisation and allocation concealment did not appear in any study report. Inevitably, blinding of participants or personnel was impossible for this intervention; likewise, blinding of outcome assessors (who were most often the parents who had delivered the intervention) was impossible. We were only able to conduct meta-analysis for two outcomes: child 'externalising' behaviour (a measure of rulebreaking, oppositional behaviour or aggression) and child 'internalising' behaviour (for example, withdrawal and anxiety). Meta-analysis of three studies (n = 190) providing data on externalising behaviour produced results that fell short of statistical significance (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.83 to 0.18, I(2) = 60%). A meta-analysis of two studies (n = 142) for internalising behaviour gave significant results in the parent training groups (SMD -0.48; 95% CI -0.84 to -0.13, I(2) = 9%). Data from a third study likely to have contributed to this outcome were missing, and we have some concerns about selective outcome reporting bias. Individual study results for child behaviour outcomes were mixed. Positive results on an inventory of child behaviour problems were reported for one small study (n = 24) with the caveat that results were only positive when parent training was delivered to individuals and not groups. In another study (n = 62), positive effects (once results were adjusted for demographic and baseline data) were reported for the intervention group on a social skills measure. The study (n = 48) that assessed parenting skill changes compared parent training with a nondirective parent support group. Statistically significant improvements were reported for the parent training group. Two studies (n = 142) provided data on parent stress indices that were suitable for combining in a meta-analysis. The results were significant for the 'child' domain (MD -10.52; 95% CI -20.55 to -0.48) but not the 'parent' domain (MD -7.54; 95% CI -24.38 to 9.30). Results for this outcome from a small study (n = 24) suggested a long-term benefit for mothers who received the intervention at an individual level; in contrast, fathers benefited from short-term group treatment. A fourth study reported change data for within group measures of parental stress and found significant benefits in only one of the two active parent training group arms (P ≤ 0.01). No study reported data for academic achievement, adverse events or parental understanding of ADHD.

Authors' Conclusions

Parent training may have a positive effect on the behaviour of children with ADHD. It may also reduce parental stress and enhance parental confidence. However, the poor methodological quality of the included studies increases the risk of bias in the results. Data concerning ADHD-specific behaviour are ambiguous. For many important outcomes, including school achievement and adverse effects, data are lacking. Evidence from this review is not strong enough to form a basis for clinical practice guidelines. Future research should ensure better reporting of the study procedures and results.

### Adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and driving: why and how to manage it [^8f9b7820]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Driving is a complex task that can be a significant challenge for individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A slight lapse in attention or inhibition while driving (not uncommon in individuals with ADHD) can result in hazardous consequences for these individuals and their families. This is also an interesting clinical scenario for the treating physician, who is always trying to optimize the various treatment options for the patient. Despite such potentially perilous consequences for society, this subject only recently has received researchers' attention. This review paper highlights the psychological differences between drivers with and without ADHD and examines differences between these groups in various driving simulation models. Research updates involving pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions are discussed at length. Although the long-term effects of such interventions may not be clearly defined, there is enough evidence to suggest the public health significance of such interventions for optimally managing adult symptoms of ADHD.

### Prevalence of probable attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder symptoms: result from a Spanish sample of children [^081cc508]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in children. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), ADHD symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behaviour and hyperactivity. Three different presentations are recognised: the predominantly inattentive, the predominantly hyperactive/impulsive, and the combined presentation. The etiology of ADHD is complex and multidimensional and combines environmental (e.g. home discord, low socioeconomic status, institutionalized care and exposure to violence and trauma) and genetic factors.

Several studies confirm that ADHD symptoms cause a significant impairment in school tasks and in the activities of daily life. In most children with ADHD, symptoms persist into adolescence and adulthood, causing personal, social, occupational and even leisure time dysfunctions; however, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may positively influence this evolution in a such way that many young people with ADHD are able to make a good adjustment to adult life and are free of mental health problems.

- psychostimulant medications to manage ADHD when the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks

- non-stimulant medications to manage ADHD when the benefits of psychostimulant medications do not outweigh the risks

- behavioral approaches.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults: evidence base, uncertainties and controversies [^306fc4f0]. World Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was once thought to be solely a childhood condition. Now it is well established that it can persist into adulthood, with an estimated worldwide prevalence of around 2.5%. Additionally, up to 70% of individuals with childhood-onset ADHD continue to experience impairing symptoms as adults, even if they no longer meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis. The validity of adult ADHD initially faced strong criticism. Today, empirical research supports its descriptive validity (identifying characteristic signs and symptoms), predictive validity (concerning specific outcomes, courses, and responses to treatment), and concurrent validity (evidence related to its underlying causes and biological mechanisms). Despite this progress, unresolved questions and ongoing debates about adult ADHD persist. This paper summarizes current empirical evidence, alongside uncertainties and controversies, regarding the definition, epidemiology, diagnosis, etiology, neurobiology, and management of ADHD in adults. Crucially, we also include perspectives from individuals with lived experience of this condition, highlighting their views on unmet needs and priorities for improving care. Key uncertainties and controversies on adult ADHD include: a) the possibility of late-onset ADHD; b) the significance of emotional dysregulation as a core symptom; c) the definition and characterization of functional impairment; d) the persistence of comorbid psychiatric and somatic conditions after accounting for confounders; e) the relevance of executive dysfunction in the definition of the condition; f) the use of objective diagnostic measures; g) the long-term effects of treatments; and h) the role of non-pharmacological interventions. Further research on adult ADHD is urgently needed. Funding for studies on this condition lags behind that for childhood ADHD and other mental disorders in adulthood. Hopefully, efforts by clinicians, researchers and other stakeholders will ultimately help ensure that adults with ADHD are better understood, supported, and empowered to thrive.

### Current status of cognitive behavioral therapy for adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^d78b6a46]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a valid and impairing psychological disorder that persists into adulthood in a majority of cases and is associated with chronic functional impairment and increased rates of comorbidity. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches for this disorder have emerged recently, and available evidence from open and randomized controlled trials suggests that these approaches are promising in producing significant symptom reduction. A conceptual model of how CBT may work for ADHD is reviewed along with existing efficacy studies. A preliminary comparison of effect sizes across intervention packages suggests that targeted learning and practice of specific behavioral compensatory strategies may be a critical active ingredient in CBT for adult ADHD. The article concludes with a discussion of future directions and critical questions that must be addressed in this area of clinical research.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the athlete: an American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^7f08e391]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

ADHD management approach in athletes — multidisciplinary, psychosocial, and behavioral strategies: The management of ADHD in athletes includes a combination of management modalities including behavioral, psychosocial, and medication treatment options, with the ideal management provided by a multi-disciplinary team that can include a psychologist, psychiatrist, and team physician, and parents, certified athletic trainers, teachers, and coaches should also be an integral part of the multi-disciplinary team. While medications can help manage and ameliorate many signs and symptoms of ADHD, the inclusion of psychosocial treatment efforts to deal with the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive issues are thought to be a critical piece of the treatment plan; behavior modification and behavior management techniques have been effective, and treatment approaches can include parent training, specific school environment interventions, and psycho-educational or psychotherapeutic interventions with examples such as training in time management skills, social skills, and problem-solving skills. For some individuals, the combination of psychosocial treatment modalities and medication is optimal; however, other individuals may be more responsive to medication alone, and some physicians consider behavior management (nonmedication) first-line treatment, followed by medication options if necessary.

### Treatment biomarkers for ADHD: taking stock and moving forward [^84ce68bb]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The development of treatment biomarkers for psychiatric disorders has been challenging, particularly for heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Promising findings are also rarely translated into clinical practice, especially with regard to treatment decisions and development of novel treatments. Despite this slow progress, the available neuroimaging, electrophysiological (EEG) and genetic literature provides a solid foundation for biomarker discovery. This article gives an updated review of promising treatment biomarkers for ADHD which may enhance personalized medicine and novel treatment development. The available literature points to promising pre-treatment profiles predicting efficacy of various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD. These candidate predictive biomarkers, particularly those based on low-cost and non-invasive EEG assessments, show promise for the future stratification of patients to specific treatments. Studies with repeated biomarker assessments further show that different treatments produce distinct changes in brain profiles, which track treatment-related clinical improvements. These candidate monitoring/response biomarkers may aid future monitoring of treatment effects and point to mechanistic targets for novel treatments, such as neurotherapies. Nevertheless, existing research does not support any immediate clinical applications of treatment biomarkers for ADHD. Key barriers are the paucity of replications and external validations, the use of small and homogeneous samples of predominantly White children, and practical limitations, including the cost and technical requirements of biomarker assessments and their unknown feasibility and acceptability for people with ADHD. We conclude with a discussion of future directions and methodological changes to promote clinical translation and enhance personalized treatment decisions for diverse groups of individuals with ADHD.

### Brain-computer-interface-based intervention re-normalizes brain functional network topology in children with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^1638291e]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood affecting 3–10% of children. Inattention is the common presentation of ADHD, representing approximately 38–57% of all ADHD cases in the community. Children with inattention symptoms usually present with passive, lethargic attention problems or a deficit of sustained attention, such as procrastination, hesitation, and forgetfulness. Clinically significant inattention and other functional impairment greatly affect their academic performance and social interaction, resulting in increased pressure and burden on their families and society. Nevertheless, the etiological bases and neural substrates of ADHD are far from being fully understood and ADHD can be difficult to treat.

The most common treatment for ADHD is pharmacotherapy. Medications used to treat ADHD such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, and atomoxetine indicate a dopamine/norepinephrine deficit as the neurochemical basis of ADHD, but the etiology is more complex. Moreover, these agents have poor adverse effect profiles and a multitude of drug interactions. Therefore, despite the potential benefit of drug therapy for ADHD in children, medication must be dispensed with caution. Other standard therapy includes psychosocial or behavioral treatment, which may improve the social interaction problems, but have unknown efficacy for inattention problems. Recently, electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurofeedback systems have been developed as an alternative modality for attention training and shown the effectiveness of recovery of function. A few studies hypothesized that brain-computer-interface (BCI)-based neurofeedback system using specific EEG signals could induce neuroplastic changes in nervous systems. Following this hypothesis, a BCI-based attention training game system was designed for treating ADHD children with significant inattentive symptoms. The proposed system requires children to modulate their brain activity in attention training games, in which feedback represents the measured concentration level. It entails the value of maintaining player interest and utilizing the virtual situation to maximize the transferability to real-life contexts. Following the BCI-based training, parent-rated inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) showed significant improvement in children with ADHD, exhibiting perspectives to be a potential new treatment for ADHD. The treatment effects of such neurofeedback-based training in children with ADHD were thought to relate to the successful regulation of brain activity and the ability of the brain to change and adapt, known as brain plasticity.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^25bdca47]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Preschool-aged children with ADHD — medication initiation should follow severity-based criteria and evidence. Before initiating medications, "the physician should assess the severity of the child's ADHD", and "only those preschool-aged children with ADHD who have moderate-to-severe dysfunction should be considered for medication", with severity defined as "symptoms that have persisted for at least 9 months", "dysfunction… in both the home and other settings", and lack of adequate response to behavior therapy; if behavior therapy is insufficient, "medication can be prescribed". For dosing, metabolism is slower "in children 4 through 5 years of age", so "they should be given a lower dose to start" with "smaller increments", and "Maximum doses have not been adequately studied". Regarding agents and evidence, "Dextroamphetamine is the only medication approved by the FDA for use in children younger than 6 years of age", but despite on-label status "does not make it possible to recommend at this time", while most evidence is from methylphenidate: "1 multisite study of 165 children and 10 other smaller single-site studies… (total of 269 children); 7 of the 10 single-site studies found significant efficacy", though its use in preschoolers "remains off-label".

### Measurement-based care in the treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorders [^efe673ec]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood psychiatric diagnoses. The core symptoms of ADHD include inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. ADHD entails impairments that have extensive and profound detrimental effects on many critical developmental areas. As a valid neurobiologic condition that causes significant impairments in those affected, it is one of the best-researched disorders in medicine. Measurement-based care in treatment of ADHD is critical in establishing a diagnosis, determining a treatment target, and assessing treatment response. This article highlights the rationale for measurement-based care in ADHD, how to implement measurement-based care in clinical practice, and common challenges encountered.

### Challenges in defining the rates of ADHD diagnosis and treatment: trends over the last decade [^7ad44584]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Case identification

We examined data of ADHD diagnosis from the computerized database of the second largest health maintenance organization (HMO) in Israel, Maccabi Healthcare Services, which provides services to 25% of Israel's 8.4 million citizens.

In Israel, the diagnosis of ADHD and the first recommendation for medication is expected to be given by a neurologist (adult or pediatric) or a psychiatrist (adult or pediatric) and, over the past 7 years, also by qualified pediatricians recognized by the Ministry of Health upon completion of a course on ADHD diagnosis and treatment. The necessary components include the use of the updated DSM criteria and a formal diagnostic questionnaire for parents and teachers.

Using Maccabi's computerized database, the following key words were used for case identification – Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Combined Type, ADHD Predominantly Inattentive Type, ADHD Predominantly Hyperactive type, ADHD Not Otherwise Specified.

Case definition

A major challenge in defining incidence and prevalence is in case definition. A case of ADHD was defined as any child with an ADHD diagnosis aged 5–17 years (17 and 364 days) between the years 2005–2014, with a physician-recorded ADHD diagnosis and / or two purchases of ADHD medication. Children with additional diagnoses, such as autism, were not excluded.

### Psychosocial interventions in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: update [^844b862c]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common reason for referral to child and adolescent psychiatry clinics. Although stimulant medications represent an evidence-based approach to managing ADHD, psychosocial interventions for child/adolescent ADHD target functional impairments as the intervention goal, and rely heavily on behavioral therapy techniques and operant conditioning principles. Evidence-based psychosocial interventions for managing pediatric ADHD include behavioral parent training, school-based interventions relying on behavioral modification, teaching skills, and operant conditioning principles, and intensive summer treatment programs. The use of conjoint psychosocial treatments with ADHD medications may enable lower doses of each form of treatment.
