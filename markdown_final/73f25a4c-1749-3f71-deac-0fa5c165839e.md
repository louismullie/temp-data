## Question

What is the role of Prussian blue in the treatment of thallium poisoning?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of Prussian blue in the treatment of thallium poisoning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic identity and regulatory status of Prussian blue. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action in thallium poisoning. Next, I will review clinical efficacy data, including human studies and case series. After that, I need to check dosing, duration, and administration details. I will then examine safety, adverse effects, and monitoring. I should also consider special populations and drug interactions. Finally, I will integrate Prussian blue into a broader management framework and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable conclusion with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic identity and regulatory status. Prussian blue insoluble, ferric hexacyanoferrate(II), is the FDA-approved agent indicated for treatment of internal contamination with radioactive cesium and/or radioactive or non-radioactive thallium to increase elimination; it is not absorbed systemically, which shapes both its safety and mechanism of action [^1155Xypb] [^111fXoae].

> I need to verify the mechanism of action in thallium poisoning. Thallium behaves as a potassium analog and undergoes enterohepatic recirculation; Prussian blue acts by ion exchange, adsorption, and mechanical trapping of thallium in the gut, thereby reducing gastrointestinal reabsorption and shifting elimination from renal to fecal routes, which accelerates removal from the body [^116ZGWX5] [^114TKEcg].

> Next, I should review clinical efficacy. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of effect. The FDA label reports that in 34 patients with non-radioactive thallium poisoning, Radiogardase reduced the mean serum biological half-life of thallium from about 8 days to about 3 days, and CDC guidance similarly notes a reduction from roughly 8 days to 3 days, which is a clinically meaningful acceleration of elimination [^112RcJPj] [^116UowB3]. Case series and reports also describe improved outcomes when Prussian blue is combined with supportive care and extracorporeal measures in severe cases, though confounding and delayed presentation complicate interpretation [^116REGTb] [^116Uno7X].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dosing. I should confirm the labeled regimen and practical administration. Adults and adolescents receive 3 grams orally three times daily with food to stimulate bile flow and enhance enterohepatic trapping; pediatric patients 2–12 years receive 1 gram three times daily; capsules can be opened and mixed with bland food or liquid if swallowing is difficult, and treatment duration is individualized based on serial urine thallium measurements, often continuing until 24-hour urine thallium is less than 5 micrograms per liter, which may extend beyond 30 days in some cases [^115Hmdsh] [^114bTiW2]. I initially thought the adult dose was 9 grams once daily; wait, that is incorrect — it is 3 grams three times daily for a total of 9 grams per day, which I should explicitly correct here [^115Hmdsh].

> I will now examine safety and adverse effects. Constipation is the most common adverse effect, reported in about 24% of patients, and is usually manageable; blue discoloration of stools, oral mucosa, and dentition is expected and benign; clinically significant hypokalemia has been reported in a minority of patients, so electrolytes should be monitored, especially in those with cardiac disease or arrhythmias; importantly, Prussian blue is not systemically absorbed, so systemic toxicity is limited, and cyanide release is minimal and not clinically concerning at therapeutic doses [^111gTFXo] [^1132trFb] [^1131jP5x] [^112HnSbd].

> Let me consider special populations and drug interactions. Safety and efficacy are established in children 2–18 years for cesium, with pediatric data informing thallium use, though formal pediatric thallium trials are lacking; use in children under 2 years is not established due to immature biliary and GI function; in pregnancy, Prussian blue is not absorbed and thus is not expected to directly harm the fetus, but thallium itself crosses the placenta and is teratogenic, so treatment benefits generally outweigh theoretical fetal risks; no clinically meaningful drug interactions have been identified with other decorporation agents [^1146fmbD] [^112TMRVB] [^115S232t].

> But wait, what if the presentation is delayed or the exposure is elemental thallium rather than a salt. I should double-check the implications. Delayed diagnosis is common in thallium poisoning, yet Prussian blue remains effective even when started late, though earlier initiation likely improves outcomes; case reports of elemental thallium ingestion suggest that early Prussian blue plus source control (e.g., endoscopic removal of metal fragments) can be associated with asymptomatic courses despite elevated blood and urine thallium, though more data are needed to define differences in toxicity between elemental and salt forms [^115Hmdsh] [^113fqUKy] [^1177EfUo].

> Next, I should review how Prussian blue fits within a comprehensive management plan. Prussian blue is the cornerstone decorporation therapy, but severe cases warrant aggressive supportive care, consideration of multi-dose activated charcoal early in the course, forced diuresis with potassium supplementation in some protocols, and extracorporeal removal such as hemodialysis or hemoperfusion during the early distribution phase; serial clinical monitoring for neuropathy, alopecia, and systemic toxicity should guide duration and adjuncts [^114bTiW2] [^116REGTb].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise. Prussian blue insoluble is the first-line, FDA-approved agent for thallium poisoning that accelerates elimination by interrupting enterohepatic recirculation and increasing fecal excretion, typically reducing the biological half-life from about 8 days to about 3 days; it is nonabsorbed and generally safe, with constipation and blue discoloration as the main issues, and should be continued with food until 24-hour urine thallium normalizes, often for 30 days or more, alongside supportive care and adjunctive measures in severe cases [^1155Xypb] [^112RcJPj] [^116UowB3] [^114bTiW2].

---

Prussian blue (insoluble ferric hexacyanoferrate) is the **first-line therapy** for thallium poisoning because it binds thallium in the gut, interrupts enterohepatic recirculation, and increases fecal elimination, reducing the biological half-life from ~8 days to ~3 days [^116ZGWX5] [^112RcJPj]. It is **not absorbed systemically**, so it is safe in pregnancy and with other medications, but constipation and blue discoloration of stools are common [^111fXoae] [^112TMRVB] [^111gTFXo]. Dosing is 3 g orally three times daily with food for adults, continued until 24-hour urine thallium is < 5 µg/L; in severe cases, combine with activated charcoal, forced diuresis, and hemodialysis or hemoperfusion [^115Hmdsh] [^114bTiW2]. Early use improves outcomes, but delayed therapy can still be effective [^115Hmdsh] [^116REGTb].

---

## Mechanism of action

Prussian blue acts by **ion exchange, adsorption, and mechanical trapping** of thallium in the gastrointestinal tract, forming insoluble complexes that are excreted in feces [^116ZGWX5]. This interrupts enterohepatic recirculation and increases fecal elimination, reducing the biological half-life of thallium from approximately 8 days to about 3 days [^112RcJPj] [^116UowB3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting efficacy

Clinical studies and case reports demonstrate that Prussian blue **significantly reduces thallium half-life** and improves clinical outcomes:

- **FDA data**: In 34 patients with non-radioactive thallium poisoning, Prussian blue reduced the mean serum biological half-life from 8 days to 3 days [^112RcJPj].
- **Case series**: In 14 patients with delayed admission (9–19 days post-ingestion), Prussian blue combined with supportive care normalized thallium levels and improved symptoms in most patients [^116REGTb].
- **Case reports**: Early Prussian blue use, often with activated charcoal and extracorporeal methods, has been associated with favorable outcomes even in severe cases [^116Uno7X] [^117GWwtq].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

The **recommended dosage** of Prussian blue for thallium poisoning is:

| **Patient population** | **Recommended dose** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults and adolescents | 3 grams (6 capsules) | Three times daily with food |
| Pediatric patients (2–12 years) | 1 gram (2 capsules) | Three times daily with food |

---

Treatment should continue until the **24-hour urine thallium concentration is less than 5 micrograms per liter**, which may require 30 days or more [^114bTiW2]. Capsules can be opened and mixed with bland food or liquids if swallowing is difficult [^115Hmdsh].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Prussian blue is **not absorbed systemically**, resulting in a favorable safety profile [^111fXoae]. Common adverse effects include:

- **Constipation**: Occurs in approximately 24% of patients, typically mild to moderate [^111gTFXo].
- **Blue discoloration**: Stools, oral mucosa, and dentition may appear blue during treatment [^1132trFb].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia may occur, particularly in patients with pre-existing electrolyte imbalances [^1132trFb].

Prussian blue is **safe in pregnancy** because it is not absorbed systemically, though thallium itself can cross the placenta and cause fetal toxicity [^112TMRVB].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Delayed initiation**: Early administration is critical; delayed therapy may reduce efficacy but can still be beneficial [^115Hmdsh] [^116REGTb].
- **Severe toxicity**: In severe cases, Prussian blue should be combined with supportive care, activated charcoal, forced diuresis, and extracorporeal removal methods (hemodialysis or hemoperfusion) [^114bTiW2].
- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of thallium levels in urine and blood is essential to guide therapy duration and assess efficacy [^114bTiW2].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Prussian blue is **superior to other treatments** (e.g. activated charcoal, chelating agents) because it specifically targets thallium in the gut and interrupts enterohepatic recirculation. Activated charcoal may be used adjunctively but is less effective alone [^116ZGWX5].

---

Prussian blue is the **first-line therapy** for thallium poisoning, effectively reducing thallium half-life and enhancing elimination. It is safe, well-tolerated, and should be initiated promptly, with treatment individualized based on clinical severity and thallium levels.

### Soluble or insoluble prussian blue for radiocesium and thallium poisoning? [^115PpUhQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available English-language literature concerning the efficacy of soluble and insoluble Prussian blue used as a therapeutic agent in radiocesium and thallium poisoning.

Data Sources

A thorough search of MEDLINE, Toxline, and EMBASE databases (1960s-August 2003) was performed. Search terms included Prussian blue, thallium, and radiocesium poisoning. Bibliographies of relevant papers were reviewed for additional citations. study selection AND DATA EXTRACTION: Reports and studies of human trials and cases, along with animal and relevant in vitro data, were sought. Data were categorized as insoluble and soluble Prussian blue and by thallium and radiocesium poisoning.

Data Synthesis

The majority of evidence describing the efficacy of Prussian blue for radiocesium poisoning is based on the use of the insoluble form. In contrast, the majority of data supporting the efficacy of Prussian blue in thallium poisoning involves the use of the soluble form.

Conclusions

Insoluble Prussian blue has recently been approved in the US for treatment of both thallium and radiocesium poisoning. While there is sufficient evidence that the insoluble form of Prussian blue is effective in radiocesium poisoning, there is a paucity of analogous data supporting its use in thallium poisoning. Whether the physicochemical differences between soluble and insoluble Prussian blue have any effect on outcomes in human poisoning is not known.

### Quantitative measurement of cyanide released from prussian blue [^1131jP5x]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Prussian Blue (PB), ferric hexacyanoferrate is indicated for (oral) treatment of internal contamination with radioisotopes of cesium or thallium. Cyanide is 35–40% of PB's molecular composition, thus cyanide may be released during transit through the digestive tract under physiological pH. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigated the issue of cyanide release prior to drug approval to ensure the drug's benefits exceeded risks.

Objectives

To determine cyanide released from PB under pH conditions that bracket human physiological exposure.

Methods

PB was incubated in situ at pH 1.0–12, 37 degrees C for 1–48 hours. Cyanide was measured using a validated colorimetric method by UV-VIS spectroscopy.

Results

PB had the highest cyanide release at pH 1 (135 ug/g) and lowest release at pH 5.0–7.0 from the highest daily dose of PB (17.5 g) (21 ug/g). Considering the minimal lethal dose of cyanide is approximately 50 mg, the maximal cyanide released (1.6 mg) does not present a safety concern.

2.5 Treatment of Radioactive and Non-radioactive Thallium Contamination

Anticipate that treatment with Radiogardase may last 30 days or longer.
For radioactive thallium:
Base duration of Radiogardase treatment on weekly measurements of radioactivity inurine and fecal samples to monitor thallium elimination rate.
Continue Radiogardase treatment until a 24-hour urine thallium test is normal (less than 5 micrograms per liter) and radiation level is acceptable.
For non-radioactive thallium: Continue Radiogardase treatment until a 24-hour urine thallium test is normal (less than 5 micrograms per liter).
Obtain weekly laboratory evaluations (complete blood count, serum chemistry and electrolytes).
In cases of severe thallium intoxication, additional types of treatment may be necessary, such as:
Induced emesis, followed by gastric intubation and lavage
Forced diuresis until urinary thallium excretion is less than 1 mg/24 hours
Charcoal hemoperfusion may be useful during the first 48 hours after thallium ingestion (biodistribution phase).
Hemodialysis has also been reported to be effective in thallium intoxication.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Prussian blue insoluble, ferric hexacyanoferrate(II), acts by ion-exchange, adsorption, and mechanical trapping within the crystal structure, and has a high affinity for radioactive and non-radioactive cesium and thallium.

Prussian blue insoluble binds cesium and thallium isotopes in the gastrointestinal tract after these isotopes are ingested or excreted in the bile by the liver, thereby reducing gastrointestinal reabsorption (enterohepatic circulation). The rate of cesium and thallium elimination is proportional to the duration and dose of prussian blue insoluble.

### Advanced thallium toxicity [^116Uno7X]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Thallium is a highly toxic tasteless, odourless and water-soluble metal that can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled or ingested. Due to the rarity of thallium toxicity, it is frequently misdiagnosed or the diagnosis is delayed. We report a 41-year-old male landscaper admitted for acute polyneuropathy and abdominal pain. He was treated for suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome and later autoimmune encephalopathy. However, over the next 42 days, he developed worsening muscle weakness, delirium and alopecia, and was diagnosed with thallium toxicity. After combining Prussian blue, activated charcoal and continuous venovenous haemofiltration, he improved though with neuropsychiatric and neuromuscular sequelae. We highlight the need to manage information disclosure properly and to preserve evidence, when the source of a toxin is unclear.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Based on animal data, co-administration of Radiogardase with other decorporation agents does not affect the efficacy of Radiogardase for treatment of internal contamination with radioactive cesium and/or radioactive or non-radioactive thallium.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Radiogardase is not systemically bioavailable and does not rely on hepatic metabolism for activation or inactivation. However, Radiogardase may be less effective in patients with hepatic impairment, due to decreased excretion of cesium and thallium in the bile.

### A fatal case of thallium toxicity: challenges in management [^116mkzzu]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Thallium is a highly toxic compound and is occasionally involved in intentional overdoses or criminal poisonings. Accidental poisonings also occur, but are increasingly rare owing to restricted use and availability of thallium. We report a fatal suicidal ingestion of thallium sulfate rodenticide in which multi-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) and Prussian Blue (PB) were both used without changing the outcome.

Case Report

A 36 year old man ingested an unknown amount of thallium sulfate grains from an old rodenticide bottle. He presented to an emergency department (ED) 45 minutes later with abdominal pain and vomiting. On examination he was agitated with a blood pressure of 141/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 146 beats per minute (bpm). He received MDAC during his initial ED management and was started on PB 18 hours post arrival; he was intubated on the following day for airway protection. The patient continued to be tachycardic and hypertensive and subsequently developed renal failure. On hospital day three, the patient developed hypotension that did not respond to fluids. The patient required vasopressors and was transferred to a tertiary care center to undergo continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient died shortly after his transfer. His last blood thallium concentration was 5369 mcg/L, a spot urine thallium > 2000 mcg/L, and a 24- hour urine thallium was > 2000 mcg/L.

Conclusion

Though extremely rare, thallium intoxication can be lethal despite early administration of MDAC and use of Prussian blue therapy. Rapid initiation of hemodialysis can be considered in cases of severe thallium poisoning, to remove additional thallium, to correct acid-base disturbance, or to improve renal function.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Cesium-137 Contamination

In literature reports, 72 people received Radiogardase after exposure to radioactive cesium (137Cs):

46 patients with 137Cs contamination
19 patients 137Cs contamination in other incidents
7 healthy human subjects who voluntarily ingested trace doses of 137Cs

In a 1987 incident in Goiânia, Brazil, 46 patients with heavy internal contamination with 137Cs were treated with Radiogardase (Table 2). Data on the whole body effective half-life of 137Cs, during and after Radiogardase treatment, was completed on 33 of these 46 patients (see Table 2). Radiogardase reduced the mean whole-body effective half-life of 137Cs by 69%, 46%, and 43% in adults, adolescents, and younger children, respectively.

Table 2 shows the decrease in whole body effective half-life of 137Cs in patients during Radiogardase treatment compared to the half-life of 137Cs after Radiogardase discontinuation (after treatment).

Data from additional literature articles including 19 patients contaminated with137Cs in other incidents and a study of 7 human subjects who voluntarily ingested trace doses of137Cs showed a similar reduction in whole body effective half-life with Radiogardase treatment.

14.2 Thallium Contamination

Thirty-four patients treated with Radiogardase for non-radioactive thallium poisoning have been reported in the literature. Radiogardase treatment reduced the mean serum biologic half-life of thallium from 8 days to 3 days.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cesium-137 (Cs) 137Cs has a physical half-life of 30 years, with a beta energy peak at 174.0 keV. Following entry into the blood, it is distributed uniformly through all body tissues. Approximately 10% of137Cs is eliminated rapidly with a biological half-life of 2 days; 90% is eliminated more slowly, with a biological half-life of 110 days; and less than 1% of the137Cs is retained with a biological half-life of about 500 days.137Cs follows the movement of potassium and is excreted into the intestine, reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract into the blood, then to the bile, where it is excreted again into the GI tract by bile via enterohepatic circulation. Without Radiogardase treatment, about 80% of137Cs is excreted through the kidneys and about 20% in the feces.

Thallium-201 (Tl)

Radioactive thallium (201Tl) has a physical half-life of 3 days with electron and photon emissions with a gamma energy peak at 167.4 keV. Non-radioactive thallium has a biological half-life of

8–10 days. The physiologic transport of thallium follows the same route as potasium and is excreted by bile in enterohepatic circulation. Without Radiogardase treatment, the fecal to urine excretion ratio of thallium is approximately 2:1.

The results of fecal analysis from patients contaminated with137Cs and treated with Radiogardase showed higher activities of137Cs in feces, and the associated whole body radioactivity counts showed a more rapid rate of elimination from the body. The effectiveness of Radiogardase for one patient is shown in Figure 1. The whole body content of radioactive material of137Cs in kilo-Bequerels (kBq) is shown on the y-axis. Time in days is on the x-axis. Line "A" represents the whole body activity of137Cs during prussian blue insoluble treatment at 10 g/day. The dotted line represents extrapolation of the whole body activity if treatment was continued. Line "B" represents the whole body activity of137Cs, after prussian blue insoluble was stopped.

### Prussian blue insoluble capsules (Radiogardase) [^115Hmdsh]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Obtain quantitative baseline of the internalized contamination by radioactive cesium (137Cs) and/or thallium by appropriate whole-body counting and/or by bioassay (e.g., biodosimetry), or feces/urine samples, whenever possible prior to Radiogardase treatment.
Initiate treatment with Radiogardase as soon as possible after contamination is suspected. Even when delayed, treatment with Radiogardase is effective and should not be withheld.
Take Radiogardase capsules with food to stimulate excretion of cesium or thallium.
In patients who cannot tolerate swallowing large numbers of capsules, open the capsules and mix with bland food or liquids.

2.2 Decontamination Procedures for Radioactive Cesium or Thallium Contamination

Prior to initiating treatment with Radiogardase, follow radioactive decontamination safety procedures including:

Use appropriate radiation protective attire and closely monitor personnel and treatment area for radiation levels using radiation detection, indication, and computation devices (RADIAC) or thermal luminescent devices (TLD).
Control spread of radiation contamination through the establishment of a patient decontamination area and a contaminated material disposal site (with proper labeling, handling, and disposal of contaminated material).

2.3 Recommended Dosage

Adults and Adolescents: 3 grams (6 capsules) taken orally three times a day (a total daily dose of 9 grams)
Pediatric Patients (2–12 years): 1 gram (2 capsules) taken orally three times a day (a total daily dose of 3 grams)

2.4 Treatment of Radioactive Cesium Contamination

Anticipate that treatment with Radiogardase may last 30 days or longer.
Base duration of Radiogardase treatment on weekly measurements of radioactivity in urine and fecal samples to monitor cesium elimination rate.
Obtain weekly laboratory evaluations (complete blood count, serum chemistry and electrolytes).

### Attempted self-harm with elemental thallium purchased online: case report with analytical confirmation [^116MZMXY]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

This case poses several clinical questions. Activated charcoal was initially given and then colonoscopy was performed due to failure of the thallium to progress through the gastrointestinal tract. Whole bowel irrigation may have obviated the need for colonoscopy. Gastric lavage may also be considered in patients who present shortly after ingestion, if it is suspected that there is thallium in the stomach, but was not performed here as the thallium was already past the pylorus of the stomach on the first x-ray. Due to its similar ionic radius, it has been reported that potassium supplementation may enhance thallium elimination, but this practice is not universally recommended and was not pursued in this patient. Extracorporeal removal of thallium with hemodialysis or hemoperfusion may be considered in severely poisoned patients, but as this patient remained clinically stable and asymptomatic this was not pursued. N-acetylcysteine in thallium toxicity has also been described but was not utilized in this case. The use of serum thallium concentrations to guide management is not well described. In this case serum thallium concentrations took several days to result, limiting the real-time utility in guiding management of the patient. Case reports describe administering 150–250 mg/kg/day of Prussian blue divided into 2–4 doses, while the prescribing information recommends 3 g every 8 h. The end points for Prussian blue therapy are not well described, with some authors advocating for treatment with Prussian blue until a 24-hour urine thallium concentration falls below 0.5 mg/day. In this case, Prussian blue was continued for 30 days as recommended by the manufacturer. Prussian blue is known to enhance elimination of thallium and it was decided to continue it until the patient's blood thallium concentrations approached undetectable levels. It is not known if shorter regimens could be used for patients without symptoms.

### Minutes to hours after a nuclear event: available radiation poisoning antidotes and practical considerations on possible urgent approaches [^111gW27q]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of long-term effects is presumably more likely the higher the dose of radiation absorbed, but it is impossible to establish a threshold below which they can be ruled out. The severity of these long-term effects is also not dose-dependent, and they are described as stochastic because they are difficult to predict and influenced by a number of variables. The most common outcomes of a stochastic effect of internal contamination are various forms of cancer, leukemia, and genetic defects because the radiation damages the structure of nucleic acids. To limit such stochastic effects, it is therefore important to prevent the incorporation and deposition of radionuclides in target organs as much as possible. The molecules used for this purpose act mostly through the following mechanisms: inhibiting gastrointestinal absorption with the aid of sequestering agents, displacing the radionuclide by administering its non-radioactive counterpart, forming complexes with chelating agents, and ingesting substances that stimulate the radionuclides' excretion. The antidotes used for decorporation therapy are mostly administered off-label. Most of these treatments have not been authorized by the regulatory agencies for this specific therapeutic indication. Prussian blue, potassium iodide (KI), calcium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Ca-DTPA), and zinc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Zn-DTPA) are the only antidotes authorized for decontamination purposes: Prussian blue for radioactive cesium; KI for iodine; and Ca- or Zn-DTPA for plutonium, americium, or curium. As clinical trials would be unthinkable for ethical reasons, the available safety and efficacy data come mainly from experience gained in the field after nuclear accidents and from animal studies. Considering the most common sources of contamination and the available international guidelines and scientific literature, we identified a list of antidotes potentially suitable (in adult population) for widespread use. These antidotes are listed in Table 1, together with their mode of administration, and suggested dosages. The "cocktail" use of antidotes in patients simultaneously contaminated with multiple isotopes is a complex issue that goes beyond the aim of this paper. The reader should however be aware that one antidote could counteract the efficacy of another one (such as for example bicarbonate for uranium + DTPA for plutonium) or even present harmful side effects if combined.

### Attempted self-harm with elemental thallium purchased online: case report with analytical confirmation [^117GWwtq]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Thallium is a multiorgan toxin that can cause both acute and delayed onset toxicity. Immediate early symptoms of toxicity include primarily gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. In the days to weeks after exposure, neurologic manifestation such as painful neuropathy, delirium, and coma may develop. Multiorgan failure with acute kidney injury, sinus tachycardia, pericardial effusion, and respiratory depression may also develop in this time frame. Dermatologic manifestations such as alopecia or leukonychia striata (Mee's lines) may develop at any time and last for a prolonged period. For patients who survive an acute episode of thallotoxicosis, dermatologic and neurologic manifestations may persist for weeks. Thallotoxicosis is in the differential diagnosis of an unexplained peripheral neuropathy, rapid-onset alopecia, and severe multiorgan failure. In this case, the patient was assessed for these signs and symptoms development while in the hospital and during outpatient follow-up. With a peak serum thallium concentration of 438.1 mcg/L, this patient had a concentration in a range similar to other patients that developed symptoms ranging from alopecia and neuropathy, to multiorgan failure and death. Direct comparison of serum thallium concentrations is challenging as there commonly is a delay in diagnosis, and the true peak serum concentration is often unknown. Additionally, asymptomatic thallium exposures are likely under-reported and corollary serum thallium concentration known to produce symptoms is not known. There may be several reasons why our patient remained asymptomatic. The patient's exposure was known immediately, and they promptly received activated charcoal, known to adsorb thallium. They were also started on Prussian blue to enhance elimination of thallium as soon it was available to the hospital. Although this hospital was able to obtain Prussian blue rapidly, it is an uncommon antidote and there may be delays in obtaining it. Prussian blue is an oral cation exchange resin that decreases luminal thallium absorption and interferes with enterohepatic recirculation. Soluble Prussian blue may adsorb thallium better than insoluble Prussian blue. Prussian blue reduces the half-life of thallium and may decrease thallium content in end organs. The patient also had a relatively short time to colonoscopy to remove the source thallium metal. Despite these interventions the patient still had a relatively high serum thallium concentration, and timely treatment does not entirely explain his lack of symptoms.

### Long-term stability study of prussian blue – A quality assessment of water content and cyanide release [^112HnSbd]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Prussian blue, ferric hexacyanoferrate is approved for (oral) treatment of internal contamination with radioisotopes of cesium or thallium. Cyanide makes up 35–40% of Prussian blue's molecular composition; thus, cyanide may be released during transit through the digestive tract under physiological pH conditions.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term stability of Prussian blue drug products and active pharmaceutical ingredients and its impact on cyanide release. The study involves the determination and comparison of the loss in water content and cyanide released from Prussian blue under pH conditions that bracket human physiological exposure.

Methods

Test samples of active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product were stored for 10 years at ambient temperatures that mimic warehouse storage conditions. Water loss from Prussian blue was measured using thermogravimetric analysis. An in vitro physiological pH model that brackets gastric exposure and gastrointestinal transit was utilized for cyanide release. Prussian blue was incubated in situ at pH: 1.0, 5.0, and 7.0 @ 37°C for 1–24 h. Cyanide was measured using a validated colorimetric method by UV-Vis spectroscopy.

Results

Although the water content (quality attribute) of Prussian blue active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product decreased by about 10.5% and 13.8%, respectively, since 2003, the cyanide release remained comparable. At pH of 7.0 for 24 h cyanide released from active pharmaceutical ingredient-1 was 21.33 ± 1.76 μg/g in 2004, and 28.45 ± 3.15 μg/g in 2013; cyanide released from drug product-1 was 21.89 ± 0.56 μg/g in 2004, and 27.31 ± 5.78 μg/g in 2013. At gastric pH of 1.0 and upper gastrointestinal pH of 5.0, the data for active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug products were also comparable in 2013. The cyanide release is still pH-dependent and follows the same trend as observed in 2003 with minimum release at pH of 5.0 and maximal release at pH of 1.0. In summary, this is the long-term stability study of Prussian blue which correlates cyanide release to water loss. Cyanide released from Prussian blue was maximum at pH of 1.0 (47.47 μg/g) and minimum at pH of 5.0–7.0 (20.01 μg/g).

Conclusions

Based on maximal dose, maximal residence time in stomach and intestine, the maximal cyanide released from Prussian blue is about 1.31 mg, which is far below the minimal lethal dose of cyanide of 50 mg, and therefore does not present a safety concern following long-term storage.

### Magnesium hexacyanoferrate nanocatalysts attenuate chemodrug-induced cardiotoxicity through an anti-apoptosis mechanism driven by modulation of ferrous iron [^116GaySY]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Dexrazoxane (DXZ), as the only iron capture agent that is clinically used for cardioprotection, can effectively chelate intracellular ferrous ions with its ketone groups to prevent the ferrous-dependent Fenton reaction. However, DXZ suffers from a limited number of ferrous species chelation sites. In addition, DXZ has also been questioned for its secondary side effect of myelosuppression and interference with antitumour therapeutics. Recently, Kim and co-workers developed ε-poly — lysine-directed multi-deferoxamine-conjugated nanochelators with greatly improved pathological ferrous ion clearance performance. Nevertheless, their chelation effects for ferrous ions are not strong enough compared to chemical capture into the hexacyanoferrate lattice.

Nanocatalysts with multienzyme-like antioxidative activity have been designed and employed in living organisms to treat a variety of pathologies in biomedicine, such as reperfusion-induced injury, acute kidney injury and inflammatory bowel diseases –. Owing to their specific electronic structure, these nanocatalysts, such as Co 2+ -containing metal-organic frameworks, iron-containing carbon nanozymeand the Cu 2+ -containing tannic acid nanosheets, show excellent and stable antioxidative enzymatic catalytic activities mimicking superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Ferric hexacyanoferrate (Fe 4 [Fe(CN) 6] 3), also known as Prussian blue (PB), has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a detoxification agent to treat radioactive caesium (Cs) or thallium (Tl) contamination in patients with guaranteed in vivo biocompatibility and biosafety. PB nanoparticles have been engineered into various structures to serve as nanotherapeutic agents for drug delivery, antioxidation, etc. Nanoparticles of the PB analogue PBA have also been synthesized as multifunctional nanotherapeutics by substituting non-iron species for ferrous and/or ferrite species. Interestingly, PBA nanoparticles are highly potent iron chelators, as iron-based PB features a low solubility product constant of 3.3 × 10 −41, which is far lower than those of its non-iron-based counterparts, endowing the PBA nanoparticles with the prominent capability of capturing ferrous species by reforming the initial PB nanoparticles with exceptionally high kineticsdisplaying great potential and broad prospects in biomedical applications.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Radioactive Cesium Contamination The safety and efficacy of Radiogardase in the treatment of137Cs in pediatric patients ages, 2 to 18 years old, was established from data from Radiogardase-treated pediatric patients exposed to137Cs in the Goiânia, Brazil, contamination incident and from Radiogardase-treated adults exposed to137Cs [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Overall, 27 pediatric patients received Radiogardase in the range of 3 to 10 grams per day in divided doses (the maximum recommended adolescent dosage is 9 grams per day). Radiogardase treatment reduced the whole body effective half-life of137Cs by 46% in adolescents and by 43% in children aged 4 to 12 years of age. In 12 patients for whom the rate of radiation elimination data are available, the rate was similar to that in adults treated with 3 grams three times daily and in pediatric patients treated with 1 gram three times daily. By body weight, the dose ranged from

0.32 gram/kg in the 12-year old patient (10 gram Radiogardase daily dose, 31 kg weight) to

0.21 gram/kg in the 4 year old patient (3 gram Radiogardase daily dose, 14 kg weight) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Pediatric patients aged 2 up to 4 years are expected to have biliary and gastrointestinal function that is comparable to that of a 4-year old.

The safety and efficacy of Radiogardase has not been established in the treatment of137Cs contamination in pediatric patients 0 to 2 years old. There are differences in the developmental maturity of the biliary system and gastrointestinal tract of neonates and infants (0–2 years). The dosage-related adverse reactions of Radiogardase on an immature gastrointestinal tract are not known.

Radioactive and Non-Radioactive Thallium Contamination The safety and efficacy of Radiogardase for the treatment of radioactive and non-radioactive thallium contamination in pediatric patients has not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

The safety and efficacy of Radiogardase in patients aged 65 and over have not been evaluated, to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects\. In general, elderly patients should be monitored closely, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### How prussian blue works | Radiation emergencies… [^112Gk8gy]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Additional languages Text equivalent How Prussian blue works Prussian blue is a pill that may be used in a radiation emergency to help remove radioactive cesium and thallium from inside a person's body. Prussian blue traps radioactive cesium and thallium in the intestines and keeps them from being reabsorbed by the body. The radioactive materials then move through the intestines and are passed in bowel movements. Because Prussian blue reduces the time that radioactive cesium and thallium stay in the body, it helps limit the amount of time the body is exposed to radiation. Prussian blue is available only by prescription. Public health and medical professionals will determine if Prussian blue is needed. People SHOULD NOT take Prussian blue artist's dye in an attempt to treat themselves. This type of Prussian blue is not designed to treat radioactive contamination and can be harmful. Learn more.

### Management of thallium poisoning in patients with delayed hospital admission [^116REGTb]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical features and management of thallium poisoning in patients with delayed hospital admission.

Methods

Fourteen patients (median age 36 years) were admitted 9–19 days after ingesting food poisoned with thallium. Clinical and laboratory data, including blood and urine thallium concentrations, were collected. Patients were treated with oral Prussian blue, a chelating agent sodium dimercaptosulfonate, and hemodialysis.

Results

All patients experienced a triad of symptoms of acute gastrointestinal upset, painful combined polyneuropathy, and hair loss after consuming poisoned food. Fatigue and skin pigmentation were observed in all patients. Abnormal liver function tests were found in 6 (42.9%) and delirium and coma were identified in 4 (28.6%). Two weeks after the poisoning, the blood and urine thallium concentration ranged from 219.0 to 1414.4 μg/L (median: 535.3) and 956.5 to 11285.0 μg/L (median: 7460.0), respectively. One patient (7.1%) with a previous history of pulmonary fibrosis died of respiratory failure in hospital. Symptoms were improved and blood or urine thallium levels were normalized in the remaining 13 patients before discharge. After a 6.5 ± 1-month follow-up, 1 patient (7.1%) developed deep venous thrombosis in the left lower limb. In another patient (7.1%), numbness in the lower limbs remained.

Conclusion

Acute thallium poisoning is commonly manifested by gastrointestinal upset, painful polyneuropathy, and significant hair loss. Treatment strategies included Prussian blue and hemodialysis, which were associated with a good outcome in this case series.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category C It is not known whether Radiogardase can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or if it can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with prussian blue insoluble. However, since Radiogardase is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, effects on the fetus are not expected.

Radioactive cesium (137Cs) crosses the human placenta. One patient, contaminated with 0.005 mCi137Cs during her 4thmonth of pregnancy, was not treated with Radiogardase. At birth, the concentration of137Cs was the same in the mother and the infant.

Thallium crosses the human placenta. Reported fetal effects include failure to thrive and death. The toxicity from untreated radioactive cesium or thallium exposure is greater than the potential reproductive toxicity of Radiogardase.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Studies to determine if Radiogardase is excreted in human milk have not been conducted. Since Radiogardase is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, its excretion in milk is unlikely. However, cesium and thallium are transmitted from mother to infant in breast milk. Women internally contaminated with cesium or thallium should not breastfeed.

### Attempted self-harm with elemental thallium purchased online: case report with analytical confirmation [^113fqUKy]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thallium is a highly toxic metal, with most publications demonstrating poisoning from thallium salts. We report on a patient with elevated serum and urine thallium concentrations from an intentional ingestion of elemental thallium purchased from the internet for self-harm.

Case Report

The regional poison center was contacted about an 18-year-old man who ingested a fragment from a 100-gram bar reported to be elemental thallium. Serial serum and urine thallium concentrations were obtained. Prussian blue was started on hospital day (HD) 2. A metal fragment was seen on abdominal x-ray and removed via colonoscopy on HD3. The ingested fragment was analyzed via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and found to be 87.0% elemental thallium. The initial serum thallium concentration obtained on HD1 was 423.5 mcg/L (reference range < 5.1 mcg/L), which subsequently decreased to 4.5 mcg/L, 29 days after the ingestion. An initial random urine thallium concentration obtained on HD 3 was 1850.5 mcg/g creatinine (reference range < 0.4 mcg/g creatinine). The patient remained hospitalized for 23 days and, when seen in follow-up, had not developed any signs or symptoms of thallium toxicity.

Discussion

Elemental thallium ingestion is a rare toxicologic exposure, with limited published clinical and analytical experience to guide management. This case report describes a patient with ingestion of elemental thallium who developed elevated serum and urine thallium concentrations and was treated with Prussian blue. Despite having elevated serum and urine thallium concentrations consistent with previous fatal exposures, more evidence is needed to understand the differences between elemental thallium and thallium salts.

### Attempted self-harm with elemental thallium purchased online: case report with analytical confirmation [^117XGa6b]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Report

An 18-year-old man was brought to the hospital from school after a self-harm attempt by ingesting a metal bar suspended in mineral oil purchased online and believed to be composed of elemental thallium (Images 1 a and 1 b). The patient's initial vitals were blood pressure 128/76 mmHg, heart rate 64 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. He had no acute complaints and a normal physical examination. Initial laboratory analysis included a normal basic metabolic panel (BMP), a normal complete blood count (CBC), and normal liver function tests (LFTs). An abdominal radiograph showed a radiopaque foreign body in the small bowel (Image 2 a). On recommendation from the poison center, the patient received 30 g of activated charcoal and was admitted to the hospital for observation. In order to facilitate passage of the radiopaque foreign body, the patient was given 17 g of oral polyethylene glycol twice a day. Oral insoluble Prussian blue (Radiograms™, McGuff Pharmaceuticals), 3 g three times daily was started empirically on hospital day (HD) 2, prior to the result of any diagnostic test for thallium. Serial abdominal radiographs were performed to assess the passage of the radiopaque foreign body (Image 2 b). Colonoscopy was performed on HD 3 to remove the foreign body due to non-progression on serial x-rays (Image 2 c). Testing via ICP-MS by the Environmental and Chemical Laboratory Services Lab in Trenton, NJ, found that the mineral oil surrounding the metal bar contained trace amounts of thallium, 0.00856% by weight. The metal bars recovered from the scene and the patient (image 1 c) appeared to be dark after being exposed to air for several days and potentially oxidized, however both were sent for testing. The metal bar obtained from the scene was tested, and determined to be 90.5% thallium by weight, and the metal bar removed from the patient was 87.0% thallium by weight. The lab was unable to further determine if the thallium present was in an elemental or ionic form. Neither sample was 100% thallium and it is unknown if the remainder of the sample was composed of other metals or reflective of weight of oxygen in thallium oxides.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of prussian blue insoluble. No study on impairment of male or female fertility and reproductive performance has been conducted in animals.

13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology

Absorption/Elimination In an animal study (pigs, n = 38), after a single dose of 40 mg of labeled prussian blue insoluble, 99% of the administered prussian blue dose was excreted unchanged in feces. Absorption from multiple doses has not been studied.

In a study using rats (n = 40, mean body weight range of 188–219 grams) injected with137Cs, a dose response relationship was demonstrated for the amount of radiation elimination with prussian blue insoluble at doses of 1 to 50 mg/day (Table 1). There is little difference in radiation elimination rate between prussian blue insoluble at doses of 50 to 100 mg/day. In Table 1, the % of Injected Radiation Dose Remaining is defined as the percentage of the total injected dose of137Cs remaining in the body at 96 hours post administration.

In studies of rats, pigs, and dogs that were internally contaminated with cesium and thallium, the presence of the insoluble complexes in the gastrointestinal lumen changed the primary elimination route from the kidney to the feces and increased the rate of elimination of these two contaminants.

Due to the concerning nature of this patient's ingestion, he was kept in the hospital to observe for both the development of symptoms, and serial laboratory testing. Over his 22-day hospitalization, serum thallium concentrations declined (Fig. 1). On HD 8, the first resulted serum thallium concentration obtained three hours after ingestion was 423.5 mcg/L (reference range < 5.1 mcg/L). Random spot urine thallium concentrations were also obtained and were elevated, with an initial concentration of 1850.5 mcg thallium/g creatinine on HD 3 (reference range < 0.4 mcg/g). A 24-hour urine thallium concentration was not obtained due to difficulty collecting the sample. The patient did not develop any signs or symptoms of thallium toxicity such as alopecia, eczematous skin rashes, diarrhea, constipation, painful ascending neuropathy, ataxia, pleuritic chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia, acute kidney injury, multiorgan failure, or coma. The patient continued Prussian blue for a total of thirty days. When evaluated in medical toxicology clinic, 38 days after ingestion, the patient remained asymptomatic. After discussing with the patient and his family, it was determined that there was no ongoing source of thallium exposure in the house or occupational setting. The patient's last detectable blood thallium concentration was 2.4 mcg/L, 44 days after ingestion. At the last outpatient evaluation, 86 days after ingestion, he remained asymptomatic, had an undetectable blood thallium concentration, and normal CBC, BMP, and LFTs. Scalp hair obtained from the patient at this visit did not reveal any obvious dark pigmentation when evaluated under a light microscope when compared to a control hair (Tuword Microscopes, 40X magnification). Consent for publication of this case was obtained and provided to the journal in accordance with JMT policy.

### Microbial synthesis of prussian blue for potentiating checkpoint blockade immunotherapy [^11161NZx]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Cancer immunotherapy has been revolutionizing oncology and demonstrating varying degrees of success in certain solid cancers –. For instance, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can be applied to durably eliminate tumors by inhibiting intrinsic down-regulators of immunity, thus boosting the therapeutic efficacy. However, clinical data suggest that only a small fraction (10–30%) of patients respond to the ICB. Cancer nanomedicine, in combination with immunotherapy, offers great potential to amplify antitumor immune responses and sensitize tumors to immunotherapy in a safe and effective manner. For instance, photo-based hyperthermia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to induce immunogenic cell death for enhanced tumor immunogenicity. The natural world provides a host of materials and inspiration for the field of nanomedicine. Recently, biological membrane-involved nanotechnology has been widely used in fabricating nanoplatforms for drug delivery, immune manipulation, and cancer treatment –. Although with promises, there are still some challenges, such as complicated procedures and large-scale manufacturing, in terms of clinical translation.

### Life-threatening torsades de pointes resulting from "natural" cancer treatment [^11258MW9]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nonradioactive cesium chloride (CsCl) is used by some alternative medicine advocates as a treatment for cancer. The therapy was proven to be neither safe nor effective. Chronic use of CsCl has resulted in cases with severe cardiotoxicity.

Case Report

A 65-year-old lady presented to our hospital's accident and emergency department with recurrent syncope attacks. Electrocardiogram monitoring showed QT prolongation and transient Torsades de Pointes (TDP) ventricular tachycardia. She was taking anticancer naturopathic drugs for 6 weeks before admission. One of her naturopathic drugs was subsequently confirmed containing 89% CsCl by weight. Besides conventional treatment of QT prolongation and TDP, the patient was given a 4-week course of oral Prussian blue to enhance gastrointestinal elimination of cesium. The serum half-life of cesium was reduced from 61.7 to 29.4 days after the use of Prussian blue. QT prolongation was normalized in 27 days.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first published case of nonradioactive cesium poisoning treated with Prussian blue. A transient rise in serum cesium level was observed during Prussian blue therapy. Possible explanations for this observation include poor drug compliance during outpatient treatment and redistribution of cesium from body stores.

Conclusion

Nonradioactive CsCl poisoning can result in severe cardiotoxicity with QT prolongation and TDP ventricular tachycardia. The key points in the management of nonradioactive cesium poisoning include cessation of cesium exposure, vigorous electrolytes replacement, and oral Prussian blue therapy.

### Chelation for heavy metals (arsenic, lead, and mercury): protective or perilous? [^113eLfyv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Despite clinical experience that spans more than half a century, chelation for toxic heavy metals represents one of the most controversial and misapplied interventions in clinical toxicology. The prompt use of chelating agents to treat acute, life-threatening intoxication is an indication that is largely supported by experimental animal data and limited clinical research. Although chelating agents administered for chronic intoxication may accelerate the excretion of heavy metals, their therapeutic efficacy in terms of decreased morbidity and mortality is largely unestablished. Recent investigations suggest that their use in such settings might be associated with deleterious effects. Careful attention to risk-benefit issues is warranted, particularly in clinical situations in which the etiological role of heavy metals in the patient's illness is in question.

### Emergency department management of patients internally contaminated with radioactive material [^117Ngqf2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

After a radiation emergency that involves the dispersal of radioactive material, patients can become externally and internally contaminated with 1 or more radionuclides. Internal contamination can lead to the delivery of harmful ionizing radiation doses to various organs and tissues or the whole body. The clinical consequences can range from acute radiation syndrome to the long-term development of cancer. Estimating the amount of radioactive material absorbed into the body can guide the management of patients. Treatment includes, in addition to supportive care and long term monitoring, certain medical countermeasures like Prussian blue, calcium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and zinc DTPA.

### Methylene blue: an antidote for methemoglobinemia and beyond [^112vVyjR]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Methylene blue has been in medicinal use for centuries and is best known as an antidotal treatment for acquired methemoglobinemia (MetHB). More recently, methylene blue has gained recognition for its efficacious use in the treatment of ifosfamide neurotoxicity and refractory vasoplegic shock in both the pediatric and adult critical care literature, extending its use beyond MetHB. Methylene blue's mechanism of action is somewhat complex and based partly on its oxidizing capabilities, ironically the same mechanism that causes MetHB. This review will examine methylene blue's use in the treatment of acquired MetHB and ifosfamide neurotoxicity and review the current literature regarding its role in critically ill pediatric and adult patients with refractory vasoplegic shock. Methylene blue's pharmacologic actions, dosing, and adverse effects will also be discussed.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Increased radiation absorbed dose to gastrointestinal mucosa: Monitor for decreased gastrointestinal motility (5.1)
Constipation: Monitor and treat (5.2)
Electrolyte abnormalities: Monitor serum electrolytes during treatment (5.3)
Blue discoloration of stool, oral mucosa and dentition (5.4)

5.1 Increased Radiation Absorbed Dose to Gastrointestinal Mucosa

Radiogardase can decrease gastrointestinal motility, thus slowing the transit time of radioactivity in the gastrointestinal tract. The slowed transit time can increase the radiation absorbed dose to the gastrointestinal mucosa.

5.2 Constipation

Radiogardase can cause constipation. Monitor and treat for signs and symptoms of constipation. Patients with disorders associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility are at higher risk.

5.3 Electrolyte Abnormalities

Radiogardase may bind to electrolytes found in the gastrointestinal tract. Hypokalemia, with serum potassium values of 2.5–2.9 (normal 3.5–5.0), was reported in 3 (7%) of 42 patients during treatement with Radiogardase. Monitor serum electrolytes during Radiogardase treatment, particularly when treating patients with pre-existing cardiac arrhythmias or electrolyte imbalances.

5.4 Blue Discoloration of Feces, Oral Mucosa, and Dentition

Radiogardase is excreted primarily in feces and turns stools blue. When Radiogardase capsules are opened and the contents eaten with food, the oral mucosa and dentition may also be colored blue.

### Unconventional hexagonal open prussian blue analog structures [^112p5nuA]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), as a classical kind of microporous materials, have attracted substantial interests considering their well-defined framework structures, unique physicochemical properties and low cost. However, PBAs typically adopt cubic structure that features small pore size and low specific surface area, which greatly limits their practical applications in various fields ranging from gas adsorption/separation to energy conversion/storage and biomedical treatments. Here we report the facile and general synthesis of unconventional hexagonal open PBA structures. The obtained hexagonal copper hexacyanocobaltate PBA prisms (H-CuCo) demonstrate large pore size and specific surface area of 12.32 Å and 1273 m 2 g − 1, respectively, well exceeding those (5.48 Å and 443 m 2 g − 1) of traditional cubic CuCo PBA cubes (C-CuCo). Significantly, H-CuCo exhibits much superior gas uptake capacity over C-CuCo toward carbon dioxide and small hydrocarbon molecules. Mechanism studies reveal that unsaturated Cu sites with planar quadrilateral configurations in H-CuCo enhance the gas adsorption performance.

### Zinc-doped prussian blue enhances photothermal clearance of Staphylococcus aureus and promotes tissue repair in infected wounds [^113hhaNX]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Antibacterial mechanism

The morphologies of bacteria (E. coli, S. aureus, MRSA and MRSA biofilm) interacting with ZnPB-3 for the L + D2 and L + D24 groups are qualitatively evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. As shown in Fig. 6a, the morphology of E. coli with no treatment (control) is rod-like and unbroken with an integrated membrane, but is irregular, corrugated or completely lysed (red arrow) when treated with ZnPB-3 for the L + D2 and L + D24 groups. Similarly, compared with S. aureus and MRSA without treatment, S. aureus and MRSA interacting with ZnPB-3 in the L + D2 and L + D24 groups become corrugated and distorted or even partly lysed, as shown in Fig. 6b, c. Moreover, the degree of bacterial destruction in the L + D24 group is more serious than that in the L + D2 group. Even for MRSA biofilm, ZnPB-3 in the L + D2 and L + D24 groups has effective lethality against bacteria. The vast majority of treated bacteria are fused together due to the destruction of their membranes (Fig. 6d).

### Zinc-doped prussian blue enhances photothermal clearance of Staphylococcus aureus and promotes tissue repair in infected wounds [^1118kjHY]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Theoretical calculations of band structure and density of states (DOS) of a PB, b ZnPB-1, c ZnPB-2 and d ZnPB-3. e Scheme of bandgap-narrowing effect with the increase of Zn-doped density by theory and experiment, and mechanism of enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency with the increase of Zn-doped density. Source data are provided as a Source Data file

According to the computational modelling of the electron distribution shown in Fig. 1, the electronic density increases with increasing Zn doping density, which leads to a change in the major electronic transition in the NIR regime from the bandgap to the LSPRs of ZnPB. LSPR originates from the collective and coherent oscillations of the free carriers (namely, electrons or holes) in resonance with the incident light frequency. The band structure modification of ZnPB will affect LSPR modulation. Zn-doped PB exhibits tuneable LSPR characteristics through carrier density modulation, dependent on the size, dopant concentration, and dopant distribution inside the MOFs –. That is, Zn dopant hybridization with the bands of the host lattice of PB, as well as the interplay of the crystal structure, determines the LSPR characteristics, and a proportional change in the carrier concentration will cause a significant shift in the LSPR optical behaviour. The effect of LSPRs contributes to the NIR absorbance of both PB and ZnPB, which is mainly ascribed to the collective oscillations of free charge carriers of [Fe(CN) 6] vacancies. When more Zn ions occupy the lattice sites to form Fe−C≡N−Zn, the concentration of the [Fe(CN) 6] vacancy will decrease, leading to the redshift of the LSPR peak towards lower energies. Additionally, the electronic transition between {Fe III [(t 2g)3(e g) 2]Fe II [(t 2g) 6]} and {Fe II [(t 2g) 4 (e g) 2]Fe III [(t 2g) 5]} results in NIR absorbance in PB. Therefore, the presence of Zn ions in the lattice sites of PB will change the orbital energies and electron density of the cyanide bonds, which also leads to a redshift of the NIR absorbance peak of PB. This is the reason why an increasing number of Zn ions present in the lattice sites of PB can optimize the NIR absorbance and enhance the photothermal conversion efficiency. In summary, the mechanism of the enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency of ZnPB is ascribed to the bandgap-narrowing effect and the redshifted LSPR towards lower energies with increasing Zn doping density. More importantly, the underlying mechanism of band structure modulation and LSPR can offer valuable insights for tailoring optical properties through theoretical and experimental understanding of the modulation principles.

Red arrows show severe damage and obvious cytoplasm leakage of bacteria. Source data are provided as a Source Data file

As shown in Fig. 6e, in the case of the control groups, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show the normal structures of MRSA, that is, regular spherical shapes with intact bacterial membranes. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detection shows no signal of Zn and a small amount of Fe (0.14%) in bacteria. In contrast, the membranes of MRSA interacting with ZnPB-3 are severely damaged and show obvious cytoplasm leakage (Fig. 6e, red arrows), which is caused by the synergistic antibacterial action of heat and ion release. In addition, the EDS spectra show that the Zn and Fe content in bacteria in the L + D24 group (Fe 3.99% and Zn 2.27%) is higher than that in the L + D2 group (Fe 1.46% and Zn 0.71%). Accordingly, the L + D24 group exhibits much higher antibacterial efficacy than the L + D2 group does. That is, the synergistic action of local heat triggered by the photothermal effect and release of Zn 2+, Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ions plays a key role in bacteria killing.

The mechanism underlying the broad-spectrum bactericidal action of ZnPB-3 is illustrated in Fig. 6f. First, the photothermal effect of ZnPB-3 will effectively damage the bacterial membrane and increase its permeability. The destruction of the bacterial membrane will result in reduced of heat resistance of the cell membrane, leading to further permeation by released ions. Meanwhile, the local heat triggered by the photothermal effect accelerates the release of ions. The released Zn 2+, Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ can rapidly penetrate bacteria, resulting in disturbance of the intracellular metabolic pathways of bacteria and enhancing the bactericidal efficiency. The collaborative action of local photothermy and released ions provides a broad-spectrum antibacterial strategy and brings more insight and understanding of the antibacterial application.

### Thallium and arsenic poisoning in a small midwestern town [^111SgdGW]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Thallium and arsenic have been used as a means of criminal poisoning. Although both manifest characteristically with peripheral neuropathies, thallium is associated with alopecia and arsenic with gastrointestinal symptoms. We describe the symptoms, physical findings, diagnostic test results, and outcomes in a group of men poisoned with thallium and arsenic. Seven patients had evidence of elevated thallium levels, and 2 patients had elevated arsenic and thallium levels. The most commonly reported symptoms included myalgias, arthralgias, paresthesias, and dysesthesias. Five patients developed alopecia. All patients with symptoms and peripheral neuropathies had characteristic blackening of their hair roots. Initially treated with dimercaptosuccinic acid, patients were switched to multiple-dose activated charcoal after testing revealed thallium poisoning. By 6 months, all patients' symptoms and peripheral neuropathies improved, but 5 patients had ongoing psychiatric problems. Thallium remains a means of criminal poisoning and should be considered in any patient with a rapidly progressing peripheral neuropathy with or without alopecia.

### Iron overload in the HCT patient: a review [^111g4BiM]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Iron overload (IO) is common in hematologic malignancies and hemoglobinopathies, largely due to red cell transfusion burden. End-organ damage from IO occurs via reactive oxygen species-mediated pathways. The impact of pretransplant IO on hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) morbidity and mortality remains contentious; studies have shown mixed results, possibly due to variability in study population and design, as well as markers of IO. Ferritin has served as a traditional circulating marker of total body IO, but liver iron content by MRI appears to be a better marker of end-organ involvement. Novel surrogate markers including hepcidin, marrow Prussian blue staining, and labile plasma iron levels may prove to be more specific for HCT complications. Posttransplant phlebotomy, chelation, or both in combination remains the mainstays of treatment, though may ultimately be supplanted by pretransplant or peri-transplant use of bone marrow maturation agents or targeted chelation at time of highest IO risk. This review discusses the pathophysiology of IO in hematologic disease, the evidence supporting and refuting its negative impact on HCT outcomes, as well as current and future therapies.

In vivo PTT for MRSA wound infections

Based on the encouraging results of the above-described antibacterial mechanism, the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of ZnPB-3 is evaluated using an animal MRSA wound model, and the related scheme is shown in Fig. 7a. The synergistic antibacterial action of heat and ion release from ZnPB-3 can rapidly eradicate MRSA in wounds. To balance the antimicrobial efficiency and toxicity to healthy tissue during PTT, an appropriate range of temperatures for PTT with ZnPB-3 for 15 min is explored in Supplementary Fig. 15, and the corresponding antimicrobial efficiency and toxicity to healthy tissue are evaluated. Specifically, the antimicrobial ratio is more than 90% (P < 0.001) when the maximum temperature for PTT is more than 55 °C after 15 min. However, the obvious toxicity to healthy tissue can be observed by the corresponding photographs (yellow arrows mark damaged tissue), and the inflammatory response can be observed by in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (red arrows mark lobulated neutrophils) due to hyperthermia, when the maximum temperature for PTT is more than 60 °C after 15 min. Based on the above results, the appropriate temperature (maximum is ~55 °C) is chosen for subsequent PTT evaluations. Based on the high photothermal conversion efficiency of ZnPB-3 in vitro, PTT for MRSA wound infection in vivo is carried out as shown in Fig. 7b. MRSA-infected rats are anaesthetized and exposed to an 808-nm NIR laser at a power density of 0.3 W cm −2, which is within the scope of the maximum permissible exposure for skin exposure formulated by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI Z136.1–2000), and the infected wound-site temperature rapidly increases from ∼35 °C to ∼55 °C over 15 min of laser irradiation. In comparison, the temperature of the control group under only 808 nm NIR laser irradiation shows no significant change.

### Zinc-doped prussian blue enhances photothermal clearance of Staphylococcus aureus and promotes tissue repair in infected wounds [^114vfd9Y]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To systematically evaluate the separate antimicrobial efficiency of the corresponding heat and ion release of ZnPB-3, incubation is performed for 2 and 24 h, respectively, in the dark without the effect of ion release after L treatment, where the mixture of treated bacteria and ZnPB-3 is centrifuged and separated with fresh culture medium several times. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 11, for separate incubations for 2 h (72.16 ± 2.67%, P < 0.001) and 24 h (69.41 ± 1.72%, P < 0.001) in the dark without the effect of ion release after L treatment, a lower bacterial killing efficiency against MRSA is displayed than that for the L + D2 group and L + D24 group, further demonstrating the synergistic antimicrobial efficiency of heat and ion release of ZnPB-3. This enhanced inactivation efficiency by different treatments can be attributed to the fact that the local heat triggered by a photothermal effect not only accelerates the release of ions but also damages the bacterial membrane. That is, the photothermal effect of ZnPB-3 will effectively damage the bacterial membrane and increase its permeability, leading to further permeation of released ions and disturbance of the intracellular metabolic pathways of the bacteria. The related mechanism will be discussed later. Additionally, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 12, the ZnPB-3 group (98.59 ± 0.56%, P < 0.05) has a higher antibacterial rate than that of PB (69.46 ± 2.69%, P < 0.001), ZnPB-1 (81.18 ± 3.27%, P < 0.01) and ZnPB-2 (89.66 ± 2.36%, P < 0.05) against MRSA in the L + D24 treatment, demonstrating that ZnPB-3 has the highest antibacterial rate.

### The treatment of cyanide poisoning [^1134koBL]. Occupational Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Cyanide has gained historical notoriety as a poison used with intent to cause fatality. Its occurrence in industry is confined to a small number of uses in a relatively narrow range of industries, including the manufacture of Perspex and nylon and in electroplating. With proper controls in these settings, episodes of poisoning are extremely rare. However, because of the potential for a fatal outcome, procedures for the treatment of acute poisoning are essential. Antidotes include methaemoglobin generators, direct binding agents and sulphur donors, but there is a lack of international consensus about the treatment of choice. This article reviews the mechanisms and treatment of cyanide intoxication and emphasizes the importance of having agreed local procedures for the emergency treatment of poisoning.

### Attempted self-harm with elemental thallium purchased online: case report with analytical confirmation [^116bdrTn]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case describes a patient who ingested elemental thallium and remained asymptomatic despite having prolonged and markedly elevated blood concentrations. The diagnosis and treatment of thallotoxicosis may be delayed because of the delayed nature of symptom development, in addition to exposures being due to unrecognized malicious intent. Interpretation of diagnostics tests are challenging since testing for thallium may be performed and result many days after exposure. In one large case series of patients with thallotoxicosis, the median time from symptom onset to admission was 13 days, and patients had symptoms along with an initial mean blood thallium concentration of 293 ng/ml. In another case series, 10 patients from two families ate cakes contaminated with thallium and developed symptoms within hours. These patients had blood thallium concentrations on admission that ranged from 53 mcg/L to 1700 mcg/L, although they did not present until 5–7 days after the suspected exposure. From this series, 5 cases required ICU admission, 3 cases required mechanical ventilation, and 2 cases had evidence of cerebral edema on CT scan. Three of these 10 patients went on to have multi-organ failure and die. In another case series, four patients were exposed to thallium contaminated candies, and were started on therapies three days after exposure. It was estimated that these patients may have consumed up to 1 gram of thallium. While serum thallium concentrations were not reported, the patient with the most severe symptoms had a spot urine thallium concentration of 10,837 mcg/L on day 3, compared to our patient who had a spot urine thallium of 1850.5 mcg/g of creatinine on day 3. Although the patients had positive outcomes, they all developed symptoms, all four had alopecia and two had painful neuropathy.

### Methylene blue for distributive shock: a potential new use of an old antidote [^113SnYAi]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Methylene blue is used primarily in the treatment of patients with methemoglobinemia. Most recently, methylene blue has been used as a treatment for refractory distributive shock from a variety of causes such as sepsis and anaphylaxis. Many studies suggest that the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of distributive shock. There are some experimental and clinical experiences with the use of methylene blue as a selective inhibitor of the NO-cGMP pathway. Methylene blue may play a role in the treatment of distributive shock when standard treatment fails.

### Topical aluminum chloride and monsel's solution block toluidine blue staining in mohs frozen sections: mechanism and solution [^113xiW44]. Dermatologic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A diminished-staining artifact is observed in some Mohs frozen sections that are stained in toluidine blue (T-blue). Such an artifact, not yet described in the literature, may interfere with a Mohs surgeon's accurate reading. The authors hypothesize that topical hemostatic agents, aluminum chloride, and Monsel's solution are the causative factors.

Objective

To evaluate the aforementioned topical hemostatic agents as a potential cause of the nonstaining artifact, to propose the mechanism associated with this phenomenon, and to develop a method to prevent or rectify the problem.

Materials and Methods

Leftover Mohs frozen sections and specimens were treated with aluminum chloride or Monsel's solution and processed with routine Mohs histology.

Results

Nonstaining artifact is reproduced in aluminum chloride or Monsel's solution-treated ex vivo skin specimens. The authors found that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a chelating agent, can reverse the staining blockage. Such a finding suggests that aluminum or ferric cations bind to tissue and subsequently inhibit T-blue from interacting with the tissue. Direct binding of ferric cations to the tissue section is demonstrated with Prussian blue iron staining.

Conclusion

By rinsing Mohs frozen sections in an EDTA solution before T-blue staining, the authors could prevent hemostatic agent-induced nonstaining. Applying an EDTA wash and restaining the slides can correct the same artifact.

### Zinc-doped prussian blue enhances photothermal clearance of Staphylococcus aureus and promotes tissue repair in infected wounds [^1121uaGJ]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

ZnPB with various doping levels is controllably designed to enhance its photothermal property for combating MRSA wound infection through the optimized synergistic antibacterial effect of heat and ion release. The mechanism of enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency of ZnPB is ascribed to the bandgap-narrowing effect and the LSPR moving towards lower energy with increasing Zn doping density. Simultaneously, the relative long-term biodegradability of ZnPB is illustrated by the characteristics of short-term rapid release from the interstitial sites and long-term stable release from the lattice sites. The mechanism underlying the broad-spectrum bactericidal action of ZnPB-3 originates from synergistic local heat and released ions. The in vivo results confirm the relatively minor MRSA infection and effective antibacterial ability of ZnPB-3, and the released Zn 2+ from ZnPB-3 can improve collagen deposition to favour wound healing. Controllable regulation of a photonic MOF for combating MRSA wound infection provides a valuable alternative to current antibiotic therapies in the post-antibiotic era. Moreover, this platform will bring further insight and understanding of multidisciplinary applications not only in the treatment of MRSA infection but also in wound repair and the design of photonic MOFs.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia [^114VjX2s]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with continued production of MetHb from a long‐acting oxidant stress such as after dapsone ingestion may require repeat dosing every 6–8 h for up to 2–3 days or MB may be given as a continuous IV infusion of 0.10–0.25 mg/kg/hr.
Caution administering MB

Several patient populations are at risk for complications after MB administration. Patients with G6PD deficiency significant hemolytic anemia. Heinz body hemolytic anemia after MB administration. Paradoxically, while MB is an oxidant, its metabolic product leukomethylene blue is a reducing agent. Large doses (4 mg/kg) may result in proportionately higher levels of the oxidizing agent, MB, rather than the reducing agent, leukomethylene blue. Thus, MB may induce hemolysis, and paradoxically, worsen methemoglobinemia in patients with G6PD deficiency. In addition, because G6PD is the first enzyme in the hexose monophosphate shunt, the only source of NADPH in the erythrocyte, patients with G6PD deficiency may not produce sufficient NADPH to reduce MB to leukomethylene blue. Thus MB therapy may be ineffective in the G6PD patient with methemoglobinemia, and alternate treatments such as ascorbic acid, or in severe cases, exchange transfusion, should be considered.MB should be avoided in patients with G6PD deficiency, and ideally, all patients should be tested for G6PD deficiency before MB. In an emergency, a family history of G6PD deficiency should be sought before MB therapy is instituted.

Management of the acutely poisoned patient requires supportive care and timely administration of antidotes to minimize ongoing toxicity and mortality. New applications for old antidotes include utilization of methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin in vasoplegia. Fomepizole is also being evaluated as a potential adjunct in acetaminophen toxicity. Other advancements include individualized acetylcysteine dosing regimens for acetaminophen toxicity and carnitine supplementation in valproic acid toxicity. Additional antidote considerations include administration of lipid emulsion in lipophilic xenobiotic exposure not responsive to standard resuscitative modalities. These expert recommendations provide guidance for providers caring for the acutely poisoned patient.

- How is Prussian blue given.
- What are the side effects of Prussian blue.
- Where can I get Prussian blue. What is Prussian blue. Prussian blue is a pill that can help remove radioactive cesium and thallium from people's bodies. Back to Top. How does Prussian blue work. Prussian blue traps radioactive cesium and thallium in the intestines to keep them from being absorbed by the body. These radioactive materials move through the intestines and pass out of the body in bowel movements. Getting these materials out of the body help limit the amount of time they expose the body to radiation. Prussian blue reduces the biological half-life of cesium from about 110 days to about 30 days. The biological half-life is the amount of time it takes for the radioactive material to leave the body, which decreases its harm.
- Prussian blue reduces the biological half-life of thallium from about 8 days to about 3 days. How is Prussian blue given. Prussian blue comes in 500-milligram capsules that patients can swallow whole. If you cannot swallow pills, you can break the capsule and mix the contents in food or liquid. This may cause your mouth or teeth to turn blue during treatment. Back to Top What are the side effects of Prussian blue. The most common side effects of Prussian blue are upset stomach and constipation. You can easily treat these side effects with other medications. You may have blue feces while you take Prussian blue. Back to Top. Where can I get Prussian blue. You can only obtain Prussian blue by prescription. People SHOULD NOT take Prussian blue artist's dye in an attempt to treat themselves.

### Gadolinium deposition in the brain: lessons learned from other metals known to cross the blood-brain barrier [^1142YU4L]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The recent discovery of gadolinium (Gd) deposition in the brains of patients receiving Gd-based contrast agents (GBCAs) raises several important questions including by what mechanism Gd or GBCAs pass through the blood-brain barrier. Decades of research focused on the safety and stability of GBCAs have not identified any mechanism of uptake. Here we review findings of Gd deposition from human and animal data, and how distribution mechanisms elucidated for endogenous and toxic metals may explain entrance of Gd into the central nervous system. Three general uptake mechanisms are considered along with examples of metals known to enter the central nervous system by these routes: (1) carrier-mediated, (2) transporter-mediated and (3) passive. The potential for chelation therapy to reduce deposition is also discussed. The work reported for other metals provides guidance for how the mechanism of Gd deposition in the brain can be determined which is essential information for rational prevention or treatment.

### A review of methylene blue treatment for cardiovascular collapse [^117QEeh3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, methylene blue (MB) has been used for multiple purposes, including as an antidote for toxin-induced and hereditary methemoglobinemia, ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy, and ackee fruit and cyanide poisoning; as an aniline dye derivative, antimalarial agent, and antidepressant.

Discussion

Most recently, the use of MB has been advocated as a potential adjunct in the treatment of shock states. Our article reviews the role of MB in septic shock, anaphylactic shock, and toxin-induced shock. MB is proposed to increase blood pressure in these shock states by interfering with guanylate cyclase activity, and preventing cyclic guanosine monophosphate production and vasodilatation.

Summary

MB may be an adjunct in the treatment of septic shock, anaphylactic shock, and toxin-induced shock.

### Current and innovative emerging therapies for porphyrias with hepatic involvement [^117HtR3u]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyrias are rare inherited disorders caused by specific enzyme dysfunctions in the haem synthesis pathway, which result in abnormal accumulation of specific pathway intermediates. The symptoms depend upon the chemical characteristics of these substances. Porphyrins are photoreactive and cause photocutaneous lesions on sunlight-exposed areas, whereas accumulation of porphyrin precursors is related to acute neurovisceral attacks. Current therapies are suboptimal and mostly address symptoms rather than underlying disease mechanisms. Advances in the understanding of the molecular bases and pathogenesis of porphyrias have paved the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this Clinical Trial Watch we summarise the basic principles of these emerging approaches and what is currently known about their application to porphyrias of hepatic origin or with hepatic involvement.

### Severe chlorate poisoning successfully treated with methylene blue [^11155w9t]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorate poisoning as a cause of methemoglobinemia is regarded in current literature to be resistant to treatment by methylene blue due to the oxidizing and denaturing properties of the chlorate anion, and often leads to severe renal and hematological complications with a high mortality rate. Recent case studies suggest practitioners have eschewed the use of methylene blue in such situations.

Objectives

This report describes a case of chlorate poisoning presenting as severe methemoglobinemia successfully treated with methylene blue alone, believed to be a first in reported literature.

Case Report

A 34-year-old male construction worker presented 4 h after accidental ingestion of an industrial chemical, with giddiness and breathlessness. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormal cardiorespiratory findings, although arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry revealed an "oxygen saturation gap". Methemoglobin levels were found to be severely elevated at 66.8% 6 h after ingestion, and the patient was promptly treated with methylene blue. Clinical examination and laboratory tests suggested the absence of hemolysis at the time of treatment. The patient was discharged after a brief and uneventful hospital stay. Subsequent tests revealed the chemical ingested to be sodium chlorate.

Conclusion

The successful outcome in our case suggests that a window of opportunity as long as 6 h may exist during which treatment of chlorate poisoning with methylene blue may be of clinical value. We postulate that the absence of significant hemolysis and hematological alterations at the time of antidote administration may be a necessary prerequisite for treatment success.

### Modeling prion-like processing of tau protein in Alzheimer's disease for pharmaceutical development [^115gXFUb]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

POTENTIAL CLINICAL EFFICACY OF TAU PROTEIN AGGREGATION INHIBITOR THERAPY IN AD

Although MT has attractive properties in vitro and in transgenic mouse models as a possible treatment for the tau pathology of AD, its clinical pharmacology is complex. This is due in part to the redox lability of the molecule at physiological pH values. The best studied example is in the treatment of methemoglobinemia which is the only approved clinical indication for the use of MT. When the MT moiety is administered intravenously in its oxidized form (MT +) as methylthioninium chloride (MTC, commonly known as "methylene blue") it needs first to be reduced to its uncharged form (LMT for "leuco-MT") to permit it to cross the red cell membrane (Fig. 6). It is then concentrated inside the cell as a result of an equilibrium between the oxidized form which is favored at physiological pH and the reduced form which is maintained in an energy-dependent fashion by consumption of reduced glutathione. This dynamic equilibrium permits MT to transfer electrons to oxidized hemoglobin thereby reducing it. A similar electron shuttling mechanism is thought to underlie the ability of MT to enhance mitochondrial metabolism. It is not known whether this redox lability is critical either for dissolution of PHFs or preventing tau aggregation.

The first tau protein aggregation inhibitor (TAI) to enter clinical development was MT in its oxidized MT + form as MTC. As indicated above, MTC has a long history of safe use, both as an approved treatment for methemoglobinemia, and experimentally in urolithiasis and bipolar disorder amongst others. A phase II clinical trial was conducted between 2004–2008 in 321 subjects with mild/moderate AD The trial was designed as an exploratory double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 24-week dose-finding study of MT as monotherapy in AD to test the doses 69, 138 and 218 mg day given in divided doses three times per day on clinical and functional brain imaging (HMPAO-SPECT) outcomes.

Therefore, a similar adjustment for age was performed and this narrowed the mean differences between control and treatment groups relative to the unadjusted results (compare Supplementary Table 3 and Table 3). A pairwise comparison of the age-adjusted results for mice treated with vehicle diet versus mice treated with the verubecestat-diet found no difference in either Prussian blue object area (estimated difference = –40.1%, p = 0.137) or object number (estimated difference = –30.7%, p = 0.181) (Table 3). There was a trend for fewer numbers of objects and smaller fractional area of Prussian blue with verubecestat treatment, similar to the results observed by T2✱-MRI. Rank correlation was 0.43 between ARIA-H assessed by T2✱-MRI and assessed by Prussian blue for both number of objects and fractional area. For Prussian blue assessment, fractional area was highly correlated with number of objects, with rank correlation of 0.94. In contrast to the T2✱MRI assessment, mice treated with 3D6 displayed significantly greater age adjusted object numbers (estimated difference = 145.3%, p = 0.002) and object area (estimated difference = 179.8%, p = 0.004) of Prussian blue detected ARIA-H compared to isotype control antibody treated mice (Table 3). As a complement to the quantitative morphometry evaluation, the same sections were qualitatively evaluated for ARIA-H by light microscopy by a board certified veterinary pathologist and peer review pathologist experienced in making toxicological pathology assessments. Both pathologists were blinded to treatment group assignment. In summary, eleven mice of the sixty studied were identified as having Prussian blue staining around small blood vessels that was qualitatively greater than the background observed in the remaining mice, which was considered indicative of ARIA-H. Animals treated with 3D6 displayed the highest incidence ARIA-H (Supplementary Table 4).

### Chronic verubecestat treatment suppresses amyloid accumulation in advanced aged Tg2576 – A β PPswe mice without inducing microhemorrhage [^1113An48]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

ARIA-H events leave behind long-lived hemoglobin-derived iron deposits that can be detected by T2✱-MRI and Prussian blue histochemical staining. The spatial resolution for MRI detection of ARIA-H events was limited to a 100×100 μ 2 area and thus identified larger, less frequent events. Overall, the number of new MRI-detected ARIA-H events was small between all groups and neither chronic verubecestat nor 3D6 treatment resulted in significantly elevated ARIA-H events compared to their respective control groups. Verubecestat-treated mice displayed the lowest level of new ARIA-H events across all groups (1.45 events) relative to 3D6-treated mice which displayed the highest number of new ARIA-H events (3.81 events). In contrast, the Prussian blue detection method was able to define much smaller ARIA-H deposits and revealed clear evidence for significant between group differences in ARIA-H. The 3D6-treated mice displayed a+145%, p < 0.002, 95% CI[42, 322] increase in Prussian blue area relative to control antibody treated mice while there was no significant difference in Prussian blue area in verubecestat-treated mice relative to control animals (–30.7%, p = 0.181, 95% CI [–59.2,–19.2]). Similar changes were observed for comparisons of numbers of Prussian blue positive objects. ARIA-H profiles in verubecestat-treated mice were no different from controls suggesting neither BACE1 inhibition nor high systemic exposures of verubecestat, required for Aβ reduction in Tg2576 mice relative to non-transgenic rodents, increase ARIA-H in mice and predict a low liability for ARIA-H with verubecestat treatment in AD patients. Major limitations of this study include the short duration of treatment and the inability to monitor for ARIA-E, a marker of increased cerebrovascular permeability. Though detectable by MRI imaging, ARIA-E is difficult to capture in mice since as in humans it occurs transiently and often without symptoms.

### Chronic verubecestat treatment suppresses amyloid accumulation in advanced aged Tg2576 – A β PPswe mice without inducing microhemorrhage [^112QPmH8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

A major challenge to preclinical evaluation of the impact of verubecestat treatment on ARIA is that there are no validated preclinical models that predict ARIA-E or ARIA-H in humans. A consistent observation in prior transgenic AβPP animal studies of various anti-Aβ immunotherapies is that the combination of advanced age and evidence for parenchymal and vascular amyloid deposits correlated with the presence of Prussian blue reactive deposits of ferric iron that result from microhemorrhage [16–20 and references therein]. Pfeifer et al. described the first systematic evaluation of ARIA-H in mice following repeated passive immunization of ∼21-month-old Tg-AβPP23 mice with an amino-terminally directed anti-Aβ antibody. Weekly antibody injections for 5 months significantly reduced plaque load, total brain Aβ 42, and vascular Aβ but also significantly increased ARIA-H severity and frequency as detected by Prussian blue histochemistry. The sites of Prussian blue reactivity visually correlated with sites of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which is consistent with the hypothesis that CAA is a component of ARIA-H. Tg2576-AβPP swedish mice display amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid deposits comprised mostly of Aβ 40, the dominant Aβ isoform found in CAA deposits common to AD patients. In parallel to the accumulation of CAA, aged Tg2576 mice also display increased ARIA-H as detected by increased Prussian blue staining and T2✱-MRI measures. Wilcock et al. reported that chronic 3-month treatment of aged Tg2576 mice with antibodies specific for the C-terminus of Aβ 40 reduced parenchymal plaque load, increased vascular amyloid reactivity, and reversed cognitive behavioral deficits but also increased the incidence of ARIA-H as qualitatively detected by Prussian blue. Anti-Aβ antibodies that demonstrate specificity for oligomeric forms of Aβ are also capable of increasing the incidence of Prussian blue detected ARIA-H in aged Tg2576 mice. Treatment of post-plaque PD-AβPP mice for up to 36 weeks with the antibody 3D6, the murine analog of bapineuzimab, resulted in increased ARIA-H that was temporally and spatially correlated with removal of vascular amyloid deposits. Luo et al. employed T2✱-MRI to mimic the clinical trial setting as a means to noninvasively detect ARIA-H events in mice throughout the 12-18-week dosing period and compared this to monitoring ARIA-H by Prussian blue histochemistry at study termination. Indeed, T2✱-MRI-detected ARIA-H events were positively correlated with ARIA-H detected by Prussian blue histochemistry following weekly anti-Aβ treatment.

### Avian toxins and poisoning mechanisms [^111jMgZW]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Birds have evolved to acquire a variety of adaptations to survive the hostile animal kingdom. While there are those who use camouflage to hide in their environment or developed increased agility to fly or run away from predators, others have developed ability to acquire toxic chemicals in their bodies making them less palatable or even lethal when consumed. Some birds have additionally developed symbiotic relationships with other organisms for mutual survival and chemical defense against predators. While poisonous animals abound in the animal kingdom, human exposures to avian species are rare yet their poisons can produce serious clinical outcomes.

Bird species that possess chemical defense by containing or using behaviorally one or more chemical substances to deter predators or parasites have often been described as poisonous or toxic to humans and animals alike. Common poisonous avian species will be discussed in this comprehensive review article which include the Pitohuis (Pitohui spp. Melanorectes nigrescens, Ornorectes cristatus, and Pseudorectes ferrugineus), blue-capped ifrita (Ifrita kowaldi), European quail (Cortunix corturnix coturnix), spur or spoor-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis), North American ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), Brush bronzewings (Phaps elegans), European hoopoes and woodhoopoes (Upupa epops and Phoeniculus purpureus, respectively). In this manuscript, common poisonous bird species will be highlighted with emphasis on the toxicologic properties of these compounds. Specific treatments beyond supportive care for poisonings will also be discussed. Furthermore, theories behind the evolutionary ability of these unique species to prevent self-intoxication will also be explored.

### Neuromelanin detection by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its promise as a biomarker for Parkinson's disease [^1149TcxK]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

As with the trapping of oxidized forms of reactive dopamine within autophagic organelles, the chelation of ferric iron within NM organelles is apparently neuroprotective, and may prevent iron-mediated neurodegeneration by apoptosis or ferroptosis. While the formation of NM-containing organelles is likely protective in living neurons, after neuronal death, iron bound to NM pigment could become extracellular and lead to toxicity by activating microglia and driving inflammation.

As detailed in the section below, "The basis of MRI", an important aspect of the NM–iron complex is that it is paramagnetic. Copper, manganese, and other metals can also form paramagnetic NM complexes with similar behavior.

### Misdiagnosis and long-term outcome of 13 patients with acute thallium poisoning in China [^115ALg7w]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze clinical feature and evaluate long-term outcome of patients with thallium poisoning.

Materials and Methods

An observational series of cases with acute thallium poisoning was analyzed retrospectively in West China Hospital of Sichuan University between 2000 and 2010. The clinical data including symptom, determination of thallium level, treatment, neurophysiological examination, and neuropsychological evaluation were analyzed. The patients were followed up until December 2012.

Results

Seven men and six women were enrolled in the study. The median patient age was 37 years (range: 15–53 years). The median duration of hospitalization was 44 days (range: 7–72). All the patients were misdiagnosed initially. One patient died in the hospital. The other 12 patients were followed for a median of 7 years (range: 1–12 years) after discharge from hospital. One patient died from leukemia in the first year of follow-up. Long-term outcome results showed peripheral neuropathy improved substantially. However, many patients have mild or moderate sequelae in sensory nerve fibers of distal lower extremity. A sural nerve biopsy in one patient revealed shrunken axons, distorted myelin sheath, and myelinated fibers loss. During follow-up period, problem of intelligence (4/12 patients, 33%), memory impairment (4/12, 33%), anxiety (6/12, 50%), and depression (5/12, 42%) were demonstrated.

Conclusions

Neurological symptoms may lead to misdiagnosis of thallium poisoning. Mild or moderate neurological sequelae may last for a long time after thallium poisoning.

### Empirical evidence for biometal dysregulation in Parkinson's disease from a systematic review and bradford hill analysis [^115Nqb9P]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Application of the Bradford Hill model of causation to published evidence of iron dysregulation strongly supports the hypothesis that this pathology plays a causal role in nigral neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. More limited data is available for copper, but the available evidence cautiously supports an etiological role for this biometal in this disorder. Iron and copper are involved in a range of accepted degenerative pathways in Parkinson's disease; it is feasible therefore that therapeutic modulation of either, or both, biometals may elicit widespread mechanisms of action with potential benefits for slowing disease progression.

### A ferritin-targeted biohybrid triggering ferroptosis immunotherapy via activating endogenous iron and replenishing exogenous iron simultaneously [^111nhVdv]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide levels are higher in tumors compared to that in normal tissues, and Prussian blue could efficiently catalyze H 2 O 2 into O 2 with a positive correlation to pH value. Here, the decrease in [Ru(dpp) 3]Cl 2 fluorescence intensity reflects an elevation in intracellular O 2 content. Laser irradiation effectively promoted intracellular O 2 production via Prussian blue catalysis (Fig. 3l), implying that this ferroptosis-inducing system may simultaneously alleviate the symptoms of tumor hypoxia, which is conducive to synergistic tumor treatment.

Furthermore, we used the ferroptosis inhibitor, Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) to confirm ferroptosis in the biohybrid system. The cytotoxicity of HMPB-H + L was alleviated in the presence of Fer-1, and cell viability was restored to 80% of baseline levels (Fig. 3m). In contrast, the fluorescence signal of LPO decreased from 79.6% in the HMPB-H + L group to 36.7% in the HMPB-H + L+Fer-1 group, indicating that ferroptosis-induced lipid peroxidation accumulation was dramatically blocked by Fer-1 (Fig. 3n and Supplementary Fig. 14). Furthermore, the western blotting analysis of GPX4 was consistent with the LPO levels, affirming that HMPB-H + L effectively induced ferroptosis in tumor cells.

The SLC7A11-GSH-GPX4 signaling axis is a crucial antioxidative defense system. A reduction in the expression of the downstream regulator, GPX4, was observed along this signaling axis. Similarly, SLC7A11 expression was downregulated in the HMPB-H + L-treated groups, decreasing GSH synthesis and lipid peroxidation. However, the addition of Fer-1 promoted the expression of SLC7A11, indicating a restoration of the antioxidant capacity of the tumor cells, further confirming the important role of SLC7A11 in ferroptosis (Fig. 3o, p and Supplementary Fig. 15).

The above results not only illustrate the successful induction of exogenous and endogenous ferroptosis in tumor cells but also reveal the multiple functions of Prussian blue in the whole system. It serves as a source of exogenous iron, an initiator for the photothermal destruction of ferritin, and a facilitator of tumor hypoxia alleviation. The photothermal effect further enhances ROS production, accelerates lipid peroxidation, and amplifies ferroptosis. This positive feedback ferroptosis-triggering system maximizes tumor suppression through synergistic roles.

Statistical analysis

For MH as detected by MRI, the difference in the number of MH after 12 weeks of treatment and baseline was the response analyzed. Differences between treatment groups and their respective controls were tested pairwise. Due to the discreteness of the response these tests were based on the Mann-Whitney test statistic. Asymptotic values are reported, but were checked via permutation. p -values are given both with and without stratification by age. A linear by linear association test was used to show that age was associated with the response. An analysis of covariance model was also used to estimate treatment groups means adjusted for age, and test for treatment group differences. For MH as detected by Prussian Blue stain, an analysis of covariance model was used to estimate treatment group means adjusted for age and to test for treatment group differences. Since graphically 24-month values (object number and object area) were similar to 23-month values, age was used in this model as a factor (i.e. a category) rather than a numeric variable.

For Aβ measured by immunoassay or by quantitative morphometry pairwise t -test comparisons of controls versus their respective treatment or baseline group were performed with significance defined as a p value ≤ 0.05. Quantitative morphometry results were also analyzed using a linear model that adjusted for age in a manner similar to that used for MH endpoints. All variables for this analysis were analyzed on a log2 scale.

### Parenteral iron therapy is associated with a characteristic pattern of iron staining on bone marrow aspirate smears [^114cY9YW]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

We developed anecdotal evidence that parenteral iron therapy is associated with a characteristic pattern of iron staining in bone marrow aspirate smears. In this pattern, uniform blue granules are observed within reticuloendothelial cells/stromal cells with Prussian blue staining, many times in curvilinear arrays. To test this hypothesis, marrow cases submitted for morphologic evaluation to our laboratory during an approximate 2-month period in 2006 were assessed for this pattern, and, when it was observed, clinical information was sought to determine if the patient had received parenteral iron. Fourteen cases were identified that displayed the pattern of interest. In 10 of these cases, the pattern was widespread (numerous granules present within virtually all marrow spicules), whereas in 4 cases, the pattern was seen only focally. In all cases in which the pattern was widespread, patients were found to have received parenteral iron at some point before the aspiration procedure. Our findings indicate that parenteral iron therapy is associated with a characteristic pattern of iron staining in bone marrow aspirate smears.

Prussian blue histochemical detection of microhemorrhage

Following the final MRI analysis after 12 weeks of treatment, animals were euthanized, and after blood and CSF were collected, one entire hemisphere from treated mice (n = 15/group) was cryosectioned sagittally at 20 μm thickness. Every twelfth section was slide-mounted and subjected to Prussian blue histochemistry (n = 12–16 sections/animal). Prussian blue positivity was quantified as the percent area occupied by Prussian blue stain and the total number of Prussian blue positive events for a given tissue region of interest. The endpoints were determined via image analysis using an algorithm that was designed to specifically identify and quantify discreet areas of Prussian blue positivity based on color, optical density, and size. An example of the algorithm based detection of Prussian blue staining is shown in Fig. 5A. Microhemorrhage was significantly increased after 12-weeks treatment with 20 mg/kg 3D6 compared to mice treated with the isotype control antibody. Both the number of Prussian blue positive events (Fig. 5B and Table 3) and the fractional area occupied by Prussian blue deposits (Fig. 5C and Table 3) were greater in the 3D6-treated animals compared to controls. In the verubecestat-treated animals, ARIA-H was not increased compared to vehicle diet-treated animals irrespective of whether ARIA-H was assessed by fractional area occupied by Prussian blue deposits or by the number of Prussian blue positive events (Fig. 5C and Table 3).

### Chronic verubecestat treatment suppresses amyloid accumulation in advanced aged Tg2576 – A β PPswe mice without inducing microhemorrhage [^112F1Qsq]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Working from the anti-Aβ immunotherapy literature described above and our own internal pilot studies, we delivered verubecestat, in-diet, to 18-22-month-old post-plaque Tg2576 mice for 12 weeks and quantified ARIA-H using longitudinal T2✱-MRI and quantitative Prussian blue histochemistry. The dose of verubecestat achieved exposures that mimicked both the degree and 24-h duration of CSF Aβ lowering targeted in ongoing Phase III clinical studies (∼75%). A group receiving weekly doses of the murine bapineuzumab analog, 3D6, served as a positive control for induction of ARIA-H. In addition to ARIA-H, the impact of verubecestat on parenchymal versus vascular amyloid deposits was measured using quantitative histology using a multi-fluorophore labeling scheme. Among all treatment groups, verubecestat-treated displayed the lowest level of ARIA-H while producing an unambiguous ∼70% reduction of CSF Aβ and sAβPPβ. Importantly, verubecestat treatment halted further plaque accumulation over the 12-week treatment period.

### Esophageal ridges: an unusual complication of oral iron therapy [^116Urhv1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A 60-year-old female who was being treated for anemia underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of recent-onset dyspepsia. Endoscopy revealed two longitudinal esophageal ridges extending from the middle to the lower esophagus (Fig. 1). Multiple biopsies taken from these ridges showed deposits of brownish granular iron pigment in the lamina propria, covered by an intact epithelium (Fig. 2A), highlighted by iron stain (Fig. 2B). The patient reported taking oral iron supplementation for iron deficiency anemia for past 6 months. The patient was advised to stop oral iron, as her hemoglobin and iron profile were now normal. Endoscopy after three months showed a significant decrease in size of these ridges (Fig. 1B). Repeat biopsies revealed an absence of any iron stores.

(A) Esophageal ridges. (B) Reduction in size of lesions at 3 months

Figure 2
(A) Esophageal biopsy showing iron deposition in the lamina propria covered by an intact epithelium (hematoxylin and eosin X 400). (B) Iron deposition confirmed on iron stain (Perl's Prussian blue X 200)

Endoscopic changes due to iron-induced injury may include the presence of gastrointestinal erythematous changes, erosions, subepithelial hemorrhages, color changes to brown or black dots (siderosis), ulcers, and rarely strictures. The presence of iron in gastrointestinal biopsy specimens may be due to iron overload states, including hemochromatosis and multiple blood transfusions, as well as being secondary to iron supplementation. One report has described the occurrence of a flat rounded pale lesion in the stomach, believed to be related to oral iron therapy. The changes of the esophageal ridge-like lesions which we describe are hitherto unreported and add to the spectrum of gastrointestinal endoscopic findings related to oral iron ingestion.

### Methylene blue in metformin intoxication: not just rescue but also initial treatment [^112rXAJJ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Metformin (MTF) is a widely used oral antidiabetic medication. Regardless the reason, high doses of MTF cause lactic acidosis as a result of its effects on mitochondrial ATP production and no-mediated vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis can be life-threatening despite all treatments. Methylene blue (MB) has the potential to reverse the toxic effects of MTF through its effects on both the mitochondrial respiratory chain and nitric oxide production. The use of MB in MTF intoxication has only been reported in a limited number of cases. Herein, we present a 16-year-old female patient who attempted suicide by ingesting high doses of MTF. Supportive treatments, such as vasopressor, inotropic treatments, and sodium bicarbonate, were started in the patient who developed fluid-resistant hypotension after pediatric intensive care unit admission. Because of rising lactate levels, Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started immediately. Despite all treatments, hypotension and hyperlactatemia persisted; MB was given as a rescue therapy. Noticeable hemodynamic improvement was observed within 30 minutes of initiating MB infusion, allowing a gradual decrease in the doses of inotropic infusions within the first hour of therapy. Patient's cardiovascular support was discontinued on the second day, and she was discharged on the fifth day. We speculate that, considering the mechanisms of MTF toxicity and the mechanisms of action of MB, it is suggested that early administration of MB, not only as a rescue treatment but as the initial approach to MTF poisoning in combination with other treatments, may result in improved outcomes.

### Genetic or pharmacological iron chelation prevents MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in vivo: a novel therapy for Parkinson's disease [^114qPsg7]. Neuron (2003). Low credibility.

Studies on postmortem brains from Parkinson's patients reveal elevated iron in the substantia nigra (SN). Selective cell death in this brain region is associated with oxidative stress, which may be exacerbated by the presence of excess iron. Whether iron plays a causative role in cell death, however, is controversial. Here, we explore the effects of iron chelation via either transgenic expression of the iron binding protein ferritin or oral administration of the bioavailable metal chelator clioquinol (CQ) on susceptibility to the Parkinson's-inducing agent 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrapyridine (MPTP). Reduction in reactive iron by either genetic or pharmacological means was found to be well tolerated in animals in our studies and to result in protection against the toxin, suggesting that iron chelation may be an effective therapy for prevention and treatment of the disease.

### Duodenal siderosis: a rare clinical finding in a patient with duodenal inflammation [^115xyxth]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

An 84-year-old man without any significant past medical history (PMH) was admitted for anemia and weight loss. There was no history of gastrointestinal bleeding or iron supplement use. Physical examination was benign except for pallor. His labs showed: hemoglobin 6.8 (11.0–15.6) g/dL, serum iron 30 (65–175) μg/dL, total iron binding capacity 141 (179–378) μg/dL, ferritin 416 (22–275) ng/dL, and transferrin 109 (188–341) mg/dL. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed which revealed a duodenal polyp, and duodenitis with dark brown pigmentation (Fig. 1A, B). Histopathologic examination of this pigmented mucosa revealed glandular deposition of brown pigments (Fig. 2A), confirmed to be iron with Prussian blue stain (Fig. 2B).

(A) Distended intestinal villi show submucosal deposition of brown pigments (H&E stain, original magnification 400X). (B) Brown pigments are hemosiderin in nature, confirmed by positive Persian blue stain (H&E stain, original magnification 400X)

Iron deposition in gastric and duodenal mucosa has been found in association with oral iron medications, alcohol abuse, blood transfusions, hemochromatosis, and decompensated cirrhosis with esophageal varices. The endoscopic finding of mucosal iron deposition is highly variable ranging from yellow-brown to black mucosa, with associated ulcerations or regenerative polyps.

Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) — mechanism, status, and safety in Wilson disease: TTM is an orally administered chelating agent that in circulation creates a nonreactive tripartite complex with albumin and copper, may promote biliary copper excretion, has a high binding constant that can remove copper bound to metallothionein, and when administered with food interferes with intestinal copper uptake. The bis-choline salt is in late stages of drug development and is not yet commercially available. Phase II data suggested TTM reduced NCC (corrected for Cu-TTM-albumin complex) and improved clinical neurological symptoms without paradoxical worsening (overall improvement in UWDRS scores). Early elevation of serum aminotransferases occurred in approximately 30% and resolved with dose discontinuation or reduction with no drug-induced liver injury; neutropenia has been observed and was reversible when the drug was discontinued or the dose reduced, and suitability for advanced hepatic WD requires further investigation.

### Chronic verubecestat treatment suppresses amyloid accumulation in advanced aged Tg2576 – A β PPswe mice without inducing microhemorrhage [^114ozMaR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Verubecestat is a potent BACE1 enzyme inhibitor currently being investigated in Phase III trials for the treatment of mild-to-moderate and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Multiple anti-amyloid immunotherapies have been dose-limited by adverse amyloid related imaging abnormalities such as vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) and microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) observed in human trials and mice. Verubecestat was tested in a 12-week nonclinical study for the potential to exacerbate microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) profiles in 18-22-month-old post-plaque Tg2576-AβPP swe mice. Animals were treated with verubecestat or controls including the anti-Aβ antibody analog of bapineuzumab (3D6) as a positive control for ARIA induction. ARIA-H was measured using in-life longitudinal T2✱-MRI and Prussian blue histochemistry at study end. Verubecestat reduced plasma and cerebrospinal fluid Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 by > 90% and 62% to 68%, respectively. The ARIA-H profile of verubecestat-treated mice was not significantly different than controls. Anti-Aβ treatment significantly increased ARIA-H detected by Prussian blue staining; however, anti-Aβ antibody treatment did not impact plaque status. Verubecestat treatment significantly suppressed the accumulation of total levels of brain Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 and Thioflavin S positive plaque load. Stereological analysis of cortex and hippocampus plaque load similarly revealed significantly reduced area of Aβ immunoreactivity and reduced plaque number in verubecestat-treated animals compared to controls. The absence of elevated ARIA events in verubecestat-treated mice was associated with a significant reduction in the level of accumulated CNS amyloid pathology and brain Aβ peptides; effects consistent with the desired therapeutic mechanism of verubecestat in AD patients. These data will be compared with longitudinal MRI profiles from ongoing clinical trials.

### Near fatal iron intoxication managed conservatively [^1171c5kj]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We report here the case of an infant who presented to the emergency department after unintentional ingestion of almost 130 mg/kg of elemental iron. The infant had evidence of serious toxicity in the form of hypotension, metabolic acidosis and excessive irritability. Her serum iron levels were 360 µg/dl, which was well above the normal range for her age. Despite such high serum levels, the infant made an uneventful recovery with medical management alone and did not require exchange transfusion. We chose to report this case to highlight her uneventful recovery with conservative therapy alone.

### Chronic verubecestat treatment suppresses amyloid accumulation in advanced aged Tg2576 – A β PPswe mice without inducing microhemorrhage [^112d54S5]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Verubecestat is a potent BACE1 enzyme inhibitor currently being investigated in Phase III trials for the treatment of mild-to-moderate and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Multiple anti-amyloid immunotherapies have been dose-limited by adverse amyloid related imaging abnormalities such as vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) and microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) observed in human trials and mice. Verubecestat was tested in a 12-week nonclinical study for the potential to exacerbate microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) profiles in 18-22-month-old post-plaque Tg2576-AβPPswe mice. Animals were treated with verubecestat or controls including the anti-Aβ antibody analog of bapineuzumab (3D6) as a positive control for ARIA induction. ARIA-H was measured using in-life longitudinal T2✱-MRI and Prussian blue histochemistry at study end. Verubecestat reduced plasma and cerebrospinal fluid Aβ40 and Aβ42 by > 90% and 62% to 68%, respectively. The ARIA-H profile of verubecestat-treated mice was not significantly different than controls. Anti-Aβ treatment significantly increased ARIA-H detected by Prussian blue staining; however, anti-Aβ antibody treatment did not impact plaque status. Verubecestat treatment significantly suppressed the accumulation of total levels of brain Aβ40 and Aβ42 and Thioflavin S positive plaque load. Stereological analysis of cortex and hippocampus plaque load similarly revealed significantly reduced area of Aβ immunoreactivity and reduced plaque number in verubecestat-treated animals compared to controls. The absence of elevated ARIA events in verubecestat-treated mice was associated with a significant reduction in the level of accumulated CNS amyloid pathology and brain Aβ peptides; effects consistent with the desired therapeutic mechanism of verubecestat in AD patients. These data will be compared with longitudinal MRI profiles from ongoing clinical trials.

### Chronic lead poisoning induced abdominal pain and anemia: a case report and review of the literature [^1143VspH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

This patient's abdominal pain was severe colic, but with only slight physical signs. The patient presented the kind of characteristics of abdominal pain caused by CLP. Lead is an electropositive metal with high affinity for sulfhydryl groups and thus inhibits sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes. In particular, lead also changes the vasomotor action of smooth muscle due to its effect on Ca-ATPase, which can cause abdominal pain. The patient was moderately anemic, with normocytic anemia and elevated bilirubin, mainly indirect bilirubin, without evidence of hemorrhagic anemia and hematopoietic dysfunction, without supplementation of hematopoietic materials after chelation therapy, the patient's Hb increased to normal levels. First, lead inhibits the major enzymes involved with heme synthesis of δ-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase, coproporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase as well as pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase, Second, lead can also be attached to the erythrocyte membrane to interfere with Na + -K + -ATP enzyme, and as a result, erythrocytes become easier to hemolyze. Finally, anemia occurs, and bilirubin levels increase. The patient's physical examination revealed the formation of Burton's lines on the upper and lower gums; Burton's lines are blue-purplish lines on the gums. They are caused by a reaction between circulating lead with sulfur ions released during oral bacterial activity, which deposits lead sulfide at the junction of the teeth and gums. The normal features of CLP include abdominal pain, anemia with basophilic stippling of red cells, blue-black gum deposits, and a lead line on joint radiography. This case reminds us that in the face of a patient with abdominal pain, we should not only consider the usual reasons for abdominal pains, but also carefully inquire about the patient's medical history and consider some other rare etiologies, such as CLP.

In conclusion, CLP is not a common cause of adult abdominal pain, the diagnosis of CLP is often delayed, and the abdominal pain can more easily conceal the underlying illnesses, detailed history taking and physical examination are crucial in early diagnosis and treatment. This report indicates that CLP should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of unexplained abdominal pain when other common causes have been excluded. The diagnosis of CLP is easy once it is suspected, this study may provide more clinical experience for diagnosis of CLP.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115izyec]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease — trientine dosing, administration, and safety are described as follows: Typical adult dosage for initial treatment is approximately 15–20 mg/kg/day (to 2000 mg/day maximum) in two or three divided doses, the dose for initial therapy with trientine should be ramped up over several (2–3) weeks, and the maintenance dose for adults is 10–15 mg/kg/day in two or three divided doses. Trientine should be administered 1 h before or 2 h after meals, coadministration of trientine and iron should be avoided because the complex with iron is toxic, and esophageal irritation can occur so trientine should be taken with ample fluid. The dihydrochloride formulation of trientine should be stored refrigerated, whereas the newly introduced tetrahydrochloride form of trientine is stable at ambient temperature; once-daily dosing of trientine in clinically stable patients may be safe and enhance adherence, but it requires confirmatory studies. Trientine has few side effects and pancytopenia has rarely been reported.

### Brain iron accumulation in unexplained fetal and infant death victims with smoker mothers – the possible involvement of maternal methemoglobinemia [^116xkqKN]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In mammals, iron is a vital constituent of the oxygen-carrrier hemoglobin (Hb). Human Hb is a tetramer consisting of a pair of α-like globin chains and a pair of β-like chains. Each chain is bound to a prosthetic heme group, consisting of an iron atom in the ferrous state located at the center of a porphyrin ring; this structure has a high affinity for oxygen. Thus, Hb is best known for its oxygen-carrying capacity, which facilitates the transport of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.

There are numerous causes of hemoglobin-related diseases. A distinction can be made between genetically inherited diseases, such as thalassemias and sickle cell disease, and acquired disorders, such as methemoglobinemia, a rare condition characterized by the presence of a greater concentration than the normal physiological range of 1–2% methemoglobin in erythrocytes.

Despite their different causes, these Hb disorders all arise from an oxidative denaturation of Hb. Oxidative injury can give rise to hemolysis with the consequent release into the circulation of Hb denatured products and of ferric iron (Fe 3+), that is the oxidised form of the normal reduced ferrous (Fe 2+) state. This free iron is characterized by its inability to bind and transport oxygen. During pregnancy, it can cross the placental-fetal barrier and inhibit the release of oxygen into fetal tissues, inducing hypoxia. Ferric iron also readily permeates through the fetal blood-brain barrier, causing, besides brain hypoxia, direct long-term DNA damage to neuronal cells regarded as selectively vulnerable.

We previously reported a high susceptibility of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to oxidative stress caused by maternal cigarette smoking in pregnancy, with consequent alterations of nuclei and/or structures controlling the vital activities, in victims of sudden fetal and infant death. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether oxidative metabolites of nicotine could also affect iron homeostasis in the brain of these victims, maybe through the induction of maternal Hb damage. The study was conducted by investigating, by means of Perls' Prussian Blue reaction, the possible presence of free iron in the ferric form in brain tissues of victims of unexplained death, aged from 25 gestational weeks to 10 postnatal months, and evaluating a possible relation with maternal smoking in pregnancy.

### Pre-and posttreatment MR imaging findings in lead encephalopathy [^1133PnHt]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

A 41-year-old man suspected of having lead poisoning was evaluated with MR imaging before and after British antilewisite therapy. The MR imaging findings showed bilateral symmetric involvement of the occipital lobe, affecting predominantly the gray-white matter junction and the subcortical white matter. A right cerebellar lesion was noted, with focal hyperintensities involving the gray-white matter. Similar lesions were seen in the temporal, parietal, and frontal regions. These lesions resolved after chelation therapy.

### Nondestructive halide exchange via S2-like mechanism for efficient blue perovskite light-emitting diodes [^115sLkzc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

On the contrary, the negligible erosion effect of CF-based post-treatment on perovskite films prevents the emerge of new halide vacancies, fundamentally differentiating it from the ionic exchange mechanism in IPA treatment. As depicted in Fig. 2a, an S N 2-like mechanism is used to describe the halide exchange process for CF-based post-treatment. At the initial stage, Cl ions adsorb onto the lattice by attacking Pb atoms (Step C), then the local lattice distortion facilitates the exchange of halogen position. The ion migration pathway is simulated by using transition state theory (Fig. 2c), where molecular internal translation results in an intermediate structure with the coexistence of Br and Cl ions at the original lattice site. Finally, the desorption of Br atoms completes the halide exchange process (Step D), producing mixed-halide perovskite crystals with increased bandgaps. After the surface halogen ion exchange, locally inhomogeneous ion distribution drives the Cl ions to penetrate into perovskite crystals, while the inside Br ions spreads to the film surface. Consequently, this nondestructive halide exchange leads to uniform and blue-shifted fluorescence through the S N 2-like mechanism (Fig. 2b). Notably, the significant difference in fluorescence intensity between IPA and CF post-treated films as monitored at 1 s further corroborates the distinct ion behavior in these two mechanisms. Such discrepancy regarding halogen ionic behavior can be ascribed to the different driving forces during the halide exchange process. Specifically, the S N 1-like mechanism is primarily propelled by spontaneous perovskite dissolution and recrystallization, while the S N 2-like mechanism exhibits a clear temperature-dependent characteristic. Direct evidence is provided by in-situ halide exchange at low temperatures through using liquid nitrogen-cooled BACl-incorporated CF solution and perovskite substrates. As shown in Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 11, the CF-based post-treatment fails to trigger effective halide exchange at low temperature, resulting in similar sky-blue emission at 488 nm to that of pristine film. Conversely, the same post-treatment at room temperature leads to apparently blue-shifted emission at 464 nm, highlighting the significant role of temperature for the CF-based halide exchange. Differently, the IPA-based post-treatment with the same BACl concentration yields blue-shifted emission at 453 and 470 nm at room and low temperatures, respectively. It is noteworthy that the change in solubility with temperature limits the spontaneous perovskite dissolution process in SN1-like mechanisms at low temperatures, which leads to different PL spectra of IPA post-treated films at room and low temperatures. Nevertheless, this temperature dependence has limited influence and the IPA post-treated film still exhibits a significant blue-shifted PL spectrum at low temperature.
