## Question

Health history for tinea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the health history for tinea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chief complaint and symptom timeline. Then, I should verify exposure and transmission risks. Next, I will review comorbidities and medications that modify risk or treatment. After that, I need to check prior fungal infections and treatments. I will then examine family and close contacts, followed by social and environmental determinants. Finally, I should consider special populations and red flags for resistant organisms, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these domains to diagnostic and management decisions.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of the chief complaint and timeline, because tinea's clinical course and morphology guide both diagnosis and urgency. I need to ask about pruritus, scaling, annular or arciform plaques, hair loss, nail dystrophy, and whether lesions are expanding, as well as onset, duration, seasonal pattern, and any prior similar episodes, since tinea corporis and tinea capitis often present with pruritic, scaly, centrifugally expanding lesions and tinea pedis may be chronic or recurrent, especially with maceration or interdigital involvement [^113QBoZe].

> Wait, let me verify exposure and transmission risks next, because these directly inform pretest probability and public health steps. I should ask about contact with animals, especially cats and dogs, given their role in tinea corporis and tinea capitis, and about shared personal items such as towels, combs, hats, shoes, and sports equipment, as well as damp communal environments like locker rooms, pools, and showers, since dermatophytes spread via direct contact and fomites and thrive in warm, moist settings [^114XDoqM] [^115iMCiz] [^1172gBGq].

> I need to check for comorbidities and medications that increase susceptibility or alter treatment choices. Diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, immunosuppression, and obesity heighten risk and severity, and onychomycosis is more common with diabetes and PAD, while chronic venous insufficiency and hyperhidrosis predispose to tinea pedis. I should also ask about recent or chronic corticosteroid use, including topical combinations, because steroids can mask and worsen tinea, producing tinea incognito and facilitating deeper invasion, and I must confirm age because tinea capitis requires systemic therapy and is most common in children, whereas tinea pedis and onychomycosis predominate in adolescents and adults [^113QBoZe] [^1122j2LR] [^113f4CGC] [^116sHXuC].

> Hold on, I should verify prior fungal infections and treatments to avoid repeating ineffective therapy and to detect patterns of recurrence. I will ask about previous tinea pedis, tinea corporis, tinea capitis, or onychomycosis, whether there was mycologic confirmation, which agents were used and for how long, and whether there was any response, because persistent or recurrent disease despite appropriate therapy should prompt consideration of nonadherence, suboptimal absorption, reinfection, or resistant organisms such as Trichophyton indotineae, and I should also ask about use of combination antifungal–steroid creams, which are discouraged due to risk of worsening infection and atypical presentations [^117XGKpg] [^113QBoZe] [^115AJX6E].

> Next, I should review family and close contacts, since tinea is contagious and household clustering is common. I need to ask whether any household members have similar rashes, scalp scaling, or nail changes, and whether there has been sharing of bedding, combs, or clothing, because guidelines recommend screening and treating asymptomatic carriers in tinea capitis outbreaks, particularly with Trichophyton tonsurans, to interrupt transmission [^113Mgc85] [^113VNQcV].

> Let me consider social and environmental determinants, because these shape both risk and prevention counseling. I should ask about crowding, socioeconomic constraints, access to laundry facilities, and hygiene practices, and I should confirm occupational or recreational exposures such as wrestling, military service, or farming, since crowded living, shared grooming tools, and high-humidity environments increase risk, and in children, factors like maternal education, animal contact, and household density correlate with tinea capitis prevalence [^116sHXuC] [^114JoJts] [^116CSejm].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population where presentation or management differs. In children, I should confirm age-appropriate dosing and the need for systemic therapy for tinea capitis, and I should remember that tinea pedis is not rare in pediatrics, with prevalence up to about 15% in some cohorts, so I should not dismiss foot symptoms in children. In travelers or those with links to South Asia, I should maintain a high index of suspicion for T. indotineae, which often presents with widespread, inflamed, steroid-exacerbated plaques and may require itraconazole rather than terbinafine, and in athletes, I should align return-to-play guidance with sports policies and emphasize fomite control and moisture management [^113QBoZe] [^114huTZE] [^115535KA] [^116Ejqin].

> I should double-check for red flags suggesting resistant or atypical tinea. Widespread, highly inflamed, steroid-refractory eruptions, especially with recent travel to South Asia or prior use of combination creams, should prompt me to consider T. indotineae and pursue culture with molecular identification, because routine labs often misidentify it as T. mentagrophytes or T. interdigitale, and delays in appropriate therapy are common. Similarly, persistent tinea capitis despite griseofulvin or terbinafine should trigger reassessment of adherence, dosing, and organism, and consideration of alternatives such as itraconazole in resistant cases [^115535KA] [^112TTvzY] [^117XGKpg].

> Let me synthesize the health history domains succinctly to ensure nothing is missed. The essential elements include symptom characterization and chronology, exposure risks including animals and fomites, comorbidities and immunomodulating drugs, prior fungal infections and treatments, family and close contact history, and social and environmental context, with special attention to pediatric, travel-related, athletic, and immunocompromised contexts, because these domains collectively inform pretest probability, guide the need for mycologic testing, and shape treatment selection, including when to escalate to systemic therapy or suspect antifungal resistance [^113QBoZe] [^112QJyqZ] [^116sHXuC].

A focused health history for tinea should document **site-specific symptoms** (pruritus, scaling, annular lesions, hair loss, nail changes) [^113QBoZe], **duration and progression** (acute vs chronic, relapsing, seasonal variation) [^114XDoqM], and **exposures** (animals, shared items, damp environments, sports, travel) [^116sHXuC] [^112KqDtY]. Ask about **risk factors** (diabetes, immunosuppression, obesity, occlusive clothing) [^116sHXuC] [^116y83Ec], prior fungal infections, and treatments (topical/oral antifungals, steroids) [^117XGKpg]. Screen family/household contacts for similar lesions, especially in tinea capitis [^113Mgc85], and assess comorbidities that may complicate management or increase recurrence risk [^1122j2LR]. This structured approach supports accurate diagnosis, guides testing, and informs treatment and prevention planning [^112QJyqZ].

---

## Chief complaint and symptom analysis

Begin by characterizing the **chief complaint** and eliciting a detailed symptom analysis:

- **Site-specific symptoms**: Identify the affected anatomical site (scalp, body, groin, feet, nails) and document site-specific symptoms such as pruritus, scaling, erythema, annular lesions, hair loss, nail discoloration, thickening, or brittleness [^113QBoZe].

- **Duration and progression**: Determine the onset, duration, and progression of symptoms (acute vs chronic, relapsing, seasonal variation) [^115iuSpM].

- **Severity and impact**: Assess the severity of symptoms, including pain, discomfort, cosmetic concerns, and impact on daily activities or quality of life [^113WdMnk].

---

## Exposure history

Exposure assessment is critical in identifying potential sources of infection and guiding preventive measures:

- **Animal contact**: Inquire about recent or ongoing contact with animals, particularly cats, dogs, or farm animals, as they are common reservoirs for dermatophytes [^116sHXuC].

- **Shared personal items**: Document sharing of towels, clothing, hairbrushes, combs, hats, shoes, or other personal items, which facilitate transmission [^115iMCiz].

- **Environmental exposures**: Assess exposure to damp, communal environments such as locker rooms, swimming pools, gyms, and shared showers [^111ZxDa9].

- **Travel history**: Recent travel, particularly to regions with high prevalence of antifungal-resistant dermatophytes (e.g. South Asia), should be documented [^115AJX6E].

---

## Risk factors and comorbidities

Identify patient-specific risk factors and comorbidities that may predispose to tinea or complicate management:

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Diabetes increases the risk and severity of tinea infections, particularly onychomycosis and tinea pedis [^1122j2LR].

- **Immunosuppression**: Immunocompromised states (e.g. HIV/AIDS, immunosuppressive therapy) predispose to severe, recurrent, or atypical tinea infections [^116sHXuC].

- **Obesity and occlusive clothing**: Obesity, excessive sweating, and tight or occlusive clothing create favorable conditions for fungal growth, particularly in tinea cruris and tinea pedis [^116y83Ec].

- **Occupational and recreational factors**: Athletes, military personnel, and individuals engaged in activities involving prolonged moisture exposure are at increased risk [^116y83Ec].

---

## Previous medical history and treatments

Document previous fungal infections, including tinea capitis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and onychomycosis, and record details of **previous treatments**, including topical and systemic antifungal agents, corticosteroid use, and adherence to therapy. Also assess treatment outcomes — response, recurrence, or treatment failures — as this information guides current management decisions [^117XGKpg].

---

## Family and household contact history

Screen family members and close contacts for similar lesions, particularly in tinea capitis, given its **highly contagious nature** [^113Mgc85]. Document any clustering of cases within the household or community, as this may indicate an outbreak or ongoing transmission [^1163ouyM].

---

## Social and environmental determinants

Assess **socioeconomic factors**, including crowding, poor hygiene, and limited access to healthcare, which contribute to increased risk and persistence of tinea infections [^116sHXuC]. Document environmental conditions such as high humidity, poor ventilation, and inadequate sanitation, which facilitate fungal growth and transmission [^115u4G5v].

---

## Special considerations

In pediatric patients, tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection; document age, school or daycare exposure, and contact with animals [^113QBoZe]. In immunocompromised patients, maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical presentations, extensive disease, or antifungal resistance [^116sHXuC]. For travelers, consider exposure to antifungal-resistant dermatophytes, particularly Trichophyton indotineae, and document travel history and use of combination corticosteroid creams [^115AJX6E].

Tinea pedis is a frequently encountered dermatophytosis affecting the superficial skin of the feet, primarily of adults. The prevalence of tinea pedis has increased over the last several decades due to an increase in multiple risk factors. Infection from dermatophytes is most common, but infection from other fungi can also result in tinea pedis. Four distinct clinical presentations occur: interdigital, moccasin, vesicular, and acute ulcerative types. A variety of physical exam findings can help the clinician identify patients with tinea pedis.

### Clinical overview of ringworm and fungal nail infections… [^114gXDoK]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Ringworm is a common epidermis infection caused by dermatophyte fungi.
- Ringworm spreads through skin contact among people and animals or by fomites.
- Onychomycosis occasionally leads to serious secondary bacterial infections, especially in people with diabetes.
- Use of diagnostics is recommended before prescribing antifungal treatment.
- Antimicrobial-resistant ringworm and onychomycosis are an emerging public health concern. Types The most common species of fungi that cause ringworm are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. Ringworm is characterized by the part of the body affected. Skin infections Ringworm is often described by the site of the body affected. Examples include:

- Ringworm of the scalp
- Ringworm of the groin
- Ringworm on the feet.

Nail infections Onychomycosis is the term for fungal nail infections. It can be caused by ringworm or by infection with other types of fungi such as yeasts. Onychomycosis can affect the fingernails or toenails, but onychomycosis of the toenails is more common. Disease rates It is estimated that up to 25% of people in the world may experience ringworm at some point in their lifetime. Onychomycosis is estimated to affect around 14% of the general population and is especially common in older adults. People with diabetes are at increased risk for fungal nail infections. Nail infections Most cases of onychomycosis are not serious. However, some people may experience pain or be bothered by the appearance of their nails. Onychomycosis may cause nails to become discolored, thick, fragile, or cracked. The nail may also become separated from the nail bed. People who have fungal toenail infections often have a fungal skin infection on the foot, especially between the toes.

Occasionally, a bacterial infection can occur on top of a fungal nail infection and cause serious illness. This is more common in people with diabetes or other conditions that weaken the immune system.

Tinea (recalcitrant infections and corticosteroid combinations) — when a returned traveler has a recalcitrant fungal infection, consider obtaining culture for species identification; a longer course of high-dose oral antifungals might be needed to treat severe or recurrent infections caused by emerging drug-resistant Trichophyton species, such as Trichophyton indotineae, detected in travelers returning from South and Southeast Asia; topical medications that combine an antifungal agent with a potent corticosteroid are available in many countries, and clinicians should caution travelers against their use because adverse events include longer-lasting infections, more extensive spread over large areas of the body, invasion into deeper skin layers, unusual presentation making diagnosis more challenging, and severe redness and burning.

### Notes from the field: first reported U.S. cases of tinea caused by trichophyton indotineae-new york city, December 2021-March 2023 [^112TTvzY]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

The cases in these two patients highlight several important points. Patient A had no recent international travel history, suggesting potential local U.S. transmission of T. indotineae. Health care providers should consider T. indotineae infection in patients with widespread tinea, particularly when eruptions do not improve with first-line topical antifungal agents or oral terbinafine. Culture-based identification techniques used by most clinical laboratories typically misidentify T. indotineae as T. mentographytes or T. interdigitale; correct identification requires genomic sequencing. Health care providers who suspect T. indotineae infection should contact their state or local public health department for assistance with testing, which is available at certain public health laboratories and specialized academic and commercial laboratories. Successful treatment using oral itraconazole, a triazole antifungal, has been documented. However, providers should be aware of challenges with itraconazole absorption, †† which can lead to variable serum drug concentrations; itraconazole's interactions with other drugs; the need for up to 12 weeks of therapy; and the documented emergence of triazole resistance. Antimicrobial stewardship efforts are essential to minimize the misuse and overuse of prescribed and over-the-counter antifungal drugs and corticosteroids. In addition, health care providers can educate patients about strategies to prevent the spread of the dermatophytes that cause tinea. §§ Finally, public health surveillance efforts and increased testing could help detect and monitor the spread of T. indotineae.

### An update on tinea capitis in children [^111XqicA]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Tinea capitis presents a significant public health care challenge due to its contagious nature, and potential long-term consequences if unrecognized and untreated. This review explores the prevalence, risk factors, diagnostic methods, prevention strategies, impact on quality of life, and treatment options for pediatric tinea capitis. Epidemiological analysis spanning from 1990 to 1993 and 2020 to 2023 reveals prevalence patterns of pediatric tinea capitis influenced by geographic, demographic, and environmental factors. Notably, Trichophyton species is most prevalent in North America; however, Microsporum species remain the primary causative agent globally, with regional variations. Risk factors include close contact and environmental conditions, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures. Accurate diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation, microscopic examination, and fungal culture. Various treatment modalities including systemic antifungals show efficacy, with terbinafine demonstrating superior mycological cure rates particularly for Trichophyton species. Recurrent infections and the potential development of resistance can pose challenges. Therefore, confirming the diagnosis, appropriately educating the patient/caregiver, accurate drug and dose utilization, and compliance are important components of clinical cure. Untreated or poorly treated tinea capitis can lead to chronic infection, social stigma, and psychological distress in affected children. Prevention strategies focus on early detection and healthy lifestyle habits. Collaborative efforts between healthcare providers and public health agencies are important in treating pediatric tinea capitis and improving patient outcomes. Education and awareness initiatives play a vital role in prevention and community-level intervention to minimize spread of infection. Future research should explore diagnostic advances, novel treatments, and resistance mechanisms in order to mitigate the disease burden effectively.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^111FWAp7]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

What is Known

Tinea capitis is a contagious infection, common among refugee children.
Treatment with oral antifungals is usually withheld until mycology results are available.
This is a critical period, because these children may infect others, and trigger epidemics in their densely populated communities.

### Onychomycosis: the development of a clinical diagnostic aid for toenail disease. part I. establishing discriminating historical and clinical features [^115nNQmE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The ideal method for diagnosing onychomycosis is unclear. Mycological investigation is currently the method of choice, although there is a false-negative culture rate of at least 30%.

Objectives

To establish a clinical diagnostic aid which may be used alongside laboratory-based mycological tests and in epidemiological studies.

Methods

Patients with nail disease (n = 209) were enrolled in the study. The examining clinician completed a questionnaire containing four historical questions and 21 questions related to the clinical findings. All patients had samples taken for mycological analysis. The gold standard for the diagnosis of onychomycosis was a positive result on both direct microscopy and culture of nail samples. Following exclusions, questionnaire responses from 169 patients were analysed using Stata. Multiple logistic regression with forward stepwise selection of variables was performed.

Results

Both microscopy and culture results were positive in 32% of cases and negative in 42%. Dermatophytes formed the majority of isolates. Four parameters were found to be significantly related to positive mycology results: a history of tinea pedis in the last year, scaling on one or both soles, white crumbly patches on the nail surface, and an abnormal colour of the nail plate.

Conclusions

Our results have shown one historical feature and three clinical features to be strongly associated with onychomycosis. The questionnaire has been revised to include only these stems and is being tested further with the aim of achieving a binary definition.

Tinea versicolor — diagnosis and treatment include clinical recognition by lesion appearance, Wood ultraviolet lamp findings of a subtle yellowish-green hue, and confirmatory KOH microscopy; the causative fungi are difficult to culture. Recommended therapies are topical azole products (clotrimazole cream, ketoconazole shampoo used as a body wash), selenium sulfide shampoo, or topical zinc pyrithione; systemic azoles (e.g., fluconazole) can be used for severe, relapsing, or first-line–recalcitrant cases. In many countries, Whitfield ointment (salicylic acid 3% and benzoic acid 6%, mixed in petrolatum) is the most common treatment, whereas oral griseofulvin, topical nystatin, and both oral and topical terbinafine are ineffective against Malassezia.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^113QBoZe]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Tinea infections (often called ringworm) are caused by dermatophyte fungi and classified by the body site involved. Tinea corporis and tinea capitis are most common in prepubertal children, and tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (most common type of onychomycosis) are more likely in adolescents and adults. Clinical diagnosis without testing may be unreliable because other conditions can resemble tinea infections (eg, tinea corporis can be confused with eczema, and onychomycosis with dystrophic toenails from repeated low-level trauma or psoriasis). Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis generally respond to inexpensive topical antifungal agents, but oral antifungal agents may be indicated for patients with extensive disease, lack of response to topical treatment, immunocompromise, or hair follicle involvement (eg, tinea capitis). Oral terbinafine is considered first-line therapy for tinea capitis and onychomycosis because it is well tolerated, effective, and inexpensive. Emerging tinea infections may be more severe than classic tinea infections and generally do not improve with first-line topical or oral antifungals. These infections may require prolonged oral antifungal therapy and specialized diagnostic testing. Antifungal stewardship, including avoiding the use of combination antifungal-corticosteroids, should be emphasized to optimize outcomes and help prevent resistance.

### Notes from the field: trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII-new york city, April-July 2024 [^112VZKzx]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Preliminary Conclusions and Actions

Health care providers should be aware that TMVII can spread through sexual contact and cause lesions on the genitals, buttocks, face, trunk, or extremities. Point-of-care testing with direct microscopy can help confirm tinea; however, TMVII identification requires fungal culture and DNA sequencing. Clinicians should initiate empiric therapy based on epidemiologic and clinical features, especially given the insensitivity of fungal cultures and that confirmation of TMVII infection might take weeks. Current evidence suggests that oral terbinafine (250 mg daily) is an effective first-line option for TMVII infections. Some patients have also been successfully treated with itraconazole with adjuvant topical antifungal therapy. Patients might require oral antifungal therapy for up to 3 months and should take the treatment until lesions have fully resolved. Some patients might respond to topical antifungals alone, but these are not recommended as monotherapy for tinea involving hair follicles.

Health care providers should advise patients with TMVII infection about the importance of avoiding skin-to-skin contact with affected areas and not sharing personal items until symptom resolution. Topical corticosteroid products, including combination antifungal-corticosteroid products, can worsen tinea infection and should be avoided in treating TMVII and other dermatophyte infections. Public health surveillance, health care provider and patient education and awareness, and increased access to dermatophyte identification and antifungal susceptibility testing could help detect, monitor, and prevent the spread of TMVII.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of tinea pedis in children [^116rf3vc]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

This systematic review assesses the prevalence of tinea pedis among children (0–19 years), following the PRISMA guidelines. The review was registered in the PROSPERO registry on April 5, 2024, with the registration number CRD42024532638.

A literature search was conducted using a search string (Appendix A) in the databases PubMed and Embase (OVID) on October 7 and October 10, 2024. The database DOAJ was also searched on October 7, 2024, but no relevant findings were obtained. The reference lists of the included articles were reviewed to identify additional relevant literature, and one article was included. The literature screening process was done independently by two authors, JBS and NFG, utilizing the Rayyan screening tool (AI tool). No other AI tool has been used. In the event of any disparities in selection, the senior author DMS was consulted to reach a consensus.

2.1 Inclusion Criteria

The inclusion criteria were studies published in peer‐reviewed journals, written in English, and reporting on the prevalence of tinea pedis in at least 100 children up to and including 19 years old.

2.2 Exclusion Criteria

The exclusion criteria were studies with a population having or suspected of tinea pedis, specific patient groups (e.g. diabetes or immunodeficiencies), studies focusing on specific etiological agents, and reviews.

2.3 Data Collection and Statistic

Data regarding the prevalence of tinea pedis (author, year of publication, country where the study was conducted, study duration, population size, diagnostic procedures, etiological agents, accompanying fungal or skin disorders) were gathered by one author, JBS, and entered in an Excel spreadsheet. Narrative synthesis was used due to data heterogeneity, describing prevalence variations based on study designs, age, location, and other factors. A linear regression model was applied to the data to assess the correlation between the prevalence of tinea pedis in children (%) over time (year of publication). Excel Version 16.84 (24041420) was used to determine if the variation in prevalence had changed over time by adding a trend line and calculating the p ‐value and 95% confidence interval. A meta‐analysis was not possible due to differences in study population, design, age, and diagnostic methods.

### Cutaneous infections dermatophytosis, onychomycosis, and tinea versicolor [^115iuH8W]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Cutaneous fungal infections cause significant morbidity for healthy and ill patients. The incidence of some dermatomycoses is increasing, despite availability of newer and better topical and systemic treatments. Fungal remnants last months to years under the ideal conditions, allowing continued spread of infection. Mycoses treated in one area may recur because of organism travel from concomitant areas of infection. Failure of patients and physicians to recognize a fungal etiology early may lead to more extensive, severe, or difficult-to-treat infections. Finally, a patient's concurrent illnesses may play a part in susceptibility and ability to manage fungal infections. For these reasons, scientists have studied and developed newer antifungal agents with better efficacy and greater convenience in dosing. These drugs, however, still have side effects and medication interactions that may limit their use in some patients. Better efforts to educate patients and physicians alike may aid in faster recognition and treatment of dermatophytoses. More research is needed to continue to develop drugs suitable for use in a broader range of patients and diagnostic tests that may be quicker or more specific than conventional ones.

### Expert panel review of skin and hair dermatophytoses in an era of antifungal resistance [^116sHXuC]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dermatophytoses are fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails that affect approximately 25% of the global population. Occlusive clothing, living in a hot humid environment, poor hygiene, proximity to animals, and crowded living conditions are important risk factors. Dermatophyte infections are named for the anatomic area they infect, and include tinea corporis, cruris, capitis, barbae, faciei, pedis, and manuum. Tinea incognito describes steroid-modified tinea. In some patients, especially those who are immunosuppressed or who have a history of corticosteroid use, dermatophyte infections may spread to involve extensive skin areas, and, in rare cases, may extend to the dermis and hair follicle. Over the past decade, dermatophytoses cases not responding to standard of care therapy have been increasingly reported. These cases are especially prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, and Trichophyton indotineae has been identified as the causative species, generating concern regarding resistance to available antifungal therapies. Antifungal-resistant dermatophyte infections have been recently recognized in the United States. Antifungal resistance is now a global health concern. When feasible, mycological confirmation before starting treatment is considered best practice. To curb antifungal-resistant infections, it is necessary for physicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for resistant dermatophyte infections coupled with antifungal stewardship efforts. Furthermore, by forging partnerships with federal agencies, state and local public health agencies, professional societies, and academic institutions, dermatologists can lead efforts to prevent the spread of antifungal-resistant dermatophytes.

### Onychomycosis: epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment in a changing landscape [^116E4ZG1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is an often overlooked and/or undertreated disease. This may be in part due to an under appreciation among both physicians and patients of its impact on quality of life and the potential for significant complications, from tinea corporis and cruris, to bacterial superinfection. Some health care providers are unaware of the effective low-risk treatments currently available. Changing demographic characteristics such as the relative aging of the population; the increasing prevalence of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, and widespread iatrogenic immunosuppression; and changes in lifestyle practices such as earlier and greater participation in sports, are likely to lead to an increased prevalence of onychomycosis in both adults and children. Two topical onychomycosis treatments, efinaconazole 10% solution, and tavaborole 5% solution were recently approved by the FDA. This article reviews the state of knowledge and describes, briefly, these new treatment options.

### Risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis: real-world evidence from a single-podiatry center, large-scale database in Japan [^112ig4uv]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dermatomycosis, including tinea pedis and onychomycosis, is common worldwide, and is frequently encountered in routine medical care in Japan. The prevalence of tinea pedis and onychomycosis in Japan is estimated to be 21.6% (~ 25 million patients) and 10.0% (~ 12 million patients), respectively.

Patients with onychomycosis are not merely concerned about the cosmetic changes caused by the disease as onychomycosis can be painful, significantly affect a patient's quality of life, and lead to serious complications. Patients with onychomycosis may cause the spread of the disease to others; however, many patients remain unmedicated in real‐world care in Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage hospital visits by unmedicated, potential patients who are at risk of developing tinea pedis and onychomycosis, and to provide these patients with information on the potential hazards of these diseases.

The risk factors for the development of onychomycosis that have been reported outside Japan include male sex, advanced age, family or personal history of onychomycosis, tinea pedis, nail trauma, fomite exposure, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, immunosuppression, and psoriasis. Watanabe et al. reported that bone and joint disease, palmoplantar hyperhidrosis, sports activity, and climate are associated with onychomycosis development, according to a random sampling survey of dermatology outpatients in 1999 and 2000, particularly those with tinea pedis and onychomycosis. Most studies that have analyzed the risk factors for these diseases were based on multicenter, questionnaire surveys and included evidence obtained from unclear or inconsistent diagnostic criteria for diseases such as tinea pedis, onychomycosis, and the identified risk factors. In the current study, risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis in real‐world practice in Japan were analyzed using a single‐center, large‐scale database that includes the data of patients managed with consistent diagnostic criteria at the Podiatry Center of Juntendo University Hospital.

### Tinea corporis, tinea cruris… [^113ztYje]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility. Tinea versicolor is not caused by dermatophytes but rather by yeasts of the genus Malassezia. Tinea unguium is more commonly known as onychomycosis. Dermatophytes are usually limited to involvement of hair, nails, and stratum corneum, which are inhospitable to other infectious agents. Dermatophytes include three genera: Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. |Uncommon fungal skin infections that involve other organs | The most common infections in prepubertal children are tinea corporis and tinea capitis, whereas adolescents and adults are more likely to develop tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium. Tinea infections can be difficult to diagnose and treat. In one survey, tinea was the skin condition most likely to be misdiagnosed by primary care physicians.

5 Patients with tinea gladiatorum, a generalized form of tinea corporis seen in wrestlers, should be treated with topical therapy for 72 hours before return to wrestling.
6. Tinea Capitis In the United States, tinea capitis most commonly affects children of African heritage between three and nine years of age. 4 There are three types of tinea capitis: gray patch, black dot, and favus. Black dot, caused by Trichophyton tonsurans, is most common in the United States. Early disease can be limited to itching and scaling, but the more classic presentation involves one or more scaly patches of alopecia with hairs broken at the skin line and crusting. Tinea Unguium Onychomycosis is a common consideration in adolescents and adults with dystrophic toenails.

In addition to the common distal subungual form, which is characterized by thickened, brittle, discolored nails, onychomycosis may present with an uncommon proximal subungual form, which should raise suspicion of immunocompromise, and a white superficial form, which is more common in children than adults 24. MANAGEMENT Treatment courses for onychomycosis are long, failure rates are high.

### The tinea capitis campaign in serbia in the 1950s [^114Bs1K5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

In this Historical Review we describe the 1950–59 UNICEF-supported campaign to eliminate tinea capitis, also known as ringworm, in Yugoslavia. Medical treatment for this infectious disease involved the use of ionising radiation. We discuss the possible health implications for the treated population. Data were collected from archive documents, newspapers from the 1950s, Yugoslavian scientific reports, interviews with patients who received treatment, and interviews with physicians who gave treatment during the campaign. The campaign screened 878 659 individuals and treated 49 389. On the basis of Israeli tinea capitis research, late health consequences (mainly cancer in the irradiated area) can be expected in the treated Serbian population. The discovery of treatment records for a substantial number of patients makes public-health action and further research possible. The findings are relevant to the Serbian medical community and populations in other countries that used a radiation-based technique for the treatment of tinea capitis.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of tinea pedis in children [^113zmYre]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

This review identified dermatophytes, primarily T. rubrum, as the predominant etiological agent. However, the included studies exhibited heterogeneity, such as the absence of standardized diagnostic methods and insufficient documentation of other comorbidities, including onychomycosis. More comprehensive and standardized research is necessary to determine the exact prevalence of tinea pedis in the pediatric population. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals should remain vigilant in recognizing pediatric tinea pedis to improve prevention and treatment strategies.

### Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea nigra, and piedra [^114WZD29]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are among the most common dermatologic conditions throughout the world. To avoid a misdiagnosis, identification of dermatophyte infections requires both a fungal culture on Sabouraud's agar media, and a light microscopic mycologic examination from skin scrapings. Topical antifungals may be sufficient for treatment of tinea corporis and cruris and tinea nigra, and the shaving of hair infected by piedra may also be beneficial. Systemic therapy, however, may be required when the infected areas are large, macerated with a secondary infection, or in immunocompromised individuals. Preventative measures of tinea infections include practicing good personal hygiene; keeping the skin dry and cool at all times; and avoiding sharing towels, clothing, or hair accessories with infected individuals.

### Clinical course, antifungal susceptibility, and genomic sequencing of trichophyton indotineae [^115535KA]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this case series is the largest US cohort describing T indotineae infections and highlights several important points. Patients experienced extensive, prolonged pruritic lesions that generally failed monotherapy with topical antifungals and showed inadequate response to typical doses and durations of oral antifungal medications, including prolonged terbinafine therapy at standard doses, consistent with findings from international reports. Diagnostic delays were common, and most patients did not have immunocompromising conditions that might predispose them to severe dermatophytosis. These findings, in addition to others (eg, recent travel to a high-prevalence region and/or initial laboratory culture identification of T mentagrophytes or T interdigitale in patients with compatible physical examination findings and history) should prompt consideration of T indotineae, which requires molecular-based techniques for definitive diagnosis. Because T indotineae identification was retrospective in most cases described in this report, treating dermatologists were often unaware of T indotineae diagnosis at the time of treatment, likely leading to the selection of ineffective or suboptimal antifungal treatment. Data highlight that 100-mg or 200-mg daily dosing of itraconazole for 6 to 8 weeks is the current preferred therapy, yet longer durations and higher doses may be required with reported relapse occurring. Terbinafine at higher than standard doses (500 mg daily) may be effective for some patients. Griseofulvin and fluconazole show limited efficacy.

### Risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis: real-world evidence from a single-podiatry center, large-scale database in Japan [^113et7xL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dermatomycosis, including tinea pedis and onychomycosis, is frequently encountered in routine medical care in Japan. Identifying the risk factors for tinea pedis and onychomycosis development is important to encourage hospital visits by patients who may have these diseases but who are not undergoing any treatment. This approach may lead to the prevention of disease progression and the spread of infections to others. Risk factors for onychomycosis development have been reported both in and outside of Japan. However, most of the risk factors were identified based on a multicenter, questionnaire survey study and included evidence obtained from unclear or inconsistent diagnostic criteria for tinea pedis, onychomycosis, and identified risk factors. The current study analyzed the risk factors for developing tinea pedis and onychomycosis in real-world practice in Japan using a single-center, large-scale database that included the data of patients managed with consistent diagnostic criteria at the Podiatry Center of Juntendo University Hospital. A total of 2476 patients (1012 males, 1464 females) with a mean age of 63.4years were included. Among these patients, 337 (13.6%) had tinea pedis and 346 (14.0%) had onychomycosis. A total of 259 patients (~75% of each patient population) had both diseases concomitantly. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for the possible risk factors of age (per 10years), sex, diabetes, dialysis, visual impairment, ulcer history, lower-limb ischemia (LLI), and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) revealed that advanced age, male sex, diabetes, and LLI were independent risk factors for the development of tinea pedis. In addition, DPN was an independent risk factor for developing onychomycosis. We believe that these data are useful for identifying patients who are at high risk of developing tinea pedis and onychomycosis, which may result in disease prevention and suppression in real-world clinical practice in Japan.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1166SdXy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can have a substantial impact on patients. Pain, feeling very unwell and the need for elevation of the affected limb can result in reduced quality of life and substantial periods of work absence among people with cellulitis. 1 Cellulitis also places a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). Between 2015 and 2016, 123 644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England for cellulitis. 2 While even a single episode of cellulitis can have a substantial impact on quality of life, approximately one‐third of people with cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes. 3, 4 Risk factors for the recurrence of cellulitis include previous episode(s) of cellulitis; lymphoedema; obesity; diabetes and skin disorders producing breaks in the skin (e.g. fungal foot disease, dry skin or insect bites).

The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long‐term, low‐dose antibiotics. 5 This strategy has not been widely implemented, possibly because of growing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing amidst fears of antibiotic resistance and possible side‐effects. The risk of further episodes may also be reduced by use of emollients for prevention of dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema using compression garments. 6

There has been little research into the role of skin care in the prevention of cellulitis, but a role for dry skin has been hypothesized and regular application of emollient has been shown to reduce dryness. 7 Previous research also suggests that there is a high rate of fungal foot disease in patients with recurrent cellulitis as skin breaks caused by fungal infection provide a 'portal of entry' for bacteria. 8, 9 Although fungal foot infection is common, many patients undertreat this as it can be asymptomatic, 10, 11 so it is possible that more active treatment of fungal foot disease may prevent recurrent cellulitis. In a recent James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership (PSP) for cellulitis, patients and health professionals identified the need to determine the best nonantibiotic intervention for the prevention of cellulitis (e.g. skin care; foot care; moisturizers; antiseptics; lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise; compression garments/bandages; treating athlete's foot; complementary and alternative therapy) as a priority area for future research. 12

### Tinea capitis and its associated factors among school children in gondar town northwest, Ethiopia [^114JoJts]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tinea capitis is a global public health concern with a unique therapeutic challenge and mostly affects children. The burden is double in developing countries. There is no study on school-going children from the urban residence in Ethiopia.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of Tinea capitis and its associated factors among school children in Gondar town northwest, Ethiopia 2021.

Methods

An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among school children in Gondar town from November 20 to December 20, 2021. Data was collected through an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. A stratified simple random sampling technique was employed. Then data were entered into EPI Info version 7.22 and transferred to Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 22 for further analysis. The binary logistic regression model was employed to identify factors associated with tinea capitis, and the strength of association and statistical significance was declared using the adjusted odds ratios with its corresponding 95% CI, and p-value ≤ 0.05 respectively.

Result

The prevalence of tinea capitis among school children in Gondar town was found to be 29.4%. Public school student (AOR = 2.79 95% CI: 1.34–5.87), widowed mother (AOR = 6.09, 95% CI: 1.83–11.23), students in the age group of 5–8 years (AOR = 3.79 95% CI: 1.68–8.55), animal contact (AOR = 2.61 95% CI: 1.15–5.90), and family similar illness category (AOR = 8.49 95% CI: 3.73–11.39) have risen the likelihood of tinea capitis among school children.

Conclusions

The prevalence of tinea capitis was higher. Young age, children from widowed marital status, illiterate mother, history of share blades, animal contact, a family similar illness, and lower number of living rooms are important factors contributing to tinea capitis among school children. Health education for the mother on the mode of transmission, prevention, and improve the low socioeconomic status of the parent is crucial.

### Evidence-based topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis: a summary of a cochrane systematic review [^112bMr62]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Tinea cruris and tinea corporis are common fungal infections. Most can be treated with a variety of topical antifungals. This review aimed to assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Searches included the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, LILACS and ongoing trials registries (August 2013). One hundred and twenty-nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 18 086 participants evaluated a range of interventions - mostly azoles. Pooling of data for several outcomes was only possible for two individual treatments. In five studies, terbinafine showed a statistically significant higher clinical cure rate compared with placebo [risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10–6.56]. Data for mycological cure could not be pooled owing to substantial heterogeneity. Across three studies, mycological cure rates favoured naftifine (1%) compared with placebo (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80–3.14) but the quality of the evidence was low. Combinations of azoles with corticosteroids were slightly more effective than azoles for clinical cure, but there was no statistically significant difference with regard to mycological cure. Sixty-five studies were assessed as 'unclear' and 64 as being at 'high risk' of bias; many were over 20 years old, and most were poorly designed and inadequately reported. Although most active interventions showed sufficient therapeutic effect, this review highlights the need for further, high-quality, adequately powered RCTs to evaluate the effects of these interventions, which can ultimately provide reliable evidence to inform clinical decision making.

### Weight history in clinical practice: the state of the science and future directions [^117H7vJD]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Eliciting a weight history can provide clinically important information to aid in treatment decision-making. This view is consistent with the life course perspective of obesity and the aim of patient-centered care, one of six domains of health care quality. However, thus far, the value and practicality of including a weight history in the clinical assessment and treatment of patients with obesity have not been systematically explored. For these reasons, the Clinical Committee of The Obesity Society established a task force to review and assess the available evidence to address five key questions. It is concluded that weight history is an essential component of the medical history for patients presenting with overweight or obesity, and there are strong and emerging data that demonstrate the importance of life stage, duration of exposure to obesity, maximum BMI, and group-based trajectory modeling in predicting risk for increased morbidity and mortality. Consideration of these and other patient-specific factors may improve risk stratification and clinical decision-making for screening, counseling, and management. Recommendations are provided for the key elements that should be included in a weight history, and several needs for future clinical research are outlined.

Dermatomycosis, including tinea pedis and onychomycosis, is frequently encountered in routine medical care in Japan. Identifying the risk factors for tinea pedis and onychomycosis development is important to encourage hospital visits by patients who may have these diseases but who are not undergoing any treatment. This approach may lead to the prevention of disease progression and the spread of infections to others. Risk factors for onychomycosis development have been reported both in and outside of Japan. However, most of the risk factors were identified based on a multicenter, questionnaire survey study and included evidence obtained from unclear or inconsistent diagnostic criteria for tinea pedis, onychomycosis, and identified risk factors. The current study analyzed the risk factors for developing tinea pedis and onychomycosis in real‐world practice in Japan using a single‐center, large‐scale database that included the data of patients managed with consistent diagnostic criteria at the Podiatry Center of Juntendo University Hospital. A total of 2476 patients (1012 males, 1464 females) with a mean age of 63.4 years were included. Among these patients, 337 (13.6%) had tinea pedis and 346 (14.0%) had onychomycosis.

In addition, DPN was an independent risk factor for developing onychomycosis. We believe that these data are useful for identifying patients who are at high risk of developing tinea pedis and onychomycosis, which may result in disease prevention and suppression in real‐world clinical practice in Japan.

### Topical therapy for dermatophytoses: should corticosteroids be included? [^113f4CGC]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Dermatophytoses, commonly known as ringworm or tinea, represent superficial fungal infections caused by dermatophytes, which are among the most common infections encountered in medicine. The use of corticosteroid-containing combinations in dermatophyte infections that are usually treated with topical medications is still a much-debated issue. The addition of a corticosteroid to local antifungal therapy may be of value in reducing local inflammatory reaction and thus carries the theoretical advantage of rapid symptom relief in acute dermatophyte infections associated with heavy inflammation. However, the use of such combinations requires caution as they have some potential risks, especially with long-term use under occlusive conditions. Corticosteroid-induced cutaneous adverse effects have been reported primarily in pediatric patients due to inappropriate application of these preparations on diaper areas. Additionally, the corticosteroid component may interfere with the therapeutic actions of the antifungal agent, or fungal growth may accelerate because of decreased local immunologic host reaction, such that underlying infection may persist, and dermatophytes may even acquire the ability to invade deeper tissues. Analysis of the literature documenting clinical study data and adverse reactions related to combination therapy, drew the following conclusions: (i) combination products containing a low potency nonfluorinated corticosteroid may initially be used for symptomatic inflamed lesions of tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and tinea cruris, in otherwise healthy adults with good compliance; (ii) therapy should be substituted by a pure antifungal agent once symptoms are relieved, and should never exceed 2 weeks for tinea cruris and 4 weeks for tinea pedis/corporis; and (iii) contraindications for the use of these combinations include application on diaper or other occluded areas and facial lesions, as well as in children < 12 years of age and in immunosuppressed patients for any reason.

### Presumed trichophyton indotineae infection in children: a call for heightened clinical awareness [^115r7edW]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1

Trichophyton indotineae often presents with widespread infection. This dermatophyte is frequently resistant to antifungals and necessitates a high level of clinical suspicion to ensure timely diagnosis and targeted treatment. The causes of the emergence of T. indotineae resistance to terbinafine and azole antifungals remain under debate. This resistance may be due to evolutionary pressures in South Asia, where over‐the‐counter antifungals admixed with potent corticosteroids are widely available. Over the past decade, the literature from South Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the United States has documented numerous cases of treatment‐resistant tinea infections, and the CDC recently reported the first confirmed cases of T. indotineae in the United States. Current hospital systems are often ill‐equipped to differentiate T. indotineae from other Trichophyton species, leading to delays in diagnosis. In this letter, we present a presumed case of T. indotineae at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2022 and discuss key clinical and laboratory findings that should alert physicians to the possibility of T. indotineae infection.

A toddler with a history of travel to Bangladesh presented in August 2022 with pruritic annular, violaceous plaques with overlying scale and excoriations on the bilateral thighs. Dermatophyte cultures were initially identified as T. tonsurans (November 2022) and later T. mentagrophytes (August 2022 and March 2023). The rash persisted despite 14 weeks of griseofulvin (7 weeks 20 mg/kg twice daily and 7 weeks 25 mg/kg twice daily), 7 weeks of oral terbinafine (4.2 mg/kg daily), 8 weeks of oral fluconazole (10.2 mg/kg once weekly), and topical ketoconazole and econazole. The rash finally resolved after a 4‐week course of itraconazole (5 mg/kg daily), administered 1 year later.

A total of 2476 patients (1012 males, 1464 females) were included in this study. The mean age was 63.4 years. The study included 337 patients with tinea pedis (13.6%) and 346 patients with onychomycosis (14.0%). Among these patients, 259 patients (~ 75% of each patient population) had both diseases concomitantly. Table 1 lists the characteristics of all patients and those with tinea pedis and onychomycosis.

3.2 Investigation of risk factors for developing tinea pedis and onychomycosis

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses (forced entry method) were performed to investigate the risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis using the possible risk factors of age (per 10 years), sex, diabetes, dialysis, visual impairment, ulcer history, LLI, and DPN. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was adjusted for all possible risk factors and revealed that advanced age, male sex, diabetes, and LLI were independent risk factors for the development of tinea pedis (Table 2, Figure 1). DPN was also an independent risk factor for developing onychomycosis (Table 3, Figure 2).

### Epidemiology, clinical features, and outcome of the hospitalized patients with kerion in fars province, iran: an eleven-year retrospective study [^112RTRDc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design, study population, and data gathering

With the extraction of information from the electronic database in the dermatology department of Shahid Faghihi Hospital, we identified 132 patients with tinea capitis between April 2011 and August 2022 (11 years). Patients with a clinical diagnosis of tinea capitis or those diagnosed through a KOH test or pathogen culture met the inclusion criteria. The study excluded patients whose final diagnosis was not tinea capitis. The following factors were ascertained: age, gender, place of residence, familial history, medical history, contact with animals, history of other fungal infections, date of admission and discharge, systemic symptoms such as lymphadenopathy and fever, laboratory profile, systemic and topical antifungal treatment. An expert physician conducted telephone conversations with patients to collect information on treatment outcomes. Despite conducting a 6-week follow-up after patients' discharge, the absence of a registration system in an outpatient setting prevented the documentation of outcome data in electronic databases.

Ethical statement

The study protocol received approval from the Research Ethics Committees of the School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, located in Shiraz, Iran (ethics code: IR.SUMS.MED.REC.1401.148). The data for this retrospective study came from the patients' hospital records. According to the research ethics consideration in biomedical sciences approved by the Health Ministry of Iran, upon admission to the hospital, all patients (or parents or legal guardians for patients under 18 years of age) signed a consent form authorizing the use of their hospital records for research purposes, anonymously.

Statistical analyses of the data

We analyzed the data using SPSS version 25 and STATA 14.2. We used chi-square, independent t-test, and ANOVA tests. Using descriptive statistics, we defined the presence of scalp ringworm as well as current clinical, demographic, and epidemiological patterns. We used the chi-square test to examine the relationship between gender and factors, such as age and place of residence. We used the independent t-test to investigate the relationship between the number of hospital days and clinical symptoms. The p-value of equal to or less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Conclusion

The prevalence of tinea capitis was higher among schoolchildren in Gondar town. Young age, children from widowed marital status, illiterate mother, history of share blades, animal contact, a family similar illness, and lower number of living rooms are important factors contributing to tinea capitis among school children. Health education for the mother on the mode of transmission, prevention, and improve the low socioeconomic status of the parent is crucial.

Ringworm (tinea) management in residential facilities notes that ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungi and ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone who has a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus; it also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat. Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body, with over-the-counter topical medication used for infections on the skin but a prescription medication taken by mouth used to treat infections on the scalp. Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection, and a rash should not be used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks. Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Racial disparities, risk factors, and clinical management practices for tinea capitis: an observational cohort study among US children with medicaid [^116uD3g1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Among 24,536 patients diagnosed with TC, 13.3% received diagnostic testing, most commonly fungal culture (10.7%) and direct microscopy (5.1%) (Table II). Testing was similar by race/ethnicity (P = 0.12). Overall, 83.2% of patients were prescribed an antifungal drug, with 68.2% and 47.2% receiving oral and topical antifungals, respectively; 15.0% received topical therapy alone.

In this Medicaid-insured cohort, Black children had higher TC incidence than other groups, with incidence rates ~7 times higher than White children, substantiating previously documented disparities. This association persisted after adjusting for TC risk factors. Focused community or school-based interventions might help address racial disparities in TC burden.

Rates of confirmatory diagnostic testing among Medicaid-insured children were lower than those found in a previous study that included commercially insured children (13.3% vs 21.9%), reflecting differential care potentially associated with limited time and resources for testing or limited access to dermatologists. Lack of confirmatory laboratory testing could lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate antifungal prescriptions, which is concerning given recent reports of antifungal drug-resistant dermatophytosis. More than 30% of patients with TC did not receive systemic antifungal treatment, which is needed for effective treatment.

This study relied on administrative data, which is subject to incomplete case ascertainment, undercoding, and disease misclassification. The database also lacked information on socioeconomic status, housing, geography, income, and other environmental factors, limiting our ability to assess underlying causes of racial disparities in TC incidence. Additional studies are needed to investigate these factors and guide targeted public health interventions to address TC disparities.

Overall, this study demonstrates high overall TC incidence and racial disparities among children with Medicaid, highlighting a need for tailored public health efforts and opportunities for improving clinical management.

### Risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis: real-world evidence from a single-podiatry center, large-scale database in Japan [^1153RGZ4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The identification of risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis is important to encourage hospital attendance by potential unmedicated patients, which may lead to the prevention of disease progression and the spread of infections to others. In this study, disease risk factors were analyzed using a large‐scale database of the Podiatry Center of Juntendo University Hospital, which includes the data of > 1000 patients/year managed in this center for foot diseases. By using this large‐scale database, risk factors could be analyzed with a large amount of sequence data obtained from a single center. This approach enabled consistent diagnostic criteria for diseases such as tinea pedis, onychomycosis, and their identified risk factors.

In this study, data from 337 patients with tinea pedis and 346 patients with onychomycosis were analyzed to identify risk factors. Among the patients with tinea pedis or onychomycosis, 259 patients (~ 75% of each patient population) had both diseases concomitantly. A previous survey conducted with data of 34 730 subjects, obtained from Japanese dermatologists in 2007, demonstrated that 7521 subjects had a tinea pedis, 3474 patients had an onychomycosis, and 2406 subjects had both diseases concomitantly with a concomitant proportion of 32.0%–69.3% of each patient population. There is a slight discrepancy in the concomitant proportion between this study and the previous survey, and one of the reasons is that previous data were obtained from a questionnaire survey conducted as a multicenter study and included data obtained from unclear or inconsistent diagnostic criteria for the diseases. On the other hand, our study data were obtained from a single‐center database, which included patients managed with consistent diagnostic criteria.

### Topical antifungal treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis [^112KrRYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea infections are fungal infections of the skin caused by dermatophytes. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of the world population is affected by fungal skin infections. Sites of infection vary according to geographical location, the organism involved, and environmental and cultural differences. Both tinea corporis, also referred to as 'ringworm' and tinea cruris or 'jock itch' are conditions frequently seen by primary care doctors and dermatologists. The diagnosis can be made on clinical appearance and can be confirmed by microscopy or culture. A wide range of topical antifungal drugs are used to treat these superficial dermatomycoses, but it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antifungal treatments in tinea cruris and tinea corporis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 13th August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched the journal Mycoses from 1957 to 1990.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with proven dermatophyte infection of the body (tinea corporis) or groin (tinea cruris).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses.

Main Results

Of the 364 records identified, 129 studies with 18,086 participants met the inclusion criteria. Half of the studies were judged at high risk of bias with the remainder judged at unclear risk. A wide range of different comparisons were evaluated across the 129 studies, 92 in total, with azoles accounting for the majority of the interventions. Treatment duration varied from one week to two months, but in most studies this was two to four weeks. The length of follow-up varied from one week to six months. Sixty-three studies contained no usable or retrievable data mainly due to the lack of separate data for different tinea infections. Mycological and clinical cure were assessed in the majority of studies, along with adverse effects. Less than half of the studies assessed disease relapse, and hardly any of them assessed duration until clinical cure, or participant-judged cure. The quality of the body of evidence was rated as low to very low for the different outcomes. Data for several outcomes for two individual treatments were pooled. Across five studies, significantly higher clinical cure rates were seen in participants treated with terbinafine compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10 to 6.56, number needed to treat (NNT) 3, 95% CI 2 to 4). The quality of evidence for this outcome was rated as low. Data for mycological cure for terbinafine could not be pooled due to substantial heterogeneity. Mycological cure rates favoured naftifine 1% compared to placebo across three studies (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.14, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 4) with the quality of evidence rated as low. In one study, naftifine 1% was more effective than placebo in achieving clinical cure (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.16, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 5) with the quality of evidence rated as low. Across two studies, mycological cure rates favoured clotrimazole 1% compared to placebo (RR 2.87, 95% CI 2.28 to 3.62, NNT 2, 95% CI 2 to 3). Data for several outcomes were pooled for three comparisons between different classes of treatment. There was no difference in mycological cure between azoles and benzylamines (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07). The quality of the evidence was rated as low for this comparison. Substantial heterogeneity precluded the pooling of data for mycological and clinical cure when comparing azoles and allylamines. Azoles were slightly less effective in achieving clinical cure compared to azole and steroid combination creams immediately at the end of treatment (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84, NNT 6, 95% CI 5 to 13), but there was no difference in mycological cure rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05). The quality of evidence for these two outcomes was rated as low for mycological cure and very low for clinical cure. All of the treatments that were examined appeared to be effective, but most comparisons were evaluated in single studies. There was no evidence for a difference in cure rates between tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Adverse effects were minimal - mainly irritation and burning; results were generally imprecise between active interventions and placebo, and between different classes of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled data suggest that the individual treatments terbinafine and naftifine are effective. Adverse effects were generally mild and reported infrequently. A substantial number of the studies were more than 20 years old and of unclear or high risk of bias; there is however, some evidence that other topical antifungal treatments also provide similar clinical and mycological cure rates, particularly azoles although most were evaluated in single studies. There is insufficient evidence to determine if Whitfield's ointment, a widely used agent is effective. Although combinations of topical steroids and antifungals are not currently recommended in any clinical guidelines, relevant studies included in this review reported higher clinical cure rates with similar mycological cure rates at the end of treatment, but the quality of evidence for these outcomes was rated very low due to imprecision, indirectness and risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to confidently assess relapse rates in the individual or combination treatments. Although there was little difference between different classes of treatment in achieving cure, some interventions may be more appealing as they require fewer applications and a shorter duration of treatment. Further, high quality, adequately powered trials focusing on patient-centred outcomes, such as patient satisfaction with treatment should be considered.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^1163ouyM]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is a common cutaneous infection of the scalp and hair follicles, typically diagnosed by direct examination and culture. Treatment with oral antifungals is usually withheld until mycology results are available. In Israel, African refugee children demonstrate higher susceptibility to Tinea capitis and generally fail to undergo follow-up evaluations.

Methods

This study aimed to identify the clinical characteristics and treatment responses of refugee children in Israel with Tinea capitis, in order to formulate a treatment plan for primary care physicians. To this end, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic medical records of 76 refugee children presenting with Tinea capitis during 2016–2017. All measured variables and derived parameters are presented using descriptive statistics. The correlation between background clinical and demographic data and Tinea capitis diagnosis was assessed using the chi-squared and Wilcoxon tests. Correlations between demographic/clinical/laboratory characteristics and other types of fungi or other important findings were assessed using a T-test.

Results

Scaling was the most common clinical finding. Cultures were positive in 64 (84%) and direct examination in 65 (85%) cases, with a positive correlation between the methods in 75% of cases. The most common fungal strain was T. violaceum. Fluconazole treatment failed in 27% of cases. Griseofulvin 50mg/kg/day was administered to 74 (97%) children, and induced clinical responses. No side effects were reported.

Conclusions

The key aim of this study was to emphasize the importance of diagnosis and treatment of these immigrant children by their primary pediatric doctor since it takes, an average of 4.3months until they visit a dermatologist. During this critical time period, the scalp can become severely and permanently damaged, and the infection can become systemic or cause an outbreak within the entire community. In conclusion, we recommend to relate to scaly scalp in high-risk populations as Tinea capitis, and to treat with griseofulvin at a dosage of up to 50mg/kg/day, starting from the first presentation to the pediatrician.

### Notes from the field: first reported U.S. cases of tinea caused by trichophyton indotineae-new york city, December 2021-March 2023 [^1145iQp9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Tinea is a common, highly contagious, superficial infection of the skin, hair, or nails caused by dermatophyte molds. * During the past decade, an epidemic of severe, antifungal-resistant tinea has emerged in South Asia because of the rapid spread of Trichophyton indotineae, † a novel dermatophyte species; the epidemic has likely been driven by misuse and overuse of topical antifungals and corticosteroids §. T. indotineae infections are highly transmissible and characterized by widespread, inflamed, pruritic plaques on the body (tinea corporis), the crural fold, pubic region, and adjacent thigh (tinea cruris), or the face (tinea faciei). T. indotineae isolates are frequently resistant to terbinafine, a mainstay of tinea treatment. T. indotineae infections have been reported throughout Asia and in Europe and Canada but have not previously been described in the United States.

On February 28, 2023, a New York City dermatologist notified public health officials of two patients who had severe tinea that did not improve with oral terbinafine treatment, raising concern for potential T. indotineae infection; these patients shared no epidemiologic links. Skin culture isolates from each patient were previously identified by a clinical laboratory as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and were subsequently forwarded to the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, for further review and analysis. Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal gene, followed by phylogenetic analysis performed during March 2023, identified the isolates as T. indotineae (Supplementary Figure;). Activity related to this investigation was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

Patient A, a woman aged 28 years, developed a widespread pruritic eruption during summer 2021. She had a first dermatologic evaluation in December 2021, at which time she was in her third trimester of pregnancy. She had no other underlying medical conditions, no known exposures to a person with similar rash, and no recent international travel history. Dermatologists noted large, annular, scaly, pruritic plaques over the neck, abdomen, pubic region, and buttocks (Figure). She received a diagnosis of tinea and began oral terbinafine therapy in January 2022 after the birth of her baby. Because her eruptions did not improve after 2 weeks of therapy, terbinafine was discontinued, and she began itraconazole treatment. The rash resolved completely after completing a 4-week course of itraconazole; however, she is being monitored for potential recurrence of infection and the need for resumption of itraconazole.

### Risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis: real-world evidence from a single-podiatry center, large-scale database in Japan [^116b5A7o]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

A limitation of this study is that the risk factors were analyzed using the data of patients who visited a podiatry center because of their foot problems. This means that the study population had at least one foot problem and is, therefore, not necessarily consistent with the population in the real‐world setting that includes individuals without foot problems. However, a strength of this database study is that the foot diseases and risk factors, such as LLI and DPN, were diagnosed using unified criteria in a single study site, although, the expertise of the physicians for these diseases could not be unified in this database study.

In conclusion, the risk factors for developing tinea pedis and onychomycosis were analyzed using a large‐scale database. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that advanced age, male sex, diabetes, and LLI were independent risk factors for tinea pedis. In addition to these factors, DPN was found to be an independent risk factor for onychomycosis. We believe that these data are useful for identifying patients who are at high risk of developing tinea pedis and onychomycosis, which can contribute to the discovery of undiagnosed/unmedicated or potential patients with tinea pedis and onychomycosis. This approach may result in disease prevention and suppression in real‐world clinical practice in Japan.

Variable of the study

Dependent variable

Tinea capitis (yes/no).

Independent variable

Socio demographic variables

Age, sex, religion, place of residence, family size, education of child, education of mother, education of father, occupation of father, occupation of mother, number of living room, family income.

Tinea capitis related variables

Itching, loss of hair, scarring alopecia, oozing of the lesion, scaly lesion, sharing of bed, sharing of blades/scissors for cutting hair, history of contact with animals, presence Tinea capitis in the family member.

Operational definition

Tinea capitis

Clinical diagnose was made in children who had one or more signs associated with Tinea capitis (hair loss, dry scaly areas, redness, and itch).

Data collection tool and procedure

We collected our data using interviewer administrated questionnaire. Physical examination was also done for all subjects. The tool comprised of information on demographic, socio-economic status, and history of contact with animals which are gathered by reviewing previous studies and reports. Adequate information about the procedures was given to the selected participants. Following the information given to the selected children, just a few questions were forwarded to their families to respond to at home. The selected students were interviewed in the school outside of the classroom. General physician examined each individual regarding symptom, and the physical examination was also filled out in the same questionnaire. Furthermore, about six nurse were recruited as data collectors and two supervisor who are medical doctor were recruited as a supervisor.

Data quality control

The questionnaire was prepared in English and then it was translated in to Amharic language. The question administered by the interview during data collection for each study subjects. It was reviewed by dermatologist and public health experts to check its appropriateness for assessing Tinea capitis. As well as some independent factors like: loss of hair, scarring alopecia, oozing of the lesion, and scaly lesion. Data collectors and supervisors were trained for one day regarding technique, ethical issue and data collection process by the principal investigator before the actual data collection.

### Tinea capitis and its associated factors among school children in gondar town northwest, Ethiopia [^116CSejm]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Our investigation showed that children with a history of animal contact were significantly higher than those who did not have contact with animals; this is compliant with a study done in Taiwan. Children who live in fewer bedrooms are 2.7 times more exposed to Tinea capitis than children living in enough bedrooms. It might result in physical contact and contribute significantly in the illness's dissemination. Furthermore, crowding highlights the vulnerability of inadequate personal hygiene and low socioeconomic standing.

The likelihood of contracting Tinea capitis in children of widowed mothers was 6.1 times higher than in children of married mothers. It is predicted that married women can rely on their spouses for both financial support and emotional support when their child is ill; this helps them to share their responsibility for one another, which is essential to leading a healthy life, and to make solid decisions early on about seeking medical attention for their ill children. However previous different scholars report that marital status was not associated with Tinea capitis among school-going children.

The likely hoods of being infected with Tinea capitis among children born to illiterate mothers were 2.8 times that of children born to highly educated mothers. This finding is similar to a study conducted in Chabahar, Iran. A higher education level influences one's ability to adopt a proactive attitude toward health, acquire important health-related knowledge, and correctly implement the many infection prevention and management strategies offered by healthcare professionals. Likewise, education is a source of income/wage which is crucial to lead a healthy life.

The likelihood of contracting Tinea capitis was 8.5 times higher in children whose family members also had the same illness than in other children. this finding is congruent with a study conducted in other parts of Ethiopia. This might be due to sharing bedding and other personal items like combs and towels with those who are infected or through direct contact with the patient. Furthermore, Tinea capitis is highly contagious since it is often passed from person to person.

Limitations of the study

The outcome variable determines by clinical sign and symptoms only it might affect the frequency of tinea capitis since this study does not employ fungal culture or microscopic examination and share the cross-sectional study drawback.

### Ringworm information for healthcare professionals… [^114XDoqM]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Ringworm Information for Healthcare Professionals Definition and sources of infection Ringworm, also called "tinea" or "dermatophytosis, " is a common infection of the epidermis caused by dermatophyte molds. People can acquire ringworm through direct skin contact with people and animals who are infected. People can also acquire ringworm by sharing personal items or through contact with surfaces found in moist areas. Ringworm can also spread from one part of the body to another. Treatment Tinea pedis: Athlete's foot can usually be treated with over-the-counter topical antifungal products. Chronic or extensive tinea pedis may require treatment with systemic antifungal agents such as terbinafine, itraconazole, or fluconazole. 6 In addition, chronic tinea pedis may require adjunctive therapy such as foot powder or talcum powder to prevent skin maceration.

Tinea capitis: Treatment with systemic antifungal medication is required, as topical antifungal products are ineffective for treatment of tinea capitis. Many experts consider griseofulvin to be the drug of choice. 6 Terbinafine is also FDA-approved for the treatment of tinea capitis in patients four years of age and older. Itraconazole and fluconazole have been shown to be safe and effective, but are not FDA-approved for this indication. 6 Selenium sulfide shampoos can be used as adjunctive therapy. 6–7 Clinicians should generally confirm the diagnosis of tinea capitis using a laboratory test.

### Notes from the field: first reported U.S. cases of tinea caused by trichophyton indotineae-new york city, December 2021-March 2023 [^116BuLDR]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient B, a woman aged 47 years with no major medical conditions, developed a widespread, pruritic eruption in summer 2022 while in Bangladesh. There, she received treatment with topical antifungal and steroid combination creams and noted that several family members were experiencing similar eruptions. After returning to the United States, she visited an emergency department three times during autumn 2022. She was prescribed hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment and diphenhydramine (visit 1), clotrimazole cream (visit 2), and terbinafine cream (visit 3) with no improvement. In December 2022, she was evaluated by dermatologists who noted widespread, discrete, scaly, annular, pruritic plaques affecting the thighs and buttocks (Figure). She received a 4-week course of oral terbinafine, but her symptoms did not improve. She then received a 4-week course of griseofulvin therapy, resulting in approximately 80% improvement. Itraconazole therapy is being considered pending further evaluation given the recent confirmation of suspected T. indotineae infection. Her son and husband, who live in the same house and report similar eruptions, are currently undergoing evaluation.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of tinea pedis in children [^115q3oZE]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dermatophytes (719/750; 96%), particularly(383/719; 53%), were the most common etiological agent, consistent with previous studies. Yeasts accounted for 4% (31/750) (Table 1). Prevalence increased with age, e.g. 25.5% in Turkish adolescents (17–19 years) vs. 7.2% in children aged 14–16 years. In Israel, prevalence was 2.1‐fold higher in children aged 12–14 compared to children aged 5–8 years. This may be due to longer lifespans, increased risk of exposure, participation in sports, military service or higher risk of certain diseases (e.g. diabetes).

Swift diagnose and treatment of tinea pedis is crucial to prevent its progression to onychomycosis, which may require systemic treatment. We therefore expected studies to report on co‐infections with onychomycosis, which we found in six studies (6/29, 20.7%). Higher prevalence was expected in dermatology clinics and in children using public swimming facilities, compared to population‐based studies, as the exposure is higher.

This review's limitations include the exclusion of non‐English articles and lack of studies with standardized diagnostic methods, making comparisons difficult. Furthermore, 48.0% (14/29) of studies did not specify the etiological agent (Table 1). None of the studies included children across the full age range of 0–19 years, resulting in narrower age brackets (Table 1). The data did not allow adjustment for potential confounders or mediators affecting outcomes, such as living conditions or healthcare access. Strengths include large study populations, diverse geographic representation, a majority of studies conducted in school settings, and the inclusion of only peer‐reviewed articles. Given that the latest included study was published in 2020, further research is necessary to confirm the findings.

### Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the use of telemedicine on the diagnosis and treatment of tinea corporis: an experience of Southern Italy center [^1175sXpo]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Tinea corporis has a characteristic clinical presentation with the presence of an annular, red, centrifugally developing patch with a central area of resolution and active border. It can often be accompanied by itchy symptoms. Lesions may be single or multiple and the size generally ranges from 1 to 5 cm, however larger lesions and confluence of lesions can also occur. The diagnosis of tinea corporis is clinical but can be confirmed with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of skin scrapings. Direct microscopic examination by 10%–20% KOH is rapid and inexpensive and helps greatly in some situations where there is a diagnostic suspicion of more than one disease.

We conducted a 2‐year data collection at our center where we evaluated the impact of covid‐19 on diagnosis and treatment of tinea corporis.

During the pandemic period caused by COVID‐19, to contain the rapid spread of the virus, the Italian government decided to introduce several measures to contain contagions such as lockdown and quarantine starting from March 10, 2020. These measures inevitably caused a longer latency between visits performed and a lower number of accesses to the mycology outpatient clinic of the University of Naples "Federico II". Patients were referred to us by dermatologists suspecting Tinea Corporis as a diagnosis. In the following work we analyzed the impact of these restrictions on the diagnosis and therapeutic response of patients affected by Tinea Corporis, comparing the pre‐pandemic year (March 2019–March 2020) with the following year during the pandemic (March 2020–March 2021). During the year between March 2019 and March 2020, both initial and follow‐up visits were being performed at our clinic. Instead, in the pandemic year between March 2020 and March 2021, all visits of first access for suspected Tinea corporis were made at our facility, while the 2 months follow‐up visits after diagnosis were made in Telemedicine. Therapeutic response was established with the resolution of manifestations clinically objectified in the pre‐pandemic year (March 2019–March 2020). Instead in the following year, therapeutic response was assessed in telemedicine by patients' anamnestic data and by photos sent.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of tinea pedis in children [^114huTZE]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background/Objectives

Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot, is a fungal infection that affects the skin of the feet. While there is extensive research on the prevalence of tinea pedis in adults, data regarding prevalence in children are limited. Therefore, it is important to gain information about epidemiology and prevalence in pediatric patients to prevent and treat this condition in children.

Methods

A comprehensive search across PubMed and Embase was conducted for studies published up to October 10, 2024. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting on the prevalence of tinea pedis in children (0–19 years) with a study population of a minimum of 100 children. A total of 29 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed to determine prevalence patterns, diagnostic methods, and etiological agents.

Results

The included studies revealed prevalence rates varying from 0.03% to 15.6%. The most common diagnostic methods were clinical examination, microscopy, and culture. The main etiological agents were dermatophytes, specifically Trichophyton rubrum.

Conclusions

This systematic review reveals heterogeneous studies with variations among countries when reporting the prevalence of tinea pedis in children of up to 15.6%. Healthcare professionals should increase awareness of recognizing tinea pedis and consider it a potential diagnosis within the pediatric population.

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^112gQbBm]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Trichophyton indotineae is a recently discovered dermatophyte species that causes recalcitrant dermatophytosis. It was first reported from India and has quickly spread across the globe. The exact prevalence of T. indotineae remains unknown due to limited surveillance. It has reached epidemic proportions in the Indian subcontinent. In India, this new species has largely replaced other previously common dermatophytes. Reports from Western countries suggest most cases are imported, with some reports of local transmission. A recent report from the United Kingdom indicates that T. indotineae now accounts for 38% of dermatophyte isolates tested in their national referral laboratory. T. indotineae causes widespread, inflammatory dermatophytosis affecting large areas of the body. Dermatophytosis caused by T. indotineae is difficult to manage due to the limited availability of mycology laboratories capable of reliably identifying and performing antifungal susceptibility testing, and because of its resistance to commonly used antifungals. Culture and physiological characteristics cannot confirm identification to the species level, requiring species-level confirmation by molecular methods like internal transcribed spacer sequencing. It is important for clinicians and mycology laboratories to be aware of and consider the possibility of T. indotineae infection in patients with relevant demographic, clinical, and travel history. This would decrease delay in diagnosis, prevent inappropriate use of medications like steroids and ineffective antifungal agents, and provide opportunities to make recommendations for good hygiene practices to prevent transmission. In this mini review, we describe the emergence of T. indotineae, its diagnostic and treatment challenges, and the current state, and provide recommendations for future direction.

Returned traveler skin lesion evaluation — lesion morphology and diagnostic confirmation should be emphasized, as "the healthcare professional should consider the morphology of skin lesions noted on physical examination", and "Primary lesions (i.e., those that are unaltered by time, scratching, crusting, or medical treatment) are most useful". The "clinical diagnosis may be straightforward or may require laboratory confirmation using cultures, serologies, skin biopsy, or microscopy". Many problems can reflect "a flare of an existing condition, sometimes because the usual treatment regimen was interrupted while away from home", while others "might coincide with travel or appear shortly thereafter but are unrelated to travel itself, such as the appearance of actinic keratoses… in older travelers with extensive sun exposure history".

### Risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis: real-world evidence from a single-podiatry center, large-scale database in Japan [^112keYXA]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and patients

This study was a single‐center, retrospective, observational study that used a large‐scale database to analyze the risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis in real‐world clinical practice in Japan. Patients aged 20 years or older who visited the Podiatry Center of Juntendo University Hospital between June 2019 and December 2021 were included in the study. Patients who did not agree to participate in the study and those who were deemed inappropriate as study participants by the principal investigator were excluded.

2.2 Analysis of the possible risk factors for developing tinea pedis and onychomycosis

Tinea pedis and onychomycosis were diagnosed by direct microscopy using potassium hydroxide staining. The following possible risk factors were recorded: (1) basic information (patient age, sex, body mass index, chief complaint, and diagnosis) and (2) the presence of associated diseases (tinea pedis, onychomycosis, and diabetes) and symptoms (lower‐limb ischemia [LLI], diabetic peripheral neuropathy [DPN], visual impairment, dialysis, and history of leg ulcers). Patients with skin tissue perfusion pressure (SPP) of < 80 mmHg were diagnosed with LLI. Using the SPP value in each patient, the severity of LLI was categorized as follows: > 80 mmHg, normal; < 80–50 mmHg, borderline; < 50–40 mmHg, suspected peripheral arterial disease; and < 40 mmHg, difficult wound healing. The presence of DPN in diabetic patients was tested using the DPNCheck™ (NeuroMetrix), which is a point‐of‐care, nerve conduction device that is widely used for the detection and severity evaluation of DPN in Japanese clinical practice.DPN severity was categorized as normal, mild, moderate, or severe according to the instruction manual for DPNCheck™. Non‐diabetic patients who did not undergo the DPN test were considered to have no DPN. The presence or absence of visual impairment was determined based on the medical records at the hospital visit.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Oxiconazole nitrate cream should be applied to affected and immediately surrounding areas once to twice daily in patients with tinea pedis, tinea corporis, or tinea cruris. Oxiconazole nitrate cream should be applied once daily in the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor should be treated for 2 weeks and tinea pedis for 1 month to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be reviewed.

Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk that may extend to the neck, arms, and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora.

Investigation and Outcomes

During April–July 2024, four additional patients received a clinical diagnosis of tinea. Samples were collected for fungal culture; following growth, TMVII was identified using Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal gene. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using previously described methods. For each patient's isolate, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of terbinafine and itraconazole were 0.0039 mg/mL and < 0.03 mg/mL, respectively, suggesting susceptibility to these drugs. Patients were treated for presumed TMVII infection before laboratory confirmation and antifungal susceptibility results were available. Data on demographic characteristics, potential exposures, clinical course, and current infection status were obtained as part of clinical care. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. §

All four patients were cisgender men aged 30–39 years who reported recent sexual contact with other men. Patients A and D reported sexual contact with each other; patients B and C had no known epidemiologic link to anyone with known TMVII infection. Patient D was a sex worker. Patient B reported travel to Europe; the other patients reported no recent international travel history. Each patient was screened for other concomitant sexually transmitted infections and received negative test results.

Patient A had no underlying medical conditions and was taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis. He was initially evaluated for a rash on his buttocks. He completed 2 weeks of topical clotrimazole followed by 1 week of topical terbinafine with no improvement. He then was prescribed oral terbinafine (250 mg daily) for a planned 2–4-week course. At last follow-up, the rash was improving.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of tinea pedis in children [^115CS3ax]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot, is a superficial fungal infection primarily caused by the dermatophyte Trichophyton (T.) rubrum. While it predominantly affects adults, its prevalence in children is not negligible. Since the 1960s, an increase in pediatric tinea pedis in Israel has been reported, with a similar recent trend observed for onychomycosis among children. The prevalence of pediatric onychomycosis has been reported to be 0%–7.66%, with a slight increase from 1972 to 2014. Given the perception that tinea pedis is less common in children, understanding its prevalence and identifying age‐related trends is crucial for early detection and management to prevent disease progression and transmission.

Treatment includes topical antifungal agents, such as terbinafine cream, which is the first‐line treatment and is well tolerated in children aged > 2 years. In more severe cases, oral antifungal treatment can be necessary. Preventative measures include keeping the feet dry and avoiding the sharing of footwear.

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the global prevalence of tinea pedis in the pediatric population. Additionally, it seeks to highlight the epidemiological aspect of tinea pedis in a potentially overlooked demographic, thereby raising awareness among healthcare professionals and parents about the importance of recognizing, preventing, and treating this condition in children.

### Benefits and risks of structuring and / or coding the presenting patient history in the electronic health record: systematic review [^111DxX78]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Patient histories in electronic health records currently exist mainly in free text format thereby limiting the possibility that decision support technology may contribute to the accuracy and timeliness of clinical diagnoses. Structuring and/or coding make patient histories potentially computable.

Methods

A systematic review was undertaken of the benefits and risks of structuring and/or coding patient history by searching nine international databases for published and unpublished studies over the period 1990–2010. The focus was on the current patient history, defined as information reported by a patient or the patient's caregiver about the patient's present health situation and health status. Findings were synthesised through a theoretically based textural analysis.

Findings

Of the 9207 potentially eligible papers identified, 10 studies satisfied the eligibility criteria. There was evidence of a modest number of benefits associated with structuring the current patient history, including obtaining more complete clinical histories, improved accuracy of patient self-documented histories, and better associated decision-making by professionals. However, no studies demonstrated any resulting improvements in patient care or outcomes. When more detailed records were obtained through the use of a structured format no attempt was made to confirm if this additional information was clinically useful. No studies investigated possible risks associated with structuring the patient history. No studies examined coding of the patient history.

Conclusions

There is an insufficient evidence base for sound policy making on the benefits and risks of structuring and/or coding patient history. The authors suggest this field of enquiry warrants further investigation given the interest in use of decision support technology to aid diagnoses.

Summary

Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII (TMVII) is an emerging dermatophyte fungus, causing tinea that can be spread through sexual contact. TMVII can cause pruritic, annular, scaly lesions on the trunk, groin, genitals, or face; might be mistaken for eczema, psoriasis, or other dermatologic conditions; and frequently requires oral antifungal therapy. † Some patients experience inflamed, painful, and persistent lesions that can lead to scarring or secondary bacterial infection. TMVII infections have been reported among men who have sex with men in France since March 2021 and previously in men who traveled to Southeast Asia for sex tourism. In June 2024, a TMVII case in the United States was reported in a man who developed genital lesions after traveling to several countries in Europe and to California and who had sexual contact with multiple men while traveling. Clinicians subsequently alerted public health officials of additional patients in the United States who had laboratory-confirmed TMVII infection.

Ringworm

Background

Ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungus. A ringworm infection can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), the body (tinea corporis), the hands (tinea manuum), the feet (tinea pedis or "athlete's foot"), the nails (tinea unguium), the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris of "jock itch"), and the beard area (tinea barbae). Typical symptoms include red, itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, and hair loss.

Ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone whohas a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus. It also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat.

Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body. Over-the-counter topical medication can treat infections on the skin, but a prescription medication taken by mouth is used to treat infections on the scalp. There are rare reports of infections that are resistant to antifungal medicines.

Recommendations

Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection. A rash should not be not used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks.
Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Clinical clues and trends in epidemiology and pathogens in paediatric tinea capitis: a retrospective cohort study [^117V4YtP]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection in children. Pathogens differ between populations. During the past few decades pathogen shifts have been reported in many countries around the world. This study aimed to characterize the pathogens involved in tinea capitis in a large tertiary paediatric medical centre in Israel.

Methods

The electronic medical records of the dermatology unit were searched for patients diagnosed with tinea capitis from 2010 to 2019, and demographic, clinical and mycological data were retrieved. A stepwise logistic regression was performed to determine the variables most significantly associated with positive cultures.

Results

The prevalence of Trichophyton tonsurans isolates was found to be significantly increased during 2019. In the logistic regression analysis, alopecia was most significantly associated with a positive culture (OR = 8.72, 95% CI 4.29–17.7, P < 0.001) while positive culture was also associated with age (OR = 1.11 per year of age, 95% CI 1.02–1.22, P = 0.01) and Ethiopian ethnicity (OR = 3.67, 95% CI 1.42–9.45, P = 0.01). The presentation of alopecia was significantly related to having a positive culture. This symptom was more prevalent in boys than in girls, and the diagnosis of tinea capitis was delayed by an average of 2months in girls.

Conclusion

The results of this study may herald a pathogen shift in Israel. Physicians should be aware that rates of alopecia are lower in girls and this can result in delayed diagnosis and the development of complications, including chronicity, scarring alopecia and kerion formation.

### Alopecias in lupus erythematosus [^1144LWB2]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Syphilitic alopecia

Alopecia can be an early manifestation of secondary syphilis and presents as 'moth-eaten' hairless patches resembling alopecia areata or diffuse hair thinning such as in telogen effluvium/anagen effluvium. It is also considered a form of anagen arrest, such as what occurs in a severe illness. Histopathological infiltrates can resemble those seen in alopecia areata. In trichoscopy, deep red-brown background pigments represent small-vessel vasculitis. With a high index of suspicion, a full infectious work-up (rapid plasma reagin, venereal disease research laboratory test and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, among others) should be carried out.

Tinea capitis

Although tinea capitis is uncommon in the adult population, a chronically immunocompromised state such as in LE can predispose a patient to acquiring fungal infections on unusual sites like the scalp. Depending on the fungal species, the presentation can be scales, follicular erythema and broken hairs, or can be a greyish patch superimposed on chronic DLE lesions. Plucked hairs should be examined with potassium hydroxide and sent for cultures.

### Global skin disease morbidity and mortality: an update from the global burden of disease study 2013 [^117TPRDB]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Data points from the aforementioned literature search were analyzed in a Bayesian meta-regression modeling tool, DisMod-MR 2.0, to yield prevalence estimates that are consistent with the other available epidemiological parameters for each of the skin conditions. All estimates were generated with 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of the quantity of interest, which allows for generation of 95% uncertainty intervals. Compared with the previous GBD 2010 study, DisMod-MR was recoded and optimized to run up to 50 times faster and shifted from a negative binomial to an offset log-normal model.

The literature search for GBD 2013 compared with GBD 2010 doubled the data set for psoriasis with an additional 30 prevalence and 5 incidence studies. Psoriasis was also modeled with a smaller remission assumption (0.05–0.15 remitted cases per case per year), better reflecting a chronic disease pattern. Of note, the GBD definition of remission is the rate at which cases stop fulfilling the case definition, that is, cure. For cellulitis, 13 191 incidence data points from both inpatient and outpatient samples were added. No additional data sources were added for pyoderma in GBD 2013. However, duration of disease was decreased from approximately 1 year in GBD 2010 to between 2 weeks for treated disease to 4 weeks for untreated disease in GBD 2013. For fungal skin diseases, prevalence was estimated separately for tinea capitis and "other fungal skin diseases". Similarly, prevalences of viral warts and molluscum contagiosum were modeled separately and then summarized as "viral skin diseases". In GBD 2010, studies for "itch" were used as prevalence of pruritus, which inaccurately included cases of pruritic skin and nonskin conditions. Comparatively, GBD 2013 included only outpatient data from Norway and the United States and several data points from the literature of patients with a diagnosis of pruritus (excluding known causes of itch). While no additional data sources were added, acne vulgaris modeling in GBD 2013 no longer assumes that reported data include asymptomatic cases because most data points were based on examination and therefore would reflect symptomatic cases. For alopecia areata, GBD 2013 applied lower estimates from the largest data source (outpatient data from the United States). No new data sources for urticaria were added; however, similarly to the case for acne vulgaris, GBD 2013 urticaria data points reflect solely symptomatic cases. For decubitus ulcer, input data were incidence from hospital admission and outpatient data. In GBD 2010, implausible duration estimates led to an overestimate of prevalence, which has been corrected in GBD 2013. Global Burden of Disease 2013 set bounds on the remission rate from 0.5 to 6 corresponding to duration range of 2 months to 2 years.

### Onychomycosis: clinical overview and diagnosis [^113WdMnk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast, and is the most common nail disorder seen in clinical practice. It is an important problem because it may cause local pain, paresthesias, difficulties performing activities of daily life, and impair social interactions. In this continuing medical education series we review the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation of onychomycosis and demonstrate current and emerging diagnostic strategies.

### Acral manifestations of fungal infections [^113rNupU]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Fungal infections, which are named according to the body site involved, can affect any skin area, the fingernails, or the toenails. Numerous fungal agents are responsible for both superficial and deep fungal diseases. Dermatophytes and Candida spp are the most common causative organisms on the surface of the hands, feet, and nails of patients with superficial fungal diseases; however, although deep fungal infections of the skin are less common compared with superficial fungal diseases, their incidence is increasing worldwide due to cross-border travel. Most superficial fungal diseases are diagnosed clinically, but sometimes direct microscopic examination with potassium hydroxide and fungal culture may be necessary for diagnosis, especially in patients suspected of having tinea incognito. In cases of superficial fungal infections except for onychomycosis and tinea incognito, topical treatments are usually sufficient and effective, but systemic treatments may be required in recalcitrant cases. Deep fungal diseases may resemble each other clinically; therefore, the organism must be identified with laboratory methods and should be treated for a long period. We review the most important clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects of fungal diseases. This paper covers fungal problems encountered both in hospitals and in general practice.

### Internal environment of footwear is a risk factor for tinea pedis [^115u4JXA]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Further, my results show that the optimal cut‐off point for discriminating between the risk of tinea pedis and non‐tinea pedis is 75% humidity for both patients with TP only and fungal foot disease; humidity and dew point can be assumed to be even higher in the interdigital area and areas close to the skin surface of the foot. Indeed, the average humidity of the fourth interdigital area in the summer was 80%, average maximum humidity was 84%, maximum humidity was 91% and average dew point was 31°C. A humid environment is important for the development of tinea infections; 25, 26, 28, 30, 31, 33 however, high humidity was not the major factor contributing to the development of tinea manuum, tinea corporis and tinea capitis, 31 but rather the high‐temperature and high‐humidity environment. Based on these studies, the following three factors can be considered necessary for tinea development: an environment with high temperature and high humidity (temperature and humidity), sufficient dermatophyte adhesion time (time) and fine scratches on the skin or nails (injury). 4, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 Reducing these three conditions can prevent exacerbating TP infections. In addition, the length of time that footwear is worn is also thought to be a risk factor for TP.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114UMZjh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellular immunodeficiency — assessment and initial management of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) should include the following: "Consider immediate consultation with a dermatologist familiar with cutaneous manifestations of infection in patients with cellular immune defects" (weak, low); "Consider biopsy and surgical debridement early in the management of these patients" (weak, low); "Empiric antibiotics, antifungals, and/or antivirals should be considered in life-threatening situations" (weak, moderate), and "The use of specific agents should be decided with the input of the primary team, dermatology, infectious disease, and other consulting teams" (strong, moderate). The evidence summary notes these patients are predisposed to infection, may not have systemic manifestations, and that clinicians "should have a very low threshold to obtain a skin biopsy".
