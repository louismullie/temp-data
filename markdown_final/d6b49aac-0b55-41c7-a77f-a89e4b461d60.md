## Question

What is the relationship between MGMT methylation and temozolomide?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between MGMT promoter methylation and temozolomide responsiveness in glioblastoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about temozolomide's mechanism of action and why O6-methylguanine is the critical lesion. Then, I should verify MGMT's repair role and how promoter methylation alters MGMT expression. Next, I will examine prospective clinical evidence that MGMT methylation is predictive and prognostic, followed by real-world validation and guideline recommendations. After that, I need to check limitations: assay variability, discordance with protein expression, temporal instability, and alternative regulatory mechanisms. Finally, I will synthesize how to apply MGMT status in practice while acknowledging edge cases and combination strategies.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic link between TMZ and O6-methylguanine lesions. Temozolomide generates methyl adducts at several positions, but the O6-methylguanine adduct is the principal cytotoxic lesion that mispairs with thymine during replication, triggering MMR-dependent futile repair cycles and culminating in lethal DNA damage and apoptosis; this is the canonical rationale for TMZ efficacy in cells that cannot efficiently reverse O6-meG lesions [^111uNMhZ] [^113dUiQ9].

> I should confirm MGMT's role next. MGMT removes the methyl group from O6-meG in a one-step stoichiometric "suicide" reaction, thereby averting the MMR-dependent cytotoxic cascade and conferring resistance to alkylating agents; high MGMT activity neutralizes TMZ's key lesion, whereas low or absent MGMT permits O6-meG persistence and downstream cell death [^111uNMhZ] [^1163ScWQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check how MGMT expression is regulated in tumors. Promoter CpG island hypermethylation silences MGMT transcription in a substantial subset of GBMs, leading to reduced MGMT protein and impaired repair of O6-meG, which restores TMZ's cytotoxic mechanism and improves treatment sensitivity; this epigenetic inactivation is the core biological basis for MGMT methylation as a biomarker [^1121KRo2] [^111uNMhZ].

> Next, I should review prospective clinical data to verify predictive and prognostic effects. In a randomized trial, patients with MGMT-methylated GBM derived a clear survival benefit from radiotherapy plus TMZ versus radiotherapy alone, with median OS 21.7 months vs 15.3 months, while unmethylated tumors showed no statistically significant benefit, establishing MGMT methylation as both a favorable prognostic factor and a predictive marker for TMZ benefit; these findings aligned with an earlier prospective phase II study linking MGMT methylation to prolonged survival under TMZ chemoradiation, and were foreshadowed by prior evidence in nitrosourea-treated gliomas [^1121KRo2] [^112k2T6u] [^116DSo5u].

> Wait, let me verify real-world external validity. Large-scale NCDB analyses corroborate that MGMT promoter methylation associates with improved survival predominantly in patients who actually receive standard chemoradiation, reinforcing its clinical utility as a predictor of TMZ benefit rather than a universal prognostic marker across treatment contexts; these datasets also quantify complementary effects of extent of resection alongside MGMT status, which is important for holistic prognostication [^115qCsDN].

> I will now examine guideline implications and practical decision-making. EANO recommends MGMT promoter methylation testing for all adults with GBM, with particular relevance in older or frail patients where TMZ monotherapy may be considered if methylated, and de-emphasized if unmethylated; in newly diagnosed, fit patients, standard chemoradiation remains appropriate while MGMT status refines risk and trial eligibility, and for unmethylated tumors, consideration of combination strategies or clinical trials is reasonable while recognizing RTOG 0525 found no benefit to dose-intense TMZ schedules [^1139Ywh3] [^112hebGf] [^112Jabuc].

> But wait, what if methylation and protein expression don't align; I should double-check sources on discordance and alternative regulation. Discordance can arise from monoallelic methylation, assay region selection, or post-transcriptional regulation; MGMT expression may also be influenced by p53 and gene body methylation rather than promoter status alone, and recurrent tumors can acquire resistance via MGMT genomic rearrangements that drive overexpression independent of promoter methylation, all of which complicate binary interpretation and can shift between diagnosis and recurrence under treatment selection pressure [^116CSiRX] [^115rBshA] [^114LxgEQ] [^116kE64z] [^11396gKq].

> Hold on, I should verify assay variability and thresholds before making firm calls. There is no universal consensus on the optimal assay or cut-point; methods like MSP, pyrosequencing, or HPLC interrogate different CpG regions and yield varying quantitative cutoffs, with evidence for a "gray zone" of intermediate methylation that still confers partial benefit, underscoring the need for method-aware interpretation and, where possible, integration with protein expression or functional context [^1153p4Fk] [^116CdeNE].

> Let me consider quantitative relationships and radiologic correlates; I need to ensure I'm not overextending. Higher quantitative methylation levels by pyrosequencing have correlated with greater volumetric response on MRI and better survival in IDH-wildtype GBM, suggesting a dose–response relationship within methylated ranges, although heterogeneity across cohorts and assays warrants cautious extrapolation and local validation of cutoffs [^115Z7r9W] [^112V6xod].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what about patients with unmethylated MGMT; are there credible strategies to enhance benefit. While standard dose escalation did not improve outcomes, combination approaches such as adding lomustine, radiosensitization phenomena observed preclinically, and multi-agent combinations in select contexts have shown signals that some unmethylated tumors can derive benefit, best pursued in trials and individualized scenarios given mixed evidence and potential toxicity trade-offs [^112hebGf] [^113dUiQ9] [^111Vtdfw] [^114Vbw57].

> Let me synthesize and confirm the core relationship before concluding. MGMT promoter methylation silences MGMT, allowing O6-meG lesions to persist and engage MMR-mediated cytotoxicity, thereby predicting meaningful survival benefit from temozolomide and conferring overall more favorable prognosis; conversely, unmethylated tumors express MGMT, rapidly reverse O6-meG, and often resist TMZ, though exceptions exist due to tumor heterogeneity, alternative DNA repair defects, and treatment combinations, which is why guidelines mandate MGMT testing and encourage trial enrollment when appropriate [^1121KRo2] [^1139Ywh3].

MGMT methylation silences the MGMT DNA repair gene [^1121KRo2], reducing the tumor's ability to fix temozolomide-induced O6-methylguanine lesions [^1163ScWQ] and thereby **increasing chemosensitivity** [^111uNMhZ]. Tumors with MGMT promoter methylation have significantly **better response rates and longer survival with temozolomide** [^112k2T6u], while unmethylated tumors are more resistant and have poorer outcomes [^1121KRo2] [^112ZhGSM]. MGMT methylation is a validated **predictive and prognostic biomarker** that guides temozolomide use, especially in elderly or frail patients [^1139Ywh3] [^112DZkmq].

---

## Biological mechanism linking MGMT methylation and temozolomide sensitivity

- **Temozolomide mechanism**: TMZ methylates DNA at the O6 position of guanine, creating O6-methylguanine lesions [^1163ScWQ] that mispair with thymine during replication, triggering mismatch repair, DNA damage, and cell death [^111uNMhZ].

- **MGMT function**: MGMT repairs O6-methylguanine lesions by transferring the methyl group to itself [^113j2xso], preventing TMZ-induced cytotoxicity and causing resistance [^111uNMhZ].

- **Effect of methylation**: MGMT promoter methylation silences MGMT expression [^1121KRo2], allowing O6-methylguanine lesions to persist and increasing TMZ sensitivity [^111uNMhZ].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting MGMT methylation as a predictive biomarker

- **Landmark trial**: In a randomized trial, MGMT-methylated glioblastomas had significantly longer survival with radiotherapy plus TMZ (median 21.7 months) versus radiotherapy alone (15.3 months) [^1121KRo2]; unmethylated tumors had minimal benefit.

- **Prospective validation**: A phase II trial showed MGMT methylation independently predicted better outcomes with TMZ-based chemoradiation [^112k2T6u].

- **Unresectable GBM**: In unresectable GBM, MGMT methylation was the strongest predictor of overall and progression-free survival with standard chemoradiation [^112ZhGSM].

---

## Prognostic significance of MGMT methylation

MGMT methylation is associated with **longer overall and progression-free survival** [^1121KRo2] in glioblastoma, independent of treatment [^115qLRit]. Among **elderly patients**, it correlates with improved survival and is the **strongest independent prognostic factor** [^112DZkmq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Routine testing is advised by EANO 2021, which recommends **MGMT methylation testing** in glioblastoma — especially in elderly or frail patients — to guide TMZ use [^1139Ywh3]. As the **standard of care** [^1141vuUV], MGMT methylation status is used to stratify patients and inform treatment decisions in clinical practice [^1139Ywh3].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Heterogeneity**: Intratumoral heterogeneity [^112MhqQz] and temporal changes can affect MGMT methylation assessment and interpretation [^11396gKq].

- **Testing variability**: Different assays and lack of standardized cutoffs [^1153p4Fk] can lead to inconsistent results [^114wqXEx].

- **Other resistance mechanisms**: Additional resistance pathways (e.g. mismatch repair defects) [^116kE64z] can limit TMZ efficacy even in methylated tumors [^11398V4X].

---

MGMT promoter methylation is a **key biomarker** [^1121KRo2] that predicts and prognosticates response to temozolomide in glioblastoma, and its assessment is integral to treatment planning [^1139Ywh3], particularly in older or frail patients.

### MGMT genomic rearrangements contribute to chemotherapy resistance in gliomas [^111uNMhZ]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

The therapeutic benefits of TMZ depend on its ability to methylate DNA, which occurs at the N-7 and O6 positions of guanine and the N-3 position of adenine. Although the minor product O6-methylguanine (O6-meG) accounts for less than 10% of total alkylation, it has the greatest potential to induce apoptosis. During DNA replication, O6-meG pairs with thymine instead of cytosine. The O6-meG:thymine mismatch is recognized by the post-replication mismatch repair (MMR) system and, according to the futile repair hypothesis, ultimately leads to DNA double-strand breaks, cell-cycle arrest, and cell death. The O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) enzyme is responsible for the direct repair of the O6-meG lesion by transferring the alkyl group from guanine to a cysteine residue. Epigenetic silencing due to promoter methylation of the MGMT gene prevents the synthesis of this enzyme, consequently increasing the tumor's sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects induced by TMZ and other alkylating compounds. As of today, MGMT promoter hypermethylation is the only known biomarker for TMZ response. However, the discordance between promoter methylation and protein expression detected in a subset of patients limits the prognostic value of methylation assessment. Moreover, while MGMT methylation at diagnosis predicts longer survival, this is not the case at recurrence. These pieces of evidence suggest that other mechanisms, in addition to promoter methylation, could contribute to MGMT upregulation in recurrent tumors.

### Clinical trial substantiates the predictive value of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation in glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide [^112k2T6u]. Clinical Cancer Research (2004). High credibility.

In the setting of a prospective clinical trial, we determined the predictive value of the methylation status of the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter for outcome in glioblastoma patients treated with the alkylating agent temozolomide. Expression of this excision repair enzyme has been associated with resistance to alkylating chemotherapy.

- **Experimental design**: The methylation status of MGMT in the tumor biopsies was evaluated in 38 patients undergoing resection for newly diagnosed glioblastoma and enrolled in a Phase II trial testing concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide and radiation. The epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene was determined using methylation-specific PCR.

- **Results**: Inactivation of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation was associated with longer survival (P = 0.0051; Log-rank test). At 18 months, survival was 62% (16 of 26) for patients testing positive for a methylated MGMT promoter but reached only 8% (1 of 12) in the absence of methylation (P = 0.002; Fisher's exact test). In the presence of other clinically relevant factors, methylation of the MGMT promoter remains the only significant predictor (P = 0.017; Cox regression).

- **Conclusions**: This prospective clinical trial identifies MGMT-methylation status as an independent predictor for glioblastoma patients treated with a methylating agent. The association of the epigenetic inactivation of the DNA repair gene MGMT with a better outcome in this homogenous cohort may have important implications for the design of future trials and supports efforts to deplete MGMT by O-6-benzylguanin.

### Outcome in unresectable glioblastoma: MGMT promoter methylation makes the difference [^112ZhGSM]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2011, we reported a predominant prognostic/predictive role of MGMT promoter methylation status on progression-free survival (PFS) in unresectable glioblastoma patients undergoing upfront radiotherapy plus concomitant and maintenance temozolomide (RTX/TMZ → TMZ). Here, we present the final results of this prospective study focusing on the prognostic/predictive value of MGMT promoter methylation status for death risk stratification. Overall, 56 adult patients with unresectable, biopsy-proven glioblastoma were prospectively assigned to upfront RTX/TMZ → TMZ treatment between March 2006 and August 2008. The last follow-up was performed in June 2016.

MGMT promoter methylation was determined using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and sodium bisulfite sequencing. Analyses were done by intention to treat, and prognostic factors were obtained from proportional hazard models. At the time of the final analysis, 55 patients showed progressive disease and 53 patients had died. MGMT promoter was methylated in 30 patients and unmethylated in 26. Methylation of the MGMT promoter was the strongest favorable predictor for overall survival (OS, median: 20.3 vs. 7.3 months, p < 0.001, HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16–0.55), and PFS (median: 15.0 vs. 6.1 months, p < 0.001, HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17–0.57), and was also associated with higher frequencies of treatment response and prolonged post-recurrence survival (PRS, median: 4.5 vs. 1.4 months, p < 0.002, HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21–0.71). Knowledge of MGMT promoter methylation status is essential for patient counseling, prognostic evaluation, and the design of future trials.

### MGMT gene silencing and benefit from temozolomide in glioblastoma [^1121KRo2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). High credibility.

Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) DNA-repair gene by promoter methylation compromises DNA repair and has been associated with longer survival in patients with glioblastoma who receive alkylating agents.

- **Methods**: We tested the relationship between MGMT silencing in the tumor and the survival of patients who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy combined with concomitant and adjuvant treatment with temozolomide. The methylation status of the MGMT promoter was determined by methylation-specific polymerase-chain-reaction analysis.

- **Results**: The MGMT promoter was methylated in 45 percent of 206 assessable cases. Irrespective of treatment, MGMT promoter methylation was an independent favorable prognostic factor (P < 0.001 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.61). Among patients whose tumor contained a methylated MGMT promoter, a survival benefit was observed in patients treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy; their median survival was 21.7 months (95 percent confidence interval, 17.4 to 30.4), as compared with 15.3 months (95 percent confidence interval, 13.0 to 20.9) among those who were assigned to only radiotherapy (P = 0.007 by the log-rank test). In the absence of methylation of the MGMT promoter, there was a smaller and statistically insignificant difference in survival between the treatment groups.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with glioblastoma containing a methylated MGMT promoter benefited from temozolomide, whereas those who did not.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for glioblastoma, particularly molecular testing for IDH mutation, MGMT promoter methylation, and 1p/19q co-deletion, the EANO 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining MGMT promoter methylation status testing in patients with glioblastoma. This is especially important for elderly or frail patients to aid in decision-making regarding the use of temozolomide.

### Molecular dosimetry of temozolomide: Quantification of critical lesions, correlation to cell death responses, and threshold doses [^1163ScWQ]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

O⁶-MeG is repaired by the suicide enzyme O⁶-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) through a damage reversal reaction. In repair-competent cells, O⁶-MeG is quickly removed from DNA, whereas in repair-incompetent cells, O⁶-MeG persists. This persistence occurs because O⁶-MeG is not eliminated by spontaneous hydrolysis and can be transmitted to subsequent cell generations, exerting long-term effects.

The MGMT gene is subject to intensive genetic and epigenetic regulation; therefore, cells and tissues vary considerably in repair capacity. High expression levels of MGMT are observed in the liver, with the lowest in the brain. In rat brain tissue, MGMT is completely absent, leading to the persistence of O⁶-MeG. This absence is a reason for neurotropic carcinogenesis following exposure to SN1 methylating agents such as N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. In contrast, the human brain expresses MGMT, although at relatively low levels compared to other organs. About 40% of human brain cancers (glioma grade 3 and 4) exhibit MGMT promoter hypermethylation, which is related to MGMT downregulation, and 17% of glioblastomas (GBM) lack MGMT repair activity, as determined in enzymatic assays. Therefore, promoter-methylated GBMs are responsive to TMZ therapy.

### MGMT genomic rearrangements contribute to chemotherapy resistance in gliomas [^116kE64z]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent used for the treatment of glioblastoma and is now becoming a chemotherapeutic option in patients diagnosed with high-risk low-grade gliomas. The O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is responsible for the direct repair of the main TMZ-induced toxic DNA adduct, the O6-Methylguanine lesion. MGMT promoter hypermethylation is currently the only known biomarker for TMZ response in glioblastoma patients. Here, we show that a subset of reGliomas carries MGMT genomic rearrangements that lead to MGMT overexpression, independently from changes in its promoter methylation. By leveraging CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated some of these MGMT rearrangements in glioma cells and demonstrated that the MGMT genomic rearrangements contribute to TMZ resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, we showed that such fusions can be detected in tumor-derived exosomes and could potentially represent an early detection marker of tumor recurrence in a subset of patients treated with TMZ.

### Assessment of MGMT methylation status using high-performance liquid chromatography in newly diagnosed glioblastoma [^1153p4Fk]. Clinical Epigenetics (2020). High credibility.

The utility of O⁶-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter methylation status as a prognostic marker for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) has been established. However, the number of CpG sites that must be methylated to cause transcriptional silencing remains unclear, and no significant consensus exists on the optimal method for assessing MGMT methylation. We developed a new high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method that enables accurate analysis of DNA methylation levels using long PCR products. In the present study, we analyzed the MGMT methylation status of 28 isocitrate dehydrogenase-wild-type GBMs treated with temozolomide using ion-exchange HPLC and set optimal cutoff values.

- **Results**: We designed three primers for separate regions (regions 1–3) that had 21 to 38 CpGs for PCR and validated the MGMT promoter methylation status using frozen samples. There was a strong correlation between HPLC and bisulfite sequencing results (R = 0.794). The optimal cutoff values for MGMT methylation in HPLC were determined to allow differentiation of patient prognosis by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The cutoff values were 34.15% for region 1, 8.84% for region 2, and 36.72% for region 3. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis estimated that the most differentiated prognosis was enabled in the setting of 8.84% methylation of MGMT in region 2. Progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly longer for patients in this setting of region 2 methylation (p = 0.00365 and p = 0.00258, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: The combination of these analyses indicates the potential significance of specific methylation percentages in determining patient prognosis in newly diagnosed glioblastoma cases.

### Treatment practices and survival outcomes for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients according to MGMT promoter methylation status: Insights from the U.S. National Cancer Database [^1141vuUV]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). High credibility.

To address these disparities, future clinical guidelines should emphasize routine MGMT testing for all newly diagnosed GBM patients, highlighting populations that are less likely to undergo molecular testing, such as the elderly, those with limited insurance coverage, and communities with lower educational attainment. With an increasing number of clinical trials using MGMT testing as an enrollment criterion, expanding insurance coverage or providing subsidies for testing could improve accessibility for all patients. Additionally, reforms at the hospital level could be implemented to ensure adequate infrastructure for timely MGMT testing. Taken together, MGMT testing can provide crucial insights into optimal treatment options for GBM patients, in addition to acting as a prognostic marker, and should be considered standard practice in the comprehensive management of GBM.

### Radiogenomics as an integrated approach to glioblastoma precision medicine [^112MhqQz]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The MGMT gene encodes the DNA repair enzyme, O 6-methylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase. Methylation of the MGMT promoter is associated with an enhanced response to alkylating agents such as temozolomide, increased response to radiotherapy, and increased overall survival. However, achieving accurate prediction is challenging, as MGMT promoter methylation is irregular, area-specific, and can change over the disease course. Numerous studies have aimed to predict MGMT methylation status using a variety of imaging modalities. Wei et al. (2019) extracted radiomic features from T1w, T2-FLAIR, and ADC maps, and developed a fusion radiomics signature to combine clinical factors with these texture features.

- **Deep learning algorithms**: DL algorithms have also been investigated to aid this prediction. Korfiatis et al. (2017) compared three different residual deep neural network (ResNet) architectures to evaluate their ability to predict MGMT methylation status in GBM patients. ResNet50 (50 layers) outperformed the other models with shallower architectures (ResNet34 and ResNet18, with 34 and 18 layers respectively), achieving an accuracy of 94.9% in the test set. More recently, a DL pipeline has been utilized for automatic tumor segmentation and MGMT promoter status classification using T1w and T2-FLAIR images.

### Posttreatment effect of MGMT methylation level on glioblastoma survival [^115qLRit]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) removes temozolomide-induced alkylation, thereby preventing DNA damage and cytotoxicity. We investigated the prognostic effect of different MGMT methylation levels on overall and progression-free survival in 327 patients with primary glioblastoma undergoing standard treatment. MGMT methylation levels in 4 CpG sites were obtained using pyrosequencing.

- **Association with survival**: The association between MGMT methylation level and survival was investigated using the Cox proportional hazards model and an extension to detect time-varying effects. We found an association between MGMT methylation level and overall survival (OS) from around 9 months after diagnosis, with no association between MGMT methylation level and OS before that. For patients surviving at least 9 months, even small increases in MGMT methylation level are significantly beneficial (HR = 0.97, 95% CI [0.96, 0.98]). The predictive ability of MGMT methylation level on OS from 9 months after diagnosis has a Harrel's C of 66%.

We conclude that the MGMT methylation level is strongly associated with survival only for patients surviving beyond 9 months, with considerable effects for levels much lower than previously reported. Prognostic evaluation of cut-points of MGMT methylation levels and of CpG island site selection should take the time-varying effect on overall survival into account.

### Mgmt testing — the challenges for biomarker-based glioma treatment [^114wqXEx]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Many patients with malignant gliomas do not respond to alkylating agent chemotherapy. Alkylator resistance of glioma cells is primarily mediated by the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation in glioma cells compromises this DNA repair mechanism and increases chemosensitivity. MGMT promoter methylation is, therefore, a strong prognostic biomarker in pediatric and adult patients with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide. Notably, elderly patients (> 65–70 years) with glioblastoma whose tumors lack MGMT promoter methylation derive minimal benefit from such chemotherapy. As a result, MGMT promoter methylation status has become a frequently requested laboratory test in neuro-oncology.

This review presents data on the prognostic and predictive relevance of MGMT testing. It discusses clinical trials that have used MGMT status to select participants, evaluates known issues concerning the molecular testing procedure, and addresses the necessity for molecular-context-dependent interpretation of MGMT test results. Whether MGMT promoter methylation testing should be offered to all individuals with glioblastoma, or only to elderly patients and those in clinical trials, is also discussed. Justifications for withholding alkylating agent chemotherapy in patients with MGMT-unmethylated glioblastomas outside clinical trials, and the potential role for MGMT testing in other gliomas, are also examined.

### Temozolomide in the era of precision medicine [^11398V4X]. Cancer Research (2017). Low credibility.

In the January 1, 2017, issue of Cancer Research, Nagel and colleagues demonstrate the value of assays that determine the DNA repair capacity of cancers in predicting response to temozolomide. Using a fluorescence-based multiplex flow cytometric host cell reactivation assay that provides simultaneous readout of DNA repair capacity across multiple pathways, they show that the multivariate drug response models derived from cell line data were applicable to patient-derived xenograft models of glioblastoma.

In this commentary, we first outline the mechanism of activity and clinical application of temozolomide, which, until now, has been largely limited to glioblastoma. Given the challenges of clinical application of functional assays, we argue that functional readouts be approximated by genomic signatures. In this context, a combination of MGMT activity and mismatch repair (MMR) status of the tumor are important parameters that determine sensitivity to temozolomide. More reliable methods are needed to determine MGMT activity as DNA methylation, the standard, does not accurately reflect the expression of MGMT. Also, genomics for MMR are warranted.

Furthermore, based on patterns of MGMT expression across different solid tumors, we make a case for revisiting temozolomide use in a broader spectrum of cancers based on our understanding of its molecular basis of activity.

### Targeted modulation of MGMT: Clinical implications [^113j2xso]. Clinical Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

O(6)-Methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) has been studied for over 20 years as a gene associated with the mutagenicity and cytotoxicity induced by either methylating carcinogens or alkylating (methylating and chloroethylating) therapeutic agents. Pioneering studies of alkylating agents identified alkylated guanine at the O(6) position, the substrate of MGMT, as a potentially promutagenic and lethal toxic DNA lesion. MGMT plays a prominent role in DNA adduct repair that limits the mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents. Because of its role in cancer etiology and chemotherapy resistance, MGMT is of particular interest. In this article, the clinical effect of MGMT expression and targeted modulation of MGMT will be summarized.

### Correlation between O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase and survival in elderly patients with glioblastoma treated with radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide [^112DZkmq]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Epigenetic silencing of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) gene by promoter methylation is correlated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who receive alkylating agents. The aim of this study is to determine the correlation between MGMT and survival in elderly patients with GBM treated with radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ).

Eighty-three patients aged 70 years or older with histologically confirmed GBM treated with RT plus TMZ between February 2005 and September 2009 were investigated in this study. The methylation status of the MGMT promoter was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Median PFS and OS were 7.5 and 12.8 months, respectively. The MGMT promoter was methylated in 42 patients (50.6%) and unmethylated in 41 patients (49.4%).

Median OS was 15.3 months in methylated patients and 10.2 months in unmethylated patients (P = 0.0001). Median PFS was 10.5 months in methylated tumors and 5.5 months in unmethylated tumors (P = 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, MGMT methylation status emerged as the strongest independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS (P = 0.004 and P = 0.005, respectively).

The results of the present study suggest that MGMT methylation status might be an important prognostic factor associated with better OS and PFS in elderly patients with GBM treated with RT and TMZ.

### Temporal stability of MGMT promoter methylation in glioblastoma patients undergoing STUPP protocol [^11396gKq]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Epigenetic silencing of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter via methylation in glioblastoma (GBM) has been correlated with a more favourable response to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents such as temozolomide. The use of global methylation surrogates, such as Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element 1 (LINE1), may also be valuable to fully understand these highly heterogeneous tumours.

In this study, we analysed both original and recurrent GBMs (reGBMs) in 22 patients (i.e. 44 tumours) for both MGMT and LINE1 methylation status. Among the 22 patients, 14 (63.6%) displayed MGMT methylation stability in the reGBM versus 8 (36.4%) with instability of methylation status. No significant differences in overall and progression-free survival were evident between these two groups. LINE1 methylation status remained stable for 12 (54.5%) of reGBM patients versus 9 (41%) of the patients with instability in LINE1 methylation status (p = 0.02), resulting in an increase in overall survival of the stable LINE1 group (p = 0.04).

The results demonstrated major epigenetic instability of GBMs treated with temozolomide as part of the STUPP protocol. GBMs appear to undergo selective evolution post-treatment and have the ability to recur with a newly reprogrammed epigenetic status. Selective targeting of the altered epigenomes in reGBMs may facilitate the future development of both prognostic biomarkers and enhanced therapeutic strategies.

### Outcome-based determination of optimal pyrosequencing assay for MGMT methylation detection in glioblastoma patients [^112Jabuc]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy into the standard care protocol for glioblastoma (GBM) patients, the analysis of O⁶-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status has become a key biological marker. MGMT is a DNA repair protein that removes alkyl adducts on the O⁶ position of guanine, inducing resistance against alkylating agents such as TMZ. MGMT status is currently used to stratify patients in clinical trials, such as in the RTOG 0525 randomized phase III trial that compared standard adjuvant TMZ with a dose-dense schedule in newly diagnosed GBM patients. It was also used to select patients in the CENTRIC phase III trial, which assesses the usefulness of adding cilengitide to the standard treatment in newly diagnosed GBM patients.

As MGMT status is a strong predictive factor of response to treatment with TMZ, it is determined in most ongoing clinical trials using this drug. The recently published results of the NOA-08 trial on elderly malignant astrocytoma patients and the Nordic trial on elderly GBM patients showed that elderly malignant astrocytoma patients with methylated MGMT promoter may receive as much benefit from TMZ as from radiotherapy alone. This suggests that testing MGMT methylation status may aid treatment decision-making in these patients, potentially increasing the demand for MGMT methylation testing in clinical practice.

### MGMT promoter methylation is a strong prognostic biomarker for benefit from dose-intensified temozolomide rechallenge in progressive glioblastoma: The DIRECTOR trial [^115UVUsa]. Clinical Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate temozolomide (TMZ) rechallenge at the first progression of glioblastoma after temozolomide chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT→TMZ) in retrospective and single-arm prospective studies using continuous or 7/14 or 21/28 day schedules. The DIRECTOR trial aimed to demonstrate the superiority of the 7/14 regimen.

- **Experimental design**: Patients with glioblastoma at first progression after TMZ/RT→TMZ and at least two maintenance temozolomide cycles were randomized to Arm A [one week on (120 mg/m² per day)/one week off] or Arm B [three weeks on (80 mg/m² per day)/one week off]. The primary endpoint was the median time-to-treatment failure (TTF), defined as progression, premature temozolomide discontinuation due to toxicity, or death from any cause. O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation was prospectively assessed by methylation-specific PCR.

- **Results**: Due to the withdrawal of support, the trial was prematurely closed to accrual after 105 patients. There were similar outcomes in both arms for median TTF [A: 1.8 months; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.8–3.2 vs. B: 2.0 months; 95% CI, 1.8–3.5] and overall survival [A: 9.8 months (95% CI, 6.7–13.0) vs. B: 10.6 months (95% CI, 8.1–11.6)]. Median TTF in patients with MGMT-methylated tumors was 3.2 months (95% CI, 1.8–7.4) versus 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.8–2) in MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma. Progression-free survival rates at 6 months (PFS-6) were 39.7% with versus 6.9% without MGMT promoter methylation.

- **Conclusions**: Temozolomide rechallenge is a treatment option for MGMT promoter methylation.

### Combination chemotherapy versus temozolomide for patients with methylated MGMT (m-MGMT) glioblastoma: Results of computational biological modeling to predict the magnitude of treatment benefit [^114rPXMx]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Biosimulation derives the signaling pathway impact from the totality of genomic aberrations represented by mutations and copy number aberrations to determine the consequences for hallmark behaviors of cancer, including proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, immune evasion, and a composite malignant phenotype represented by cell number (see Supplementary Sect. 1 for additional details).

For each patient, treatment efficacy scores (T eff) were computed for TMZ, lomustine, and the combination of both drugs based on their ability to reverse the phenotypic changes driving disease progression (i.e. proliferation) and to produce cell death (i.e. DNA damage, reactive oxygen species, survival, apoptotic blockade). In essence, computational modeling of genomic aberrations and the dysregulated signaling pathways that follow permits a quantitative determination of various phenotypic behaviors of each individual's cancer. The magnitude of divergence of each phenotype from the healthy cell characterizes the disease state and drug response for each patient, which varies across the population according to the genomic abnormalities represented in the model. For example, some patients' cancers are characterized by homologous recombination repair deficiency or DNA checkpoint defects which enhance responsiveness to chemotherapy. Others have mismatch repair deficits that compromise the benefit of temozolomide. Some patients have epigenetic aberrations that result in a highly proliferative cancer, while others may have signaling pathway dys.

### Assessment of quantitative and allelic MGMT methylation patterns as a prognostic marker in glioblastoma [^116CSiRX]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Methylation of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a predictive and prognostic marker in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide, but the method of MGMT methylation assessment to ensure optimal detection accuracy is debated. We developed a novel quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) MGMT assay capable of providing allelic methylation data and analyzed 151 glioblastomas from patients receiving standard of care treatment (Stupp protocol).

The samples were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), standard bisulfite pyrosequencing, and genotyped for the rs1690252 MGMT promoter single nucleotide polymorphism. Monoallelic methylation was observed more frequently than biallelic methylation, and some cases with monoallelic methylation expressed the MGMT protein, whereas others did not. The presence of MGMT methylation was associated with better overall survival (p = 0.006; qMSP and p = 0.002; standard pyrosequencing), and the presence of the protein was associated with worse overall survival (p = 0.009).

Combined analyses of qMSP and standard pyrosequencing or IHC identified additional patients who benefited from temozolomide treatment. Finally, low methylation levels were also associated with better overall survival (p = 0.061; qMSP and p = 0.02; standard pyrosequencing). These data support the use of both MGMT methylation and MGMT IHC, but not allelic methylation data, as prognostic markers in patients with temozolomide-treated glioblastoma.

### Apparent diffusion coefficient obtained by magnetic resonance imaging as a prognostic marker in glioblastomas: Correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status [^112Q11WA]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values can predict the status of methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and correlate with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).

This retrospective study included 47 patients with pathologically proven glioblastoma. All patients underwent MR DWI study before surgery (mean time: 1 week) to determine the status of MGMT promoter methylation. Minimum ADC values were analyzed. Parameters for OS and PFS were calculated, and statistical analyses such as Student's t-test, Kaplan-Meier curves, and linear and Cox regression were applied.

The results showed that 25 patients had positive methylation of the MGMT promoter. These patients exhibited higher minimum ADC values and survived longer than those without MGMT promoter methylation. A median ADCmin value of 0.80 emerged as a cutoff able to differentiate between methylated and unmethylated patients. Patients with minimum ADC values higher than 0.80 had longer survival times than those with values below 0.80. A linear correlation between minimum ADC values and both OS and PFS was observed.

In conclusion, minimum ADC values in glioblastoma multiforme could serve as a preoperative parameter to estimate MGMT promoter methylation status and patient survival.

### Promoter methylation cutoff with safety margin for selecting glioblastoma patients into trials omitting temozolomide: A pooled analysis of four clinical trials [^116CdeNE]. Clinical Cancer Research (2019). Low credibility.

The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is predictive for benefit from temozolomide in glioblastoma (GBM). A clinically optimized cutoff was sought, allowing patient selection for therapy without temozolomide, while avoiding its withholding from patients who may potentially benefit.

- **Experimental design**: Quantitative MGMT methylation-specific PCR data were obtained for newly diagnosed patients with GBM screened or treated with standard radiotherapy and temozolomide in four randomized trials. The pooled dataset was randomly split into a training and test dataset. The unsupervised cutoff was obtained at a 50% probability to be (un)methylated. ROC analysis identified an optimal cutoff supervised by overall survival (OS).

- **Results**: For 4,041 patients, valid MGMT results were obtained, whereof 1,725 were randomized. The unsupervised cutoff in the training dataset was 1.27 (log2 [1,000 × (MGMT +1)/ACTB]), separating unmethylated and methylated patients. The optimal supervised cutoff for unmethylated patients was -0.28 (AUC = 0.61), classifying "truly unmethylated" (≤ -0.28) and "gray zone" patients (> -0.28, ≤ 1.27), the latter comprising approximately 10% of cases. In contrast, for patients with MGMT methylation (> 1.27), more methylation was not related to a better outcome. Both methylated and gray zone patients performed significantly better for OS than truly unmethylated patients [HR = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27–0.45, P < 0.0001; HR = 0.58, 95% CI, 0.43–0.78, P < 0.001], validated in the test dataset.

### Assessment of quantitative and allelic MGMT methylation patterns as a prognostic marker in glioblastoma [^115KjDBL]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a predictive and prognostic marker in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide; however, how MGMT methylation should be assessed to ensure optimal detection accuracy is debated.

### MGMT methylation may benefit overall survival in patients with moderately vascularized glioblastomas [^114JkU3g]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Gliomas are the most common malignant primary central nervous system tumors, with an estimated annual incidence of 3.21 per 100,000 individuals in the United States. About half of all newly diagnosed gliomas are classified as glioblastoma, which is the most malignant type of brain cancer. Glioblastoma pathology is characterized by angiogenesis, highly infiltrative growth, and cellular heterogeneity. Despite an aggressive therapeutic approach combining maximum safe resection with radiotherapy (RT) plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ), the prognosis is poor, with a median overall survival (OS) duration of approximately 14 months. In 2016, the World Health Organization introduced molecular parameters along with histology to describe the interpatient glioblastoma heterogeneity associated with differential prognosis and responses to therapy.

Adequate clinical and molecular biomarkers are needed for accurate estimations of prognosis and optimal treatment selections. Inactivation through promoter methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene, which impairs the ability to repair DNA damage induced by alkylating agents such as TMZ, has been described as a relevant biomarker for clinical decision-making in glioblastoma treatment. In a post hoc analysis of a phase III trial, MGMT promoter methylation was associated with a 2-year survival increase in TMZ-treated glioblastoma patients from 14% to 46%. Additional studies have also described not only a predictive but also a prognostic role of MGMT methylation for glioblastoma patients.

### Prognostic value of TP53 expression and MGMT methylation in glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide combined with other chemotherapies [^114Vbw57]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

To assess the recurrence interval and predictive significance of TP53 expression and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation in glioblastomas, we examined patients treated with radiotherapy and combined chemotherapies, including temozolomide, lomustine, procarbazine, and bevacizumab.

- **Method**: We reviewed the clinical outcomes of 52 totally resected glioblastoma patients who received conventional radiotherapy and temozolomide with other chemotherapeutic agents. The correlation of TP53 expression and MGMT promoter methylation with recurrence interval was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.

- **Results**: No significant association was found between MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 expression in glioblastomas (P-value = 0.158). Patients with non-methylated MGMT who received temozolomide chemotherapy with other chemotherapeutic agents showed significantly later recurrence (P-value = 0.007) compared with patients with non-methylated MGMT who received temozolomide alone. No significant difference was found in recurrence interval among glioblastoma patients with methylated MGMT who received temozolomide alone or with other chemotherapies (P-value = 0.667). Moreover, patients with non-TP53-expressing tumors who received temozolomide with other chemotherapies had significantly later recurrence (P-value = 0.04) compared with patients who received temozolomide alone.

- **Conclusion**: Totally resected glioblastoma patients with non-methylated MGMT or non-TP53-expressing tumors treated with radiotherapy and combined chemotherapies had a reduced chance of tumor recurrence.

### A novel enhancer regulates MGMT expression and promotes temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma [^112bYxMu]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Despite therapy, the median survival for GBM patients is approximately 15 months. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been the standard chemotherapy for newly diagnosed GBM for more than a decade; however, almost all patients eventually develop resistance. Furthermore, recurrent tumors are more aggressive than primary tumors. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand how TMZ resistance is acquired and whether there is any connection between TMZ resistance and tumor aggressiveness.

While multiple factors have been associated with TMZ resistance, the expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) remains a major cause. MGMT is a DNA repair protein that removes the cytotoxic O6-methylguanine (O6MG) DNA lesions generated by TMZ, and high MGMT expression in cells is mechanistically linked to robust TMZ resistance. MGMT expression can be silenced by the methylation of a promoter/enhancer (P/E) region, which contains a promoter and a 59 bp cis-acting enhancer element that spans the first exon–intron boundary of the MGMT gene.

Several large cohort studies indicate an association between DNA methylation of the P/E region and favorable outcomes of TMZ treatment, which led to the hypothesis that MGMT inhibition may be a plausible strategy for sensitizing TMZ therapy in MGMT-expressed tumors. However, combinations of TMZ with MGMT inhibitors, such as O6-benzylguanine (O6BG), a synthetic derivative of guanine that can inhibit MGMT, were developed before the cloning of the MGMT gene.

### The role of extent of resection, chemoradiation, and MGMT promoter methylation in overall survival in a large cohort of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma [^115qCsDN]. Neurosurgical Focus (2025). High credibility.

Although MGMT promoter methylation, gross-total resection (GTR), and adjuvant chemoradiation therapy are known to independently improve clinical outcomes for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), their combined influence remains unclear. In this study, the authors investigated the complementary role of these factors in GBM prognosis.

The 2022 National Cancer Database was queried for individuals with histologically confirmed IDH-wildtype GBM WHO grade 4 and available MGMT promoter methylation status data. Demographic, clinical, and treatment-related variables were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were conducted, stratified by MGMT promoter methylation and chemoradiation therapy status.

A total of 27,858 patients were included in the analysis. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and MGMT promoter methylation status were independently associated with improved survival in the overall cohort (p < 0.001). In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, MGMT promoter methylation was associated with improved overall survival for individuals who received standard chemoradiation therapy (p < 0.001) but not for individuals who did not receive chemoradiation therapy (p = 0.649). In the overall cohort, GTR was associated with a 40% improvement in overall survival relative to excisional biopsy (HR 0.633 [95% CI 0.52–0.77], p < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. In patients with MGMT promoter-methylated tumors, GTR was associated with a 70% (HR 0.30 [95% CI 0.12–0.71], p = 0.007) improvement in overall survival compared with excision.

### Minimally cytotoxic doses of temozolomide produce radiosensitization in human glioblastoma cells regardless of MGMT expression [^111Vtdfw]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment with the methylating agent temozolomide during radiotherapy has yielded the first significant improvement in the survival of adult glioblastomas (GBMs) in the last three decades. However, improved survival is observed in a minority of patients, most frequently those whose tumors display CpG methylation of the O(6)-methylguanine (O(6)-meG)-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter, and adult GBMs remain invariably fatal. Some, although not all, preclinical studies have shown that temozolomide can increase radiosensitivity in GBM cells that lack MGMT, the sole activity in human cells that removes O(6)-meG from DNA.

Here, we systematically examined the temozolomide dose dependence of radiation killing in established GBM cell lines that differ in the ability to remove O(6)-meG or tolerate its lethality. Our results show that minimally cytotoxic doses of temozolomide can produce dose-dependent radiosensitization in MGMT-deficient cells, MGMT-proficient cells, and MGMT-deficient cells that lack mismatch repair, a process that renders cells tolerant of the lethality of O(6)-meG.

In cells that either possess or lack MGMT activity, radiosensitization requires exposure to temozolomide before, but not after, radiation and is accompanied by the formation of double-strand breaks within 45 minutes of radiation. Moreover, suppressing alkyladenine-DNA glycosylase, the only activity in human cells that excises 3-methyladenine from DNA, reduces the temozolomide dose dependence of radiosensitization, indicating that radiosensitization is mediated by 3-methyladenine as well as by O(6)-meG.

### O⁶-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation in 45 primary central nervous system lymphomas: Quantitative assessment of methylation and response to temozolomide treatment [^113uxWuc]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Favorable responses to temozolomide chemotherapy have recently been reported in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients who are refractory to high-dose methotrexate therapy. The gene encoding the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is transcriptionally silenced by promoter methylation in several human tumors, including gliomas and systemic lymphomas. MGMT promoter methylation is also a prognostic marker in glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide.

To validate temozolomide treatment in PCNSL, we applied methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis to quantitate MGMT methylation in PCNSL. MGMT promoter methylation was detected in tumors from 23 (51%) of 45 PCNSL patients, 11 of which were considered to have high (more than 70.0%) methylation status. Of the five relapsed PCNSLs treated with temozolomide, four cases responded, with three achieving complete response and one achieving a partial response. All four responsive PCNSLs had methylated MGMT promoters, whereas the non-responsive relapsed PCNSL did not.

Thus, the use of quantitative MS-HRM analysis for the detection of MGMT promoter methylation has been suggested in PCNSL for the first time. The assay allows rapid and high-throughput evaluation of the MGMT methylation status and seems to be promising in clinical settings. MGMT promoter methylation may become a useful marker for predicting the response of PCNSLs to temozolomide.

### MGMT-positive vs MGMT-negative patients with glioblastoma: Identification of prognostic factors and resection threshold [^1129fBvT]. Neurosurgery (2021). High credibility.

The importance of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status as a predictive factor for the response to chemotherapy with temozolomide is well established. However, its significance in stratifying glioblastoma (GBM) patients regarding their prognostic factors and the impact of the surgical approach on them has not been identified.

- **Objective**: To reveal possible differences in the prognostic factors and the impact of surgery between GBM patients stratified according to their MGMT status.

- **Methods**: The authors retrospectively analyzed 186 patients with a newly diagnosed primary supratentorial GBM treated with surgical resection followed by standard radiation and chemotherapy. A prospective quantitative volumetric analysis of tumor characteristics identified on magnetic resonance imaging was performed.

- **Results**: For the 109 patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter, extent of resection (EOR) represented an independent predictor of survival, whereas residual tumor volume (RTV), Karnofsky Performance Score, and age were found to be independent prognostic factors of survival for the 77 patients with a methylated MGMT promoter. For the group of patients with unmethylated and the group with methylated MGMT promoter, an EOR threshold of 70% and 98% and an RTV threshold of 1.5 and 1 cm³ were identified, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The selection of patients according to the MGMT promoter methylation status resulted in different prognostic factors and different resection thresholds for each patient population.

### O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase regulation by p53 in astrocytic cells [^115rBshA]. Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

Methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter, which results in gene silencing, occurs in 40% to 50% of patients with glioblastoma and predicts benefit from temozolomide chemotherapy. When unmethylated, MGMT repairs DNA damage induced by temozolomide, contributing to chemoresistance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that MGMT is regulated by p53 in astrocytic cells, which are precursors that may give rise to glioblastoma. p53 is of interest because it is often mutated in glioblastoma, and its inactivation sensitizes some astrocytoma cell lines to temozolomide.

MGMT expression was examined in neonatal murine astrocytes and SF767 human astrocytic glioma cells following p53 inactivation by knockout (murine only) or RNAi methods. MGMT mRNA and protein were detected in murine wild-type p53 astrocytes. However, in knockout murine astrocytes and wild-type cells in which p53 was inhibited by RNAi, MGMT expression was reduced by more than 90%. This effect of p53 on MGMT expression was unrelated to MGMT promoter methylation. In both wild-type and p53-null astrocytes, the MGMT promoter was unmethylated. In wild-type astrocytes, the p53 protein localized to a regulatory region of the MGMT promoter. In SF767 human astrocytic glioma cells, transient knockdown of p53 led to the down-regulation of MGMT gene expression.

In murine astrocytes and SF767 cells, p53 regulates MGMT expression without affecting promoter methylation. In astrocytes, this effect may be due to direct binding of p53 to the MGMT promoter. These results imply that the best use of temozolomide requires further exploration of p53's regulatory role.

### MGMT promoter methylation is prognostic but not predictive for outcome to adjuvant PCV chemotherapy in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors: A report from EORTC Brain Tumor Group Study 26951 [^112juggn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

- **Purpose**: O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation has been shown to predict the survival of patients with glioblastomas when temozolomide is added to radiotherapy (RT). It is unknown if MGMT promoter methylation is also predictive of outcomes to RT followed by adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors (AOT).

- **Patients and methods**: In the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer study 26951, 368 patients with AOT were randomly assigned to either RT alone or RT followed by adjuvant PCV. From 165 patients in this study, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was available for MGMT promoter methylation analysis. This was investigated using methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.

- **Results**: In 152 cases, an MGMT result was obtained; in 121 (80%) cases, MGMT promoter methylation was observed. Methylation strongly correlated with the combined loss of chromosome 1p and 19q (P = 0.00043). In multivariate analysis, MGMT promoter methylation, 1p/19q codeletion, tumor necrosis, and extent of resection were independent prognostic factors. The prognostic significance of MGMT promoter methylation was equally strong in the RT arm and the RT/PCV arm for both progression-free survival and overall survival. In tumors diagnosed at central pathology review as glioblastoma, no prognostic effect of MGMT promoter methylation was observed.

- **Conclusion**: In this study on patients with AOT, MGMT promoter methylation was of prognostic significance.

### dCas9/CRISPR-based methylation of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase enhances chemosensitivity to temozolomide in malignant glioma [^114w3BNb]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

For malignant glioma, specifically glioblastoma (GBM, IDH wild-type), a central aspect of clinical decision-making and prognosis is the de novo methylation status of the promoter of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), routinely assayed during neuropathologic diagnosis. MGMT repairs the toxic DNA lesion O6-methylguanine induced by alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, such as temozolomide (TMZ), thereby undermining the mechanism of action of TMZ and leading to chemoresistance. As the only FDA-approved drug with relative improvement in survival, TMZ comprises the standard of care chemotherapy in combination with fractionated radiation.

Approximately 40% of GBM patients harbor methylated MGMT, silencing expression in tumor cells, and enhancing chemosensitivity and survival (progression-free survival (PFS) = 10.3 months, overall survival (OS) = 21.7 months). By contrast, the preponderance of GBM patients (60%) harbor unmethylated MGMT and exhibit chemoresistance to TMZ, markedly reducing survival (PFS = 5.3 months, OS = 12.7 months).

### Prognostic value of TP53 expression and MGMT methylation in glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide combined with other chemotherapies [^115uFf4W]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

In our study, despite the MGMT promoter being methylated more frequently in tumors expressing TP53, no significant relationship was observed between MGMT and TP53. We also found that in glioblastomas where TP53 was not expressed, treatment with TMZ and additional chemotherapeutic agents was associated with a low rate of tumor recurrence within 1 year, which was significantly different from the rate in patients treated with TMZ alone. This shows that lack of TP53 expression may increase the sensitization of glioblastoma cells to additional chemotherapeutic agents and reduce the risk of TMZ resistance.

Finally, one limitation must be acknowledged in our study: the total number of cases analyzed for MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 expression is relatively low. Despite this limitation, and to our best knowledge, this is the first study in Saudi Arabia that correlates these molecular biomarkers with recurrence-free interval in totally resected glioblastomas, reflecting the impact of adjuvant therapies as well as the specific type of chemotherapies on patient outcome. The results are in keeping with other conclusions from similar international studies.

### Assessment of quantitative and allelic MGMT methylation patterns as a prognostic marker in glioblastoma [^111C2Txm]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Silencing by promoter methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is an early event in several human cancers due to its central role in DNA repair. MGMT removes alkyl adducts from the O6 position of guanine, thereby preventing G > A mutations in the genome. Under normal circumstances, this is an important cellular function. However, since alkylating agents such as temozolomide introduce alkyl adducts in the genome, MGMT methylation may be a predictive marker of response to alkylating agents in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The use of MGMT methylation status for routine clinical decision-making has been hampered by the fact that most GBM patients receive a combination of radiotherapy and temozolomide regardless of MGMT methylation status because no other good treatment options are available. However, MGMT methylation testing is useful for selecting patients for clinical trials. Recent studies also suggest that treatment decisions in older patients, for whom monotherapy with either radiotherapy or temozolomide is favored, should take MGMT methylation into account.

A functional role of MGMT methylation in GBM has been confirmed at the RNA and protein levels, but it is unclear how detection of MGMT methylation should be performed in clinical practice to ensure that as many patients as possible receive optimal treatment. We have previously shown that allelic methylation patterns as well as methylation levels influence MGMT protein expression in malignant pleural mesothelioma. If this were also observed in GBMs, allelic methylation patterns could play a significant role in treatment outcomes.

### Bisulfite profiling of the MGMT promoter and comparison with routine testing in glioblastoma diagnostics [^115JgrVr]. Clinical Epigenetics (2022). Low credibility.

Correlating patients' clinical data to local deep bisulfite sequencing results showed that none of the CpGs in MGMT e1 and MGMT i1 was predictive of the duration of a progression-free survival in our sample cohort of primary glioblastoma without IDH mutations and treatment with radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with temozolomide. This is in contrast to previous meta-analyses and other recent studies; however, studies with a non-significant effect on survival data also exist. This may largely depend on how progression-free survival is defined and detected. Routinely performed neuroimaging without neurological symptoms at set intervals may prepone the noted date of tumor remission compared to the onset of clinical aggravation. The actual location of the tumor in the brain, however, is crucial for the beginning of neurological symptoms. Massive tumor growth in an inconspicuous location may be overlooked for some time and artificially prolong the noted progression-free interval. In the present cohort, we had hardly any data on the overall survival of the patients. Also, the size of the cohort, immune cell composition, hotspot mutations, or genomic aberrations within the group of glioblastoma multiforme may influence the outcome of survival analyses, possibly making them inconclusive.

We also found CpG + 18 methylation not to be meaningful towards prognosis in three different independent glioblastoma cohorts, suggesting that combinatorial analysis as shown by Bady and colleagues might improve survival analysis and biomarker detection significantly.

### Prognostic value of TP53 expression and MGMT methylation in glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide combined with other chemotherapies [^114KEp8r]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

To assess the recurrence interval and predictive significance of TP53 expression and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation in glioblastomas, patients were treated with radiotherapy and combined chemotherapies, including temozolomide, lomustine, procarbazine, and bevacizumab.

We reviewed the clinical outcomes of 52 totally resected glioblastoma patients who received conventional radiotherapy and temozolomide with other chemotherapeutic agents. Correlation of TP53 expression and MGMT promoter methylation with recurrence interval was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.

No significant association was found between MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 expression in glioblastomas (P-value = 0.158). Patients with non-methylated MGMT who received temozolomide chemotherapy with other chemotherapeutic agents showed significantly later recurrence (P-value = 0.007) compared with patients with non-methylated MGMT who received temozolomide alone. No significant difference was found in recurrence interval among glioblastoma patients with methylated MGMT who received temozolomide alone or with other chemotherapies (P-value = 0.667). Moreover, patients with non-TP53-expressing tumors who received temozolomide with other chemotherapies had significantly later recurrence (P-value = 0.04) compared with patients who received temozolomide alone.

In conclusion, totally resected glioblastoma patients with non-methylated MGMT or non-TP53-expressing tumors treated with radiotherapy and combined chemotherapies had a reduced chance of tumor recurrence.

### Advances in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma [^112hebGf]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Given the antagonistic mechanisms of MGMT-mediated DNA repair and temozolomide, it was hypothesized that higher doses of temozolomide may overcome the DNA repair capacity of MGMT. This hypothesis led to the design of RTOG 0525, a randomized phase III trial comparing dose-intense temozolomide (75–100 milligrams per meter squared taken on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle) versus standard dose temozolomide (150–200 milligrams per meter squared on days 1 to 5 of a 28-day cycle). This trial included prospective tissue collection and stratification of both groups by clinical prognostic factors and MGMT promoter methylation. No benefit of dose-intense temozolomide was seen overall, or in the subgroups of MGMT hypermethylated or unmethylated patients. RTOG 0525 confirmed the prognostic significance of MGMT promoter methylation.

While an improved prognosis for newly diagnosed patients with MGMT promoter methylation treated with the EORTC-NCIC regimen is established, there is not an alternative regimen for newly diagnosed GB patients with unmethylated MGMT promoters otherwise eligible to receive the EORTC-NCIC regimen. Outside of a clinical trial, it is the authors' opinion that all patients with a KPS of 70 or greater and an age of 65 years or less should receive the EORTC-NCIC regimen regardless of MGMT promoter methylation status.

### Combination chemotherapy versus temozolomide for patients with methylated MGMT (m-MGMT) glioblastoma: Results of computational biological modeling to predict the magnitude of treatment benefit [^113dUiQ9]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

In the landmark trial by Stupp and colleagues on glioblastoma (GBM), adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy decreased the death rate compared to radiation therapy alone by 37% and, in 2005, became the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients. By alkylating guanine residues, TMZ induces futile DNA mismatch repair that introduces single-stranded breaks resulting in replication fork arrest and cell death. The dominant but by no means only mechanism of TMZ resistance is caused by the DNA repair enzyme O⁶-methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase (MGMT), which removes alkylated guanine bases to counter the lethal effects of the drug. The MGMT gene is subject to epigenetic regulation via methylation, which silences its transcription. Hence, cancers with MGMT methylation (m-MGMT) tend to be highly responsive to TMZ, with an increase in median survival of approximately six and one-half months compared to less than one month for unmethylated-MGMT (u-MGMT) cancers.

For patients with m-MGMT, efforts to build on the benefits of TMZ have explored combination chemotherapy regimens with the addition of lomustine to the TMZ backbone. A single-arm, phase II trial (UKT-03) evaluated TMZ plus lomustine in newly diagnosed GBM patients and revealed a median survival of 23 months, considerably better than the historical experience of 14.6 months. Larger benefits accrued in the m-MGMT patients, with a 2-year survival of 75% compared to 20% for u-MGMT patients, and median survival of not reached and 12.6 months, respectively. This led to the Nordic phase III trial (NOA-9) in newly diagnosed patients.

### Molecular dosimetry of temozolomide: Quantification of critical lesions, correlation to cell death responses, and threshold doses [^114jerKe]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: TMZ, a front-line drug in the treatment of high-grade malignant glioma, is effective if the tumor lacks MGMT or expresses the repair protein at a low level (< 30 fmol/mg protein). These tumors are defined as "methylated" because MGMT promoter CpG methylation correlates with silencing of the gene and, as a consequence, lack of or low MGMT protein expression and enzyme activity. Although the curative effect is significant, the response is not dramatic, and the prognosis of GBM is still bleak with a median survival of only 14.6 months (12.6 and 23.4 months in the MGMT-unmethylated and MGMT-methylated subgroups, respectively; ref.). Although recent phase III clinical trials revealed that the median overall survival for adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM can reach up to 20 months, indicating a trending increase in survival, the prognosis is still poor with 5-year overall survival rates of less than 10%.

Given the mechanism of action of TMZ and the low curative response, some questions arise which are controversially discussed in the literature and thus need to be addressed experimentally. (i) Do GBM cells really die (by apoptosis or other forms of cell death) following TMZ treatment, or does the drug just exert a cytostatic effect? (ii) Are the doses used for patients' treatment high enough to kill cancer cells in their body? This question implies that low doses are ineffective and that threshold doses do exist below which cytotoxicity does not occur. (iii) How many O⁶ MeG adducts are required for eliciting specific effects such as apoptosis, necrosis, and senescence?

### Epigenetic preconditioning with decitabine sensitizes glioblastoma to temozolomide via induction of MLH1 [^116EYyTy]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

DAC preconditioning enhances TMZ cytotoxicity in a subset of GBM cell lines independent of MGMT promoter methylation status. This effect appears to be driven by increased expression of MLH1, leading to potentiation of MMR activity and increased DSB formation. We identified an unmethylated region of the MLH1 promoter, common to sensitized cell lines in their treatment-naive state, which merits further investigation as a clinical biomarker for DAC patient selection. Additional studies will be needed to confirm whether DAC increases functional MLH1 levels through E2F1 transcription factor upregulation.

### The role of gene body cytosine modifications in MGMT expression and sensitivity to temozolomide [^114LxgEQ]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

The DNA repair protein O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is known to play a role in sensitivity to temozolomide. Promoter hypermethylation of MGMT is commonly used to predict low expression levels of MGMT in gliomas, despite observed discordance between promoter methylation and protein levels. Here, we investigated the functional role of gene body cytosine modification in regulating levels of MGMT gene expression and sensitivity to temozolomide. In 91 human glioblastoma samples, we observed significant variation in MGMT expression levels in patients with an unmethylated promoter, with higher levels of gene body cytosine modification correlating with higher gene expression levels.

Furthermore, inducing hypomethylation across the MGMT gene body with decitabine corresponded with decreased levels of MGMT gene expression in lymphoblastoid and glioblastoma cell lines, indicating an important functional role for gene body cytosine modifications in maintaining gene expression. We reasoned that the decrease in MGMT expression induced by decitabine may render resistant glioblastoma cell lines more sensitive to temozolomide. Consistent with this reasoning, we found that the MGMT-expressing glioblastoma cell lines exhibiting an unmethylated MGMT promoter that were pretreated with decitabine became significantly more sensitive to temozolomide. Overall, our results suggest a functional role for gene body cytosine modification in regulating gene expression of MGMT and indicate that pretreating patients whose tumors have an unmethylated MGMT promoter with decitabine before temozolomide treatment may enhance therapeutic efficacy.

### Prognostic significance of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase determined by promoter hypermethylation and immunohistochemical expression in anaplastic gliomas [^116Nn2Px]. Clinical Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

Anaplastic gliomas constitute a heterogeneous group of tumors with different therapeutic responses to adjuvant chemotherapy with alkylating agents. O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a DNA repair protein, is one of the implicated factors in glioma chemoresistance. The prognostic value of MGMT remains controversial due, in part, to the fact that previously published studies included heterogeneous groups of patients with different tumor grades. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of MGMT in patients with anaplastic glioma.

Ninety-three patients with anaplastic glioma were analyzed for MGMT protein expression by immunohistochemistry. For those patients from whom a good yield of DNA was obtained (n = 40), MGMT promoter methylation profile was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR. MGMT prognostic significance was evaluated together with other well-known prognostic factors.

Fifty-one tumors (54.8%) showed nuclear staining of MGMT. There was a trend towards longer overall survival for those patients with negative MGMT immunostaining (hazard ratio, 1.66; P = 0.066). In a secondary analysis including those patients who actually received chemotherapy (n = 72), the absence of MGMT expression was independently associated with better survival (hazard ratio, 2.12; P = 0.027). MGMT promoter methylation was observed in 50% of the analyzed tumors, and no statistical correlation between MGMT expression and MGMT promoter hypermethylation was observed.

Unlike previous studies, we did not find.

### Mgmt promoter methylation in plasma of glioma patients receiving temozolomide [^114n7ya7]. Journal of neuro-oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Promoter methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene plays a role in the cellular response to alkylating agents. This study aimed to:

- **Evaluate the concordance**: Assess the agreement between MGMT promoter methylation status in tumor tissue and plasma.
- **Monitor methylation status**: Track MGMT promoter methylation in plasma samples collected before and during temozolomide treatment.
- **Explore biomarker value**: Investigate the prognostic and predictive value of MGMT promoter methylation status in plasma for glioma patients.

We enrolled 58 patients with histologically confirmed glioma at different grades of malignancy. All patients underwent surgical resection and temozolomide treatment. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was available for 48 patients. Blood samples were collected from all patients before temozolomide treatment (baseline) and at each MRI examination for a 12-month period. MGMT promoter methylation status was assessed in both sample types by real-time PCR using a specific probe. The frequency of MGMT promoter methylation was 60.4% in tumor tissue and 41.38% in plasma. The methylation status was concordant in the two sample types (Kappa = 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57–0.93; p-value < 0.001). Overall and progression-free survival were longer in patients with a methylated MGMT promoter. Mortality was higher in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter, both in tumor tissue [hazard ratio (HR) 2.21; 95% CI 0.99–4.95] and plasma (HR 2.19; 95% CI 1.02–4.68). Progression-free survival was shorter in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter, whether in tissue (HR 2.30; 95% CI 1.19–4.56).

### Prognostic value of TP53 expression and MGMT methylation in glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide combined with other chemotherapies [^115dcdDc]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Our results show that temozolomide combined with other chemotherapeutic agents, regardless of the type and number of added drugs, produces a significantly better outcome (reduced recurrence interval) in glioblastoma without TP53 expression or non-methylated MGMT promoter. This is because these glioblastomas have increased sensitivity to chemotherapies. Furthermore, TP53 mutation or expression and MGMT methylation are significant independent prognostic factors. Further studies should be performed to understand the mechanisms of glioma cell sensitivity to different chemotherapeutic agents.

### Inactivation of the DNA-repair gene MGMT and the clinical response of gliomas to alkylating agents [^116DSo5u]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2000). High credibility.

The DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) inhibits the killing of tumor cells by alkylating agents. MGMT activity is controlled by a promoter; methylation of the promoter silences the gene in cancer, and the cells no longer produce MGMT. We examined gliomas to determine whether methylation of the MGMT promoter is related to the responsiveness of the tumor to alkylating agents.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the MGMT promoter in tumor DNA by a methylation-specific polymerase-chain-reaction assay. The gliomas were obtained from patients who had been treated with carmustine (1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, or BCNU). The molecular data were correlated with the clinical outcome.

- **Results**: The MGMT promoter was methylated in gliomas from 19 of 47 patients (40 percent). This finding was associated with regression of the tumor and prolonged overall and disease-free survival. It was an independent and stronger prognostic factor than age, stage, tumor grade, or performance status.

- **Conclusions**: Methylation of the MGMT promoter in gliomas is a useful predictor of the responsiveness of the tumors to alkylating agents.

### MGMT gene promoter methylation by pyrosequencing method correlates volumetric response and neurological status in IDH wild-type glioblastomas [^115Z7r9W]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults. The standard treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is maximal safe resection and postoperative local radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide, followed by adjuvant temozolomide. However, the median survival and 2-year survival rates with the above standard treatment are reported to be 14.6 months and 26.5%, respectively.

Prognostic factors for glioblastoma include age, neurological status, preoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS), extent of resection, and O⁶-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. Many studies have reported MGMT promoter methylation as a prognostic factor for glioblastoma. The MGMT gene encodes a DNA repair enzyme that removes alkyl adducts from the O⁶ position of guanine in tumor DNA, which is damaged by alkylating agents such as temozolomide, exerting antitumor effects by impairing DNA replication. Therefore, MGMT expressed in tumor cells removes the guanine-alkyl group and attenuates the antitumor effect, while patients with MGMT promoter methylation have a better response to temozolomide and a better prognosis because of the suppression of MGMT in tumor cells. Furthermore, it has been reported that MGMT promoter methylation status is associated with prolonged survival in patients treated with radiotherapy alone. Thus, MGMT promoter methylation status is both a prognostic and predictive marker for temozolomide in glioblastomas, and evaluation of MGMT promoter methylation is considered important for predicting treatment efficacy and prognosis.

### Aberrant MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) promoter methylation in choroid plexus tumors [^111UfKCX]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Aberrant methylation of the MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) DNA-repair gene is a predictive marker for the response to chemotherapy with alkylating agents (e.g. temozolomide) in malignant gliomas. Since temozolomide is considered for the treatment of choroid plexus tumors, MGMT promoter methylation status was retrospectively assessed in 36 choroid plexus tumors using methylation-specific PCR, combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA), and clone sequencing. By methylation-specific PCR, all samples demonstrated a signal for MGMT methylation. COBRA confirmed > 10% methylation of CpGs 17 and 31 in 58% of tumors. Clone sequencing of six cases methylated by COBRA confirmed aberrant methylation, including a previously recognized enhancer element. In conclusion, MGMT promoter methylation is frequent in choroid plexus tumors and can be quantified using COBRA. Determination of MGMT promoter methylation status might be useful for the stratification of patients for alkylator-based treatments in future clinical trials.

### Assessment of MGMT methylation status using high-performance liquid chromatography in newly diagnosed glioblastoma [^114XapFK]. Clinical Epigenetics (2020). Low credibility.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common brain tumor in adults; it has an aggressive lethal nature, with a median survival of only 12–15 months, despite the standard established therapy of maximum resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy. GBM chemotherapy is based on drugs that alkylate the DNA in the O6-position of guanine, such as temozolomide (TMZ). O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a protein that repairs the naturally occurring mutagenic DNA lesion O6-methylguanine back to guanine and prevents mismatch and errors during DNA replication and transcription. Since epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene via promoter methylation is associated with loss of MGMT expression, analysis of MGMT methylation status has become a key prognostic marker of TMZ.

In GBM patients, the relevance of MGMT promoter methylation as a predictive marker for TMZ effectiveness has been strengthened by a randomized trial. Furthermore, it has been reported that MGMT methylation is significantly correlated with the prognosis of glioma patients treated with TMZ, with or without adjustment of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1/2 status. Based on these results, MGMT methylation analysis has been intensely investigated in several clinical trials.

Despite considerable research, consensus regarding the optimal method for MGMT gene promoter methylation assessment and the optimal promoter region for MGMT methylation analysis is lacking. The CpG island of MGMT exhibits heterogeneous methylation patterns, and it is therefore possible to fail to detect methylation when only analyzi.

### MGMT promoter methylation correlates with survival benefit and sensitivity to temozolomide in pediatric glioblastoma [^112GtpdC]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Methylation of the DNA-repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) causes gene silencing. This epigenetic modification has been associated with a favorable prognosis in adult patients with glioblastoma (GBM) who receive temozolomide and other alkylating agents. We explored MGMT promoter methylation in pediatric GBM and its relationship to survival and temozolomide sensitivity.

- **Procedure**: We performed a retrospective study of MGMT promoter methylation in 10 pediatric GBM. The methylation status of the MGMT was determined using a two-stage methylation-specific PCR analysis on DNA extracted from tumor specimens which had been snap-frozen at surgery. The relationships between MGMT promoter methylation and patient outcome, and response to temozolomide, were evaluated.

- **Results**: Four of our 10 pediatric patients with GBM were found to have methylation of the MGMT gene promoter. Methylation of the MGMT promoter was shown to correlate (P = 0.0005) with survival. The average survival time for patients with methylated MGMT was 13.7 months compared to 2.5 months for the six patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter. Of the seven patients that received temozolomide, those with the methylated MGMT gene promoter responded better to treatment (P = 0.007).

- **Conclusions**: As in adults, pediatric GBM patients with methylated MGMT promoter benefited from temozolomide. However, a stronger correlation with overall survival, regardless of treatment, was observed in this group of patients. These data suggest that MGMT methylation may be a prognostic factor.

### Correlation between promoter hypermethylation of the O6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase gene and prognosis in patients with high-grade astrocytic tumors treated with surgery, radiotherapy, and 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea-based chemotherapy [^117AdtQa]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

O(6)-Methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein associated with the chemoresistance of chloroethylnitrosoureas. We investigated whether MGMT promoter hypermethylation is associated with prognosis in patients with high-grade astrocytic tumors treated uniformly with surgery, radiotherapy, and 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea (ACNU)-based chemotherapy.

- **Methods**: Using the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, we assayed promoter hypermethylation of the MGMT gene in tumor DNA from 116 adult patients with supratentorial high-grade astrocytic tumors (42 anaplastic astrocytomas [AAs] and 74 glioblastomas multiforme [GBMs]). The Cox proportional hazards model was used in forward stepwise regression to assess the relative role of prognostic factors such as age at surgery, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, extent of surgical resection, methylation status of the MGMT promoter, and the association between MGMT promoter methylation and survival.

- **Results**: MGMT promoter hypermethylation was confirmed in 19 (45.2%) of 42 AA patients and 33 (44.6%) of 74 GBM patients. It was significantly associated with both longer overall and progression-free survival time in AA but not in GBM patients.

- **Conclusion**: Our results demonstrate that MGMT promoter hypermethylation is associated with longer survival time in patients with AA who were treated with surgery, radiotherapy, and ACNU-based chemotherapy but not in patients with GBM.

### MGMT gene promoter methylation by pyrosequencing method correlates volumetric response and neurological status in IDH wild-type glioblastomas [^112V6xod]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Although the usefulness of O⁶-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation analysis for predicting response to chemoradiotherapy and the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma has been widely reported, there is still no consensus regarding how to define MGMT promoter methylation percentage (MGMTpm%) cutoffs by the pyrosequencing method. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal cutoff value of MGMT promoter methylation status using volumetric analysis focused on the tumor volume ratio (TVR) measured by MRI.

This retrospective study included newly diagnosed IDH wild-type glioblastoma patients with residual tumors after surgery, followed by local radiotherapy with temozolomide. TVR was defined as the tumor volume at six months after the initial chemoradiotherapy administration divided by the tumor volume before the start of therapy. The mean MGMTpm% of 16 CpG islands (74–89) was analyzed using pyrosequencing. We statistically analyzed the correlation between MGMTpm%, TVR, and the change in Karnofsky performance status.

The study included 44 patients with residual tumors. Thirteen (92.9%) of 14 patients with MGMTpm% ≥ 23.9% showed a 50% or more volumetric response, leading to prolonged survival, and 17 (70.8%) of 24 patients with MGMTpm% < 8.2% had progressive disease after initial chemoradiotherapy administration. Three (50.0%) of six patients with MGMTpm% 8.2% to < 23.9% had stable disease or partial response.

Evaluation of MGMTpm% by pyrosequencing is important in predicting the volumetric response and prognosis of glioblastoma.

### Mgmt methylation: A marker of response to temozolomide in low-grade gliomas [^11166PRB]. Annals of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase promoter (MGMTP) was evaluated in 68 low-grade gliomas treated with neoadjuvant temozolomide. Methylated MGMTP was detected in 63 of 68 patients (92.6%) and was a favorable predictor of progression-free survival compared to unmethylated MGMTP tumors (p < 0.0001). Assessment of MGMTP status could help identify low-grade glioma patients more likely to respond to chemotherapy or to benefit from MGMT depletion strategies.

### MGMT gene promoter methylation by pyrosequencing method correlates volumetric response and neurological status in IDH wild-type glioblastomas [^117M1aFR]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the volumetric tumor response and MGMTpm% using the pyrosequencing method. Our data showed that 92.9% of patients with MGMTpm% ≥ 23.9% experienced a decrease in tumor volume by more than 50% (CR/PR) at 6 months after the start of chemoradiotherapy. Furthermore, 42.9% of those patients with high MGMTpm% improved their Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), leading to a good prognosis. Conversely, 70.8% of patients with MGMTpm% < 8.2% exhibited progressive disease (PD), and 62.5% of those patients with low MGMTpm% had a decline in KPS. These predictions are integral in explaining the prognosis to the patient.

We also analyzed the relationship between pre-treatment relative tumor volume (RTV), MGMTpm%, and the tumor volume reduction (TVR). No significant relationship was found between pre-treatment RTV and TVR, indicating that a higher MGMTpm% could lead to a greater tumor volume decrease, regardless of whether the pre-treatment RTV was small or large.

Although the usefulness of MGMT promoter methylation analysis in glioblastoma patients for predicting the prognosis and response to chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide has been widely reported, there is still no consensus on how to measure MGMTpm% and define MGMTpm% cutoff values. Since glioblastoma patients without MGMT promoter methylation are resistant to temozolomide and have a worse prognosis, the treatment strategy depends on MGMT promoter methylation status. Wick et al. reported that event-free survival was longer in patients with MGMT promoter methylation who received temozolomide alone compared to those who underwent radiotherapy alone in older patients. A phase 3 CheckMate-498 study comparing radiotherapy with temozolomide and radiotherapy in radioth…
