## Question

Indication and validation to start tamiflu if more than 48 hours?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when it is appropriate to start Tamiflu (oseltamivir) after more than 48 hours of influenza symptom onset, and how to justify that decision with evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and what is considered on-label versus off-label. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for treatment beyond 48 hours in severe or high-risk patients. Next, I will review guideline recommendations from IDSA, CDC, and WHO. After that, I should examine randomized and observational data that inform late initiation. Finally, I will synthesize practical decision criteria, dosing considerations, and a bottom-line recommendation with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. The FDA label restricts treatment indications to acute, uncomplicated influenza in patients symptomatic for no more than 48 hours, which means starting after 48 hours is off-label for uncomplicated outpatients, even though clinicians may still proceed in selected scenarios based on professional judgment and guidelines [^114eSLAd] [^113dAeLG] [^115u1S2x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — off-label does not mean inappropriate. I need to check whether major guidelines endorse treatment beyond 48 hours in specific contexts. IDSA recommends initiating antivirals as soon as possible for hospitalized patients regardless of illness duration, for outpatients with severe, complicated, or progressive disease, and for those at high risk for complications, noting that benefit can extend up to 4–5 days and sometimes longer in severe disease, so treatment after 48 hours is reasonable in these groups [^117XnXm4] [^117DnkUL]. CDC guidance similarly advises treatment as soon as possible for hospitalized patients and high-risk outpatients, stating that antivirals can still be beneficial after 48 hours in severe or progressive illness, and WHO advises considering oseltamivir in patients with suspected or confirmed severe influenza irrespective of timing, which supports late initiation in the right clinical context [^1138R71n] [^113pUKh7].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for late initiation. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit when therapy starts after 48 hours. Observational meta-analyses in hospitalized patients show substantial mortality reduction with early neuraminidase inhibitor therapy and smaller but meaningful benefit even when started after 48 hours, with pooled estimates around 28–35% mortality reduction versus no treatment in critically ill adults, acknowledging confounding and the absence of randomized data in this exact population [^115hgxJb] [^112JNdhL]. A large 2025 target-trial emulation of 11,073 hospitalized adults found that oseltamivir within 2 days of admission was associated with lower mortality versus supportive care, reinforcing guideline direction despite observational design [^117VKW7p] [^113wc5da]. For outpatients, a randomized trial in Bangladesh showed modest symptom reduction and reduced viral shedding even when treatment started ≥ 48 hours, suggesting virologic and clinical benefit in some settings, though symptom benefit attenuates with delay [^115Cp6z7].

> I will now examine who specifically benefits after 48 hours. Let me consider the patient groups where the risk-benefit is most favorable: hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, patients with severe or progressive disease (hypoxemia, pneumonia, rapid deterioration), and those at high risk for complications such as older adults, pregnant patients, the immunocompromised, and individuals with chronic cardiopulmonary, renal, hepatic, metabolic, or neurologic disease; these are the groups for whom guidelines consistently recommend not delaying therapy even if beyond 48 hours [^117XnXm4] [^117DnkUL] [^1138R71n]. But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised — does viral replication persist longer? Yes, IDSA notes prolonged shedding and supports extended treatment courses in immunocompromised hosts when clinically indicated, which strengthens the rationale for late initiation in that subgroup [^114tLpsz].

> Let me think about dosing and duration, because I need to ensure we apply the regimen correctly. Standard adult treatment dosing is 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days; however, in severe or complicated disease, and particularly in immunocompromised patients, extending therapy to 7–10 days or longer can be reasonable if illness is severe and viral RNA remains detectable, aligning with IDSA guidance and pharmacologic plausibility for ongoing replication [^1177DJoR] [^114tLpsz]. I should double-check renal dosing adjustments — dose reduction is recommended for creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min, and in intermittent hemodialysis a modified schedule is advised, so I must incorporate kidney function into the plan [^113UXSuQ] [^114Fs41P].

> I need to ensure safety and drug interaction issues are addressed. Common adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, which can be mitigated by taking with food; rare neuropsychiatric events and severe hypersensitivity or cutaneous reactions have been reported, so I should counsel and monitor accordingly, and I should avoid live attenuated influenza vaccine within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after oseltamivir to prevent interference with vaccine replication [^115h9Jv5] [^116nUttK] [^1173HnX3].

> But wait, what if the patient is a low-risk outpatient presenting on day 4 with mild symptoms — should I still treat? I should confirm that routine treatment of otherwise healthy, non–high-risk outpatients after 48 hours is not routinely recommended, as the clinical benefit wanes and the FDA label does not support this use; in such cases, supportive care remains appropriate unless there are special circumstances or evolving severity [^114eSLAd] [^117XnXm4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied no benefit at all after 48 hours in outpatients — that overstates the data; the Bangladesh RCT did show reduced viral shedding and a modest symptom reduction even with late initiation, so I should frame this as limited and context-dependent benefit rather than no benefit, while still prioritizing high-risk and hospitalized patients for therapy after 48 hours [^115Cp6z7].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize this at the bedside. If the patient is hospitalized or high risk, I should start oseltamivir empirically without waiting for test results, because delays worsen outcomes; if the patient is a low-risk outpatient beyond 48 hours, I should individualize based on trajectory, comorbidities, and likelihood of influenza, recognizing diminishing returns and the potential to observe if stable, while maintaining a low threshold to treat if deterioration occurs [^117XnXm4] [^1138R71n]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not conflating prophylaxis timing with treatment timing; prophylaxis should be started within 48 hours of exposure, whereas treatment decisions after symptom onset are governed by severity and risk, not a strict 48-hour cutoff for all patients [^115RNZvK] [^117XnXm4].

> Bottom line, I should synthesize a clear recommendation. Starting Tamiflu after 48 hours is off-label for uncomplicated outpatients, but it is guideline-supported and evidence-informed for hospitalized patients, those with severe or progressive disease, and high-risk outpatients, where benefits on complications and possibly mortality outweigh modest risks; in these scenarios, treat as soon as possible, consider extending therapy in severe or immunocompromised cases, and do not delay for confirmatory testing, while for low-risk patients beyond 48 hours with mild illness, supportive care is generally preferred unless clinical judgment suggests otherwise [^117XnXm4] [^117DnkUL] [^1138R71n] [^114tLpsz].

Tamiflu (oseltamivir) may be started after 48 hours in **high-risk or hospitalized patients** with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza, or in those with prolonged viral shedding (e.g. immunocompromised) [^117DnkUL] [^114tLpsz]. Benefit is greatest when started within 48 hours, but **some benefit persists up to 4–5 days** after onset, especially for reducing complications and mortality in severe cases [^117XnXm4] [^112JNdhL]. For low-risk outpatients, routine use after 48 hours is not recommended unless illness is severe or progressive [^115kqX51]. Use clinical judgment, and do not delay therapy while awaiting test results in high-risk or hospitalized patients [^1138R71n].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

### IDSA guidelines (2018)

- **High-risk or hospitalized patients**: Initiate antiviral treatment as soon as possible, regardless of illness duration, for patients with documented or suspected influenza who are hospitalized, have severe/complicated/progressive illness, or are at high risk for complications [^117DnkUL].

- **Benefit beyond 48 hours**: Clinical benefit has been reported even when treatment is initiated > 48 hours after symptom onset, particularly in severe cases or those with prolonged viral shedding [^117XnXm4].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Prolonged viral replication and prolonged shedding are common; treatment may be extended to 10 days or longer if disease is severe and influenza viral RNA remains detectable [^114tLpsz].

---

### CDC recommendations

- **High-risk patients**: Antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who are hospitalized, have severe/complicated/progressive illness, or are at high risk for complications, even if > 48 hours have elapsed since symptom onset [^1138R71n].

- **Clinical benefit beyond 48 hours**: Antiviral treatment initiated after 48 hours may still be beneficial for some patients, particularly those with severe or complicated illness [^112kMUKB].

---

### WHO guidelines (2024)

WHO guidance recommends **considering oseltamivir** in patients with suspected or confirmed severe influenza virus infection, irrespective of the time since symptom onset [^notfound].

---

## Evidence supporting Tamiflu use beyond 48 hours

### Clinical trials and observational studies

- **Hospitalized patients**: Observational studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that oseltamivir treatment initiated after 48 hours can reduce mortality, shorten hospital stay, and decrease the risk of complications in hospitalized patients with severe influenza [^117XnXm4] [^115hgxJb].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Prolonged viral shedding and high risk of complications justify treatment beyond 48 hours, with some cases requiring extended treatment durations (up to 10 days or more) [^114tLpsz].

- **Pediatric patients**: Clinical trials have shown modest benefits of oseltamivir treatment initiated after 48 hours in pediatric patients, including reduced symptom duration and complications [^115Cp6z7].

---

### Meta-analyses and systematic reviews

A 2015 Lancet meta-analysis reported that oseltamivir reduced lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics and hospital admissions, even when treatment was initiated after 48 hours in some cases [^116AnA7U]. A 2024 JAMA Internal Medicine meta-analysis found no significant reduction in first hospitalization with oseltamivir in outpatients, but acknowledged that **benefit may still exist in high-risk or hospitalized patients** [^113Wu3wA].

---

## Clinical scenarios where Tamiflu may be considered after 48 hours

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for treatment beyond 48 hours** |
|-|-|
| Hospitalized patients with severe influenza | - Reduced mortality <br/> - Shorter hospital stay <br/> - Fewer complications [^115hgxJb] |
| Immunocompromised patients | - Prolonged viral shedding <br/> - Higher risk of complications [^114tLpsz] |
| Patients with progressive or complicated influenza | Potential reduction in complications and clinical deterioration [^117XS9VQ] |
| Pediatric patients with severe influenza | Modest reduction in symptom duration and complications [^116htSCm] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Diminished efficacy**: Clinical benefit diminishes with delayed initiation, particularly in uncomplicated cases [^116htSCm].

- **Adverse effects**: Nausea, vomiting, and neuropsychiatric events may occur, necessitating careful patient selection and monitoring [^115h9Jv5] [^116nUttK].

- **Resistance**: Influenza viruses may develop resistance to oseltamivir, although resistance remains relatively uncommon [^113ViYbT].

---

## Clinical judgment and patient-specific factors

Clinical judgment should guide use after 48 hours, with attention to **illness severity**, **patient risk**, and the likelihood of ongoing viral replication. High-risk patients — older adults, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and those with chronic medical conditions — may benefit from treatment beyond 48 hours [^1142oiVA]. Patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness may also benefit from antiviral therapy even if initiated after 48 hours [^1138R71n].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Tamiflu may be started after 48 hours in **high-risk or hospitalized patients** with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza, or in those with prolonged viral shedding. Benefit is greatest within 48 hours, but some benefit persists up to 4–5 days after onset, especially for reducing complications and mortality in severe cases. Routine use in low-risk outpatients after 48 hours is not recommended unless illness is severe or progressive. Use clinical judgment, and do not delay therapy while awaiting test results in high-risk or hospitalized patients [^117XS9VQ].

Seasonal influenza (IDSA 2018) — immunocompromised patients: Influenza viral replication, including asymptomatic shedding, can be prolonged and resistant variants during or after antiviral treatment can occur more frequently than in immunocompetent patients. Retrospectively collected data suggest treatment can safely extend to 10 days or longer, and rebound viral replication has been observed in some patients treated for 5 days; longer duration is advisable if disease is severe and influenza viral RNA remains detectable. There are no data to support the use of higher doses of oseltamivir in this population. Early initiation of antiviral therapy is associated with the best outcomes, although clinical benefit has been reported when starting treatment > 48 hours after symptom onset.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^114xQ4j7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir Policies for Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza

The evidence from randomized controlled trials is clear that oseltamivir treatment decreases the duration of symptoms by up to 1 day in adolescent and adult patients with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza whose infections are able to be managed in the community. Oseltamivir provides no benefit to patients who have influenza-like illness not caused by influenza virus. Reviews of observational data regarding patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza A(H5N1) infections found that risk for death is cut in half if treatment is initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset. Small prepandemic observational studies, although they generally have controlled less for potential biases, also support the conclusion that risk for death is decreased with oseltamivir treatment.

These 2 lines of evidence may appear inconsistent. How would an intervention that has a modest effect on symptom duration in patients whose uncomplicated influenza was treated after a visit to a general practitioner be able to cut in half the risk for death among hospitalized patients?

### Neuraminidase inhibitors: who, when, where? [^113w8c57]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Although the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs), oseltamivir and zanamivir were first licensed in 1999, their clinical effectiveness is still hotly debated. Two rigorous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the data from clinical trials conducted in community settings against relatively benign influenza, both suggest that reductions in symptom duration are extremely modest, under one day. Whilst one of these reviews could find no evidence of reductions in complications, the most recent review reported clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in the likelihood of requiring antibiotics (44%) and hospitalizations (63%) in adult patients with confirmed influenza, treated with oseltamivir. A further meta-analysis of observational data from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic suggested that, in hospitalised patients, NIs significantly reduced mortality in adults by 25% overall, and by 62% if started within 48 hours of symptom onset, compared with no treatment. But, the effectiveness of NIs in children is far less clear. Taken together, these data suggest that NIs should be reserved for patients with influenza who are at high-risk of complications, or when clinically assessed found to be markedly unwell, or rapidly deteriorating. In such patients, treatment should be initiated empirically, as soon as possible, preferably with follow-on virological confirmation.

2.3	Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis of Influenza

Initiate post-exposure prophylaxis with TAMIFLU within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with TAMIFLU during a community outbreak.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended dosage of TAMIFLU for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule or 12.5 mL of oral suspension once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, TAMIFLU may be continued for up to 12 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. The duration of protection lasts for as long as TAMIFLU dosing is continued.

Pediatric Patients (1 year to 12 years of age)

Table 1 displays the recommended oral dosage of TAMIFLU for prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age based on body weight and provides information about prescribing the capsule or the formulation for oral suspension. Prophylaxis in pediatric patients is recommended for 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

2.4	Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Table 2 displays the dosage recommendations for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in adults with various stages of renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of less than or equal to 90 mL per minute). Dosage modifications are recommended in adults with an estimated creatinine clearance less than or equal to 60 mL per minute [see Use in Specific Population (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Oseltamivir Treatment of Severe Influenza

Although necessary to consider oseltamivir's effect on more serious infections, no randomized controlled trials exist that can be included in a meta-analysis. The Cochrane group chooses only to conduct meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, which are generally accepted to be the highest level of evidence. Thus, the Cochrane group could not review severe outcomes of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Evidence is instead derived from observational studies on the use of oseltamivir to treat complications of influenza virus infection, as in hospitalized patients or in those who died. These studies are subject to uncontrolled bias. For instance, sicker patients may be more (or less) likely to be treated, thus attenuating (or exaggerating) the effect of the intervention. Also, a serious outcome may occur soon after the treatment was initiated in a severely ill patient, so that the treatment has not had a chance to succeed. Similarly, patients who receive early treatment are more likely to benefit from treatment than patients who receive late treatment. To minimize bias, researchers conducting observational studies have attempted to adjust for time from disease onset to treatment and time from treatment to outcome. Some observational studies have also adjusted for propensity to be treated as well as patient coexisting conditions and disease severity, which may affect treatment decisions and outcomes.

Observational studies that enrolled adults have often used death as an outcome, given its ease of definition. However, many observational studies fail to control completely for potential biases, including time biases. Among studies that have attempted to control for these biases, a decreased risk for death after oseltamivir treatment has been reported, and early treatment appears to be critical. For instance, in a retrospective cohort study from Israel of 449 patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, all patients were treated with oseltamivir, and 189 (42%) were treated within 48 hours. This observational study controlled for propensity to treat and patient coexisting conditions and demonstrated the odds of death increased by 2.2 times (95% CI 1.4–3.5 times) if treatment was started late (> 48 hours after symptom onset).

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) or serious skin reactions. Instruct patients and/or caregiver to stop TAMIFLU and seek immediate medical attention if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Neuropsychiatric Events

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of neuropsychiatric events in TAMIFLU-treated patients with influenza and instruct patients to contact their physician if they experience signs of abnormal behavior while receiving TAMIFLU [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Important Dosing Information

Instruct patients to begin treatment with TAMIFLU as soon as possible from the first appearance of flu symptoms, within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Similarly, instruct patients to start taking TAMIFLU for prevention as soon as possible after exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Instruct patients to take any missed doses as soon as they remember, except if it is near the next scheduled dose (within 2 hours), and then continue to take TAMIFLU at the usual times.

Influenza Vaccines

Instruct patients that TAMIFLU is not a substitute for receiving an annual flu vaccination. Patients should continue receiving an annual flu vaccination according to guidelines on immunization practices. Because of the potential for TAMIFLU to inhibit replication of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and possibly reduce efficacy of LAIV, avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks or 48 hours after TAMIFLU administration, unless medically necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Fructose Intolerance

Inform patients with hereditary fructose intolerance that one dose of 75 mg TAMIFLU oral suspension (supplied as powder) delivers 2 grams of sorbitol. Inform patients with hereditary fructose intolerance that this is above the daily maximum limit of sorbitol and may cause dyspepsia and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Influenza [^112vZzjA]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

What treatments are available for influenza?

Influenza is usually self limiting in healthy individuals. Treatment of uncomplicated disease in healthy individuals is supportive and includes antipyretics, adequate fluid intake, rest, and staying off work or school until 24 hours after resolution of fever to limit spread to others.

Most randomised trials of antiviral drugs have been conducted among otherwise healthy individuals and have shown modest reductions in symptom duration (0.7 days). Fewer studies have been conducted among individuals at risk of complicated influenza. Data from observational studies and trials suggests that antiviral treatment may reduce adverse outcomes. For example, the meta-analysis from 2015 reported fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics after oseltamivir treatment compared with placebo (risk difference −3.8%) and fewer hospital admissions (risk difference −1.1%).NICE, Public Health England, UK Chief Medical Officers, and the WHOrecommend treatment of suspected and confirmed influenza for individuals at risk of complicated influenza (box 1). General practitioners considering prescription of antivirals should discuss with patients likely benefits, as well as possible harms including nausea (number treated to cause nausea in one patient = 28)and vomiting (number treated to cause vomiting in one patient = 22).

Individuals with complicated influenza may be helped by antiviral treatment. Treatment is most effective if started within 48 hours of symptom onset, and it should not be delayed while awaiting results of investigations. Neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir inhibit viral release from infected cells and reduce the rate of viral replication. Meta-analysis of individual participant data found that, compared with late treatment, early treatment (within 48 hours of symptom onset) of hospitalised individuals with complicated influenza reduced the odds of mortality by 52%. Some individuals may require antibiotic therapy to treat secondary bacterial infections.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) or serious skin reactions. Instruct patients and/or caregiver to stop oseltamivir phosphate and seek immediate medical attention if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Neuropsychiatric Events

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of neuropsychiatric events in oseltamivir phosphate-treated patients with influenza and instruct patients to contact their physician if they experience signs of abnormal behavior while receiving oseltamivir phosphate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Important Dosing Information

Instruct patients to begin treatment with oseltamivir phosphate as soon as possible from the first appearance of flu symptoms, within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Similarly, instruct patients to start taking oseltamivir phosphate for prevention as soon as possible after exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Instruct patients to take any missed doses as soon as they remember, except if it is near the next scheduled dose (within 2 hours), and then continue to take oseltamivir phosphate at the usual times.

Influenza Vaccines

Instruct patients that oseltamivir phosphate is not a substitute for receiving an annual flu vaccination. Patients should continue receiving an annual flu vaccination according to guidelines on immunization practices. Because of the potential for oseltamivir phosphate to inhibit replication of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and possibly reduce efficacy of LAIV, avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks or 48 hours after oseltamivir phosphate administration, unless medically necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) [^114hkYkF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

One double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.

Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. TAMIFLU treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of TAMIFLU in male and female pediatric subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)

Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age). Subjects received TAMIFLU at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days depending on subject age. These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.

Of the 136 subjects under the age of 1 year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non-Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza A (80%). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that a dose of 3 mg per kg twice daily in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age provided TAMIFLU concentrations similar to or higher than those observed in older pediatric subjects and adults receiving the approved dose and provided the basis for approval [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^116dXfMn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir Treatment of Seasonal Influenza

After partially successful efforts to retrieve unpublished data from Roche, the Cochrane group conducted a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating uncomplicated community-acquired influenza. Their findings led the group to conclude that oseltamivir had no specific antiviral effect, even though the drug had been specifically designed to achieve exactly that. The Cochrane systematic review, which focused only on an intention-to-treat analysis, confirmed that oseltamivir reduced symptom duration in the intention-to-treat group by < 24 hours. Earlier, the Cochrane group had noted, "We are unsure of the generalizability of our conclusions from seasonal to pandemic or avian influenza".

As noted previously, a subsequent meta-analysis (funded by an unrestricted grant from Roche) also confirmed a ≈1-day reduction in symptoms among adults and adolescents who had laboratory-confirmed influenza and were treated within 48 hours of symptom onset. This analysis included outcomes of both intention-to-treat and intention-to-treat-infected groups. Benefit was found for the intention-to-treat-infected group, but no benefit was found for patients with influenza-like illness who did not have laboratory-confirmed influenza (the intention-to-treat but not infected group). Given that the benefit of oseltamivir was confined to symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed infection, the authors concluded that the effect of oseltamivir was due to its effect on the influenza virus, rather than a nonspecific antiviral effect, as had been suggested by the Cochrane group.

14.1 Treatment of Influenza

Adults

Two randomized, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral oseltamivir phosphate or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever‐reducing medications.

Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza‐infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza‐infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self‐assess the influenza‐associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3‐day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza‐infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in men and women.

### Update: influenza activity – United States, September 28, 2014-February 21, 2015 [^1138R71n]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

CDC recommends that antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after illness onset (ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset) for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who is hospitalized, has severe, complicated, or progressive illness, or is at high risk for influenza-associated complications, including children aged < 2 years and adults aged ≥ 65 years. However, even when started after 48 hours of illness onset, antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients. Antiviral treatment decisions should not be delayed awaiting laboratory confirmation of influenza.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available at.

What is already known on this topic?

CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity year-round in the United States. The timing and severity of circulating influenza viruses can vary by geographic location and season.

What is added by this report?

Influenza activity in the United States began to increase in mid-November, remained elevated through February 21, 2015, and is expected to continue for several more weeks. This has been an especially severe season for adults aged ≥ 65 years; this group has the highest recorded influenza-associated hospitalization rate and accounts for the majority of pneumonia and influenza–associated deaths this season. During September 28, 2014–February 21, 2015, influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated. Characterization data indicate that most of the influenza A (H3N2) viruses have antigenically or genetically drifted and are different from the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. The vast majority of currently circulating influenza viruses are sensitive to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Although vaccine effectiveness is reduced this season, influenza vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent influenza illness. Antiviral medications are more important than usual as an adjunct to vaccination in the treatment and prevention of influenza. Early antiviral treatment is recommended for patients with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza illness and those at higher risk for influenza complications, including adults aged ≥ 65 years.

### Effectiveness of oseltamivir on disease progression and viral RNA shedding in patients with mild pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1: opportunistic retrospective study of medical charts in China [^112KoTEj]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Three quarters of our patients received oseltamivir treatment, and 37% of them were given treatment within two days of symptom onset. Thus, we analysed the effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment on the subsequent development of radiographic evidence of pneumonia and on two quantitative indicators — duration of fever and viral RNA shedding — rather than grouping only duration of viral RNA shedding as in a recent study. Our study suggests that oseltamivir reduces the risk of radiographically confirmed pneumonia, and early treatment within two days of symptoms onset can reduce the duration of fever and viral RNA shedding. Two small observational studies on 2009 H1N1 also suggested that early oseltamivir treatment reduced duration of viral shedding, viral load, and duration of fever. The evidence from previous randomised controlled trials of uncomplicated seasonal influenza is strongest for antiviral treatment started within 48 hours of illness onset. Current guidance recommends that antiviral treatment should be initiated immediately and without waiting for laboratory confirmation of diagnosis. Observational studies suggest that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment of patients in hospital can reduce disease severity and mortality, both for 2009 H1N1and seasonal influenza. Our results, however, do not suggest that early initiation of oseltamivir (that is, less than two days after onset) was more protective than later initiation. Consistent with the observational studies on seasonal infectionand human infection with H5N1, our patients still seemed to gain benefit (prevention of radiographically confirmed pneumonia) even when they received antiviral treatment more than 48 hours after symptom onset. Antiviral treatment should ideally be started early after the onset of symptoms, but it can also be used at any stage of active disease if ongoing viral replication is anticipated or documented.

We believe the absence of severely affected patients in our series is because of early admission to hospital and early treatment with oseltamivir for most patients. In contrast to previous reports on severely affected patients admitted to hospital in countries with sustained community-wide transmission, our case series reflects only the most commonly affected — that is, young healthy adults — at the beginning of the pandemic, which is not representative of the general Chinese population. Also, the prevalence of risk factors associated with severe disease from 2009 H1N1, including chronic comorbidities, pregnancy, and very young age, in our patients is much lower than in recent reports of severely affected patients admitted to hospital. These differences are probably because we included all patients positive for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, whereas in the other studies requirement for admission to hospital was an additional criterion.

### Oseltamivir treatment for influenza in adults: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116AnA7U]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use, questions remain about the efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. We aimed to do an individual patient data meta-analysis for all clinical trials comparing oseltamivir with placebo for treatment of seasonal influenza in adults regarding symptom alleviation, complications, and safety.

Methods

We included all published and unpublished Roche-sponsored randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 75 mg twice a day oseltamivir in adults. Trials of oseltamivir for treatment of naturally occurring influenza-like illness in adults reporting at least one of the study outcomes were eligible. We also searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register for other relevant trials published before Jan 1, 2014 (search last updated on Nov 27, 2014). We analysed intention-to-treat infected, intention-to-treat, and safety populations. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of all symptoms analysed with accelerated failure time methods. We used risk ratios and Mantel-Haenszel methods to work out complications, admittances to hospital, and safety outcomes.

Findings

We included data from nine trials including 4328 patients. In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted a 21% shorter time to alleviation of all symptoms for oseltamivir versus placebo recipients (time ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·74–0·85; p < 0·0001). The median times to alleviation were 97·5 h for oseltamivir and 122·7 h for placebo groups (difference -25·2 h, 95% CI -36·2 to -16·0). For the intention-to-treat population, the estimated treatment effect was attenuated (time ratio 0·85) but remained highly significant (median difference -17·8 h). In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics more than 48 h after randomisation (risk ratio [RR] 0·56, 95% CI 0·42–0·75; p = 0·0001; 4·9% oseltamivir vs 8·7% placebo, risk difference -3·8%, 95% CI -5·0 to -2·2) and also fewer admittances to hospital for any cause (RR 0·37, 95% CI 0·17–0·81; p = 0·013; 0·6% oseltamivir, 1·7% placebo, risk difference -1·1%, 95% CI -1·4 to -0·3). Regarding safety, oseltamivir increased the risk of nausea (RR 1·60, 95% CI 1·29–1·99; p < 0·0001; 9·9% oseltamivir vs 6·2% placebo, risk difference 3·7%, 95% CI 1·8–6·1) and vomiting (RR 2·43, 95% CI 1·83–3·23; p < 0·0001; 8·0% oseltamivir vs 3·3% placebo, risk difference 4·7%, 95% CI 2·7–7·3). We recorded no effect on neurological or psychiatric disorders or serious adverse events.

Interpretation

Our findings show that oseltamivir in adults with influenza accelerates time to clinical symptom alleviation, reduces risk of lower respiratory tract complications, and admittance to hospital, but increases the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, October 1, 2017-February 3, 2018 [^117XS9VQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors has been shown to reduce illness duration and severe outcomes of influenza based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. Treatment with influenza antiviral medications initiated as close to the onset of illness as possible is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are not hospitalized but who are at high risk for developing serious influenza complications. Treatment should not be delayed while waiting for results of testing or even if rapid antigen-detection influenza diagnostic test results are negative. Clinical benefit of antiviral treatment is greatest when treatment begins within 48 hours after symptom onset; however, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients. A CDC health advisory released on December 27, 2017, regarding treatment with antiviral medications is available at.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available online.

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — antiviral timing and hospital admission management — Greatest clinical benefit was reported when antiviral treatment was started within 2 days of illness onset, but benefit was noted even when started in most patients 4–5 days and up to 7 days after illness onset, including when NAI treatment was started > 48 hours after illness onset; a meta-analysis in hospitalized A(H1N1)pdm09 cases suggested that antiviral treatment within 48 hours of illness onset was associated with lower mortality compared to later or no treatment. Early antiviral treatment of influenza in outpatients reduces the likelihood of antibiotic use or physician-diagnosed complications and may reduce secondary bacterial coinfection. For patients being admitted with suspected influenza, we recommend starting empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible without waiting for influenza testing results.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^116MjpuU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

A debate about the market-leading influenza antiviral medication, oseltamivir, which initially focused on treatment for generally mild illness, has been expanded to question the wisdom of stockpiling for use in future influenza pandemics. Although randomized controlled trial evidence confirms that oseltamivir will reduce symptom duration by 17–25 hours among otherwise healthy adolescents and adults with community-managed disease, no randomized controlled trials have examined the effectiveness of oseltamivir against more serious outcomes. Observational studies, although criticized on methodologic grounds, suggest that oseltamivir given early can reduce the risk for death by half among persons hospitalized with confirmed infection caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H5N1) viruses. However, available randomized controlled trial data may not be able to capture the effect of oseltamivir use among hospitalized patients with severe disease. We assert that data on outpatients with relatively mild disease should not form the basis for policies on the management of more severe disease.

### Impact of neuraminidase inhibitor treatment on outcomes of public health importance during the 2009–2010 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis in hospitalized patients [^111Qhury]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), oseltamivir and zanamivir are licensed for the treatment of influenza A and B. Before the 2009–2010 pandemic, evidence from randomized trials suggested modest reductions in time to alleviation of symptoms and symptom severity and possibly a reduction in antibiotic use for secondary complications. Further evidence from methodologically weaker observational studies, derived mainly from prepandemic data (seasonal influenza), suggests that oral oseltamivir reduces mortality by about 75%, hospitalization by 25% and symptom duration compared with no treatment, with broadly similar findings for zanamivir, based on fewer studies.

Despite limited usage since launch, except in Japan, both drugs, especially oseltamivir, were widely stockpiled for pandemic purposes and subsequently deployed during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. A subsequent analysis of oseltamivir safety data published by F. Hoffman–La Roche estimated that 18.3 million individuals worldwide received the drug during the pandemic period between 1 May and 31 December 2009, and data from the United States shows that 97.5% of prescriptions for NAIs during the pandemic period were for oseltamivir.

Published studies from the recent pandemic period suggest that early (≤ 48 hours after symptom onset) versus "late" (delayed > 48 hours after symptom onset) treatment of healthy and at-risk adults reduced the likelihood of hospitalization or requirement for critical care. Similarly, a small number of studies suggest that increased in-hospital mortality might be related to the late initiation of NAI therapy. However, many studies are too small to produce conclusive individual findings; some adjust for possible confounders, but most do not.

Considerable uncertainty remains among public health policy-makers and governments regarding the public health benefits of NAI usage during the 2009–2010 pandemic. We therefore present a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies specifically from that period, assessing the impact of NAI treatment in hospitalized patients on mortality, requirement for critical care, and influenza-related pneumonia.

Antiviral medications continue to be an important adjunct to vaccination for reducing the health impact of influenza. On January 21, 2011, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations on the use of antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza were released. This guidance remains in effect for the 2014–15 season, and recommended antiviral medications include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). All influenza viruses tested for the 2014–15 season since October 1 have been susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended because of high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza A viruses. In addition, influenza B viruses are not susceptible to amantadine or rimantadine. Treatment with antivirals is recommended as soon as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at higher risk for influenza complications §§§. Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early. When indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset. However, antiviral treatment might still have some benefits in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients when started after 48 hours of illness onset. Antiviral treatment also may be considered for previously healthy, symptomatic outpatients who are not considered to be at high risk and have confirmed or suspected influenza, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Residents of long-term care facilities can experience severe and fatal illness during influenza outbreaks; residents with confirmed or suspected influenza should be treated with antivirals immediately, without waiting for laboratory confirmation of influenza. During periods where two or more residents of long-term care facilities are ill within 72 hours with confirmed or suspected influenza, antivirals should be given prophylactically to residents and should be considered for any unvaccinated staff. Additionally, antiviral chemoprophylaxis can be considered for all staff, regardless of vaccination status, if the outbreak is caused by a strain of influenza virus that is not well matched to the vaccine.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A virus infections in humans is available at.

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Wu3wA]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the administration of oseltamivir to adult and adolescent outpatients with confirmed influenza associated with a reduced risk of first hospitalization?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 randomized clinical trials including 6166 patients, oseltamivir was not associated with reduced risk of first hospitalization compared with placebo or standard of care. Results were similar in a subgroup of patients considered at high risk of hospitalization; however, the CIs were wide.

Meaning

An adequately powered trial in a suitably high-risk population is needed to determine who might benefit from early treatment with oseltamivir to prevent hospitalization.

Evidence summary — early neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) therapy in outpatients: Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that established the efficacy of NAIs in reducing the duration of fever and symptoms by approximately 1–2 days were conducted among mostly non–high-risk adult and pediatric outpatients with uncomplicated laboratory-confirmed influenza, enrolled within 36–48 hours of illness onset. Greater clinical benefit was reported when NAI treatment was started very early; in both adults and children, NAI treatment started within 6 hours of illness onset reduced symptoms by about 4 days. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate that early initiation (within 2 days of illness onset) of antiviral treatment can reduce the duration of fever and symptoms, especially in nonasthmatic children; decrease the risk of otitis media in children; and reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics and of hospitalization in adults.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) or serious skin reactions. Instruct patients and/or caregiver to stop oseltamivir phosphate capsules and seek immediate medical attention if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Neuropsychiatric Events

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of neuropsychiatric events in oseltamivir phosphate-treated patients with influenza and instruct patients to contact their physician if they experience signs of abnormal behavior while receiving oseltamivir phosphate capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Important Dosing Information

Instruct patients to begin treatment with oseltamivir phosphate capsules as soon as possible from the first appearance of flu symptoms, within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Similarly, instruct patients to start taking oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prevention as soon as possible after exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Instruct patients to take any missed doses as soon as they remember, except if it is near the next scheduled dose (within 2 hours), and then continue to take oseltamivir phosphate capsules at the usual times.

Influenza Vaccines

Instruct patients that oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not a substitute for receiving an annual flu vaccination. Patients should continue receiving an annual flu vaccination according to guidelines on immunization practices. Because of the potential for oseltamivir phosphate to inhibit replication of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and possibly reduce efficacy of LAIV, avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks or 48 hours after oseltamivir phosphate capsules administration, unless medically necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

14.1 Treatment of Influenza

Adults Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral oseltamivir phosphate or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.

Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in men and women.

### Oseltamivir treatment vs supportive care for seasonal influenza requiring hospitalization [^115mzquB]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Our study adds to the existing evidence on the benefit of oseltamivir treatment in patients hospitalized for severe influenza, which supports the current guideline recommendation of antiviral treatment for these patients. Ideally, efforts should be made toward RCTs to provide higher quality evidence. Given the small mortality benefit shown in our study, a trial powered on mortality would need to have a very large sample size. We look forward to the results from the ongoing Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial that is comparing oseltamivir with supportive care for patients hospitalized with influenza. It will be interesting to compare the RECOVERY trial results to our target trial emulation that was designed and analyzed without knowledge of the RECOVERY trial results.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study has several strengths. First, we had a large sample size of 11 073 patients that led to more precise estimates and allowed us to detect small but clinically important differences in mortality. To our knowledge, our study is the largest study to date comparing oseltamivir with supportive care without oseltamivir treatment for seasonal influenza requiring hospitalization. Second, the inclusion of 30 hospital sites over 9 influenza seasons make the study results more generalizable. However, the study results may be less applicable to other settings with very different patient population or practice patterns. Third, we used a target trial emulation approach that accounted for immortal time bias by excluding those who died on hospital day 0 or 1. Moreover, overlap weighting of propensity score was used to balance covariates and account for confounding by indication. Our findings were robust across several sensitivity analyses.

There are several limitations that merit mentioning. First, we did not have the microbiology data to confirm influenza. However, the algorithm based on ICD-10-CA codes used in our study has already been validated against laboratory-confirmed influenza using the same data source and population in a prior study with a high positive predictive value of 91% and negative predictive value of 96%. Although the diagnostic accuracy is high, it is not perfect. As a result, this study will have included some false positives and missed some false negatives, which have the potential to introduce selection bias. Similar algorithms using ICD-10 codes have been used previously.

Second, we did not account for outpatient oseltamivir treatment prior to presentation to hospital or days of symptoms as a baseline covariate. However, this aligns with the current guidelines that all patients hospitalized with influenza should be treated regardless of illness duration.

2.1	Dosage and Administration Overview

Administer oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza in patients 2 weeks of age or older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] or for prophylaxis of influenza in patients 1 year and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

The capsules may be taken with or without food; however, tolerability may be enhanced if oseltamivir phosphate is taken with food.

Adjust the oseltamivir phosphate dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

For patients who cannot swallow capsules, oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is the preferred formulation. When oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is not available from wholesaler or the manufacturer, oseltamivir phosphate capsules may be opened and mixed with sweetened liquids such as regular or sugar‐free chocolate syrup, corn syrup, caramel topping, or light brown sugar (dissolved in water). During emergency situations and when neither the oral suspension or the age‐appropriate strengths of oseltamivir phosphate capsules to mix with sweetened liquids are available, then a pharmacist may prepare an emergency supply of oral suspension from oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg capsules [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

2.2	Recommended Dosage for Treatment of Influenza

Initiate treatment with oseltamivir phosphate within 48 hours of influenza symptom onset.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended oral dosage of oseltamivir phosphate for treatment of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg twice daily (one 75 mg capsule twice daily) for 5 days.

Pediatric Patients (2 weeks of age through 12 years of age)

### Early estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, January 2015 [^1142oiVA]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

These early VE estimates underscore the need for additional influenza prevention and treatment measures, especially among persons aged ≥ 65 years, young children, and other persons at higher risk for serious influenza associated complications. § Influenza antiviral medications should be used as recommended for treatment in patients, regardless of their vaccination status. Antiviral treatment can reduce the duration of illness and reduce complications associated with influenza. Antiviral treatment should be used for any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza who is hospitalized, has severe or progressive illness, or is at high risk for complications from influenza, even if the illness seems mild. Persons at high risk include young children (especially children aged < 2 years), pregnant women, persons with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease, and adults aged ≥ 65 years.

Ideally, antiviral treatment should be initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset, when treatment is most effective. However, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients. Observational studies of hospitalized patients suggest some benefit when treatment was initiated up to 4 or 5 days after symptom onset. Also, a randomized placebo-controlled study suggested clinical benefit when oseltamivir was initiated 72 hours after illness onset among febrile children with uncomplicated influenza. Clinical judgment, on the basis of the patient's disease severity and progression, age, underlying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms, is important when making antiviral treatment decisions for outpatients. The decision to initiate antiviral treatment should not be delayed pending laboratory confirmation of influenza, especially if performed by insensitive assays, such as rapid influenza diagnostic tests. Health care providers should advise patients at high risk to call promptly if they get symptoms of influenza. Also, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for influenza while influenza activity is widespread. Alternative strategies, such as health care provider–operated telephone triage, might enable patients at high risk to discuss symptoms over the phone and facilitate early initiation of treatment.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used the General Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) database. A target trial emulation framework was used, which explicitly defines the target trial and analyzes a large observational database to emulate the target trial with the aim of estimating the causal effect of an intervention. Research ethics approval was obtained from the Unity Health Toronto research ethics board with a waiver of informed consent due to the retrospective nature of the study and use of deidentified data. We reported the study using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Data Source

The GEMINI database includes internal medicine and ICU patients admitted to participating hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Administrative and clinical data are linked at the individual patient level. The collected data include demographics, diagnoses, interventions, discharge, readmission, medication orders, and bloodwork results. Diagnoses were coded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) codes.

Eligibility Criteria

The study comprised patients with severe influenza, defined as influenza requiring hospitalization. We included consecutive adult patients admitted to the medical inpatient service or ICU across 30 acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 2015, to June 1, 2023. To be eligible, patients needed to have influenza as the main responsible diagnosis for hospital admission based on ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes of J09, J10.0, J10.1, J10.8, J11.0, J11.1, and J11.8. This algorithm of ICD-10-CA codes has been validated against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations using the same administrative data. Patients with bacterial or viral coinfections were included in the study.

Patients were excluded if they died on hospital day 0 or 1 because they would likely have died before a patient could have been recruited and randomized for the analogous trial. Day 0 was defined as the calendar day the patient was admitted to the hospital. Patients who were prescribed peramivir or zanamivir were excluded because both agents were alternative influenza treatments that were not relevant to this study question. Baloxavir was not marketed in Canada during the study period.

Treatment Strategies

The intervention group consisted of patients who were prescribed oseltamivir on hospital day 0 or 1. This index frame was based on observational studies that suggested most benefit for early initiation of oseltamivir treatment on hospital day 0 or 1. The comparison group consisted of patients who received supportive care without receipt of oseltamivir on day 0 and 1.

Risk Summary

Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for oseltamivir phosphate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Treatment of Influenza

The safety and efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks old to 17 years of age has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)] and is based on:

- **13 to 17 years of age**: Safety and efficacy in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age was supported by adequate and well‐controlled trials in adults and adolescents and younger pediatric patients and safety data in adolescents treated with oseltamivir phosphate in a study of treatment and prophylaxis.

- **1 year to 12 years of age**: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age was supported by results of one double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in 452 pediatric patients with influenza in whom oseltamivir phosphate 2 mg per kg twice daily or placebo was administered within 48 hours of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Additional safety information was provided in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with known asthma. Efficacy could not be established in pediatric patients with asthma.

- **2 weeks to less than 1 year of age**: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age is supported by adequate and well‐controlled trials in adults and older pediatric patients and two open‐label trials of oseltamivir phosphate (2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days) in 136 pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age. In these two trials, the oseltamivir plasma concentrations in these subjects were similar to or higher than the oseltamivir plasma concentrations observed in older pediatric subjects and adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Administer oseltamivir phosphate capsules for the treatment of influenza in patients 2 weeks of age or older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] or for prophylaxis of influenza in patients 1 year and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] using:

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules

The capsules may be taken with or without food; however, tolerability may be enhanced if oseltamivir phosphate capsules is taken with food.

Adjust the oseltamivir phosphate capsules dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

For patients who cannot swallow capsules, oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is the preferred formulation. When oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is not available from wholesaler or the manufacturer, oseltamivir phosphate capsules may be opened and mixed with sweetened liquids such as regular or sugar-free chocolate syrup, corn syrup, caramel topping, or light brown sugar (dissolved in water).

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^112f9Lp5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza — postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis in noninstitutional settings: Clinicians can consider postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis for asymptomatic adults and children aged ≥ 3 months who are at very high risk of developing complications from influenza and for whom influenza vaccination is contraindicated, unavailable, or expected to have low effectiveness, after household exposure to influenza, and can consider postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis (in conjunction with influenza vaccination) for adults and children aged ≥ 3 months who are unvaccinated and are household contacts of a person at very high risk of complications from influenza, after exposure to influenza. Clinicians can consider educating patients and arranging for early empiric initiation of antiviral treatment as an alternative to postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis. If chemoprophylaxis is given, clinicians should administer postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis as soon as possible after exposure, ideally no later than 48 hours after exposure. Clinicians should not administer once-daily postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis if > 48 hours has elapsed since exposure, and full-dose empiric antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as symptoms occur, if treatment is indicated. Clinicians should administer postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis in a nonhousehold setting for 7 days after the most recent exposure to a close contact with influenza, and should test for influenza and switch to antiviral treatment dosing in persons receiving postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis who become symptomatic, preferably with an antiviral drug with a different resistance profile if not contraindicated. Clinicians should administer an NAI (inhaled zanamivir or oral oseltamivir) if postexposure chemoprophylaxis for influenza is given, rather than an adamantane antiviral.

### Effect of double dose oseltamivir on clinical and virological outcomes in children and adults admitted to hospital with severe influenza: double blind randomised controlled trial [^111JNA2Z]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Human influenza is often considered an acute self limiting febrile illness. Occasionally, however, it is associated with respiratory complications, admission to hospital, and mortality. Clinical trials have shown that treatment with oseltamivir has clinical and virological benefit in patients with uncomplicated influenza when it is administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Randomised trials in patients with severe influenza are lacking, but observational studies in patients admitted to hospital indicate that oseltamivir treatment, especially if it is given early, is associated with reduced mortality and shorter length of stay, although mortality can still be up to 6% with H1N1-pdm09 (pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza) or seasonal influenza. Timely oseltamivir treatment of patients with avian H5N1 influenza reduces mortality, but many patients die despite treatment.

Higher oseltamivir doses were tested in patients with uncomplicated influenza, but no consistently improved clinical or virological outcomes were found compared with the standard dose. Despite a lack of evidence, several authorities have suggested use of double dose oseltamivir for severe influenza. The use of higher doses has major implications for clinical management, public health, and planning for antiviral stockpiles. The sudden emergence of pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009, the persistent circulation of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses across large regions of the world since 1997, and the recent emergence and spread of avian H7N9 influenza virus in Chinaillustrate the continuing threat of influenza viruses to global health. Improvement of the evidence base for current treatment guidelines of severe influenza is clearly essential for optimal clinical management and pandemic preparedness. Consequently, we conducted a randomised controlled trial to ascertain whether double dose oseltamivir controls viral replication faster and improves clinical outcomes compared with standard dose in patients admitted to hospital with severe influenza.

2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview

Administer oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension for the treatment of influenza in patients 2 weeks of age or older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] or for prophylaxis of influenza in patients 1 year and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] using:

Oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension (supplied as a powder). This is the preferred formulation (6 mg per mL) for patients who cannot swallow capsules. Prior to use, the supplied oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension powder must be constituted with water by the pharmacist to produce the oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

The oral suspension may be taken with or without food; however, tolerability may be enhanced if oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is taken with food.

Adjust the oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Treatment of Influenza

Initiate treatment with oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension within 48 hours of influenza symptom onset.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended oral dosage of oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension for treatment of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg twice daily (12.5 mL of oral suspension twice daily) for 5 days.

Pediatric Patients (2 weeks of age through 12 years of age)

### Treatment with oseltamivir in children hospitalized with community-acquired, laboratory-confirmed influenza: review of five seasons and evaluation of an electronic reminder [^116nG8eG]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When initiated within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, oseltamivir has been shown to reduce severity and length of influenza illness. Few studies have evaluated the use of oseltamivir in patients hospitalized with influenza.

Objective

To describe the prescribing practices for oseltamivir in children hospitalized with influenza and to evaluate a mechanism to improve the rate of appropriate prescription.

Design, Setting, Patients

Retrospective cohort study of 929 patients aged 21 years or younger hospitalized with community-acquired laboratory-confirmed influenza (CA-LCI) during 5 consecutive seasons (2000–2005). We examined oseltamivir eligibility, which included patients 1 year of age or older with an influenza test result available within 48 hours of symptom onset. During the 2005–2006 season, an observational trial of an electronic reminder was conducted to improve the frequency of oseltamivir prescription.

Measurements

Oseltamivir prescription.

Results

Of 305 patients (32.8%) eligible for treatment with oseltamivir, 49 (16.1% of those eligible) were prescribed oseltamivir during hospitalization. Prescription rates for indications consistent with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval ("on label") increased from 0% to 37.2% over 5 seasons (P < 0.0001). Prescriptions outside this recommendation ("off label") also increased over 5 seasons (P < 0.0001). Twenty-nine (5%) of 624 patients were treated with oseltamivir off label; 11 were less than 1 year of age. Initiation of a reminder had no impact on prescription (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Oseltamivir was used infrequently for children hospitalized with influenza. In addition, use inconsistent with the FDA label of oseltamivir occurs. Mechanisms are needed to improve appropriate prescription of oseltamivir.

### A randomized study evaluating the effectiveness of oseltamivir initiated at the time of hospital admission in adults hospitalized with influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections [^115f8nSd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Influenza-associated hospitalizations result in high morbidity and mortality. We sought to determine if early empiric anti-influenza therapy improves outcomes of hospitalized patients with influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections (I-LRTIs).

Methods

This was a randomized, unblinded, trial of adult patients hospitalized with I-LRTIs in Kentucky during 2009–2012. Patients were randomized to group A (standard of care) or group B (standard of care plus oseltamivir as early as possible but within 24 hours of enrollment). The primary outcome was development of clinical failure (composite variable including failure to reach clinical improvement within 7 days, transfer to intensive care 24 hours after admission, or rehospitalization or death within 30 days). Intent-to-treat (ITT) (all LRTI) and per-protocol (PP) (I-LRTI) analyses were done.

Results

A total of 1107 patients were enrolled and included in the ITT analysis, 556 in group A and 551 in group B. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 5 days (interquartile range, 5) for both groups; oseltamivir was initiated median day 6 in group B. There was no difference in the development of clinical failure (group A, 25%, and group B, 24%; p = 0.561). In the PP analysis, 11 of 45 (24%) patients in group A and 4 of 29 (14%) patients in group B had clinical failure (P = 0.414).

Conclusions

Initiation of oseltamivir more than 5 days after illness onset did not reduce clinical failures among hospitalized patients with I- LRTIs. However, we did not enroll our projected sample size of I-LRTI.

Prophylaxis of Influenza

The safety and efficacy of TAMIFLU for the prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 17 years old has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.2)] and is based on:

13 to 17 years of age: Prophylaxis in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age is supported by one randomized, placebo-controlled post-exposure household prophylaxis trial of TAMIFLU 75 mg taken orally once daily for 7 days in household contacts including 207 adolescents [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].
1 year to 12 years of age: TAMIFLU for prophylaxis in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age is supported by one randomized, open-label, post-exposure household prophylaxis trial including pediatric subjects 1 year to 12 years of age who received 30 to 60 mg of TAMIFLU for oral suspension (supplied as powder) taken orally once daily for 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Additional safety information was provided in a 6-week seasonal prophylaxis (community outbreak) safety study in 49 patients 1 year to 12 years of age.

The safety and efficacy of TAMIFLU for prophylaxis of influenza have not been established for pediatric patients less than 1 year of age.

### Influenza activity – United States, 2012–13 season and composition of the 2013–14 influenza vaccine [^112GaYSu]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

As a supplement to vaccination, influenza antiviral drugs are an important adjunct to reduce the impact of influenza. Based on recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at higher risk for influenza-related complications. Antiviral treatment also may be considered for outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who do not have known risk factors for severe illness if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. In addition, if a clinician does suspect that a patient might have an infection caused by a novel influenza virus, prompt empiric antiviral therapy is recommended. Recommended antiviral medications include oseltamivir and zanamivir. Recent viral surveillance and resistance data indicate that the majority of currently circulating influenza viruses are sensitive to these medications. Amantadine and rimantadine should not be used because of sustained high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza A viruses.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of oseltamivir phosphate PO (also known as Tamiflu, Tamiflu):

- **Bacterial infections**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as bacterial infections may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza.
- **Gastrointestinal adverse events**: use caution in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, as oral suspension of oseltamivir contains sorbitol and can cause dyspepsia and diarrhea.
- **Neuropsychiatric adverse events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as oseltamivir has been associated with an increased risk of abnormal behavior and delirium.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as oseltamivir has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, ans erythema multiforme.

Regarding medical management for influenza virus infection, more specifically with respect to indications for treatment, IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antiviral treatment in adult and pediatric patients not at high risk of influenza complications, with documented or suspected influenza, irrespective of influenza vaccination history, meeting any of the following criteria:

- outpatients with illness onset ≤ 2 days before presentation

- symptomatic outpatients who are household contacts of persons at high risk of developing complications from influenza, particularly with severe immunocompromising conditions

- symptomatic healthcare providers caring for patients at high risk of developing complications from influenza, particularly with severe immunocompromising conditions.

Except for one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and one influenza B virus, all influenza viruses tested remained susceptible to oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir, and only one virus contained a genetic mutation that has previously been associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir. Influenza antiviral medications are a valuable adjunct to annual influenza vaccination, and early treatment with influenza antiviral medication, especially within 48 hours of symptom onset, is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who 1) have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; 2) require hospitalization; or 3) are at high risk for influenza-related complications §§. Early treatment has been shown to decrease time to symptom improvement and to reduce secondary complications associated with influenza. Health care providers should not delay treatment until test results become available because treatment is most effective when given early in the illness.

Table
Conclusions of study evaluating the use of oseltamivir for seasonal and pandemic influenza and wisdom of stockpiling*

*RCT, randomized controlled trial; ICU, intensive care unit.

The details of study design may be best accomplished by an experienced group of international researchers, focusing on standardized recruitment procedures and covariate and outcome definitions with a clearly defined analysis plan designed to minimize bias, as far as possible. Funding for such studies could come from the public or private sectors, with prior safeguards on perceptions of conflicts of interest. The studies should be adaptable to evaluate new antiviral medications, including intravenous forms of the NAIs, newly licensed non-NAI antiviral agents that are currently in late-phase clinical trials, or adjunctive therapies and immunomodulatory agents. Combinations of novel drugs with existing NAIs will likely be a useful approach and will require evaluation. Plans for ensuring broad availability and regulatory approval for emergency use of unlicensed antiviral agents will need to be established on very short notice. If pragmatic trials or high-quality prospective observational studies are completed and published over the next decade, an improved evidence base may help clinicians and public health planners decide on the most appropriate use of oseltamivir and potential new influenza antiviral agents for patients with severe infections caused by seasonal or pandemic influenza.

Observational evidence on antiviral therapy — effects of oseltamivir timing, zanamivir comparisons, and evidence quality — reported that a meta-analysis of observational studies consisted of 74 articles, the analysis suggested that oseltamivir may reduce hospitalization in outpatients and decrease mortality in high-risk patients, and treatment was most effective when oral oseltamivir was started within 48 hours of symptom onset (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12–0.86 for mortality and OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33–0.81 for hospitalization); when inhaled zanamivir was compared with no treatment, patients were less likely to be hospitalized, studies comparing oral oseltamivir with inhaled zanamivir found no significant difference in hospitalization, overall evidence quality was very low to low for mortality and hospitalization, only one study reported mortality reduction with oral amantadine and adamantanes were considered more harmful than oseltamivir and zanamivir, and in a case series of older long-term care residents, those receiving oseltamivir within 48 hours were less likely to be prescribed antibiotics (38% vs 20%; P < .05).

### Update: influenza activity-United States, September 29-December 7, 2013 [^113bBvfh]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Antiviral medications continue to be an important adjunct to vaccination for reducing the health impact of influenza. On January 21, 2011, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations on the use of antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza were released. This guidance remains in effect for the 2013–14 season. Treatment with antivirals is recommended as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at higher risk for influenza complications, ††† without waiting for confirmatory testing. Antiviral treatment also may be considered for outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who do not have known risk factors for severe illness, and is most effective when treatment is initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Recommended antiviral medications include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). The majority of influenza viruses tested for the 2013–14 season since October 1, 2013, have been susceptible to oseltamivir. The seven oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 viruses identified in late October through November were from three different states in the South and West. Sporadic oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 virus infections, including small geographic clusters, have occurred previously, but the public health impact has been limited. This situation is being closely monitored. All influenza viruses, including those from the oseltamivir-resistant cluster, tested since October 1, 2013, have been susceptible to zanamivir. Amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended because of high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza A viruses. In addition, influenza B viruses are not susceptible to amantadine or rimantadine.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A virus infections in humans is available at.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

One double‐blind placebo‐controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza‐infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza‐infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.

Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. Oseltamivir phosphate treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in male and female pediatric subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)

Two open‐label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza‐infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age). Subjects received oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days depending on subject age. These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.

Of the 136 subjects under the age of 1 year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non‐Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza A (80%). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that a dose of 3 mg per kg twice daily in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age provided oseltamivir phosphate concentrations similar to or higher than those observed in older pediatric subjects and adults receiving the approved dose and provided the basis for approval [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Secondary analyses from the Roche-sponsored meta-analysis suggested the following: a 63% (95% CI 19%–83%) decreased risk in hospitalization for any cause, based on 9/1,591 (0.6%) oseltamivir treated vs 22/1,302 (1.7%) placebo-treated patients; and a 44% (95% CI 25%–58%) decreased risk of antibiotic prescription for lower respiratory disease in patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, based on 65/1,544 (4.2%) oseltamivir-treated vs 110/1,263 (8.7%) placebo-treated patients. However, hospital admissions were all cause and not confined to those that may have been associated with influenza infection; also, no formal diagnostic criteria existed for lower respiratory tract infection. We consider these secondary analyses less convincing than the analyses of primary endpoints. The latter were largely in agreement with those of the Cochrane group. Yet, despite this agreement and the arm's length funding mechanism, the Roche-sponsored meta-analysis has been criticized as being influenced by the manufacturer.

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JSnbC]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza was one of the most clinically burdensome respiratory viruses. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 29 million cases, 380 000 hospitalizations, and 28 000 deaths from influenza in the US during the 2018 to 2019 season. While COVID-19 led to a temporary reduction in infections, influenza is now expected to have a resurgence. Novel strains or a rise in a relatively less immune population could trigger an influenza pandemic resembling the crises experienced in 1968 or 2009. As such, the availability of safe and effective treatments is critical to avoid overwhelming health care systems and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Indeed, a breakthrough in the COVID-19 pandemic occurred when outpatient randomized clinical trials demonstrated reductions in hospitalization and death. In contrast, despite the substantial threat that influenza poses, there are no evidence-based outpatient treatments proven to prevent the progression to hospitalization.

Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is an antiviral that is commonly prescribed to outpatients with influenza to accelerate recovery and prevent complications. Detailing by key opinion leaders, guideline panels, and the manufacturer has even led to stockpiling of the medication as part of national pandemic responses. Yet, despite guideline recommendations, and millions of doses prescribed, it is unclear whether oseltamivir reduces severe complications requiring hospitalization. Three prior systematic reviews (1 independent and 2 supported by the manufacturer) have arrived at different conclusions. Since these publications, several large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been completed and have yet to be meta-analyzed. We, therefore, sought to clarify whether oseltamivir is a high-value medical treatment (achieving optimal results for patients balanced with an efficient use of resources). To do so, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of oseltamivir for the prevention of first hospitalization in adolescent and adult outpatients (efficacy) and treatment-associated adverse events (safety).

### Early oseltamivir treatment of influenza in children 1–3 years of age: a randomized controlled trial [^115vfgJE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Oseltamivir provides modest clinical benefits to children with influenza when started within 48 hours of symptom onset. The effectiveness of oseltamivir could be substantially greater if the treatment were started earlier during the course of the illness.

Methods

We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy of oseltamivir started within 24 hours of symptom onset in children 1–3 years of age with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the seasons of 2007–2008 and 2008–2009. Eligible children received either orally administered oseltamivir suspension or a matching placebo twice daily for 5 days. The children received clinical examinations, and the parents filled out detailed symptom diaries for 21 days.

Results

Of 408 randomized children who received the study drug (oseltamivir, 203, and placebo, 205), 98 had laboratory-confirmed influenza (influenza A, 79, and influenza B, 19). When started within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms, oseltamivir decreased the incidence of acute otitis media by 85% (95% confidence interval, 25%-97%), but no significant reduction was observed with treatment started within 24 hours. Among children with influenza A, oseltamivir treatment started within 24 hours shortened the median time to resolution of illness by 3.5 days (3.0 vs 6.5 days; p = 0.006) in all children and by 4.0 days (3.4 vs 7.3; p = 0.006) in unvaccinated children and reduced parental work absenteeism by 3.0 days. No efficacy was demonstrated against influenza B infections.

Conclusions

Oseltamivir treatment started within 24 hours of symptom onset provides substantial benefits to children with influenza A infection. Clinical trials registration. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00593502.

The impact of neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) treatment on clinical outcomes of public health importance during the 2009–2010 pandemic has not been firmly established.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching 11 databases (2009 through April 2012) for relevant studies. We used standard methods conforming to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using random effects models.

Results

Regarding mortality we observed a nonsignificant reduction associated with NAI treatment (at any time) versus none (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, .51–1.01]). However we observed significant reductions for early treatment (≤ 48 hours after symptom onset) versus late (OR, 0.38 [95% CI, .27-.53]) and for early treatment versus none (OR, 0.35 [95% CI, .18-.71]). NAI treatment (at any time) versus none was associated with an elevated risk of severe outcome (OR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.22–2.54]), but early versus late treatment reduced the likelihood (OR, 0.41 [95% CI, .30-.56]).

Conclusions

During the 2009–2010 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, early initiation of NAI treatment reduced the likelihood of severe outcomes compared with late or no treatment.

### Updated treatment for influenza A and B [^1179pbxS]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality and is responsible for considerable medical expenditures. Vaccination is the most effective public health measure to combat this illness. Amantadine and rimantadine are older antiviral agents that have been important adjuncts in the prevention and treatment of influenza A outbreaks. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are newer agents indicated for the treatment of both influenza A and B. For antiviral agents to be effective, they must be used within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms. Antiviral agents reduce the duration of fever and illness by one to two and one-half days and also reduce the severity of some symptoms. Use of amantadine or rimantadine is appropriate if influenza virus A is known to be the predominant agent in a particular year or location. Data need to be evaluated on the development of resistance and use of the newer antiviral agents in geriatric patients, high-risk patients and children. For optimal use of antiviral agents, patients with influenza symptoms must present early, and family physicians must accurately and rapidly diagnose the illness.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^1116EdxD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Implications for Stockpiling

Data from the randomized controlled trials of patients with mild influenza and the observational data from severely ill patients demonstrate the clear clinical benefits of initiating treatment as early as possible after infection. NAI use in Japan is so widespread that almost every confirmed influenza case is treated, which is likely to have led to the extensive and rapid delivery of the drugs in the 2009 pandemic. For instance, in a study of Japanese children hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections, > 98% (984/1,000) were treated with an NAI, and for those for whom the treatment time was recorded, 89% received NAIs within 48 hours and 70% within 24 hours. Only 1% of the hospitalized children ultimately required mechanical ventilation, and 1 death was recorded.

Similar ecologic data were observed among pregnant women in Japan, a group of patients at increased risk for hospitalization and death when infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Pregnant Japanese women were treated prophylactically after close contact with an infected person, and if infected and hospitalized, > 90% were given NAIs within 48 hours of symptom onset. In comparison to the high mortality rates among pregnant women in many countries around the world, no maternal deaths occurred in Japan during the pandemic.

Ecologic data from Japan, although regarded as the weakest form of epidemiologic evidence, suggest that rapid access to stockpiled NAIs in a pandemic is necessary to achieve the greatest benefit from their use. Rapid access during the 2009 pandemic in Japan was possible because rapid access represented routine care for seasonal influenza. In other countries, the 2009 pandemic confirmed that centralized stockpiles did not facilitate rapid distribution and that decentralized stockpiles would be more efficient. Stockpiles in hospitals, for example, would facilitate rapid treatment of ill patients in a pandemic but might also allow the periodic use of some material for the treatment of interpandemic seasonal influenza to avoid wastage due to an expiring stockpile.

IDSA seasonal influenza — nonresponse or deterioration on antivirals: Clinicians should investigate other causes besides influenza virus infection in influenza patients who fail to improve or deteriorate despite antiviral treatment (A-III). In patients who do not demonstrate clinical improvement after at least 2–3 days of antiviral treatment, especially when treatment is initiated early in the clinical course, consideration should be given to potential alternative explanations. Evaluation and management should be individualized.

### Efficacy of oseltamivir treatment started within 5 days of symptom onset to reduce influenza illness duration and virus shedding in an urban setting in Bangladesh: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^115Cp6z7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Few data exist for the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors, which are the only readily available influenza treatment options, especially in low-income settings. We assessed the efficacy of treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir to reduce patient illness and viral shedding in people with influenza, in whom treatment was started within 5 days of symptom onset, in an urban setting in Bangladesh.

Methods

We undertook a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial between May, 2008, and December, 2010. Patients with a positive rapid influenza test identified by surveillance of households in Kamalapur, Bangladesh were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to receive oseltamivir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. Randomisation lists for individuals enrolled less than 48 h and 48 h or longer since illness onset were generated with permuted blocks of variable length between two and eight. Participants and study staff were masked to treatment group. Participants provided nasal wash specimens at enrolment and 2, 4, and 7 days later, and were visited daily to record symptoms. All specimens were tested for influenza with reverse-transcriptase PCR, and if the result was positive, we isolated the virus. The primary endpoints were duration of clinical illness and viral shedding in patients treated less than and more than 48 h since illness onset and the frequency of oseltamivir resistance during treatment. Analyses were intention to treat unless otherwise specified. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00707941.

Findings

Overall, 1190 people with a median age of 5 years (IQR 2–9) were enrolled: 794 (67%) less than 48 h since symptom onset and 396 (33%) 48 h or longer since symptom onset. 592 participants were assigned to placebo and 598 to oseltamivir. The median duration of symptoms was shorter in the oseltamivir group (3 days, IQR 1–5) than in the placebo group (4 days, 1–6; p = 0.01). When stratified by timing of treatment initiation, in participants enrolled 48 h or longer since illness onset, the median duration of symptoms was similar in both groups (oseltamivir 3 days [IQR 2–5], placebo 3 days [1–5]; p = 0.04). The median duration of symptoms was reduced by 1 day in the group given oseltamivir who were enrolled less than 48 h since symptom onset compared with those given placebo, but this difference was not significant. In those with all swab specimens (n = 1134), oseltamivir significantly reduced virus isolation on days 2 (placebo 374 [66%] vs oseltamivir 321 [56%]; difference 15.2%, 95% CI 9.5–20.8, p = 0.0004), 4 (241 [43%] vs 174 [30%]; difference 30.2%, 95% CI 24.6–35.8, p < 0.0001), and 7 (68 [12%] vs 36 [6%]; difference 47.5%, 95% CI 44.2–50.8, p = 0.0009). In participants enrolled 48 h or longer since illness onset, oseltamivir treatment significantly reduced virus isolation on days 2 and 4, but not day 7. In participants enrolled less than 48 h since illness onset, oseltamivir treatment significantly reduced virus isolation on days 2, 4, and 7. The emergency of resistance to oseltamivir during treatment was rare overall (< 1%) and in influenza A H1N1pdm09 viruses (3.9%).

Interpretation

Oseltamivir treatment resulted in a modest reduction in the duration of symptoms and virus shedding in people with uncomplicated influenza infections, even when treatment was started 48 h or longer after illness onset.

### Effect of early oseltamivir treatment on mortality in critically ill patients with different types of influenza: a multiseason cohort study [^113xsrx4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The available evidence on whether neuraminidase inhibitors reduce mortality in patients with influenza is inconclusive and focuses solely on influenza A/H1N1pdm09. We assessed whether early oseltamivir treatment (≤ 48 hours from symptom onset) decreases mortality compared to late treatment in a large cohort of critically ill patients with influenza of all types.

Methods

The study included all adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) in Greece over 8 seasons (2010–2011 to 2017–2018) and treated with oseltamivir. The association of early oseltamivir with mortality was assessed with log-binomial models and a competing risks analysis estimating cause-specific and subdistribution hazards for death and discharge. Effect estimates were stratified by influenza type and adjusted for multiple covariates.

Results

A total of 1330 patients were studied, of whom 622 (46.8%) died in the ICU. Among patients with influenza A/H3N2, early treatment was associated with significantly lower mortality (relative risk, 0.69 [95% credible interval {CrI}, .49-.94]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.58 [95% CrI, .37-.88]). This effect was purely due to an increased cause-specific hazard for discharge, whereas the cause-specific hazard for death was not increased. Among survivors, the median length of ICU stay was shorter with early treatment by 1.8 days (95% CrI, .5–3.5 days). No effect on mortality was observed for A/H1N1 and influenza B patients.

Conclusions

Severely ill patients with suspected influenza should be promptly treated with oseltamivir, particularly when A/H3N2 is circulating. The efficacy of oseltamivir should not be assumed to be equal against all types of influenza.

Long-term care facility influenza outbreaks — duration of antiviral chemoprophylaxis is specified and supported by epidemiologic data: Clinicians should administer antiviral chemoprophylaxis for 14 days and continue for at least 7 days after the onset of symptoms in the last case identified during an institutional influenza outbreak (A-III). Supporting data include a randomized trial from 1991–1995 in which amantadine or rimantadine for 14 days (and for 7 days after the last confirmed influenza case) controlled outbreaks compared to 21 days, other reports using oseltamivir or zanamivir for 7–14 days, typical incubation 1–3 days (up to 4 days) with a mean serial interval of approximately 2–3 days, viral RNA detection for approximately 4–7 days after symptom onset with immunosuppressed, hospitalized and critically ill patients able to have prolonged shedding, household data showing transmission substantially reduced > 3 days after symptom onset but more than one-third with viral RNA detected at 7 days, and CDC guidance to administer chemoprophylaxis initially for 14 days and continue until 7 days after the last case has been identified if new cases continue to occur.

Seasonal influenza — evidence summary and agent selection notes state that clinicians should maintain familiarity with local patterns of influenza activity and use CDC resources; based on 2009–2017 surveillance, the use of an NAI — oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous (IV) peramivir — is recommended for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in pediatric and adult patients, and therapy should be started as soon as possible and generally should not be delayed while awaiting test results; adamantane influenza antiviral agents are not recommended for treatment of influenza A due to documented high levels of resistance; trials comparing agents found no superiority of investigational IV zanamivir over oral oseltamivir in hospitalized patients, and in outpatients oral oseltamivir reduced viral shedding at day 2 and the median time to resolution of illness symptoms compared with inhaled zanamivir, while combination oseltamivir–zanamivir showed virologic but not clinical benefit vs inhaled zanamivir; triple therapy with oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin reduced viral shedding at treatment day 3 but did not reduce multiple clinical endpoints compared with oseltamivir monotherapy.

### Influenza virus-related critical illness: prevention, diagnosis, treatment [^115hgxJb]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

No completed randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antiviral treatment have been conducted in hospitalized influenza patients to establish the efficacy of oseltamivir or other NAIs. A number of observational studies have reported clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitors in hospitalized patients, including reduction in duration of hospitalization and risk of death, including in ICU patients. Additionally, a systematic review of published reviews/meta-analyses reported survival benefit of NAI treatment in hospitalized patients, although another meta-analysis of observational studies did not. In particular, a large pooled individual patient-level meta-analysis of observational studies from 38 countries identified a 38% reduction in risk of mortality in critically ill adults and those aged ≥ 16 years old when comparing early NAI treatment (< 48 h) with later treatment (> 48 h), and a 69% reduction in mortality risk between influenza patients receiving early NAI treatment and those who did not receive NAIs. The mortality risk reduction of NAI treatment at any time versus no treatment was 28% for critically ill patients aged ≥ 16 years old; while a similar reduction in mortality was identified in critically ill children aged < 16 years, the result was not statistically significant and was likely underpowered because death is less common in hospitalized children with influenza than in adults.

Although studies have shown the greatest clinical benefit when antivirals are started within 2 days of illness onset, some observational studies have shown clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitors when started up to 5 days following symptom onset. The large meta-analysis mentioned above also identified a significantly reduced mortality risk reduction (35%) in critically ill patients aged ≥ 16 years old who received NAI treatment > 48 h after symptom onset compared with those who did not. A cohort study of early versus late oseltamivir treatment reported a significant reduction in mortality and median duration of ICU hospitalization in severely ill patients with influenza A(H3N2), but not A(H1N1pdm09) or B virus infection in Greece. One French study reported delays in initiation of oseltamivir treatment prescribed to hospitalized influenza patients and suggested empiric administration of oseltamivir treatment in the emergency department for patients being admitted with lower respiratory tract disease during influenza season. Overall, based upon available observational data to date in hospitalized patients with influenza, including ICU patients, initiation of neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis of Influenza

Initiate post-exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules during a community outbreak.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended dosage of oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, oseltamivir phosphate capsules may be continued for up to 12 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. The duration of protection lasts for as long as oseltamivir phosphate capsules dosing is continued.

Pediatric Patients (1 year to 12 years of age) Table 1 displays the recommended oral dosage of oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age based on body weight and provides information about prescribing the capsule or the formulation for oral suspension. Prophylaxis in pediatric patients is recommended for 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Table 1 Oseltamivir Phosphate Dosage Recommendations in Pediatric Patients for Treatment and Prophylaxis of Influenza

* The recommended duration for post-exposure prophylaxis is 10 days and the recommended duration for community outbreak (seasonal/pre-exposure) prophylaxis is up to 6 weeks (or up to 12 weeks in immunocompromised patients). The amount supplied (e.g., number of bottles or capsules) for seasonal prophylaxis may be greater than for post-exposure prophylaxis.

† Use an oral dosing dispensing device that measures the appropriate volume in mL with the oral suspension.

‡ Oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is the preferred formulation for patients who cannot swallow capsules.

§ For patients less than 1 year of age, provide an appropriate dosing device that can accurately measure and administer small volumes.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, September 30, 2012-February 9, 2013 [^112kMUKB]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Vaccination remains the first and best way to prevent influenza and its complications. Health-care providers should continue to offer vaccine to all unvaccinated persons aged ≥ 6 months throughout the influenza season. Interim vaccine effectiveness estimates suggest that effectiveness against influenza A (H3N2) viruses is lower and not statistically significant in adults aged ≥ 65 years during the 2012–13 influenza season. Adults aged ≥ 65 years are at the greatest risk for hospitalization and death from influenza-associated complications; therefore, it is important for them to receive their annual influenza vaccine, take everyday preventive actions, and seek medical care quickly if they develop ILI symptoms to see if treatment with antiviral medications is needed. Antiviral medications remain an important adjunct to vaccination for reducing the health impact of influenza. Recommended antiviral medications are oseltamivir and zanamivir. Early and aggressive treatment with antiviral medication is crucial, ideally within the first 48 hours of illness onset, and persons with suspected influenza infection who are at high risk, including adults aged ≥ 65 years, should be treated with antiviral medications without the need to wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza. However, as indicated by observational studies, antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients when started after 48 hours of illness onset. Recent data on influenza antiviral resistance indicate that > 99% of currently circulating influenza virus strains are sensitive to these medications.
