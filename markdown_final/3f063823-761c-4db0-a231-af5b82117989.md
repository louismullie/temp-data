## Question

Complicated uti treatment in women

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) in women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and classify cUTI versus uncomplicated UTI. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to obtain cultures and imaging. Next, I will consider empiric antibiotic selection and stewardship, followed by duration of therapy and IV-to-oral transition. After that, I need to check special populations and source control considerations. Finally, I will review follow-up, prevention, and quality metrics to ensure the plan is complete and aligned with guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't mislabel the syndrome. Complicated UTI is best conceptualized as infection extending beyond the bladder or occurring in patients with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities, indwelling devices, immunocompromise, or systemic illness, whereas uncomplicated UTI is localized cystitis without these features; importantly, the new IDSA schema classifies infection beyond the bladder (pyelonephritis, febrile/bacteremic UTI, catheter-associated UTI) as complicated, which guides both diagnostics and therapy [^1124T5qR].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic steps before jumping to antibiotics. I should obtain urine culture and susceptibility testing prior to antibiotics when feasible, because cUTI carries higher resistance risk and de-escalation is critical; if the patient is septic or severely ill, I can start empiric therapy immediately but must narrow promptly once results return [^112bPvv4]. I need to ensure I'm not over-ordering imaging; in nonresponders, frequent relapses, or those with known risk factors, CT urography or MR urography is appropriate, whereas routine imaging is not indicated for recurrent uncomplicated UTIs.

> Hold on, I should verify empiric antibiotic selection using a structured approach. IDSA proposes a four-step process: assess severity, consider risk factors for resistant uropathogens, evaluate patient-specific adverse event risks, and consult the local antibiogram; for cUTI without sepsis, reasonable empiric options include third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, while reserving carbapenems for sepsis or high risk of ESBL; I should avoid agents to which the patient recently had a resistant isolate and avoid fluoroquinolones if there was recent exposure to that class, given resistance selection risk [^116uTTsD] [^112xZtgT] [^116FkURv] [^116v63pm] [^111s2fcA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "all cUTI requires 10–14 days", but I should double-check duration guidance. For patients improving clinically on effective therapy, IDSA suggests shorter courses: 5–7 days with a fluoroquinolone or 7 days with a non-fluoroquinolone, rather than 10–14 days; even bacteremic cUTI can often be treated for 7 days if the patient is improving, with duration counted from the first day of effective therapy; exceptions include suspected prostatitis in men, severe immunocompromise, or ongoing source issues, where longer therapy may be warranted [^117Smpys] [^116fXk2s] [^116wywDX].

> I need to ensure timely IV-to-oral transition to minimize complications and cost. Once the patient is clinically improving, able to take oral agents, and an effective oral option exists, I should switch from IV to oral therapy to complete the course. This approach maintains efficacy while reducing line-related risks and resource use, though some high-risk subgroups may need individualized plans [^112BXcnZ].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In pregnancy, I should treat even asymptomatic bacteriuria and use beta-lactams guided by culture, avoiding fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim in the first trimester. In older women, I should be cautious with fluoroquinolones due to adverse effects and consider renal dosing, while recognizing that age alone is not a marker of complication. In diabetes, tissue-penetrating agents and adequate duration are important given higher risks of complications. In catheter-associated infections, device management is central and treatment follows cUTI principles with attention to biofilm biology [^113X7c1U] [^112bWJbi] [^117WUogp] [^114XQfpU] [^1143DosV].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite appropriate therapy? I should confirm source control: evaluate for obstruction, stones, abscess, or an infected device, and obtain appropriate imaging such as renal ultrasound or CT if obstruction or abscess is suspected; persistent fever or bacteremia beyond 48–72 hours should prompt reassessment of the nidus and potential drainage or device intervention [^116buK5r] [^111Gwyks].

> Next, I should review follow-up and stewardship checkpoints. I will reassess clinically at 48–72 hours; if not improving, I should repeat culture and imaging and reconsider the diagnosis or source control. I should obtain a test-of-cure urine culture about 1–2 weeks after therapy in complicated cases, especially with structural abnormalities or immunocompromise, to ensure eradication and detect relapse early [^1143JJsA] [^114mzFy2].

> I will now examine prevention strategies to reduce recurrence without fueling resistance. For women with recurrent UTIs, I should prioritize nonantibiotic measures and reserve prophylaxis for carefully selected patients after shared decision-making. Options include continuous or postcoital prophylaxis with nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX, and patient-initiated therapy for compliant patients with documented recurrences. I must avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria except in pregnancy, as it increases resistance without benefit [^1166XZJb] [^112kKQCz] [^115cGfid].

> Hold on, I should verify that my approach aligns with quality indicators and evolving diagnostics. Guideline-concordant empiric choices, culture-directed de-escalation, appropriate durations, and avoidance of unnecessary imaging or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria are key quality markers; while molecular diagnostics are promising, they remain investigational for routine care and should not replace clinical judgment or standard culture in cUTI management at this time [^114mzFy2] [^116Lq8ka].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure coherence: define cUTI accurately, obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible, select empiric therapy using severity and resistance risk with a stewardship mindset, shorten duration if improving, transition early to oral, address source control if failing, tailor for special populations, and embed follow-up and prevention into the plan. This aligns with IDSA, EAU, and radiology guidance and balances efficacy with resistance mitigation [^113XstJL] [^111Gwyks].

---

For complicated UTIs in women, **obtain urine culture and susceptibility testing** before starting antibiotics when feasible [^117H4oaD], and initiate empiric therapy based on local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors [^116uTTsD]. Use **fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams** for 7–14 days [^notfound], adjusting to culture results and clinical response; avoid fluoroquinolones if there has been recent exposure [^111s2fcA]. For severe infection or sepsis, start IV therapy and transition to oral when stable [^112BXcnZ]. Evaluate for underlying abnormalities with imaging (ultrasound or CT) if the patient does not improve within 48–72 hours or has recurrent infections [^111Gwyks]. Monitor for complications such as abscess or obstruction, and arrange close follow-up to ensure resolution [^116buK5r].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Urine culture and susceptibility testing**: Obtain before antibiotics when feasible to guide therapy and support de-escalation [^112bPvv4].

- **Empiric therapy**: Start promptly if the patient is septic or severely ill, then tailor to culture results [^116FkURv].

- **Imaging**: Use renal ultrasound or CT if no improvement within 48–72 hours or with recurrent infections to detect obstruction, abscess, or structural abnormalities [^113vT7KH].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns**, patient allergies, and comorbidities [^116uTTsD]:

| **Antibiotic class** | **Recommended agents** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Fluoroquinolones | - Ciprofloxacin <br/> - Levofloxacin | 7–14 days [^notfound] |
| Beta-lactams | - Ceftriaxone <br/> - Piperacillin-tazobactam <br/> - Carbapenems (for severe/resistant cases) | 7–14 days [^notfound] |
| Aminoglycosides | - Gentamicin <br/> - Amikacin | 7–14 days (often combined with beta-lactams) |

---

Avoid **fluoroquinolones** if there has been recent exposure within 12 months because of resistance risk [^111s2fcA].

---

## Definitive antibiotic therapy

Adjust to **culture and susceptibility results**, prioritizing the narrowest effective agent [^112bPvv4]. Typical durations are 7–14 days, with shorter courses (5–7 days) considered if the patient improves rapidly and the pathogen is susceptible [^117Smpys]. For bacteremia, treat for 7–14 days, ensuring at least 7 days of effective therapy [^116fXk2s].

---

## Management of special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; use beta-lactams (e.g. ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanate) for 7–10 days.

- **Diabetes**: Use agents with good tissue penetration (e.g. fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams) for 10–14 days.

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Use broad-spectrum agents (e.g. carbapenems) for 10–14 days, with close monitoring.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track clinical improvement within 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, reassess and obtain imaging [^111Gwyks]. Repeat **urine culture** after therapy in recurrent or persistent infections. Arrange follow-up within 1–2 weeks to confirm resolution and address underlying factors.

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on modifiable risks: **address urinary tract abnormalities** surgically or medically, and use antibiotic prophylaxis for frequent recurrences [^1166XZJb]. Additional measures include behavioral modifications — such as hydration, bladder training, and hygiene — and non-antibiotic options like probiotics or cranberry products [^113vT7KH].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **pyelonephritis** with risk of renal scarring or impairment, and urosepsis requiring aggressive management and source control [^115dApDE]. Obstruction from stones, strictures, or tumors may necessitate intervention, and abscess formation may require drainage or surgery [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Obtain urine culture**: Before antibiotics when feasible [^117H4oaD].

- **Start empiric therapy**: Based on local resistance and patient factors [^116uTTsD].

- **Adjust therapy**: To culture results and clinical response [^112bPvv4].

- **Use appropriate duration**: Typically 7–14 days, shorter if improving rapidly [^117Smpys].

- **Image**: If no improvement within 48–72 hours or recurrent infections [^111Gwyks].

- **Monitor**: For complications and ensure close follow-up.

---

Effective management of complicated UTIs in women requires **culture-guided therapy**, appropriate imaging, and vigilant follow-up to prevent recurrence and complications.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^113X7c1U]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common complications of pregnancy; upper tract infections in particular may lead to significant morbidity for both the mother and fetus. Bacteriuria is a significant risk factor for developing pyelonephritis in pregnant women. Therefore, proper screening and treatment of bacteriuria during pregnancy is necessary to prevent complications. All women should be screened for bacteriuria in the first trimester, and women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections or anomalies should have repeat bacteriuria screening throughout pregnancy. Treatment of bacteriuria should include 3-day therapy with appropriate antimicrobials, and women should be followed closely after treatment because recurrence may occur in up to one third of patients.

Results

A total of 16 QIs reached consensus after the first round of ratings. The remaining 11 indicators were discussed and reassessed at the following online meeting. Two QIs (QI9 and QI16, tables 1 and 2) were rephrased at the meeting and one additional indicator (QI17) was proposed by the panel of experts.

Table 1

Table 2
Medians for nine quality indicators (QI) and accompanying standards focusing on the treatment decision for urinary tract infections (UTI)

Following consensus of appropriateness, the final set comprised 24 QIs for the management of patients with suspected UTI in general practice.

Consensus of appropriateness was attained for all of the 11 proposed QIs focusing on the diagnostic process (table 1). For example, the experts agreed on the relevance of measuring the performance of urine culture and susceptibility testing for patients diagnosed with complicated lower UTI (QI4). The importance of assessing the use of urine culture and susceptibility testing was likewise agreed on when referring to patients with pyelonephritis and specific patient groups (pregnant women or catheter users) who might have a UTI (QI6, QI10 and QI11). The panel of experts also agreed on the relevance of measuring the appearance of UTI symptoms and high probability of bacteriuria (a positive urinary dipstick and/or a positive microscopy) when patients were diagnosed with UTI (QI2).

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: what do we know and where do we go from here? [^116rgAo8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past 25 years, researchers have performed > 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating short courses to be non-inferior to long courses of antibiotics for common bacterial infections.

Objective

We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in 7 common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.

Sources

Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

Content

Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer antibiotic courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, 6 weeks of antibiotics is adequate for the treatment of osteomyelitis in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. Whether durations can be further shortened with debridement is unclear, although small studies are promising.

Implications

With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population, ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials and developing meaningful outcomes relevant for frontline clinicians.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

### Which treatment strategy for women with symptoms of urinary tract infection? [^114NRmJS]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in women. Most women experience at least one episode during their lives, and each year about 10% receive one or more courses of antibiotics for UTI. Most women with typical symptoms are treated empirically, though up to half of them do not have clinically significant bacteriuria, and evidence indicates that many women with symptoms of UTI will recover without antibiotic treatment.

Studies that compared antibiotics with placebo in women with uncomplicated UTI report a delayed cure in the placebo group, but most become symptom free within a week. Prescribing antibiotics to patients with self limiting conditions contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The World Health Organization considers antimicrobial resistance to be one of the three most important public health problems globally, and initiatives to reduce inappropriate and superfluous prescribing are essential if we are to maintain effective antibiotic treatment for future generations.

In a linked paper, Gágyor and colleagues (doi:) report a pragmatic double blind trial to investigate whether initial treatment with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen can help to reduce antibiotic prescribing in women in primary care with symptoms suggestive of uncomplicated UTI. Nearly two thirds of women treated with ibuprofen did not receive antibiotics during the four week follow-up. They did, however, have a significantly higher burden of symptoms than women randomised to antibiotics (fosfomycin). Women given ibuprofen had their symptoms for a day longer, and about 60% (n = 143) still had still symptoms after four days compared with about half of those given fosfomycin initially. After one week, only 70% (n = 163) of women in the NSAID group were symptom free compared with 82% (n = 186) of women in the antibiotic group.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — recent antibiotic class exposure: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding fluoroquinolones if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^113ZsabT]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a pervasive, costly, and dangerous cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they become recurrent or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTI is a particular concern among postmenopausal females because of increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome. Prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans, but finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many of the common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs in women over 65. Current prevention strategies include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents a few unique challenges, including frequent allergy or intolerance of side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, which all are accompanied by certain advantages and disadvantages. Appropriate management plans can help to reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. In addition, we hope future studies continue to investigate the proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112bPvv4]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^117TcBoR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: 7 May 2008.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days and prevention studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.

Recommendation 10a — antibiotic duration for acute cystitis episodes in recurrent UTI: Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence includes a review of 15 trials (N = 1,644) where single-dose antibiotics increased short-term (< 2 weeks) bacteriological persistence versus short-course (3 to 6 days; RR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.84; I² = 36%) or long-course (7 to 14 days; RR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.01 to 3.70; I² = 31%) therapy, and another review of 32 trials (N = 9,605) showing three-day courses, irrespective of class, increased long-term (4 to 10 weeks) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.60; I² = 30%) versus more prolonged (5 to 10 day) therapy, with no differences in short-term (2 to 15 days) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.44; I² = 0%).

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^11389yui]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

### Antimicrobial agents for treating uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114PmJ6k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy, resistance development and safety of different antimicrobial treatments for acute uncomplicated lower UTI.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different classes of antimicrobials for acute uncomplicated UTI in women were included. The outcomes of interest were symptomatic and bacteriological cure at short and long-term follow-up, resistance development, number of days to symptom resolution, days of work loss, adverse events and complications.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed study quality. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was as effective as fluoroquinolones in achieving short-term (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03) and long-term (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.05) symptomatic cure. Beta-lactam drugs were as effective as TMP-SMX for short-term (RR 0.95' 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12) and long-term (RR 1.06' 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21) symptomatic cure. Short-term cure for nitrofurantoin was similar to that of TMP-SMX (RR 0.99' 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04) as was long-term symptomatic cure (RR 1.01' 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09). Fluoroquinolones were more effective than beta-lactams (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.31) for short-term bacteriological cure. Rashes were more frequent in patients treated with TMP-SMX than with nitrofurantoin or fluoroquinolones and in patients treated with beta-lactam drugs compared to fluoroquinolones. Minimal data were available on the emergence of resistant strains during or after antimicrobial treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

No differences were observed between the classes of antimicrobials included in this review for the symptomatic cure of acute uncomplicated UTI. Fluoroquinolones proved more effective than beta-lactams for the short-term bacteriological outcome, probably with little clinical significance. Individualised treatment should take into consideration the predictable susceptibility of urinary pathogens in local areas, possible adverse events and resistance development, and patient preference.

### Fluoroquinolone use for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a retrospective cohort study [^116gyawF]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The United States Food & Drug Administration released an advisory in 2016 that fluoroquinolones be relegated to second-line agents for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) given reports of rare but serious side effects; similar warnings have followed from Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency. The objective was to determine whether alternative non-fluoroquinolone agents are as effective as fluoroquinolones in the treatment of UTIs.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study using administrative health data from six Canadian provinces. We identified women (n = 1 585 997) receiving antibiotic treatment for episodes of uncomplicated UTIs (n = 2 857 243) between January 1 2005 and December 31 2015. Clinical outcomes within 30 days from the initial antibiotic dispensation were compared among patients treated with a fluoroquinolone versus non-fluoroquinolone agents. High-dimensional propensity score adjustments were used to ensure comparable treatment groups and to minimize residual confounding.

Results

Fluoroquinolone use for UTI declined over the study period in five of six Canadian provinces and accounted for 22.3–48.5% of treatments overall. The pooled effect across the provinces indicated that fluoroquinolones were associated with fewer return outpatient visits (OR 0.89, 95%CI 0.87–0.92), emergency department visits (OR 0.74, 95%CI 0.61–0.89), hospitalizations (OR 0.83, 95%CI 0.77–0.88), and repeat antibiotic dispensations (OR 0.77, 95%CI 0.75–0.80) within 30 days.

Conclusions

Fluoroquinolones are associated with improved clinical outcomes among women with uncomplicated UTIs. This benefit must be weighed against the risk of fluoroquinolone resistance and rare but serious fluoroquinolone side effects when selecting first-line treatment for these patients.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treating symptomatic uncomplicated urinary tract infections in non-pregnant adult women [^1152Doak]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Almost half of all women will have at least one symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime. Although usually self-remitting, 74% of women contacting a health professional are prescribed an antibiotic, and in rare instances, they may progress to more severe infections. Therefore, the standard of care for the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs is oral antibiotic therapy, which aims to achieve symptom resolution and prevent the development of complications such as pyelonephritis. Given that a number of UTIs are self-remitting, non-antibiotic treatments that may help reduce the severity or duration of symptoms or reduce the need for antibiotics may be of benefit.

Objectives

This review aims to investigate the benefits and risks associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non-pregnant adult women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 18 November 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at the effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non-pregnant adult women. The outcomes of interest were: 1) short-term resolution of symptoms (days 1 to 4); 2) medium-term resolution of symptoms (days 5 to 10); and 3) incidence of adverse events (including progression to sepsis or complicated UTI, hospitalisation or need for intravenous antibiotics, gastrointestinal complications, or death) up to 30 days from randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, abstract selection, and data extraction were carried out independently by two authors, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Six studies (1646 randomised women) published between 2010 and 2019 met our inclusion criteria. The mean age ranged from 28 to 50 years; previous UTIs were reported in 7.2% to 77% of participants. There were five multicentre studies, and studies were carried out in Denmark, Germany, Korea, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Overall, the risk of bias was low or unclear. Compared to antibiotics, NSAIDs probably result in less short-term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1144 participants: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91; I² = 75%; moderate certainty) and may also result in less medium-term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1140 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; I² = 78%; low certainty). NSAIDs probably make little or no difference to the number of adverse events by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; I² = 64%; moderate certainty). NSAIDs may result in longer duration of symptoms (2 studies, 553 participants: MD 1.00 day, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.39; I² = 0%; low certainty). NSAIDs may result in a lower proportion of women experiencing microbiological resolution by day 10 compared to antibiotics (2 studies, 322 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 0%; low certainty) and probably result in more women using rescue antibiotic treatment by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 3.14, 95% CI 2.23 to 4.42; I² = 49%; moderate certainty). Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may reduce the use of rescue antibiotic treatment (1 study, 183 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; low certainty evidence) but may make little or no difference to adverse events at day 30. Compared to the herbal product Uva-Ursi, NSAIDs may make little or no difference to adverse events by day 30.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of NSAIDs for symptomatic management of uncomplicated UTIs probably results in less short-term resolution of symptoms and greater use of rescue antibiotics by day 30 compared to primary antibiotic treatment. Future studies should consider the various confounders such as degree of symptoms, microbiology, type and resistance patterns of bacteria involved and number of UTI episodes in the months prior to commencement of treatment.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114RLvXD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116wywDX]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; p = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^1143DosV]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^113XstJL]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment not diagnosis — are defined by clinical presentation suggesting infection extending beyond the bladder with fever, other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or hemodynamic instability), flank pain, or costovertebral angle tenderness. Pyelonephritis is encompassed in complicated UTI. UTI with systemic symptoms associated with transurethral, suprapubic, or intermittent catheterization is encompassed in complicated UTI. Patients with complicated UTIs may have an indwelling urinary catheter, neurogenic bladder, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention as an underlying condition, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116FkURv]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with sepsis due to complicated UTI, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Agents with broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may be considered for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of cUTI is not clear or who are suspected to have cUTI due to these pathogens.

Main outcome measures

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least 2 points improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without additional antimicrobial therapy (for relapse of UTI). Secondary outcome measures were bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and rate of UTI relapses. In addition, outcome measures were analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups (men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, patients with bacteremic UTI). Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria (pathogen growth < 10⁴ CFU/mL in women or < 10³ CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture combined with disappearance of leucocyturia).

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114xto5v]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^111Gwyks]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk over > 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months. An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs are those occurring in patients with underlying structural or medical problems. In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Differences in the pattern of antibiotic prescription profile and recurrence rate for possible urinary tract infections in women with and without diabetes [^117WUogp]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetes is an increasingly important endocrine disease. Incidence of infections is increased in diabetic (type 1 and type 2) patients compared with control subjects, and the urinary tract is the most prevalent site of these infections. Furthermore, diabetic patients with a urinary tract infection (UTI) more often develop severe and rare complications, such as emphysematous cystitis and papillary necrosis. Studies addressing differences in UTI recurrence rates between diabetic patients and control subjects show contradictory results for uncomplicated lower and upper UTIs. Currently, there are no controlled clinical trials investigating the optimal antimicrobial treatment strategy in diabetic patients with UTIs. Current recommendations rely on the opinion of experts. It is generally recommended to treat UTIs in diabetic patients with antibiotics with high tissue penetration for 7–14 days. Importantly, we lack data on the clinical practice of how diabetic patients with a UTI are actually treated, to assess recurrence rates.

The aims of this study are to describe the treatments (duration and agents) for uncomplicated UTIs in women with and without diabetes in the Netherlands and to analyze recurrence rates of these UTIs within 30 days after the last treatment.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: randomised controlled trial [^1117s5av]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are common in many clinical settings but especially in general practice, where they account for 25% of antibiotic prescriptions. Prescription of antibiotics when many cases are self limiting contributes to increased resistance rates, posing a serious health threat. Disease burden and treatment costs have to be considered as well. Escherichia coli, the main causative agent, is increasingly resistant to current antibiotics, and the number of new antibiotics being developed is declining. Many current primary care guidelines, however, still recommend antibiotics as a first line treatment, at least when standard measures do not lead to symptom relief. As urinary tract infection is often self limiting, and less antibiotic prescribing lowers levels of antibiotic resistance, efforts should be made to reduce rates of prescription.

Earlier trials assessed placebo compared with antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection as well as delayed prescription of antibiotics. These trials reported a delayed resolution of symptoms and prolonged time to bacterial clearance but no serious complications. From qualitative studies and surveys, we know that many affected women are aware of the potential disadvantages of antibiotics and might agree to avoid or postpone such treatment.

In a pilot study we compared symptomatic (ibuprofen) with antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin) in 79 women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Although this study was inadequately powered for a definitive result, it showed that ibuprofen was not inferior for symptom resolution, with 24/36 women recovering without antibiotic treatment. In the current study we assessed whether the number of antibiotic prescriptions issued for uncomplicated urinary tract infection can be reduced by symptomatic treatment with ibuprofen, reserving antibiotics for women who return with worsening or recurrent symptoms, and without an increase in symptom burden, recurrences, or complications.

### Epidemiology, definition and treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^116WuyBb]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2020). High credibility.

UTIs are amongst the most frequent bacterial infections. However, the clinical phenotypes of UTI are heterogeneous and range from rather benign, uncomplicated infections to complicated UTIs (cUTIs), pyelonephritis and severe urosepsis. Stratification of patients with UTIs is, therefore, important. Several classification systems exist for the description and classification of UTIs, with the common rationale that cUTIs have a higher risk of recurrence or chronification, progression or severe outcome than uncomplicated UTIs. The pathophysiology and treatment of cUTIs and pyelonephritis are driven more by host factors than by pathogen attributes. cUTIs and pyelonephritis are associated with high antimicrobial resistance rates among causative pathogens. However, antimicrobial resistance rates can differ substantially, depending on the population being studied and whether the data being analysed are from surveillance studies, registry data or interventional studies, in which specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are used for patient selection. For example, antibiotic resistance rates are higher in patients with urosepsis than in those with less severe infections. Thus, treatment outcomes differ substantially among studies, ranging from 50% to almost 100% clearance of infection, depending on the patient population analysed, the UTI entities included and the primary outcome of the study. Pyelonephritis and cUTIs have emerged as infection models for the study of novel antibiotics, including extensive investigation of novel substances active against Gram-negative bacteria.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns and guideline concordance for uncomplicated urinary tract infections among adult women in the US military health system [^113wUHSC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most commonly diagnosed outpatient infection. In the US, more than 7 million people are referred to physicians for UTIs each year, and UTIs account for approximately 15% of all antibiotic prescriptions, with an annual cost to the US health care system of approximately $1.6 billion.

In 2011, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated their international clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in premenopausal women due to the increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance. For the optimal treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, the IDSA recommends nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin trometamol, and pivmecillinam as first-line therapy. Despite clear IDSA guidelines, practice patterns vary widely with numerous studies showing substantial discrepancies between clinical practice guidelines and antibiotic prescribing practices. A recent studyreported that the rate of IDSA antibiotic guideline concordance (hereinafter, guideline concordance) for UTIs ranged from 58.4% to 64.6%, and several studies, have shown that obstetricians and gynecologists are more likely to prescribe a first-line antibiotic compared with other clinicians in other specialties.

Antibiotic treatments for UTIs have been evaluated in a variety of different health care settings, but, to our knowledge, treatment patterns have not yet been studied in the Military Health System (MHS). The MHS provides health care to 9.6 million beneficiaries including active-duty personnel, retirees, and their dependents through the Department of Defense health insurance known as TRICARE. The MHS delivers care in 2 distinct settings: direct care through more than 350 military health facilities and via the US private sector care through civilian fee-for-service facilities. The ability to compare direct care and private sector care is a unique aspect of the MHS. Evaluating antibiotic prescribing patterns for uncomplicated UTIs in this universally insured population may help provide valuable insights on antibiotic treatment patterns in an optimal care environment. In addition, the Department of Defense formally chartered an antibiotic stewardship program in 2017, which has been implemented across the MHS; however, currently there is no specific requirement that hospitals have a specific outpatient or UTI protocol. Thus, the existence of any of these types of antibiotic stewardship programs varies across the MHS.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infections in the post-antibiotic era: a narrative review highlighting diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship [^114hHBBu]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As one of the most common indications for antimicrobial prescription in the community, the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is both complicated by, and a driver of, antimicrobial resistance.

Objectives

To highlight the key clinical decisions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in adult women, focusing on clinical effectiveness and both diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship as we approach the post-antimicrobial era.

Sources

Literature reviewed via directed PubMed searches and manual searching of the reference list for included studies to identify key references to respond to the objectives. A strict time limit was not applied. We prioritised recent publications, randomised trials, and systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) where available. Searches were limited to English language articles. A formal quality assessment was not performed; however, the strengths and limitations of each paper were reviewed by the authors throughout the preparation of this manuscript.

Content

We discuss the management of UTIs in ambulatory adult women, with particular focus on uncomplicated infections. We address the diagnosis of UTIs, including the following: definition and categorisation; bedside assessments and point-of-care tests; and the indications for, and use of, laboratory tests. We then discuss the treatment of UTIs, including the following: indications for treatment, antimicrobial sparing approaches, key considerations when selecting a specific antimicrobial agent, specific treatment scenarios, and duration of treatment. We finally outline emerging areas of interest in this field.

Implications

The steady increase in antimicrobial resistance among common uropathogens has had a substantial affect on the management of UTIs. Regarding both diagnosis and treatment, the clinician must consider both the patient (clinical effectiveness and adverse effects, including collateral damage) and the community more broadly (population-level antimicrobial selection pressure).

### Complicated urinary tract infections [^113ivLkw]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

A complicated urinary tract infection is that which occurs in a patient with an anatomically abnormal urinary tract or significant medical or surgical comorbidities. Whereas this definition may not cover each and every situation, it does serve to encompass the great majority of these patients and guide their care. The definition is necessarily broad, to assure that these potentially complex patients are appropriately managed. Thus, complicated urinary tract infection describes a group of patients that usually need a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy, with all its attendant morbidities, costs, and outcome differences.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### Pyelonephritis (acute) in non-pregnant women [^115dApDE]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis is usually caused by ascent of bacteria, most often Escherichia coli, from the bladder, and is more likely in people with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities. The prognosis is good if pyelonephritis is treated appropriately, but complications include renal abscess, renal impairment, and septic shock.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: oral antibiotic treatments for acute pyelonephritis in women with uncomplicated infection; antibiotic treatments in women admitted to hospital with complicated infection; inpatient versus outpatient management in women with uncomplicated infection; analgesia in uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 5 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, inpatient management, intravenous antibiotics, non-opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral antibiotics, outpatient management, urinary analgesics.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116vZ2qd]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — antibiogram use: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis (including acute pyelonephritis), we make no specific recommendation about using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from cUTI (less than or equal to 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality, and routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

Antibiotic treatment — women with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI): Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence from a Cochrane review of studies published from 1977 to 2003 included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 6,016) and found no differences between fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, or nitrofurantoin versus TMP-SMX in short-term (within two weeks of treatment) or long-term (up to 8 weeks) symptomatic or bacteriological cure, with risk ratio (RR) estimates close to 1.0; results were similar with treatment durations of 3 days or 7 to 10 days and across specific fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin). For harms, fluoroquinolones (2 trials; pooled RR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.43; I² = 0%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.76; I² = 0%) were associated with lower likelihood of rash than TMP-SMX, there was no difference in discontinuation due to adverse events though estimates favored fluoroquinolones (3 trials; RR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.14; I² = 39%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.41; I² = 0%), and there was no difference between β-lactams and TMP-SMX in rates of rash or other harms.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Common questions about recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^113fX5G2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women, including healthy women with normal genitourinary anatomy. Recurrent UTI is typically defined as three or more UTIs within 12 months, or two or more occurrences within six months. The same species that caused previous infections is typically responsible for recurrences. In premenopausal women, sexual intercourse three or more times per week, spermicide use, new or multiple sex partners, and having a UTI before 15 years of age are established risk factors. In postmenopausal women, risk is primarily increased by sequelae of lower estrogen levels. Episodes of recurrent UTI are typically characterized by dysuria and urinary frequency or hesitancy. Findings from the history or physical examination that suggest complicated infection or another disease process warrant additional evaluation. At least one symptomatic episode should be verified by urine culture to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Imaging is rarely warranted. Short courses of antibiotics are as effective as longer courses. Patient-initiated treatment lowers the cost of diagnosis, number of physician visits, and number of symptomatic days compared with physician-initiated treatment. It also reduces antibiotic exposure compared with antibiotic prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis effectively limits UTI recurrence but increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Cranberry products may reduce recurrent UTIs in premenopausal women, but are less effective than antibiotic prophylaxis, and data are conflicting. Optimal dosing is unknown. Postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis may benefit from topical estrogen therapy.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^11619zp2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Education and informed decision-making — supportive care and risk of progression note that the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is enhanced by the unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and that the diagnosis of UTI is highly imprecise. While no evidence exists to support the concept of withholding antimicrobials to patients with rUTIs, substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of UTI. For patients with episodes of acute cystitis without complicating factors, there is minimal risk of progression to tissue invasion or pyelonephritis, and additional characteristics of great concern do not reliably indicate risk or presence of bacteremic bacteriuria or pyelonephritis. In a representative study of older patients with bacteremia who had the same bacterial species cultured from the urine, only 1 of 37 participants aged 75 years and older had symptoms consistent with UTI, such as dysuria. Multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for acute cystitis offers little but mildly faster symptomatic improvement compared to placebo in patients with acute dysuria and significant bacteriuria, and the incidence of pyelonephritis in these patients is low and is not substantially different in individuals receiving antibiotics versus those treated with supportive care of analgesics and hydration; expectant management with analgesics and hydration while awaiting culture results is likely underutilized.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Urinary tract infection in women over the age of 65: is age alone a marker of complication? [^112bWJbi]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We were interested to know if our older female patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) might have differing pathogens or rates of Escherichia coli antibiotic sensitivity and if our physicians managed them in a manner similar or dissimilar to the care provided to younger patients with no complications.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis from patients excluded from a previous retrospective study regarding uncomplicated UTIs.

Results

Twenty-six percent of total patients with UTIs were older than 65 and otherwise medically uncomplicated whereas 21% were older patients who did have complicating factors. E. coli was a pathogen in 81% of uncomplicated elders' and 54% of complicated elders' cultures. E. coli sensitivity rate to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) in both groups was 86%. Physicians were significantly less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP for complicated older patients with complications than for young patients with an uncomplicated UTI (P = 0.017); there was a significant trend of physicians to be less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP with advancing age in a patient and complications across all 3 groups (P = 0.011). Antibiotics rarely needed to be changed after cultures.

Conclusions

The presence of E. coli on culture in patients with a UTI changes based on medical complications, not age. Being medically complex did not result in reduced sensitivity of E. coli to SMX/TMP but was associated with increased rates of the presence of other pathogens. In our setting, treatment employed with SMX/TMP and without the use of culture and sensitivity may be effective for appropriately selected older women. Prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal approach to management.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112BXcnZ]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — acute cystitis with cultures resistant to oral antibiotics: clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion). Many such infections will be caused by organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and generally are susceptible only to carbapenems; before considering that these infections require intravenous antimicrobials, clinicians should consider fosfomycin susceptibility testing because many multidrug-resistant uropathogens, including ESBL-producing bacteria, retain susceptibility to fosfomycin and/or nitrofurantoin, and consultation with an infectious diseases specialist may be appropriate.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^116h1STd]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the last decade, treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) has become more complicated by the rising antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, the most common uropathogens. With a scarcity of new antimicrobial classes in the development pipe-line, it is essential to develop strategies to maintain effectiveness of the available antimicrobials. Therefore, among strategies to control resistance, the determination of an optimal duration of treatment is essential in addition to optimization of diagnostics to target treatment and antibiotic stewardship concerning antibiotic choice and dose. Shortening of antimicrobial therapy will lead to less selection pressure on the gut microbiome with benefits to both the individual patient as well as the ecological environment, including reduction of antibiotic resistance development. Therefore, the focus upon treatment duration of common infections should be that shorter is better. With respect to febrile UTI (fUTI) or acute pyelonephritis, trials upon treatment duration have usually focused on previously healthy young women and have addressed optimal treatment duration by comparing the same drug for different durations of therapy, or compared various treatment durations of different antimicrobial agents. As such, recommendations upon optimal treatment duration of UTIs in men, the elderly, hospitalized patients, and patients with comorbidities or bacteremia, remain unclear.

Recently, a randomized placebo-controlled trial showed that community-acquired acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women of all ages can be safely and efficaciously treated with oral ciprofloxacin for 7 days. Clearly, such findings need to be extended to men and patients with significant comorbidities. In the present investigator-initiated randomized trial of treatment duration, we use fUTI as the clinical syndrome of interest because this is a broadly recognized specific clinical presentation of patients. Consecutive patients with fUTI were included, including men and women with comorbidities, and treated with antibiotics for 7 or 14 days. The aims of the study were to compare clinical and bacteriological cure at both the short and long term.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^114swyqX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that may lead to significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a large number of drugs, and combination of them, available to treat urinary tract infections, most of them tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy have, therefore, been problematic.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine, from the best available evidence from randomised controlled trials, which agent is the most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy in terms of cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (November 2009) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We considered all trials where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 10 studies, recruiting a total of 1125 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons there were no significant differences between the treatments under study with regard to cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic and incidence of prolonged pyrexia. When cefuroxime and cephradine were compared, there were better cure rates (29/49 versus 41/52) and fewer recurrences (20/49 versus 11/52) in the cefuroxime group. There was only one other statistically significant difference when comparing outpatient versus inpatient treatment. Gestational age at birth was greater in women from the outpatient group (38.86 versus 37.21), while birthweight was on average greater in the inpatient group (3120 versus 2659).

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific drug regimen for treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of the different outcomes. Complications were very rare. All included trials had very small sample sizes to reliably detect important differences between treatments. Future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1142cqa9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### The adherence of GPs to guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of lower urinary tract infections in women is poor [^111zzxXJ]. Family Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the adherence of GPs to evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of lower urinary tract infection (UTI) in women.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was performed from March to July 2009 in primary care offices. Physicians consecutively registered the first six UTI attended during an 8-week period. Age, days with symptoms, episode of infection, associated morbidity, signs and symptoms, diagnostic procedures performed, antibiotic prescription, allergies and referral or not were registered. The type of antibiotic course (short or long) and first-choice treatments were also taken into account.

Results

Of 176 physicians invited to participate, 110 (62.5%) included 658 women with lower UTI. Urine dipstick was performed in 550 cases (83.6%) and urine culture was requested in 235 women (35.7%), with criteria for culture in 49.6% and without criteria in 32.8%. Antibiotic treatment was administered in 634 cases (96.4%). Short courses were given to 385 women (60.7%) and 75 of those with complicated UTI were treated with long courses (66.4%). First-choice antibiotics were administered as empiric treatment in only 92 women with uncomplicated UTI (17.7%).

Conclusions

These results highlight the poor adherence of GPs to the current recommendations of clinical practice guidelines with a high number of inappropriate urine cultures requested and a low utilization of first-choice antibiotics.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

Patients with complicated UTIs are a diverse group. These patients have upper UTIs and structural or functional abnormalities that reduce the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. They are at increased risk for morbidity such as bacteremia and sepsis, perinephric abscess, renal deterioration, and emphysematous pyelonephritis. Appropriate urinary tract imaging, antimicrobials, medical and surgical therapies, and follow-up are required to avoid potentially devastating outcomes.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^115GwfrB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that can result in significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a large number of drugs, and combination of them, available to treat urinary tract infections, most of them tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy has, therefore, been problematic.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to try to determine, from the best available evidence from randomized control trials, which agent is most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy in terms of cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 2003) and reference lists of articles were searched.

Selection Criteria

All trials were considered where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eight studies were included, recruiting a total of 905 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons there were no significant differences between studied treatments with regard to cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic and incidence of prolonged pyrexia. Only when cefuroxime and cephradine were compared, were there better cure rates (29/49 versus 41/52) and less recurrences (20/49 versus 11/52) in the cefuroxime group, but the sample size is insufficient to ensure that differences found in the effect of the drugs were real.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific treatment regimen for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of outcomes measured. Complications were very rare. All included trials had very small sample sizes to try to detect important differences between treatments. Future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Treating adult women with suspected UTI… [^115QTByx]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best way to manage urinary tract infections in adult women. Evidence Summary More than 7 million women are diagnosed with urinary tract infections annually, making it one of the most commonly seen conditions in primary care. 1 At least one half of women who suspect that they have UTI actually do. 2 Because of the high pretest probability and the low risk of complications with delayed diagnosis in otherwise healthy women, treating select patients through telephone consultation is a reasonable option that has been validated in prospective studies. 3, 4. However, many patients present to their physicians' offices with UTI symptoms. For these patients, a systematic approach can help ensure proper treatment. A systematic review. 2 confirmed that the following clinical examination findings increase the likelihood of UTI in otherwise healthy women: dysuria, frequency of urination, hematuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness or back pain. Patients had up to an 86 percent probability of UTI depending on the number of variables present. UTIs are typically classified as "complicated" in pregnant women and in those with comorbidities. For these women, urine culture and empiric therapy are recommended to confirm UTI diagnosis and to determine antibiotic sensitivities. 2, 7 Women with complicated UTIs require longer courses of broader-spectrum antibiotics. Women with uncomplicated UTIs can be treated with a three-day course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or with a three-day course of a quinolone antibiotic if resistance to Escherichia coli is greater than 10 to 20 percent.
7.

8 showed that a three-day course of ciprofloxacin is effective in otherwise healthy women with UTI who are younger than 82 years; however, the number of participants who were between 65 and 82 years of age is unknown. 8 Physicians should use their own judgment to decide if otherwise healthy women older than 65 years with uncomplicated infections can be treated for only three days or whether a longer course is indicated. Physicians should follow up with patients after three days by telephone or in person to ensure clinical improvement.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^117BsxsL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^116D2UjH]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114XF3PN]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — patient education and shared decision-making emphasizes framing care beyond empiric antibiotics. It is reasonable to consider an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of rUTI as one of shared decision-making, in which patients are educated about the inaccuracy of diagnostic testing, the benefits and potential risks of antimicrobial use, and alternatives to standard antibiotic treatment, and we suggest documentation of the education provided and informed consent discussion. Many patients and providers do not know that localized cystitis typically is self-limited and rarely progresses to more severe disease, which can help define goals of care around symptom amelioration, prevention of long-term complications, and more appropriate antibiotic use.

### An update on uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^11321799]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women comprise uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. Uncomplicated UTIs, such as acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, are very common infections in otherwise healthy women, with a high tendency to recur. Although severe complications are rare, their high prevalence causes remarkable costs in the healthcare systems.

Recent Findings

As most scientific evidence has been gathered in uncomplicated UTI, this study focuses on recent developments in epidemiology, pathogenesis, cause, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTI and recurrent UTI in women.

Summary

A remarkable increase of antibiotic resistance is also noted in uncomplicated UTI. Therefore, prudent use of antibiotic substances in uncomplicated UTI is increasingly important.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a review [^113vT7KH]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections most often present with symptoms of irritative voiding. In most cases, they are caused by reinfection with a previously isolated organism. Patients with one or more symptoms of uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infection should undergo thorough examination and screening for underlying comorbidities that increase susceptibility. When frequent reinfections, empiric treatment relapse, persistent infections, or risk factors for complicated infections are encountered, patients may benefit from urodynamics, cystoscopy, renal ultrasound, intravenous urogram, or voiding cystourethrogram to evaluate for anatomic, functional, or metabolic abnormalities affecting the urinary tract (e.g., stones, stricture, obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, lesions, detrusor underactivity). These patients may benefit from culture-guided empiric treatment and further evaluation by urology, nephrology, or infectious disease specialists. In patients with a history of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, empiric treatment guided by local antimicrobial resistance may efficiently treat a suspected recurrence. After successful treatment of the acute infection, postcoital prophylaxis, continuous prophylaxis, or self-start empiric treatment may be selected based on frequency of recurrent infections, temporal relation to intercourse, and patient characteristics. Ancillary measures such as probiotics, cranberry products, or local estrogen replacement may also be considered. This article will review the current definition, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, work-up, treatment, treatment side effects, and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women. A suggested algorithm for evaluation and treatment based on current literature is provided.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^1143JJsA]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Single-dose antibiotic therapy fell into disfavor when it was observed that women had a high risk of recurrence within six weeks of the initial treatment. 14, 15 The risk was attributed to the failure of single-dose antibiotics to eradicate gram-negative bacteria from the rectum, the source or reservoir for ascending uropathogens. Unlike single-dose antibiotic therapy, a three-day regimen reduces rectal carriage of gram-negative bacteria and is not associated with a high recurrence rate. Thus, three-day regimens appear to offer the optimal combination of convenience, low cost and an efficacy comparable to that of seven-day or longer regimens but with fewer side effects. On the basis of cost and efficacy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the antibiotic of choice in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in young women.

The use of fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs should be discouraged, except in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or trimethoprim, who have a high frequency of antibiotic resistance because of recent antibiotic treatment or who reside in an area in which significant resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been noted. Three days is the optimal duration of treatment for uncomplicated cystitis. A seven-day course should be considered in pregnant women, diabetic women and women who have had symptoms for more than than one week and thus are at higher risk for pyelonephritis because of the delay in treatment. Each of these regimens has been shown to decrease the morbidity of recurrent UTIs without a concomitant increase in antibiotic resistance. Long-term studies have shown antibiotic prophylaxis to be effective for up to five years with trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin, without the emergence of drug resistance.

3, 19 Unfortunately, antibiotic prophylaxis does not appear to alter the natural history of recurrences because 40 to 60 percent of these women reestablish their pattern or frequency of infections within six months of stopping prophylaxis.
19. Patients with complicated UTIs require at least a 10- to 14-day course of therapy. Follow-up urine cultures should be performed within 10 to 14 days after treatment to ensure that the uropathogen has been eradicated. Recent studies have shown that patients initially placed on parenteral therapy can be switched to oral therapy within 72 hours as long as they are clinically improving and able to tolerate the oral agent, and a regimen is available that covers the identified pathogen.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^11285M1j]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women: diagnosis and management [^111PCAzk]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections, presenting as dysuria or irritative voiding symptoms, are most commonly caused by reinfection with the original bacterial isolate in young, otherwise healthy women with no anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. Frequency of sexual intercourse is the strongest predictor of recurrent urinary tract infections in patients presenting with recurrent dysuria. In those who have comorbid conditions or other predisposing factors, recurrent complicated urinary tract infections represent a risk for ascending infection or urosepsis. Escherichia coli is the most common organism in all patient groups, but Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and other organisms are more common in patients with certain risk factors for complicated urinary tract infections. A positive urine culture with greater than 102 colony-forming units per mL is the standard for diagnosing urinary tract infections in symptomatic patients, although culture is often unnecessary for diagnosing typical symptomatic infection. Women with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections can be treated with continuous or postcoital prophylactic antibiotics; other treatment options include self-started antibiotics, cranberry products, and behavioral modification. Patients at risk of complicated urinary tract infections are best managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, urine culture to guide subsequent therapy, and renal imaging studies if structural abnormalities are suspected.

### Which treatment strategy for women with symptoms of urinary tract infection? [^111osZb9]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

In patients with severe and persistent symptoms, microbiological examination of urine can help the GP to identify the micro-organisms causing the infection. In Nordic countries, many GPs have direct access to point of care testing such as urine phase contrast microscopy, culture, and direct susceptibility testing to identify patients who need antibiotic treatment. In the study by Gágyor and colleagues, only a third of patients with uncomplicated UTI needed antibiotics during the four weeks of follow-up, so a strategy of delayed prescription for patients with light to moderate symptoms might also be a feasible strategy. We need trials of delayed prescriptions for UTI. Delayed prescribing has been shown to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections by 50–70%.(this is same sentence repeated in adifferent way!)

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.
